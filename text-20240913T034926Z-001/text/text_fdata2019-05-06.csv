if someone were to make a movie about neoliberalism there would need to be a starring role for the character of paul volcker as chair of the federal reserve from 1979 to 1987 volcker was the most powerful central banker in the world these were the years when the industrial workers movement was defeated in the united states and the united kingdom and third world debt crises exploded both of these owe something to volcker on october 6 1979 after an unscheduled meeting of the fed s open market committee volcker announced that he would start limiting the growth of the nation s money supply this would be accomplished by limiting the growth of bank reserves which the fed influenced by buying and selling government securities to member banks as money became more scarce banks would raise interest rates limiting the amount of liquidity available in the overall economy though the interest rates were a result of fed policy the money supply target let volcker avoid the politically explosive appearance of directly raising rates himself the experiment known as the volcker shock lasted until 1982 inducing what remains the worst unemployment since the great depression and finally ending the inflation that had troubled the world economy since the late 1960s to catalog all the results of the volcker shock shuttered factories broken unions dizzying financialization is to describe the whirlwind we are still reaping in 2019 at the height or nadir of the volcker shock prime interest rates were over 20 percent and worse if you had bad credit the exorbitant cost of borrowing put tens of thousands of firms out of business and led overall to twenty two months of negative growth in december 1982 unemployment was at 10 8 percent closer to 20 percent if you include workers who wanted jobs but had stopped looking and underemployed workers who could not find steady full time work in absolute terms twelve million americans were unemployed that month plus another thirteen million discouraged and underemployed the nation s industrial belt was the hardest hit ninety percent of job losses occurred in mining construction and manufacturing it was costly for businesses to pay their debts and borrow money to invest while a strong dollar made american exports even less competitive internationally in places like flint michigan and youngstown ohio more than one in five workers were unemployed in akron the commercial blood bank reduced the prices it would pay by 20 percent due to the glut of laid off tire workers lining up to bleed in the area around pittsburgh suicide rates and alcoholism soared while residents competed for spots in homeless shelters the unemployment rates for african americans were worse peaking in early 1983 at 21 2 percent up from around 12 percent already a crisis in 1979 those who praise volcker like to say he broke the back of inflation nancy teeters the lone dissenter on the fed s board of governors had a different metaphor i told them you are pulling the financial fabric of this country so tight that it s going to rip you should understand that once you tear a piece of fabric it s very difficult almost impossible to put it back together again teeters also the first woman on the fed s board told the journalist william greider that none of these guys has ever sewn anything in his life fabric or backbone both images convey violence in any case a price index doesn t have a spine or a seam but the broken bodies and torn garments of the early 1980s belonged to people reagan s economic adviser michael mussa was nearer the truth when he said that to establish its credibility the federal reserve had to demonstrate its willingness to spill blood lots of blood other people s blood the point of all this misery was to halt the rise of inflation which had become a problem during the vietnam war and hit a monthly peak of almost 15 percent in april 1980 the cycle went like this if prices were high today people would expect them to be higher tomorrow businesses would raise their own prices to keep up while workers would demand higher wages to preserve the real value of their income people considering a purchase would tend to buy immediately while their money was still worth something and before the shortages appeared volcker was convinced that altering expectations would take a demonstration of determination that no one could miss contracting the money supply and hiking the interest rate makes it harder to borrow for investment or consumption harder to pay off existing debts and more profitable to save money all of this reduces aggregate demand and leads to a fall in price levels as well as a rise in unemployment the politicization of the economy and the extension of controls does not always or perhaps even often favor the popular classes tweet did volcker consciously see unemployment as the instrument of price stability a rhode island representative asked him if a large increase in unemployment was a necessary result of his policy to which volcker responded i don t know what policies you would have to follow to avoid that result in the short run we can t undertake a policy now that will cure that problem in 1981 call this the necessary by product view defeating inflation is the number one priority and any action to put people back to work would raise inflationary expectations growth and full employment could be pursued once inflation was licked but there was more to it than that even after prices stabilized full employment would not mean what it once had as late as 1986 unemployment was still at 6 6 percent the reagan boom notwithstanding this was the practical embodiment of milton friedman s idea that there was a natural rate of unemployment and attempts to go below it would always cause inflation for this reason the concept is known as the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment the logic here is plain millions of unemployed workers are required for the economy to work as it should central bankers like volcker can decide how much employment is too much because they are insulated from domestic democratic politics the world beyond the united states had even less say in the matter but it suffered more the interest rate shock was the trigger for a worldwide recession it also touched off a debt crisis across latin america where governments found the cost of paying dollar denominated loans soaring at the same time that the global contraction was lowering the prices they received for commodity exports their primary source of foreign currency events like these helped deliver the coup de gr√¢ce to the ambitious third world politics of the 1970s exemplified by the call for the new international economic order which had been sustained by a global commodity boom the tremolo of debt crises across mexico brazil zambia and other countries and the lost decade that followed was the overture for imf structural adjustment subsequently introduced across the global south it is easy to imagine a world in which volcker never became fed chair in some accounts his appointment was an accident jimmy carter s treasury secretary resigned the president responded by moving fed chair g william miller to the treasury suddenly there was a hole at the fed in the words of carter adviser stuart eizenstat volcker was not the first person offered the post what if someone else had accepted what if as his wife would have preferred volcker had turned down the job on the other hand the event lends itself to a powerful narrative of inevitability inflation was a crisis attempts to tame it had failed and so something new had to be tried something drastic volcker was less the demiurge of monetarism than the one selected to execute the plan that so many others wanted his appointment was not an accident one of carter s lead advisers admitted volcker was selected because he was the candidate of wall street this was their price in effect the economist gerald friedman recalls i remember sitting in the lounge at the national bureau of economic research that day when everyone both economists friendly to and opposed to the carter administration understood what happened in replacing federal reserve board chairman g william miller with paul volcker president carter had finally caved to wall street s demands for an aggressive attack on inflation without regard for the social costs global forces also constrained american policy in 1971 when volcker worked in the nixon treasury the united states had delinked the dollar from gold without the money supply anchored by a scarce metal the only thing ensuring the soundness of the dollar and therefore its role as the world s reserve currency was effective anti inflation policy just weeks before announcing his shock volcker had gone to europe the new york times reported murmurs that the europeans all but backed him up against the berlin wall to tell him squarely that although america may take some perverse pleasure from its perpetual inflation its chief trading partners and allies do not in his recent memoir keeping at it volcker suggests there was no alternative did i realize at the time how high interest rates might go before we could claim success no from today s vantage point was there a better path not to my knowledge not then or now he likens himself to odysseus lashed to the mast and unable to respond to the siren call of unemployed workers and failing businessmen what is surprising is that everyone else seems to share this view in their book capitalism in america adrian wooldridge and alan greenspan volcker s successor praise his gold standard like restraint as does anti fed icon ron paul those further to the left tend not to like volcker but they also deny that he had any alternative at least not if he wanted to preserve private control of investment and employment decisions most versions of the marxist story present the crisis of the 1970s as the result of a working class empowered by the postwar full employment regime 1 difficult to fire and able to find new jobs easily if let go workers made demands that threatened the system their wage increases bit into profits lowering the incentive to invest and their militancy slowed productivity growth shrinking the surplus out of which both wages and profits are paid even the oil price increases widely blamed for the decade s inflation were the result of a third world movement emboldened by american defeat in vietnam the volcker shock altered this balance of class forces and restored the conditions of profitable accumulation at home and abroad if conservatives and radicals agree about the necessity of volcker you might expect liberals to dissent but they don t according to paul krugman volcker with bipartisan support began fighting inflation the only reliable way we know by tightening up on monetary policy rick perlstein described carter s appointment of volcker as rather heroic and self sacrificing and claimed the shock itself saved the economy even lane kirkland who became head of the afl cio the year of the volcker shock later told an interviewer that had to do it that way in the face of inflation christina romer the leading voice for stimulus in the obama white house has said like all good revolutions the volcker revolution was the triumph of better ideas over worse ones among leading liberal economists only joseph stiglitz to my knowledge has expressed any real ambivalence we can describe the benefit of what he did which is that he brought down inflation he said and we can describe the costs but we can t know for sure what would have happened if he had tried another approach liberals at the time were sure there was another way they cheered ted kennedy at the 1980 democratic convention when he said let us pledge that we will never misuse unemployment high interest rates and human misery as false weapons against inflation that same year kenneth arrow stated his disagreement with those who suggest we use shock methods or a very severe economic slump to eliminate inflation it could have permanently bad consequences people don t get over a depression easily and paul samuelson argued that to change the present inflation growth path quickly will take severe measures which i m not for my personal judgment is that this is too severe a price for less advantaged people to pay many instead looked for a solution in the political management of wage levels then known as an incomes policy the phrase has a foreign or archaic resonance now but it was ubiquitous in the postwar years the simplest way to think about it is this since the great depression though governments in capitalist societies haven t controlled the commanding heights of the economy they nonetheless have made it their business to manage the performance of the economy as a whole their main tools are monetary policy targeting the price and supply of money and fiscal policy targeting aggregate demand through taxes and government spending but sometimes governments have gone beyond managing aggregates to target something more specific namely wage and price decisions in particular industries enacted successfully this would allow the government to fight inflation without forcing recession and unemployment everyone would keep working at lower or at least frozen wages rather than some people working in fear of unemployment while the laid off sat idle and got nothing the us had compulsory wage and price controls during world war ii and the korean war and informal guidelines during the kennedy and johnson years from 1971 to 1974 nixon imposed the first peacetime wage and price controls even though they did not last the decade it was easy to assume that the future belonged to political wage setting in 1979 64 percent of americans wanted to revive controls he once told an audience of bankers that the only financial innovation that had improved society was the atm tweet the politics of how a permanent incomes policy might have been implemented is of course another question entirely capitalists naturally would be suspicious of political wage setting especially if it required them to share information with the government that was proprietary in the us organized labor under the leadership of george meany was also an opponent of an incomes policy partly out of an ideological commitment to free collective bargaining that is bargaining with specific firms rather than with a central government agency and partly because nixon s controls had bound wages more tightly than prices writing in 1984 the radical economist stephen a marglin had a proposal for overcoming labor opposition growth of real wages did have to be limited but he suggested that the left can at the same time demand something in return for wage restraint namely a gradual extension of worker participation in the private preserve of management prerogatives neither then nor now have american labor leaders had time for such ideas james tobin who supported an incomes policy admitted it was a conveniently evasive term including everything from full fledged wage and price controls to wage price guideposts and open mouth operations without legal sanction with advocates like this it is not surprising that many people complained that an incomes policy was more of a phrase than a policy ultimately what is interesting is not the details of proposed incomes policies or the coalitions that favored or opposed them it s that before the volcker shock ended the argument very few people thought there was a market based solution to the inflation crisis most thought the path out led through more extensive government controls and planning deepening rather than constraining the power of democratic or in the us quasi democratic politics over private economic prerogatives a generation of historians following alan brinkley have argued that american keynesianism was powerful precisely because in promising to manage aggregate demand it forswore any ambition of influencing the structure of production or distribution but keynesians like tobin thought the 1970s demanded a microeconomic strategy focused on industries and firms to supplement the manipulation of aggregates labor s qualms about wage and price controls remind us that the politicization of the economy and the extension of controls does not always or perhaps even often favor the popular classes but the point is that the incomes policy brings to light a surprisingly recent past in which the economy was still politicized shortly thereafter volcker helped usher in an era of central bank supremacy a masterful exorcism of the political in political economy but as springsteen sang on nebraska released in 1982 the trough of the recession maybe everything that dies someday comes back volcker has his attractive qualities even for those unmoved by his crusade against inflation for people shaped by the obama rather than the carter years he is probably best known for the volcker rule which limits the kinds of speculative trading in which commercial banks may engage the regulation ultimately enacted as part of dodd frank bore some resemblance to the new deal glass steagall law which separated commercial and investment banking and which was overturned during the clinton administration at the behest of then newly formed citigroup which otherwise would have been targeted by it even such a modest limit was enough to put volcker at odds with the common sense of the obama team i am sure tim geithner and larry summers would have been content if i disappeared he writes beyond his rule volcker has been a consistent critic of financialization he once told an audience of bankers that the only financial innovation that had improved society was the atm more seriously he believes we have done little to prevent another crisis on the scale of 2008 despite his hostility to certain elements of activist government volcker son of a new jersey town manager has always believed in public service his cheap suits and ten cent cigars advertised his indifference to the elite culture of the 1980s he has an uncommon contempt for think tanks policy institutes and elite law schools and he now calls his country a plutocracy and admits that the concerns of industrial workers have been too easily dismissed with vague promises of job retraining the irony is that volcker played a significant role in bringing about the situation he laments there is no force on earth he writes today that can stand up effectively year after year against the thousands of individuals and hundreds of millions of dollars in the washington swamp aimed at influencing the legislative and electoral process if there was ever such a force it was the labor movement which volcker helped destroy in the economy as a whole volcker said in 1981 labor accounts for the bulk of all costs and those rising costs in turn maintain the momentum of the inflationary process the high interest rate high unemployment environment would moderate new wage demands and push unions to agree to concessions both because workers would fear unemployment and also because they would no longer seek raises to compensate for the inflation they expected but there was a more direct path to breaking the unions volcker says that the most important single action of the administration in helping the anti inflation fight was defeating the professional air traffic controllers organization patco strike in 1981 when reagan fired and permanently replaced eleven thousand government workers and arrested their leaders the show of force had a psychological effect on the strength of the union bargaining position on other issues whatever the issues were he was right in 1979 twenty one million americans belonged to a union in 2003 despite substantial growth in the workforce the number was down to just under sixteen million after the crushing of patco those unions became less restive in the 1970s there were on average about 289 major work stoppages per year between 1983 and 2017 the annual average was thirty volcker also helped to bring about the orgy of financialization that has driven the american economy since the early 1980s as the sociologist greta krippner shows in her invaluable capitalizing on crisis the high interest rates of the 1980s created punishing conditions for productive investment and drew economic activity inexorably toward finance following the removal of capital controls around the world after 1971 and the deregulation of domestic finance that had begun in the late 1960s the result of high us interest rates was to attract an unprecedented flood of foreign money into us financial markets savings from other countries above all japan funded reagan s government deficits as well as the ballooning balance sheets of wall street banks along with a vast expansion in consumer credit while the high cost of borrowing kept real investment low and caused hundreds of thousands of businesses to fail all this liquidity flowed into financial markets in his memoir volcker writes the real danger comes from encouraging or inadvertently tolerating rising inflation and its close cousin of extreme speculation and risk taking in effect standing by while bubbles and excesses threaten financial markets statements like this make clear the connection between the scourge of the unions and the critic of the bankers between the volcker shock and the volcker rule both inflation and bubbles create fictitious money claims in excess of the wealth a society actually possesses leading to spurious gdp gains that must give way whether in an inflationary spiral or financial panic in both cases temporizing economists the enemies of practical bankers like volcker claim that things can be finely measured and controlled through fiscal policy and price indexes hedges and efficient markets and in both cases pride brings a fall from one vantage these sentiments sound like a fussy obsession with sound money and real value but critical scholars have also linked consumer price inflation and asset bubbles according to krippner the result was to transfer inflation from the nonfinancial to the financial economy where it was not visible or conceptualized as such a growing money supply understood to include not just dollars but new credit instruments which banks as well as governments can create still causes prices to rise but instead of causing a general inflation of all prices including the price of labor the new spiral affects only assets from bonds to houses to picassos enriching the rentier class but also creating instability as for example when the notional value of derivatives swells to several times the value of world gdp if this is the case the troubles of the 1970s simply mutated like so many other maladies of capitalism into new forms for most of 1980 jimmy carter remained curiously serene regarding the fact that one of his appointees had induced a recession in an election year he publicly questioned fed policy exactly once calling a recent interest rate hike ill advised in a speech that also went out of its way to call volcker an outstanding chairman the president s criticism of the federal reserve is regrettable said arthur burns a former fed chair under nixon ford and carter william mcchesney martin another former fed chair called it deplorable this concern for the sanctity of central banking has echoes today when volcker s memoir was published last fall newspapers questioned trump s escalating conflict with fed chairman jerome powell whom trump resents for continuing janet yellen s policy of gradual tightening after the long post 2008 era of quantitative easing and other loose monetary policies in the memoir volcker recalls being told by james baker reagan s chief of staff that he was under strict orders not to raise interest rates before the election luckily according to volcker he had not been planning to tighten inspired by the anecdote interviewers asked if he had any advice for powell volcker obliged by saying that his message to chairman powell is be strong and follow your instincts obsession with central bank independence has roots like most things in america in the class war to raise interest rates in response to low unemployment rates even when inflation is low is to make sure that the ratio of surplus going to workers does not change that the vigilant central bank whatever else it may be is an instrument of class rule should not surprise anyone familiar with 19th century politics over currency and inflation the original gold standard historians have concluded became untenable around the time of world war i once universal suffrage was granted across europe the strategy of maintaining price stability through recurrent bouts of deep unemployment became politically impossible volcker wrote in 1978 that the fed s control of the money supply and the resulting high interest rates could provide the same discipline that was once a function of the gold standard the next year he brought back the form of wage discipline that is recession that had been considered politically impossible it makes sense that it wouldn t remain politically impossible forever obsession with central bank independence has roots like most things in america in the class war tweet given the darkening economic outlook trump will likely continue to clash with the fed and we can expect central bankers to take their place alongside fbi agents and laundered neoconservatives in the surreal new liberal pantheon but there have also been signs of new thinking with vox s matthew yglesias writing that there is a decent size body of economists mostly though by no means exclusively on the left who argue that at the end of the day trump is right the fed has been raising rates too quickly not just this year but for decades and in doing so has hurt workers and laid the groundwork for political dysfunction for one thing economists may be mistaken about where the natural rate of unemployment lies or they may neglect the fact that higher wages can increase the labor force thus expanding employment without risking overheating or in a more daring rendition it might be that we could live with a slightly higher rate of inflation as the price of a high pressure economy but what happens if inflation does come back and at a level that everyone agrees is a problem what would we expect a democratic or democratic socialist president to do in 2019 the immediate problem is stimulating demand not stopping inflation but the question will come back one day and perhaps sooner than we think take the jobs guarantee an increasingly prominent demand of the left the idea is simple enough the government would act as an employer of last resort ensuring that anyone who wanted a job can find one the left leaning economist dean baker has warned that this would unleash a serious wage price spiral unless we introduce other measures his logic is that affluent earners will have to pay more for services leading them to seek raises of their own to offset their losses not everyone agrees with him about the effects of the jobs guarantee but it can never be too early to start thinking about those other measures debates about job guarantees green new deals and codetermination make clear a dominant question of our time the renewal of political economy after decades of depoliticization trump made headlines last may by threatening to use emergency powers to keep unprofitable coal plants running an unprecedented intervention into us energy markets per bloomberg it was reminiscent of the late 1940s when harry truman threatened that if the steel companies refused to expand as much as government economists thought was necessary for national prosperity the government would build and run new plants by itself this wasn t mere bluster democrats in congress talked about nationalizing steel and treating it like a public utility while truman s chief economic adviser leon keyserling believed interest rates should be permanently kept close to zero as indeed they were from 1940 to 1951 after the crisis of the depression and the planned economy of world war ii ideas like this were familiar if never quite mainstream the intervening years saw the ebbing of such proposals and the triumph of a vision of the economy as a discrete sphere managed by technical experts above all by central bankers it is now clearer that this state of affairs never completely hegemonic anyway was an exception in the longer history of political economy the best way to discover what was possible in the 1970s would be to test the limits of what is possible today
column abuja on may 1 our country celebrated workers day this occasion presents an opportunity to consider the situation of the common man or woman in our country the role of the labour movement in our political economy and the undoubtedly weak state of the nigerian economy today congratulations to labour and the federal government of nigeria on the introduction of a new minimum wage while the new minimum wage of n30 000 will help tackle poverty we must do more 95 per cent of nigerians still live below 5 5 a day approximately n170 or n49 500 a month while 90 million nearly 50 per cent of our 200 million population leave below the extreme poverty line of 2 a day employers and labour should increase labour productivity together with broad based growth across different sectors of the economy this is what creates inclusive economic growth the emphasis should be on creating a skilled workforce and dramatically increasing available electricity in order to increase the productivity of labour which in turn can support higher wages i call on the labour movement in nigeria to support necessary and fundamental economic reforms in our country reforms that will ultimately improve the living standards and economic opportunities for nigerian workers labour should hold federal and state governments accountable for their performance on economic management based on rational factors how economic populism blocks possible reforms economic reforms in nigeria should be anchored on the following factors achieving the right balance between the role of the state and the private sector an understanding of what drives the wealth or poverty of nations the presence or absence of skilled human capital strong independent institutions property rights a culture of innovation that is the basis of wealth creation as opposed to reliance on natural resources capital and affordable access to it an understanding of the difference between gdp growth total value of goods and services produced annually human development real quality of life as expressed in life expectancy availability and quality of healthcare education potable drinking water etc and structural economic transformation the shift from dependence on subsistence agriculture or raw natural resources to an industrial economy that creates value added exports sadly none of these factors exist adequately in the nigerian economy today one of the most important reasons for the absence of these foundations is economic populism a false appeal to the hopes and fears of the common people set against the interests of the elite economic populism can be exaggerated where political expediency leads as it does in nigeria to a tendency to admire the problem while taking no real action to address it in a fundamental manner in nigeria this doctrine has led to the huge cost of governance astronomical salary costs including ghost workers for civil servants politicians and their aides this phenomenon results in massive recurrent expenditures currently 70 per cent of the federal budget that divert resources that should be invested in human development as well as massive corruption the temptation to populism is a universal one when the industrial revolution began sweeping across the western world three centuries ago a wave of populism resisted the phenomenon out of fear that machines with far greater efficiency and productive capacity would put men assured of manual labour jobs out of employment had the populist streak prevailed poverty would have been the lot of today s wealthy industrialized world fortunately for these societies their leaders could see the longer term benefits of industrialization and parted ways with the old ways petroleum subsidy versus oil industry reform for several decades now for example successive governments in nigeria have maintained a wasteful and corrupt petrol subsidy regime in the name of the poor but these subsidies have favored the rich far more than the poor who do not own petrol guzzling vehicles nigeria has spent an estimated 10 trillion naira over the past decade in petrol subsidies many petroleum importers have gotten wealthy on the basis of fraudulent invoices subsidies may be used to stimulate production and export of value added goods as the asian tigers did decades ago but when applied to consumption they are often a monument to corruption the federal government should therefore bite the bullet remove the petrol subsidy and completely deregulate the downstream petroleum industry it should move quickly and decisively towards the at least partial privatization of the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc no more dissipation of effort in dictating fuel prices that are practically impossible to enforce nationwide the role of the government is an important one that role is to be a strategic enabler for market economies to create inclusive growth but government cannot successfully replace the markets as the allocator of the prices of goods it can intervene strategically and occasionally to moderate any observed excesses of market behaviour nigeria s oil industry ought to be liberalized but not without strategic provisions for the interests of the populations and the environment of the oil producing states that is not because the state cannot run corporations conceptually speaking that is a position of classical neoliberalism it is only partially correct to the extent that deregulation and a level competitive playing field will help achieve price equilibriums and remove corrupt arbitrage and the worst kinds of crony capitalism more accurately the nigerian state should not run businesses because as a matter of factual contemporary experience it can t the track record is there from nigerian airways to nitel and the nigerian national shipping line but state owned or state invested companies have succeeded in some jurisdictions such as china france germany and japan alongside the more dominant private enterprises the main reason the nigerian state cannot run companies well is because we have fundamental problems of nationhood ethos and the organizing principle the federal government of nigeria must develop and articulate a comprehensive plan to move nigeria away from oil dependence over the next seven years the plan should have timelines including a short term three year plan to 2022 with concrete deliverables and accountabilities the plan should be inter sectorial demonstrating how a linked up combination of policy and private sector actions in areas such as trade industrial fiscal and infrastructure policy will deliver a diversified revenue base it should have specific targets for revenues from the non oil sectors the economic recovery and growth plan eprg in its present form does not rise to the level of such a plan saudi arabia a much wealthier oil dependent country has developed a four year national transformation plan to prepare it for a world beyond oil the plan s specific components are known the country has ended petrol subsidies and will build a new 2 trillion sovereign wealth fund that will be the largest in the world it will privatize aramco its national oil company and turn it into an industrial conglomerate making its shares part of the new sovereign fund the whole point of the plan is to make investments by the sovereign fund not crude oil the main revenue earner for the kingdom by 2020 there is little evidence of such an intellectually and programmatically well articulated economic diversification strategy in nigeria today we cannot grow on a diet of good intentions it is not too late for the federal government of nigeria to create a better economic future for us all how forex policy strangles the nigerian economy our foreign exchange policy is essentially subsidizing a massive import economy that prevents the structural transformation of our economy the equilibrium exchange rate price or value of the naira is determined mainly by purchasing power parity the strength or weakness of our productive and export economy the price of oil and the quantum of our fiscal savings the price of crude oil which gives us 90 per cent of our dollar revenues is subject to external factors beyond our control today s oil price of above 70 notwithstanding the oil price will drop again we do not have a hedging policy to manage this risk the exchange rate of our legal tender relative to others will naturally deteriorate when this happens especially if external reserves are spent to stabilize the naira we have no fiscal savings as a buffer having wiped out our excess crude account for populist reasons we should reposition by engineering our economy to benefit from this scenario since importation will become more expensive we ought to shift to a productive economy based on exports not of other raw commodities or crude minerals but of value added products the absence of such multi sectorial policy action is why past devaluations did not help our economy meanwhile we should encourage dollar inflows from investors to address forex supply scarcity without a flexible and transparent exchange rate this will not happen to the extent that is necessary a few years ago the mere announcement effect of an intention to move to a flexible exchange rate by the central bank which ultimately did not happen saw our stock market rise by 1 billion in a couple of days nigeria is an important economy and many around the world are keen on doing business in and with it but not at all cost yet despite not having a strong manufacturing and export base we erroneously believe that an artificially strong currency is better for the purchasing power of the masses so we must maintain the naira s artificial strength in the face of all logic as a matter of the national interest in doing so we are in effect protecting the national interest of the vested interests that have access to and profit mightily from subsidized dollars leadership and the role of labour leadership is the antidote to populism rational evidence based economic policy is essential for economic transformation combined with other attributes such as vision decision making and others the ability to formulate and execute evidence based policy and to communicate effectively to citizens and stakeholder groups why certain reforms are necessary and cannot be delayed is a critical aspect of effective leadership it can make the difference between the progress and wealth of nations across generations on the one hand or stasis and retrogression as is the case in nigeria on the other the lessons from latin america which flirted with populist macroeconomics for several decades to ultimate failure are apt this is where the role of labour comes in labour can work with a competent government to sequence and manage difficult reforms that will yield fruit for workers citizens and the economy at large conclusion populism resilient in our governance culture since the 1970s has made us a poor country it is the reason nigeria failed to develop a strong savings habit the political culture operates with the mindset that all public income must be spent including even what we have not earned it is why nigeria is today heading back towards a debt crisis with an ultimately unsustainable debt burden it is why we did not set up a sovereign wealth fund in the heyday of the oil price and even when we did decades later the project still faced stiff resistance from several politicians it is why the federal government bailed out profligate states that carry on as if the only reason they exist is to pay the salaries of bloated bureaucracies some of the bailout funds reportedly went missing the workers must be paid in the name of populism corruption and other bad habits thrive and poverty reigns populism should no longer hold rational economic policy thinking hostage in nigeria our federal and state governments were elected to deliver progress for citizens not to continue recycling the status quo that from every evidence has failed to deliver prosperity beyond immediate policy actions the constitutional restructuring of nigeria back to true federalism by transforming our geopolitical zones into regions that will be the federating units and geo economic zones remains the long term path to prosperity for the millions of our

term inflationary impact of the removal of petrol subsidies and permanently end such subsides as from the budget for 2020 deregulate the importation and sale of petrol in order to produce a market determined price of petrol and mitigate adverse inflationary effects in the medium term fgn should establish a moratorium on foreign borrowing alongside measures to improve taxation revenue fgn should commence a progressive reduction of recurrent expenditure by 10 per cent every budget year from 2020 the central bank of nigeria should abolish differential exchange rates and establish a uniform exchange rate for all transactions the cbn should abolish the ban on provision of foreign exchange for the importation of most or all of the 40 items denied forex prior to this action the federal ministries of finance and industries trade and investment should establish appropriate tariffs for the imports of luxury and non essential items while creating policy to give reasonable advantages for locally manufactured goods including enhanced export incentives in order to realign the nigerian economy towards competitive manufacturing for domestic and export markets fgn should submit an executive bill for the abolition of the land use act according to a study by pwc this legislation and policy action will liberate hundreds of billions of dollars of dead capital potential but suppressed financial values in land and property related transactions that could lift off the nigerian economy fgn should strengthen the policy environment to encourage mass production of innovation and a pipeline of the products of innovation into commercial markets as from 2020 turn the n500 billion budget for the social investment programs into a one time equity contribution to a public private venture capital fund of n1 trillion for innovation and small scale entrepreneurship aimed at helping the poor and unemployed escape poverty by creating wealth and inclusive economic growth the venture capital fund should be managed by the private sector which will bring in the other n500 billion in capital this reform will bring in equity capital into the lower strata of the nigerian economy complementing efforts by the cbn such as the establishment of national microfinance bank that will lend at single digit rates to improve affordable access to credit it will also contribute to bringing in the informal sector which contributes about 65 per cent of nigeria s gdp into the formal economy and thus expand the tax net it will also create millions of new jobs for unemployed or under employed youth professor kingsley moghalu is the founder and president of the institute for governance and economic transformation a think tank in abuja and washington dc he was a deputy governor of the central bank of nigeria and was a candidate for president in nigeria 2019 general elections
kingsley moghalu on may 1 our country celebrated workers day this occasion presents an opportunity to consider the situation of the common man or woman in our country the role of the labor movement in our political economy and the undoubtedly weak state of the nigerian economy today congratulations to labor and the federal government on the introduction of a new minimum wage while the new minimum wage of n30 000 will help tackle poverty we must do more ninety five per cent of nigerians still live below 5 5 a day approximately n170 or n49 500 a month while 90 million nearly 50 per cent of our 200 million population leave below the extreme poverty line of 2 a day employers and labor should increase labor productivity together with broad based growth across different sectors of the economy this is what creates inclusive economic growth the emphasis should be on creating a skilled workforce and dramatically increasing available electricity in order to increase the productivity of labor which in turn can support higher wages i call on the labor movement in nigeria to support necessary and fundamental economic reforms in our country reforms that will ultimately improve the living standards and economic opportunities for nigerian workers labor should hold federal and state governments accountable for their performance on economic management based on rational factors how economic populism blocks possible reforms economic reforms in nigeria should be anchored on the following factors achieving the right balance between the role of the state and the private sector an understanding of what drives the wealth or poverty of nations the presence or absence of skilled human capital strong independent institutions property rights a culture of innovation that is the basis of wealth creation as opposed to reliance on natural resources capital and affordable access to it an understanding of the difference between gdp growth total value of goods and services produced annually human development real quality of life as expressed in life expectancy availability and quality of healthcare education potable drinking water etc and structural economic transformation the shift from dependence on subsistence agriculture or raw natural resources to an industrial economy that creates value added exports sadly none of these factors exist adequately in the nigerian economy today one of the most important reasons for the absence of these foundations is economic populism a false appeal to the hopes and fears of the common people set against the interests of the elite economic populism can be exaggerated where political expediency leads as it does in nigeria to a tendency to admire the problem while taking no real action to address it in a fundamental manner in nigeria this doctrine has led to the huge cost of governance astronomical salary costs including ghost workers for civil servants politicians and their aides this phenomenon results in massive recurrent expenditures currently 70 per cent of the federal budget that divert resources that should be invested in human development as well as massive corruption the temptation to populism is a universal one when the industrial revolution began sweeping across the western world three centuries ago a wave of populism resisted the phenomenon out of fear that machines with far greater efficiency and productive capacity would put men assured of manual labor jobs out of employment had the populist streak prevailed poverty would have been the lot of today s wealthy industrialized world fortunately for these societies their leaders could see the longer term benefits of industrialization and parted ways with the old ways petroleum subsidy versus oil industry reform for several decades now for example successive governments in nigeria have maintained a wasteful and corrupt petrol subsidy regime in the name of the poor but these subsidies have favored the rich far more than the poor who do not own petrol guzzling vehicles nigeria has spent an estimated 10 trillion naira over the past decade in petrol subsidies many petroleum importers have gotten wealthy on the basis of fraudulent invoices subsidies may be used to stimulate production and export of value added goods as the asian tigers did decades ago but when applied to consumption they are often a monument to corruption the federal government should therefore bite the bullet remove the petrol subsidy and completely deregulate the downstream petroleum industry it should move quickly and decisively towards the at least partial privatization of the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc no more dissipation of effort in dictating fuel prizes that are practically impossible to enforce nationwide the role of the government is an important one that role is to be a strategic enabler for market economies to create inclusive growth but government cannot successfully replace the markets as the allocator of the prices of goods it can intervene strategically and occasionally to moderate any observed excesses of market behavior nigeria s oil industry ought to be liberalized but not without strategic provisions for the interests of the populations and the environment of the oil producing states that is not because the state cannot run corporations conceptually speaking that is a position of classical neoliberalism it is only partially correct to the extent that deregulation and a level competitive playing field will help achieve price equilibriums and remove corrupt arbitrage and the worst kinds of crony capitalism more accurately the nigerian state should not run businesses because as a matter of factual contemporary experience it can t the track record is there from nigerian airways to nitel and the nigerian national shipping line but state owned or state invested companies have succeeded in some jurisdictions such as china france germany and japan alongside the more dominant private enterprises the main reason the nigerian state cannot run companies well is because we have fundamental problems of nationhood ethos and the organising principle the federal government must develop and articulate a comprehensive plan to move nigeria away from oil dependence over the next seven years the plan should have timelines including a short term three year plan to 2022 with concrete deliverables and accountabilities the plan should be inter sectorial demonstrating how a linked up combination of policy and private sector actions in areas such as trade industrial fiscal and infrastructure policy will deliver a diversified revenue base it should have specific targets for revenues from the non oil sectors the economic recovery and growth plan eprg in its present form does not rise to the level of such a plan saudi arabia a much wealthier oil dependent country has developed a four year national transformation plan to prepare it for a world beyond oil the plan s specific components are known the country has ended petrol subsidies and will build a new 2 trillion sovereign wealth fund that will be the largest in the world it will privatize aramco its national oil company and turn it into an industrial conglomerate making its shares part of the new sovereign fund the whole point of the plan is to make investments by the sovereign fund not crude oil the main revenue earner for the kingdom by 2020 there is little evidence of such an intellectually and programmatically well articulated economic diversification strategy in nigeria today we cannot grow on a diet of good intentions it is not too late for the federal government of nigeria to create a better economic future for us all how forex policy strangles the nigerian economy our foreign exchange policy is essentially subsidizing a massive import economy that prevents the structural transformation of our economy the equilibrium exchange rate price or value of the naira is determined mainly by purchasing power parity the strength or weakness of our productive and export economy the price of oil and the quantum of our fiscal savings the price of crude oil which gives us 90 per cent of our dollar revenues is subject to external factors beyond our control today s oil price of above 70 notwithstanding the oil price will drop again we do not have a hedging policy to manage this risk the exchange rate of our legal tender relative to others will naturally deteriorate when this happens especially if external reserves are spent to stabilise the naira we have no fiscal savings as a buffer having wiped out our excess crude account for populist reasons we should reposition by engineering our economy to benefit from this scenario since importation will become more expensive we ought to shift to a productive economy based on exports not of other raw commodities or crude minerals but of value added products the absence of such multi sectorial policy action is why past devaluations did not help our economy meanwhile we should encourage dollar inflows from investors to address forex supply scarcity without a flexible and transparent exchange rate this will not happen to extent that is necessary a few years ago the mere announcement effect of an intention to move to a flexible exchange rate by the central bank which ultimately did not happen saw our stock market rise by 1 billion in a couple of days nigeria is an important economy and many around the world are keen on doing business in and with it but not at all cost yet despite not having a strong manufacturing and export base we erroneously believe that an artificially strong currency is better for the purchasing power of the masses so we must maintain the naira s artificial strength in the face of all logic as a matter of the national interest in doing so we carry are in effect protecting the national interest of the vested interests that have access to and profit mightily from subsidized dollars leadership and the role of labor leadership is the antidote to populism rational evidence based economic policy is essential for economic transformation combined with other attributes such as vision decision making and others the ability to formulate and execute evidence based policy and to communicate effectively to citizens and stakeholder groups why certain reforms are necessary and cannot be delayed is a critical aspect of effective leadership it can make the difference between the progress and wealth of nations across generations on the one hand or stasis and retrogression as is the case in nigeria on the other the lessons from latin america which flirted with populist macroeconomics for several decades to ultimate failure are apt this is where the role of labor comes in labor can work with a competent government to sequence and manage difficult reforms that will yield fruit for workers citizens and the economy at large conclusion populism resilient in our governance culture since the 1970s has made us a poor country it is the reason nigeria failed to develop a strong savings habit the political culture operates with the mindset that all public income must be spent including even what we have not earned it is why nigeria is today heading back towards a debt crisis with an ultimately unsustainable debt burden it is why we did not set up a sovereign wealth fund in the heyday of the oil price and even when we did decades later the project still faced stiff resistance from several politicians it is why the federal government bailed out profligate states that carry on as if the only reason they exist is to pay the salaries of bloated bureaucracies some of the bailout funds reportedly went missing the workers must be paid in the name of populism corruption and other bad habits thrive and poverty reigns populism should no longer hold rational economic policy thinking hostage in nigeria our federal and state governments were elected to deliver progress for citizens not to continue recycling the status quo that from every evidence has failed to deliver prosperity beyond immediate policy actions the constitutional restructuring of nigeria back to true federalism by transforming our geopolitical zones into regions that will be the federating units and geo economic zones remains the long term path to prosperity for the millions of our country s poor recommendations the federal government should develop and establish in consultation with labor unions a set of policies to mitigate the likely short term inflationary impact of the removal of petrol subsidies and permanently end such subsides as from the budget for 2020 deregulate the importation and sale of petrol in order to produce a market determined price of petrol and mitigate adverse inflationary effects in the medium term fgn should establish a moratorium on foreign borrowing alongside measures to improve taxation revenue fgn should commence a progressive reduction of recurrent expenditure by 10 per cent every budget year from 2020 the central bank of nigeria should abolish differential exchange rates and establish a uniform exchange rate for all transactions the cbn should abolish the ban on provision of foreign exchange for the importation of most or all of the 40 items denied forex prior to this action the federal ministries of finance and industries trade and investment should establish appropriate tariffs for the imports of luxury and non essential items while creating policy to give reasonable advantages for locally manufactured goods including enhanced export incentives in order to realign the nigerian economy towards competitive manufacturing for domestic and export markets fgn should submit an executive bill for the abolition of the land use act according to a study by pwc this legislation and policy action will liberate hundreds of billions of dollars of dead capital potential but suppressed financial values in land and property related transactions that could lift off the nigerian economy fgn should strengthen the policy environment to encourage mass production of innovation and a pipeline of the products of innovation into

overview reports that a us china deal could be struck by may 10 before the weekend left investors ill prepared for the presidential tweets yesterday that announced that the us was ending the tariff truce trump indicated that the 10 tariff on 200 bln of chinese goods would be lifted to 25 at the end of the week and that the remaining 325 bln of chinese goods that have not been subject to an extra levy will be slapped with a 25 tariff soon some projections suggest that such a tariff regime would take as much as 1 5 off china s gdp and around half as much from us gdp stocks tanked the shanghai composite fell 5 6 while shenzhen bled 7 4 in singapore the entrepot shares fell 3 european shares trended lower all morning leaving the dow jones stoxx 600 off more than 1 3 for its biggest drop in three months the s p 500 is called almost 1 75 lower bond yields are lower australian bonds where the central bank meets later this week saw yields tumble five basis points as did china s 10 year benchmark yield following a targeted cut in required reserves for small banks european bonds yields were one two basis points lower with italian bonds being the exception the dollar is stronger against most major and emerging market currencies the japanese yen is the chief exception though local markets will not re open until tomorrow asia pacific the us tariff threat is the main news and it rocked the region which had seemed like the laggard especially recently as emu s q1 gdp surprised on the upside south korea s gdp contracted in q1 and taiwan s had slowed while south korea s manufacturing pmi rebounded back above 50 in april taiwan s fell deeper below 50 south korea s export orders were at nine month lows singapore s april pmi stood at 47 3 and its non oil exports had dropped nearly 12 in march the market was more inclined to see new zealand cut rates than australia escalating us china tensions may push the rba over the edge and the odds have risen there have been conflicting press reports about how china will respond the first issue is whether china s negotiating team some 100 strong led by vice premier liu he will still come to washington as planned by the middle of the week chinese officials reportedly were blindsided by trump s tweets there is also some thought that us industry may need more than a week to prepare for the hike in tariffs the targeted required reserve ratio reduction for small chinese banks is estimated to inject about cny280 bln 40 bln us economic adviser kudlow played up the chances of a us japanese trade agreement by the end of the month the heightened tensions with china may make the us more willing to secure its other markets however what seems more likely is that the us wants japan to grant the same terms for agriculture as it granted to others under tpp and the free trade agreement with the eu trump has a trip to japan planned toward the end of the month that could provide such an opportunity to sign a deal japan however has gently pushed back it does not want a quick deal that will be followed by a longer negotiation it wants a comprehensive deal now and it does not wish to be subject to us auto tariffs which trump threatens it wants the steel and aluminum tariffs that have been levied on national security grounds to be lifted in unusual price action the dollar gapped lower to start the week in asia recall the dollar finished last week on its lows just above jpy111 00 it opened the tokyo less asian session near jpy110 70 and has not been above jpy110 85 it fell to almost jpy110 25 before finding a bid the lows from late march were set in the jpy109 80 area tokyo markets re open tomorrow the dollar was around jpy111 50 when its extended holiday began the australian dollar was sold down to almost 0 6960 on the initial reaction it is often viewed as a liquid proxy for china the 0 6950 level where an a 1 1 bln option is set to expire today corresponds to 61 8 retracement objective of the rally since the flash crash january 3 low near 0 6740 a close above 0 7000 would be constructive the dollar jumped from around cny6 7350 before the may day holiday to almost cny6 80 today a four month high the dollar rose 0 7 today against the offshore yuan which had been trading over the extended holiday europe european markets and currencies have responded to the end of the us china tariff truce but local news has been more important for the euro and sterling the emu service and composite pmi were in line with expectations while labour seems cool to may s latest overture after the stunning results of the local elections the emu service pmi edged up to 52 8 from the flash reading of 52 5 don t confuse this with an uptick it stood at 53 3 in march the decline was a little less than initially projected this is mostly because of the firmer german showing germany not known for its service sector saw its pmi firm to 55 7 from the flash s 55 6 and march s 55 4 the german service pmi is at its best level since last september italy and spain s service pmis were lower than expected 50 4 vs 51 8 and 53 1 vs 55 1 for italy and spain respectively the composite pmi for the eurozone stands at 51 5 up from 51 3 of the flash report but still down from 51 6 in march we see two takeaways first the growth in the region is uneven and fragile second the real sector continues to outperform sentiment and survey data chastened by another electoral loss may appears to be now willing to compromise with labour and is offering a customs union arrangement that would help resolve the irish border issue as oscar wilde would have it there are only two tragedies getting what you want and not like for many of us the worse thing for labour is to be given what it wants it has not been lost on observers that the parties that do well were pro eu reports suggest that in case talks with labour breakdown and parliament votes in favor of a second referendum the government has already given thought to what a referendum may entail it might see a three part offering the negotiated deal no deal no exit the euro remains within the weekend range it was initially sold to about 1 1160 but quickly rebounded toward 1 12 are where it has hovered in rather narrow ranges there are around 1 8 bln euros in options struck between 1 1150 1 1160 that expire today the us market demonstrated after the strong headline jobs data that it was prepared to take some profits on long dollar positions a move above the pre weekend high near 1 1205 would confirm the corrective forces are intact after opening about 2 3 of a cent lower sterling immediately rallied and took out the pre weekend high marginally and briefly before gradually returning to its lows near 1 31 in the european morning there is a modest option gbp210 at 1 3105 that will be cut today but the intraday technical indicators look constructive america in addition to the knock on equities and the general risk off moment spurred by the heightened trade tensions investors have concluded that a fed cut is more likely the risk of a cut had appeared to slacken after fed chair powell had suggested that the softness in inflation was temporary and indeed as we noted this week s april cpi report is expected to be higher for the second consecutive month and back above 2 0 after reaching 1 5 in february the implied yield of the january 2020 fed funds futures reached 2 115 in the middle of last week the current average is near 2 41 it rebounded to 2 265 after the jobs data and is now 2 195 while q1 gdp was stronger than expected the details were not as good as the optics in particular the inventory build was disconcerting it was followed by the weakest ism manufacturing report since november 2016 and little noticed last week was the sharp drop in april auto sale to 16 4 mln annualized pace the least in almost two years rather than get the fed to cut rates pre emptively to help the us fight the trade war as he had used the bully pulpit to do trump now appears to be playing for a cut in reaction to the cross currents he is risking several fed officials speak this week including powell williams and brainard of course there are some differences among the voting members but there has yet to be a single dissent under powell yellen in contrast faced on at her first meeting the differences seem contextual and in any event will not lead to a policy change for several more months at least in addition the president s public criticism of the fed may also encourage officials to be particularly parsimonious with dissents for fear that it could be used to undermine the central bank the drop in oil prices and the risk off moment weighs on the canadian dollar the us dollar has recouped the ground it lost after the employment report and is back knocking on cad1 35 it rose above there in late april but did not manage to close above it initial support is seen near cad1 3450 on balance the cad1 34 cad1 35 may contain the greenback near term the dollar reversed lower against the mexican peso ahead of the weekend but the trade escalation prevents follow through dollar selling the recent highs for the greenback have been shy of mxn19 20 it has been up to mxn19 11 today already until there is some clarification the dollar may hold above the mxn19 00 area however remember that mexico is often seen as one of the beneficiaries of heightened us china tensions separately note that saudi arabia indicated it was cutting the price of oil shipped to the us next month while raising its prices elsewhere wti for june delivery spiked down to almost 60 which was important support before rebounding back above 61 resistance is pegged in the 61 50 61 80 area disclaimer
by arkadiusz sieron of sunshine profits the us dollar will collapse or it will be replaced by another currency we hear such statements all the time are they true we decided to check these claims so we invite you to read our today s article about the us dollar s international supremacy and find out whether the greenback s demise is likely in the foreseeable future let s also draw implications from the analysis for the precious metals market we have heard about the fall of the us dollar s significance for over half a century in particular the rise of china s economy threatens the greenback s dominance trump s unsound fiscal policy and the recent powell s dovish turn only reinforce these fears so let s analyze whether such a scenario is likely in the foreseeable future and let s draw implications for the precious metals market the dollar s supremacy started around 1955 when reserves held in greenback exceeded those held in pound sterling since then the us dollar is a king to be clear we do not maintain that greenback is a wonderful currency without problems and better than gold no it simply has no competitors among other fiat currencies it is a king of beggars initially after the gradual demise of british currency the only possible alternatives to the greenbackwere the japanese yen and the deutsche mark as japan and germany noted impressive pace of economic development however both economies were much smaller and with less liquid financial market moreover the us army stationed in both countries which cast a shadow over their currencies the situation has not improved since then in the 1990s germany struggled with the reunification while japan fell into multi year stagnation after the burst of the enormous asset price bubble actually one may convincingly claim that japan has not fully recovered yet as the country still faces deflation weak banks adverse demographics sluggish growth or even periodic bouts of negative growth and negative interest rates indeed the bank of japan is running the most accommodative machine of any central bank that it systematically important hence yen is not likely candidate to replace the us dollar many analysts believed that 21th century will bring some changes as the ecb launched euro a new common currency for several european countries however for almost every economist with some knowledge about the international monetary system it was clear that a project based on a unified monetary policy and heterogeneous fiscal policy each member of the eurozone conducts its own policy could not pose a serious threat to the us dollar the euro is too fragile which was revealed by the great recession and the sovereign debt crisis the current italy s problems are just an old shortcomings in a new disguise i write more about the latest twenty years of the eurozone in the february edition of the market overview last but not least germany is also an obstacle for euro to gain in importance you see berlin favors the policy of a balanced budget for us it is a very sound policy but it results in the small supply of german bunds so investors prefer to park their funds in the us treasury market which is the most liquid market in the world if not euro and not yen so maybe yuan will dethrone the us dollar this is what many analysts expect based on china s economic potential after all the imf included the chinese renminbi into the sdr basket in october 2016 however the yuan is not likely to replace the us dollar anytime soon the main reason is shallow financial market in china it still lacks transparency and it is controlled to large extent by the authorities do you remember august 2015 when the people s bank of china devalued the currency i bet you do we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us let s look at the chart below the share of the yuan in global currency reserves amounted to 1 8 percent in q3 2018 it does not look like a great threat for us dollar does it chart 5 composition of world s total foreign currency reserves from q1 2010 to q3 2018 green line us dollar blue line euro purple line pound sterling orange line japanese yen red line chinese yuan investors should remember that there are four things needed in order for a currency to play a global role size stability liquidity and security although china s economy and trade payments are big the yuan is not stable not liquid and not secure the financial system is still heavily controlled by the authorities and it is not open and transparent although the share of the us dollar in the world s total foreign reserves has declined somewhat since 2015 it remained dominant with share above 60 percent the euro which is the second most popular reserve currency has share amounting to 20 percent or one third of the greenback s share moreover although dollar s role as official reserve diminished slightly its share in bank external claims has risen similarly volumes through u s based dollar wire transfer and settlement systems have also continued to rise to sum up tina says that the us dollar will remain the world s global reserve despite all its shortcomings who is tina it is the slogan used by margaret thatcher there is no alternative yen let s be serious japan still cannot stand on its own feet after post bubble recession approaching the third lost decade euro no way as long as there are doubts about the eurozone s survival yuan maybe someday but not anytime soon as the renminbi is not freely floating while china s capital markets are not yet fully open the implications for the precious metals market are clear the gold bulls should not count on yuan replacing the us dollar it is not going to happen anytime soon you may not like america and its currency but the fact is the greenback will remain the dominant fiat currency us dollar will remain relatively strong which will be a headwind for the yellow metal however when china liberalizes and opens its capital market the gradual reshuffle in the composition of the foreign reserves may occur which could support gold if you enjoyed the above analysis and would you like to know more about the

lahore after having designed debt and fiscal policies in various crisis affected countries like cyprus ghana greece jamaica portugal philippines egypt ukraine bulgaria and romania etc the newly appointed state bank of pakistan governor dr reza baqir has now set sails for karachi to ensure that the country achieves fiscal stability through better regulation of the monetary and credit systems in place dr baqir is currently serving as the imf s country representative for egypt where the imf had approved financial assistance to the tune of about us 12 billion during november 2016 in the form of an extended fund facility eff arrangement research conducted by the jang group and geo television network shows that the assistance for egypt was dished out by the imf in a bid to help the country restore macroeconomic stability and return it to sustainable growth by improving the functioning of the foreign exchange markets bringing down the budget deficit and curtailing the government debt besides raising growth to create jobs the financial assistance egypt had also aimed at protecting the most vulnerable groups in the society research reveals that while egypt has a nominal gdp of us 249 559 billion as compared to pakistan s 312 2 billion the egyptian economy enjoys the services of a 31 15 million labour force which is much smaller than pakistan s 61 04 million unemployment in egypt stands at 9 9 per cent which is higher than pakistan s 5 7 per cent though it is a little hard to believe the figure for pakistan where people are running from pillar to post daily to find petty jobs egyptian exports have touched the 23 3 billion mark whereas pakistani economic wizards are hoping against hope that the country s exports would touch the 27 billion mark by june 30 this year the gross external debt in egypt s case rests at us 77 47 billion while pakistan s foreign debt liabilities had already soared to a record 96 7 billion by the end of september 2018 and are surging with every passing minute with the worsening rupee dollar parity well the task of revamping the ailing pakistani economy in partnership with dr abdul hafeez sheikh is a rather daunting one for raza baqir but it was certainly not easy to achieve what the new state bank governor and his organization imf have already achieved in egypt let us see how this 73 year old global financial institution having 189 countries as its members has helped egypt attain substantial monetary and fiscal stability during dr reza baqir s tenure as imf s country representative in cairo the imf executive board had approved the first review on july 13 2017 the second review on december 20 2017 the third review on june 29 2018 and the fourth review on february 4 2019 having allocated over 283 billion throughout the world and having quota resources of about us 661 billion in its kitty the imf undertook numerous reforms in egypt under the supervision of dr reza baqir to create fiscal room for investments in health education and infrastructure the fund thinks these investments would help achieve higher sustained growth job creation and greater purchasing power for egypt s middle class and the poor at the time of the third review the authorities indicated their intention to implement indexation for most fuel products as part of completing their energy sector reforms and the timing of its implementation will be determined by them the completion of the fourth review allows the disbursements of about 2 billion bringing total disbursements under the program to date to about us 10 billion completion of the fifth and final review will complete the imf programme s total disbursement of around 12 billion the fairly recent april 6 2019 report of the imf reveals egypt s macroeconomic situation has improved markedly since the initiation of the authorities reform programme in november 2016 the liberalisation of the foreign exchange market prudent monetary policy and ambitious fiscal consolidation have helped stabilise the macroeconomic environment growth has accelerated external and fiscal deficits have narrowed international reserves have risen and public debt inflation and unemployment have declined fiscal savings were in part deployed to enhance social protection and ease the burden of adjustment on the poor furthermore ongoing structural reforms aim at promoting private sector led inclusive growth and job creation the remainder of the extended fund facility supported program is focused on consolidating the gains in macroeconomic stabilisation further rebuilding fiscal buffers and advancing reforms in october 2018 as a local media house the egypt independent had written the international monetary fund expects egypt s economy to grow by 5 3 per cent in 2018 and 5 5 per cent in 2019 up from 4 2 per cent in 2017 the imf predicted that the growth rate of the egyptian economy will continue to rise to about 6 per cent in 2023 the average annual inflation rate is expected to fall this year to 20 9 per cent from 23 5 per cent last year and it will fall to 14 per cent in the next year and 7 per cent in 2023 the report added the report expected the unemployment rate to fall to 10 9 per cent this year from 12 2 per cent in the previous year but it will continue to decline to 9 9 per cent in 2019 what else has egypt achieved through imf s assistance the imf website states the egyptian authorities economic reform programme has made substantial progress as evident in the success achieved in macroeconomic stabilisation and recovery of growth tourism is rebounding sharply remittances have increased and the non petroleum manufacturing sector key for job creation is showing signs of a rebound the authorities have adopted the value added tax allowed the exchange rate to be determined by market forces and reduced inefficient fuel and electricity subsidies in addition to improve the business climate they passed the new industrial licensing law the investment law the companies law and the insolvency law the fund s website adds at the same time various measures have been taken to shield the poor from the adverse effects of the adjustment process looking forward the authorities are working on improving availability and access to industrial land which is critical for private sector development the reform of public procurement is advancing and the authorities are revamping the law on the egyptian competition authority eca to level the playing field for encouraging new private investment these reforms should help lay the foundation for higher and more inclusive growth and job creation over the medium term this is what the international monetary fund website further mentions about the after effects of its financial support to egypt the rise in inflation following the launch of the reform program was anticipated it reflected the effects of increases in electricity and fuel prices the introduction of the vat and pass through from the exchange rate depreciation however inflation has been on a declining trajectory since its peak in the summer of 2017 which means that prices are increasing at a slower pace annual headline inflation has declined from 33 per cent in mid 2017 to 12 percent in december 2018 in response to the central bank of egypt s cbe well calibrated interest rate policies it asserts this is line with the rate of inflation prior to the program and on track to meet the authorities target of single digit inflation by 2020 going forward monetary policy decisions will need to remain data driven and as before be guided by the primary goal of achieving low and stable inflation and underpinned by a flexible exchange rate regime a flexible exchange rate is critical for maintaining competitiveness and adjusting to external shocks wouldn t the imf loan add to egypt s debt and make the problem worse the imf policy makers comment countries generally turn to the imf for financing when they have run into economic difficulties at the time that egypt requested the imf program its international borrowing costs were substantially higher compared to about 2 7 per cent annual interest rate for the imf money in addition the imf program served as a catalyst for support from other international and bilateral partners the imf financing helped egypt ease the burden of economic adjustment by providing a financial cushion and more time to address the external and budget deficits which were the source of egypt s rising imbalances how is the imf addressing the problem of corruption that is perceived as being widespread in egypt the imf is helping the egyptian authorities address the issue of corruption in egypt both in the context of the imf supported reform programme and its annual health check of the economy a main pillar of the reform programme is the commitment to transparency and accountability holding a phd in economics from the university of california at berkeley besides being a harvard university alumni dr baqir was among the economic experts who had met abdul hafeez shaikh the incumbent adviser to prime minister imran khan on finance revenue and economic affairs when the latter was

april was a great month for the us dollar but the beginning of may has posed challenges end of april profit taking drove the greenback lower initially but the rally was renewed by optimistic comments from federal reserve chairman jerome powell then on friday the us dollar turned lower despite good labour market numbers this final move makes investors wonder if the greenback has peaked paving the way for a bottom in the euro aud and other major currencies on a fundamental basis the us dollar should be a more attractive currency the us economy is performing better and the fed is more hawkish than other central banks but technically having fallen to multi month lows eur and aud are vulnerable to a further short squeeze that could take these and other currencies higher but even if the aud and nzd do squeeze higher their moves will be restrained ahead of their reserve bank monetary policy announcements sterling was the best performing currency last week and it is an example of how important rate decision are aud and nzd trailed behind on concerns that rate cuts will be on the minds of those central banks data review fed leaves rates unchanged optimistic comments from powell

oil prices hitting fresh highs in april will have to see how ppi fares but inflation should be hotter with gas prices hitting its highest level since october last month key levels support 110 00 resistance 112 00 may is typically a good month for the dollar we ve all heard the saying sell in may and go away it s a well known investment strategy that calls for investors to buy stocks between november and april and switch to bonds between may and october but this month is generally a good one for the which strengthened 7 out of the last 10 years the dollar index also tends to perform well in may having appreciated 12 of the last 15 years see chart below fundamentally the us dollar should be an attractive currency even though the greenback fell after friday s labour market report job growth exceeded expectations and the unemployment rate fell to a 49 year low nonfarm payrolls increased by 263k in april up from 189k the previous month and the jobless rate dropped to 3 6 the dollar fell because wage growth increased less than expected but last month s release was revised higher and year over year earnings growth is just below the cyclical high so what this data tells us is that the labour market is tight finding work is easy but salary gains are limited and american pocketbooks aren t swelling it s important that fed chairman powell is optimistic at last week s fomc meeting he said solid fundamentals are supporting the economy as it continues on a healthy path he dismissed talk of easing described the fed s policy stance as appropriate right now and said we don t see a strong case for moving in either direction while the fomc statement focused on the negatives like low inflation weaker consumer spending and business investment powell downplayed all of these concerns he acknowledged that inflation has been weaker but attributed the softness to transitory factors he also said consumer spending and business investment will most likely pick up and noted that some of the risks they were worried about in march such as brexit europe and china have moderated these upbeat comments kicked off a dollar rally so strong that it drove eur usd below 1 12 and below 70 cents while that rally fizzled on nfps we believe the dollar remains a buy for two main reasons first the fed chair made it very clear that when it comes to the economy he sees the glass half full he expects the outlook to improve as the prior weakness eases secondly he sees no reason to be talking about rate cuts this view contrasts sharply with other central banks which have expressed growth concerns and talked openly about a response to counter the trend economic and monetary policy divergences were the reasons for the dollar s strong gains in april and they should continue to be a source of demand for the greenback cpi and ppi are scheduled for release this week and with gas prices rising to their highest level since october the risk is to the upside for these upcoming inflation reports don t forget that when it comes to trading currencies sentiment and technicals are important as well has not closed above the 20 day sma since april 25th and eur usd found support above 1 11 we could see further profit taking on long dollar positions before the buyers come in again the next support level for usd jpy is 110 50 and resistance in eur usd is near 1 1270 data review

currencies last week as investors were reluctant to buy ahead of the reserve bank s monetary policy announcements the rba and rbnz are among the least hawkish major central banks they are the furthest from raising interest rates and might even consider easing in fact interest rate futures are pricing in an 89 chance of an rba rate cut this year and an 82 chance of a similar move by the rbnz when the reserve bank of australia met in april they altered their monetary policy statement to say that the board will continue to monitor developments and set monetary policy to support sustainable growth in the economy and achieve the inflation target over time which suggested that they are moving to a more dovish posture the australian dollar plunged in response and remained under pressure since then although aud usd is hovering near 2019 lows the bears could be disappointed by the rba the table below shows broad based improvements in australia s economy since the last central bank meeting retail sales are up manufacturing services and construction sector activity improved and job growth accelerated this won t be enough to ease the central bank s concerns especially with inflationary pressures falling but it could lead to a tinge of optimism especially with china and us nearing a trade deal the reserve bank of new zealand on the other hand should be worried since their last meeting credit card spending is down and labour market service manufacturing and housing market activity weakened the trade balance is much higher but inflation is much lower back in march the rbnz shocked the market when they said a rate cut is more likely now than a hike as the balance of risks shifted to the downside due to lower business sentiment and a more pronounced global downturn experienced its strongest one day decline in seven weeks it could fall further if the central bank reaffirms their dovishness should also break out of its week long consolidation with

potential upside surprise given carney s optimism key levels support 1 3000 resistance 1 3300 gbp breaks higher on boe and nfps the best performing last week was sterling which traded sharply higher after the us nonfarm payrolls report we were actually surprised by the currency s anemic reaction to the bank of england meeting because initially the bank of england s lowered inflation projections overshadowed governor carney s positive comments and gdp upgrades the central bank now sees inflation ending the year at 1 6 well below their 2 target they also lowered their inflation forecasts for 2020 but carney believes inflation and demand will recover strongly over the next 2 to 3 years growth should also stabilize leading to stronger activity in 2019 2020 and beyond and if their forecast which is predicated on a brexit deal is correct more rate hikes than what is currently priced into the curve will be needed sterling did not react initially to these comments because there are no immediate policy implications until brexit is resolved the bank of england won t raise interest rates however when the nfp report came out all of the major currencies shot higher versus the greenback and gbp was the biggest beneficiary if the rba and rbnz are dovish there could be even more significant gains in and support in could also break paving the way for a deeper slide below 84 cents data

lahore after having designed debt and fiscal policies in various crisis affected countries like cyprus ghana greece jamaica portugal philippines egypt ukraine bulgaria and romania etc the newly appointed state bank of pakistan governor dr reza baqir has now set sails for karachi to ensure that the country achieves fiscal stability through better regulation of the monetary and credit systems in place dr baqir is currently serving as the imf s country representative for egypt where the imf had approved financial assistance to the tune of about us 12 billion during november 2016 in the form of an extended fund facility eff arrangement research conducted by the jang group and geo television network shows that the assistance for egypt was dished out by the imf in a bid to help the country restore macroeconomic stability and return it to sustainable growth by improving the functioning of the foreign exchange markets bringing down the budget deficit and curtailing the government debt besides raising growth to create jobs the financial assistance egypt had also aimed at protecting the most vulnerable groups in the society research reveals that while egypt has a nominal gdp of us 249 559 billion as compared to pakistan s 312 2 billion the egyptian economy enjoys the services of a 31 15 million labour force which is much smaller than pakistan s 61 04 million unemployment in egypt stands at 9 9 per cent which is higher than pakistan s 5 7 per cent though it is a little hard to believe the figure for pakistan where people are running from pillar to post daily to find petty jobs egyptian exports have touched the 23 3 billion mark whereas pakistani economic wizards are hoping against hope that the country s exports would touch the 27 billion mark by june 30 this year the gross external debt in egypt s case rests at us 77 47 billion while pakistan s foreign debt liabilities had already soared to a record 96 7 billion by the end of september 2018 and are surging with every passing minute with the worsening rupee dollar parity well the task of revamping the ailing pakistani economy in partnership with dr abdul hafeez sheikh is a rather daunting one for raza baqir but it was certainly not easy to achieve what the new state bank governor and his organization imf have already achieved in egypt let us see how this 73 year old global financial institution having 189 countries as its members has helped egypt attain substantial monetary and fiscal stability during dr reza baqir s tenure as imf s country representative in cairo the imf executive board had approved the first review on july 13 2017 the second review on december 20 2017 the third review on june 29 2018 and the fourth review on february 4 2019 having allocated over 283 billion throughout the world and having quota resources of about us 661 billion in its kitty the imf undertook numerous reforms in egypt under the supervision of dr reza baqir to create fiscal room for investments in health education and infrastructure the fund thinks these investments would help achieve higher sustained growth job creation and greater purchasing power for egypt s middle class and the poor at the time of the third review the authorities indicated their intention to implement indexation for most fuel products as part of completing their energy sector reforms and the timing of its implementation will be determined by them the completion of the fourth review allows the disbursements of about 2 billion bringing total disbursements under the program to date to about us 10 billion completion of the fifth and final review will complete the imf programme s total disbursement of around 12 billion the fairly recent april 6 2019 report of the imf reveals egypt s macroeconomic situation has improved markedly since the initiation of the authorities reform programme in november 2016 the liberalisation of the foreign exchange market prudent monetary policy and ambitious fiscal consolidation have helped stabilise the macroeconomic environment growth has accelerated external and fiscal deficits have narrowed international reserves have risen and public debt inflation and unemployment have declined fiscal savings were in part deployed to enhance social protection and ease the burden of adjustment on the poor furthermore ongoing structural reforms aim at promoting private sector led inclusive growth and job creation the remainder of the extended fund facility supported program is focused on consolidating the gains in macroeconomic stabilisation further rebuilding fiscal buffers and advancing reforms in october 2018 as a local media house the egypt independent had written the international monetary fund expects egypt s economy to grow by 5 3 per cent in 2018 and 5 5 per cent in 2019 up from 4 2 per cent in 2017 the imf predicted that the growth rate of the egyptian economy will continue to rise to about 6 per cent in 2023 the average annual inflation rate is expected to fall this year to 20 9 per cent from 23 5 per cent last year and it will fall to 14 per cent in the next year and 7 per cent in 2023 the report added the report expected the unemployment rate to fall to 10 9 per cent this year from 12 2 per cent in the previous year but it will continue to decline to 9 9 per cent in 2019 what else has egypt achieved through imf s assistance the imf website states the egyptian authorities economic reform programme has made substantial progress as evident in the success achieved in macroeconomic stabilisation and recovery of growth tourism is rebounding sharply remittances have increased and the non petroleum manufacturing sector key for job creation is showing signs of a rebound the authorities have adopted the value added tax allowed the exchange rate to be determined by market forces and reduced inefficient fuel and electricity subsidies in addition to improve the business climate they passed the new industrial licensing law the investment law the companies law and the insolvency law the fund s website adds at the same time various measures have been taken to shield the poor from the adverse effects of the adjustment process looking forward the

hobbled by recession and one of the world s highest inflation rates argentina may be lurching toward the next in a series of economic crises afflicting the country over the last 70 years consumer prices streaked more than 54 percent higher in the 12 months through march in defiance of central bank efforts to control inflation fueling poverty and further damaging a business climate blighted by nose bleed high borrowing rates the peso which lost 50 5 percent of its value against the us dollar in 2018 has shed another 15 percent so far this year prompting the central bank on monday to ease limits on foreign exchange market interventions related food insecurity in argentina sparks protests emergency bill the situation is threatening president mauricio macri s chances of being re elected in october how can this be happening again in a country that was once richer than all its latin american neighbors combined is it macri s fault macri was elected in late 2015 as a champion of free markets promising to normalize the economy after eight years under president cristina fern√°ndez a free spending populist who placed tight government controls on the markets he hired a cabinet of technocrats who promised to use orthodox policies to bring down inflation attract waves of foreign direct investment and put the country on track toward sustainable growth but some of the measures macri promised would cure the country s economic ills just gave it a different ailment related in argentina uber is illegal but unemployment is rampant to attract investment macri set out to cut the fiscal deficit first on his list of budget cuts the generous public utility subsidies that helped families recover from a 2001 02 sovereign debt default and shock currency devaluation that tossed millions of middle class argentines into poverty as useful as macri s budget cuts were on the fiscal side they had an unintended effect on people who had long taken the subsidies for granted every time a water electricity or home heating gas subsidy was reduced people s monthly utility bills rose the utility bills sapped the economy by reducing consumer spending in other areas and boosted inflation as businesses increased the price of goods and services to pay their own rising utility bills but macri started off so well after taking office in december 2015 macri got off to a good start he ditched fern√°ndez s trademark currency controls and settled a long standing feud with holders of defaulted argentine bonds finally getting the country out of default in october 2017 his governing coalition swept congressional elections macri s political future looked bright but argentina s high labor costs and activist unions known for going on strike continued to scare off investors the big foreign bricks and mortar investment promised by macri never arrived and the central bank appeared flat footed in dealing with the inflationary threat linked to the subsidy cuts related venezuelan engineers flee to argentina but find few jobs await when the united states raised interest rates last year money started flowing out of argentina and other riskier emerging markets all this pressured the peso prompting the central bank to increase interest rates which further weighed on the economy a noxious circle of fear low private investment recession and inflation deepened as the familiar doubts resurfaced about argentina s ability to pay its debts macri negotiated a 56 3 billion standby financing agreement with the international monetary fund the deal included a promise from the government to erase its primary fiscal deficit in 2019 to hit the target the macri administration cut more subsidies further inflaming inflation meanwhile the central bank s reference interest rate the one it gets for issuing short term notes shot to over 74 percent choking off what little credit there was for businesses and households cristina part ii some argentines have started to look back fondly on the tenure of fern√°ndez she remains popular among low income voters who benefited from generous welfare spending during her 2007 2015 administrations fernandez could pose a tough challenge to macri if she runs for another term in the october general election as much as the economy has suffered under macri many investors fear that leftist fern√°ndez would be worse the catch is that when investors get nervous about political uncertainty they yank money out of argentina making it harder for macri to pursue his orthodox policies and get re elected the president has already been forced to embrace some populist policies including grains export taxes and price freezes on food staples two hallmarks of the fern√°ndez years this has generated concern among investors who say these measures go against macri s own market friendly platform with the october vote up for grabs the only certainty in argentina is that uncertainty looks set to reign during the months ahead eliana raszewski of reuters reported from buenos aires

lahore after having designed debt and fiscal policies in various crisis affected countries like cyprus ghana greece jamaica portugal philippines egypt ukraine bulgaria and romania etc the newly appointed state bank of pakistan governor dr reza baqir has now set sails for karachi to ensure that the country achieves fiscal stability through better regulation of the monetary and credit systems in place dr baqir is currently serving as the imf s country representative for egypt where the imf had approved financial assistance to the tune of about us 12 billion during november 2016 in the form of an extended fund facility eff arrangement research conducted by the jang group and geo television network shows that the assistance for egypt was dished out by the imf in a bid to help the country restore macroeconomic stability and return it to sustainable growth by improving the functioningof the foreign exchange markets bringing down the budget deficit and curtailing the government debt besides raising growth to create jobs the financial assistance egypt had also aimed at protecting the most vulnerable groups in the society research reveals that while egypt has a nominal gdp of us 249 559 billion as compared to pakistan s 312 2 billion the egyptian economy enjoys the services of a 31 15 million labour force which is much smaller than pakistan s 61 04 million unemployment in egypt stands at 9 9 per cent which is higher than pakistan s 5 7 per cent though it is a little hard to believe the figure for pakistan where people are running from pillar to post daily to find petty jobs egyptian exports have touched the 23 3 billion mark whereas pakistani economic wizards are hoping against hope that the country s exports would touch the 27 billion mark by june 30 this year the gross external debt in egypt s case rests at us 77 47 billion while pakistan s foreign debt liabilities had already soared to a record 96 7 billion by the end of september 2018 and are surging with every passing minute with the worsening rupee dollar parity well the task of revamping the ailing pakistani economy in partnership with dr abdul hafeez sheikh is a rather daunting one for raza baqir but it was certainly not easy to achieve what the new state bank governor and his organization imf have already achieved in egypt let us see how this 73 year old global financial institution having 189 countries as its members has helped egypt attain substantial monetary and fiscal stability during dr reza baqir s tenure as imf s country representative in cairo the imf executive board had approved the first review on july 13 2017 the second review on december 20 2017 the third review on june 29 2018 and the fourth review on february 4 2019 having allocated over 283 billion throughout the world and having quota resources of about us 661 billion in its kitty the imf undertook numerous reforms in egypt under the supervision of dr reza baqir to create fiscal room for investments in health education and infrastructure the fund thinks these investments would help achieve higher sustained growth job creation and greater purchasing power for egypt s middle class and the poor at the time of the third review the authorities indicated their intention to implement indexation for most fuel products as part of completing their energy sector reforms and the timing of its implementation will be determined by them the completion of the fourth review allows the disbursements of about 2 billion bringing total disbursements under the program to date to about us 10 billion completion of the fifth and final review will complete the imf programme s total disbursement of around 12 billion the fairly recent april 6 2019 report of the imf reveals egypt s macroeconomic situation has improved markedly since the initiation of the authorities reform programme in november 2016 the liberalisation of the foreign exchange market prudent monetary policy and ambitious fiscal consolidation have helped stabilise the macroeconomic environment growth has accelerated external and fiscal deficits have narrowed international reserves have risen and public debt inflation and unemployment have declined fiscal savings were in part deployed to enhance social protection and ease the burden of adjustment on the poor furthermore ongoing structural reforms aim at promoting private sector led inclusive growth and job creation the remainder of the extended fund facility supported program is focused on consolidating the gains in macroeconomic stabilisation further rebuilding fiscal buffers and advancing reforms in october 2018 as a local media house the egypt independent had written the international monetary fund expects egypt s economy to grow by 5 3 per cent in 2018 and 5 5 per cent in 2019 up from 4 2 per cent in 2017 the imf predicted that the growth rate of the egyptian economy will continue to rise to about 6 per cent in 2023 the average annual inflation rate is expected to fall this year to 20 9 per cent from 23 5 per cent last year and it will fall to 14 per cent in the next year and 7 per cent in 2023 the report added the report expected the unemployment rate to fall to 10 9 per cent this year from 12 2 per cent in the previous year but it will continue to decline to 9 9 per cent in 2019 what else has egypt achieved through imf s assistance the imf website states the egyptian authorities economic reform programme has made substantial progress as evident in the success achieved in macroeconomic stabilisation and recovery of growth tourism is rebounding sharply remittances have increased and the non petroleum manufacturing sector key for job creation is showing signs of a rebound the authorities have adopted the value added tax allowed the exchange rate to be determined by market forces and reduced inefficient fuel and electricity subsidies in addition to improve the business climate they passed the new industrial licensing law the investment law the companies law and the insolvency law the fund s website adds at the same time various measures have been taken to shield the poor from the adverse effects of the adjustment process looking forward the authorities are working on improving availability and access to industrial land which is critical for private sector development the reform of public procurement is advancing and the authorities are revamping the law on the egyptian competition authority eca to level the playing field for encouraging new private investment these reforms should help lay the foundation for higher and more inclusive growth and job creation over the medium term this is what the international monetary fund website further mentions about the after effects of its financial support to egypt the rise in inflation following the launch of the reform program was anticipated it reflected the effects of increases in electricity and fuel prices the introduction of the vat and pass through from the exchange rate depreciation however inflation has been on a declining trajectory since its peak in the summer of 2017 which means that prices are increasing at a slower pace annual headline inflation has declined from 33 per cent in mid 2017 to 12 percent in december 2018 in response to the central bank of egypt s cbe well calibrated interest rate policies it asserts this is line with the rate of inflation prior to the program and on track to meet the authorities target of single digit inflation by 2020 going forward monetary policy decisions will need to remain data driven and as before be guided by the primary goal of achieving low and stable inflation and underpinned by a flexible exchange rate regime a flexible exchange rate is critical for maintaining competitiveness and adjusting to external shocks wouldn t the imf loan add to egypt s debt and make the problem worse the imf policy makers comment countries generally turn to the imf for financing when they have run into economic difficulties at the time that egypt requested the imf program its international borrowing costs were substantially higher compared to about 2 7 per cent annual interest rate for the imf money in addition the imf program served as a catalyst for support from other international and bilateral partners the imf financing helped egypt ease the burden of economic adjustment by providing a financial cushion and more time to address the external and budget deficits which were the source of egypt s rising imbalances how is the imf addressing the problem of corruption that is perceived as being widespread in egypt the imf is helping the egyptian authorities address the issue of corruption in egypt both in the context of the imf supported reform programme and its annual health check of the economy a main pillar of the reform programme is the commitment to transparency and accountability holding a phd in economics from the university of california at berkeley besides being a harvard university alumni dr baqir was among the economic experts who had met abdul hafeez shaikh the incumbent adviser to prime minister imran khan on finance revenue and economic affairs when the latter was heading the pakistani delegation at imf world bank meetings in the united states as ppp government s finance minister during september 2011

of millennial and generation z respondents believed that our economy should be mostly socialist that result is no outlier but rather a consistent finding over recent years in 2018 gallup found that 51 percent of 18 to 29 year old americans view socialism favorably only 45 percent look at capitalism positively an august 2018 yougov poll revealed that only 30 percent of 18 to 29 year olds had good feelings toward capitalism while 35 percent regarded socialism positively bernie sanders an avowed democratic socialist nearly captured the democratic presidential nomination in 2016 thanks in part to youth support another democratic socialist newly elected house member alexandria ocasio cortez from new york herself a millennial has achieved overnight celebrity accumulating more than 3 million twitter followers while trumpeting a 70 percent marginal tax rate just 25 years after the collapse of the soviet union how can socialism have made such a comeback the likeliest answer the great recession left millennials looking for alternatives to capitalism without the cold war ideological guideposts that positioned older generations both the right and the left have redefined socialism moreover so that many young supporters now think that it just means a cuddlier more equitable government yet even if socialism has been redefined its rising approval among the young is still a problem for proponents of economic liberty for decades apostles of free markets could condemn bad economic ideas merely by branding them socialist because real world marxists did such a good job of showing how much evil could radiate from a state controlled economy but those negative examples are mostly vanquished now the task ahead is to convince today s young people that society requires liberty as well as compassion the private ingenuity that generates new products and new jobs needs both incentives and reasonable regulation if our current politics tell us anything it is that this case must be made again with arguments that resonate among americans who ve probably never heard of lavrentiy beria in 2009 fox news host sean hannity mocked the obama administration s vast stimulus bill as the european socialist act of 2009 hannity joined a long line of conservative critics who ve hurled the term socialism at liberal opponents seeking to discredit their plans to expand government hannity s tag didn t derail the stimulus of course and a week later a newsweek cover story blared we are all socialists now heralding a new era of government intervention in the economy that headline to jon meacham s nearly decade old story is even truer today as those recent poll numbers of younger americans suggest the trend line is striking gallup polling data show that the share of democrats holding a positive view of socialism increased from 53 percent in 2010 to 57 percent in 2018 while the share who held a positive view of capitalism fell from 53 percent to 47 percent the shift is particularly dramatic among the young in 2010 according to gallup 68 percent of 18 to 29 year old americans felt favorably toward capitalism 51 percent felt favorably toward socialism eight years later only 45 percent of that age group view capitalism positively while 51 percent still liked socialism yougov polling found even starker figures with just 39 percent of 18 to 29 year olds viewing capitalism favorably in 2015 by 2018 that figure had fallen to 30 percent the comparable numbers for those over 65 59 percent and 56 percent the figures differ from poll to poll but the direction is clear for millennials socialism is a viable option socialism s comeback has been helped along by a change in meaning merriam webster defines socialism as any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods pretty much the traditional meaning of the term the 1912 election was the high water mark for american socialism in this sense with socialist party presidential candidate eugene debs winning 6 percent of the popular vote that year the party s platform called for collective ownership and democratic management of railroads wire and wireless telegraphs express service steamboat lines and all other social means of transportation and communication and of all large scale industries as well as the banking and currency system and land too wherever practicable in a 1949 gallup poll 46 percent of americans with an opinion on socialism thought that it meant government ownership or control of business in 2018 by contrast gallup found that only 22 percent of respondents understood socialism to mean government control thirty percent thought socialism meant equality and another 13 percent equated it with benefits and services like free medicine three times as many democratic and democratic leaning respondents thought socialism meant either equality or free benefits and services than thought it meant government control if socialism is just about higher tax rates and more generous health care then perhaps the cause of freedom doesn t have much to fear few of the new socialists seem to want industries nationalized outright ocasio cortez s preferred marginal tax rates are lower than those that president dwight eisenhower a republican found acceptable yet i m not so sanguine about the popularity of socialism even if the word has lost its harder edge if today s self proclaimed socialists merely want to champion postwar democratic ideals why adopt an ism that many older americans still regard with alarm and while total nationalization of industries is hard to imagine many ideas gaining currency with left of center politicians would significantly extend state control over private companies elizabeth warren doesn t call herself a socialist but her accountable capitalism actexpects all large firms to obtain a new federal charter obligating them to pay heed to the interests of corporate stakeholders from employees to surrounding communities who could know whether a company was adequately considering such dispersed interests presumably a warren administration would make that determination this may not be socialism in the strict sense but it s heading in that direction writing in the new york times last august corey robin a political scientist at brooklyn college attempted to sum up the worldview of the new socialists the socialist argument against capitalism isn t that it makes us poor it s that it makes us unfree when my well being depends upon your whim when the basic needs of life compel submission to the market and subjugation at work we live not in freedom but in domination socialists want to end that domination to establish freedom from rule by the boss from the need to smile for the sake of a sale from the obligation to sell for the sake of survival this characterization does not suggest a slightly more generous medicaid program or higher capital gains taxes it represents a wholesale rejection of the market and its purported cruelties the increasing popularity of socialism however defined among the young has many plausible causes the trend might just be the latest example of the old line often mistakenly attributed to winston churchill if you re not a liberal when you re 25 you have no heart if you re not a conservative by the time you re 35 you have no brain the idealism of the young is timeless even a bit charming at least when it doesn t lead to the guillotine or the gulag but opinion polling from the 1960s and 1970s shows no equivalent fondness for socialism among twentysomethings perhaps it s all about the indoctrination of the young by left wing professors a 2007 study found that more than 60 percent of college teachers identified themselves as being somewhat liberal and under 20 percent as somewhat conservative a more recent study suggests an even greater leftward skew in certain disciplines among historians there were 33 5 registered democrats to every registered republican the ratio was 20 to one among journalism professors and 17 4 to one among psychology professors but left leaning views have long been prevalent on college campuses so it s unclear why indoctrination would suddenly generate a far more socialist generation even if the leftward tilt is undeniable moreover it doesn t prove that professors have been trying to convert students i tend to believe that most teachers like myself try to keep their politics out of the classroom moreover most teachers again like me lack any skill in the black arts of political propaganda and while i share the concern that america s campuses might be too ideologically monolithic i m skeptical that professors have much power to shape opinion many americans don t even go to college and many who do go aren t paying much attention to their teachers those paying attention are the least likely to be ideologically indoctrinated in 2018 gallup found that only 22 percent of respondents understood socialism to mean government control a strong left wing bias among high school teachers might be a more credible explanation since their influence comes earlier and is more widespread but high school teachers are far more balanced politically than college professors one recent education week survey of k 12 educators found 23 percent identifying as conservatives 24 percent as liberals and 43 percent as moderates fifty percent of the responding teachers voted for hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential election and only 29 percent pulled the lever for donald trump still could what seems a moderate liberal skew in high school classes really produce a generation that likes socialism more than capitalism a simple test of the influence of high school teachers is to look at views of the vietnam war which would surely be presented extremely negatively by left wing instructors somewhat surprisingly a 2013 poll of 19 to 29 year olds discovered that only 43 percent thought the vietnam war was a mistake compared with 69 percent of respondents over 50 if left wing high school teachers managed to produce a generation broadly sympathetic with american military action in southeast asia it s hard to see how those teachers could also be responsible for turning out young socialists no the socialist surge is new and it marks a shift in american politics away from the cold war norm it is rooted i believe more in the events of the past 15 years than in the biases of educators i ve taught at harvard since 1992 and the changes in the students as they arrive seem far more profound than any changes in the classroom incoming students have reacted to events by rejecting the political status quo a wave of campus activism began with the post 9 11 wars of the george w bush years unlike the vietnam war the conflicts in afghanistan and iraq empaneled no draft boards for most college kids the wars remained far away in 2005 and 2006 young americans were more likely to support the iraq war than were older americans as late as 2013 19 to 29 year old gallup respondents split almost evenly on the war s merits the iraq war nevertheless mobilized a hard core of campus protesters who gathered in one case within earshot of my office to relive the glories of their parents or grandparents fight against the vietnam war thousands marched in washington to protest the iraq conflict on the day of president bush s second inauguration further the muddled outcomes of the post 9 11 american military interventions together with the end of the cold war weakened the national security case for being on the right in 2002 according to gallup 50 percent of americans thought the gop was better at protecting americans from military and terrorist threats with only 31 percent giving the edge to democrats by 2007 the republican advantage was gone then the great recession struck over the past 12 years america s economic travails have had a far greater impact on the young than has any national security concern the republican party which embraced capitalism was in the driver s seat when the financial meltdown and subsequent recession began but that would change financiers some drawing large paychecks amid a collapse that they helped trigger proved easy to vilify the crisis thankfully didn t spiral into a second great depression but it didn t end quickly either the generation that turned 21 in 2006 had a rough decade in 2010 the jobless rate for 25 to 34 year old men stood at 21 8 percent two years later the rate had fallen only to 19 8 percent even by 2018 after almost a decade of recovery joblessness among young men remained alarmingly high 13 9 percent this long period of high joblessness coincided with wage stagnation real median wages for men over age 16 were lower from 2010 to 2016 than they had been in 2009 or 2001 or 1982 at the same time younger americans could see wealthier older people getting richer the stock market enjoyed an almost unremitting rise from 2009 to 2018 housing markets recovered nicely from the financial crisis especially in coastal america faced with this reality many younger americans began to listen to left wing critics of president obama who argued that the crisis lingered because the administration was too timid in its reforms in part because it was too friendly with wall street in 2011 the occupy movement came to wall street and to colleges though movement speakers were often incoherent they made clear their dislike for capitalism and their dislike for the need for compromise that the founders had built in to america s political system regnant orthodoxies often come under fire during moments of economic and political crisis if president obama had possessed the political skills of franklin roosevelt he might have articulated a worldview that captured the imagination of the young but while his personal approval remains high among democratic voters obama never championed a clear philosophy of government in the absence of ideological leadership new voices found listeners among economically struggling millennials some rejected globalization embracing a populist economic nationalism others voiced the radical view that markets themselves were to blame for economic stagnation and that capitalism needed replacing since the status quo seemed to be performing poorly especially for the young why not try socialism nevertheless many younger americans remain fundamentally uncommitted they re not die hard socialists if the friends of freedom want a way into their hearts and minds however they ll need an updated message that speaks to millennials hopes and fears with the caveat that i m no political strategist here are my suggestions on what might work we should recognize that millennials like entrepreneurship a 2016 gallup survey found that 90 percent of 18 to 29 year olds viewed entrepreneurs positively ninety eight percent looked favorably on small businesses in fact the youngest respondents had the most enthusiasm both for socialism and for small businesses and entrepreneurship even with their socialist sympathies millennials have not lost sight of the dynamism that comes from private enterprise we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us this makes sense after all children born in 1992 have lived through a series of public sector failures and private sector successes apple s ipod arrived when they were nine enabling them to listen to a library of music that they could carry in their pocket the iphone appeared in 2007 just in time to turbocharge their teenage social life facebook twitter instagram amazon all became mass phenomena during their lifetime a group with so much exposure to the power of entrepreneurship should be open to the notion that private sector energy not government control opens a better path to widespread employment less expensive housing and superior medical care but millennials won t fall for a pure laissez faire pitch the teens of the reagan era like myself may have believed that the republican program of shrinking bureaucracy was exactly what was needed to liberate the economy for millennials republican stewardship brought financial chaos and economic underperformance my more libertarian friends point out that the gop s passion for economic liberty rarely translated into action they argue too that the 2007 housing crash would ve been far less devastating if the government hadn t been subsidizing gambling on the housing market with the home mortgage interest deduction and the loose mortgage underwriting of quasi governmental entities freddie mac and fannie mae yet for many millennials the call to scale back government s role sounds like an excuse for inaction rather than a real plan to reduce their economic frustrations a better approach might be to channel a mixture of supreme court justice louis brandeis free market icon milton friedman and recent nobel prizewinning economist edward phelps and call for a new freedom that would be guided intelligently toward solving social problems when woodrow wilson campaigning for president in 1912 evoked brandeis by saying that if america is not to have free enterprise then she can have freedom of no sort whatever his supporters heard a call for muscular reform not a defense of the status quo in our day empowering small businesses could mean slashing onerous regulations that stop small shops from opening in immigrant neighborhoods a brandeis style reform agenda could include rewarding pharmaceutical companies for lifesaving innovations in ways that don t grant them lengthy monopolies or discouraging local governments from giving favored treatment to large companies to get them to relocate or stay milton friedman was a champion of free markets but one of his most successful ideas school vouchers envisioned public incentives that would encourage entrepreneurs to solve social problems friedman understood the failure of state monopoly provision of public schooling he wanted to empower parents and startups to create better schools friedman s vision could be extended to other pressing social problems from inner city undereducation to the reintegration of newly released convicts in the friedmanite vision the public sector establishes the financial incentives but private entrepreneurs come up with the ingenious solutions silicon valley moguls seem to think that they can solve any puzzle except perhaps the chronic underemployment of less skilled americans including millennials that s where phelps comes in he proposes using the tax code to subsidize job creation a policy that encourages entrepreneurs to employ more workers could include tax subsidies to firms and workers like the earned income tax credit and reforming public policies like disability insurance and food stamps so that they did less to discourage work millennials came of age during the great recession which left many of them struggling to find work ashley gilbertson vii redux the case for liberty is about more than material gains which the defenders of markets must remember more often for most of the past quarter century the advocates of economic freedom have made their case primarily by arguing that low taxes lead to economic prosperity both in the immediate sense that families get to keep more of their earnings and in the systemic sense that strong economic incentives generate higher levels of output the moral argument has been less prevalent by contrast the left wing case at least at times has combined castigation of apparent economic injustices with a call for empathy and compassion bernie sanders declares that his very strong spiritual feeling is that when children go hungry when veterans sleep out on the street that impacts me this cri de coeur resonated with younger americans in the past effective promoters of liberty like ronald reagan have emphasized that the case for economic freedom is more spiritual than material socialists ignore the side of man that is the spirit they can provide you shelter fill your belly with bacon and beans treat you when you re ill all the things guaranteed to a prisoner or a slave they don t understand that we also dream reagan s argument remains a potent condemnation of leftist chimeras including growing enthusiasm for the universal basic income particularly among silicon valley elites who see artificial intelligence and robotics as potentially obliterating millions of jobs what kind of nation would america be if say 40 percent of adults subsisted entirely on government handouts the data on joblessness show the broken spirits of those lacking the sense of purpose and social connections that come with work the make work public employment guarantees advanced by democratic senator kirsten gillibrand and other politicians seem almost as soul killing the fight for economic freedom must instead celebrate the ordinary americans who bring a smile to their customers faces while serving them a coffee or employers who generate jobs for the less skilled we are indeed in a race of man against machine as new technologies threaten to replace many forms of ordinary work entrepreneurial imagination is the best way to ensure that workers laid off today will be able to find new productive jobs tomorrow satisfaction comes from doing not from having and freedom not socialism empowers doing any new freedom narrative should also point out that many nonprofit leaders like geoffrey canada of the harlem s children zone educational organization are also entrepreneurs habitat for humanity and teach for america are just two entrepreneurial nonprofits that struggle with excessive government regulation socialism s current appeal rests partly on the fact as we ve seen that for many it stands for caring for the poor it needs to be defined again as what it truly is my former student laura nicolae of romanian descent offered a powerful counterargument to our intellectual carelessness about socialism in a recent harvard crimson op ed she writes after spending four years on a campus saturated with marxist memes and jokes about communist revolutions my classmates will graduate with the impression that communism represents a light hearted critique of the status quo rather than an empirically violent philosophy that destroyed millions of lives nicolae chose to combat this ignorance by telling how her father ran from a government that beat tortured and brainwashed its citizens and how his childhood friend disappeared after scrawling an insult about the dictator on the school bathroom wall and that his neighbors starved to death from food rations designed to combat obesity it s vital to remember that socialism the ideology of marx meant state ownership of the means of production such a system creates a government so powerful that abuse of citizens is practically guaranteed scandinavian social democracies like sweden and denmark are not socialist in any meaningful sense they re capitalist societies with extensive welfare states if you think swedish pensions are too generous you can argue against them but don t argue as many on the right do that they are tantamount to socialist control of the economy similarly when obamacare is demonized as socialism then millions of young people who want a more inclusive safety net start thinking that they must be socialists too this is no mere misuse of language calling themselves socialist the young open themselves to orwellian notions like socialism means freedom freedom say from the need to smile for the sake of a sale as corey robin put it that markets incentivize kindness is a good thing one great evil of socialist states is that they eliminated any financial reason to be friendly yielding generations of dour apparatchiks whose success came from subservience to their political masters not pleasing the public another step let freedom serve the young the unhappiness that many millennials have with the status quo reflects an economy that has too often protected insiders at outsiders expense in manufacturing firms older unionized workers earn far more than similarly skilled younger workers occupational licensing restricts the competitive chances of new workers economic freedom will become much more compelling to 25 year olds when they see how often public interventions have benefited the entrenched at the expense of the young the regulatory bias toward the old is particularly evident in housing policy consider california s proposition 13 passed overwhelmingly in 1978 the measure may have struck a blow against rising property taxes but by ensuring that home value assessments cannot rise more quickly than the rate of inflation unless the house is sold it glaringly favors the old over the young as california s housing prices have risen steadily since 1976 old homeowners wind up paying a tiny fraction of the taxes paid by younger more recent buyers an additional downside of prop 13 is that it tends to lock older homeowners in place if they move they lose the tax advantage that comes from their ultralow property assessment california s onerous housing regulations add to the dysfunction of the state s housing market by making it hard to build some limits originated with the state courts in cases like 1972 s friends of mammoth which mandated extensive environmental impact reviews for all large building projects in other instances local regulations have limited new construction with policies like the 60 acre minimum lot sizes that exist in parts of marin county this creates housing shortages that drive up prices recent research that i ve conducted with wharton s joseph gyourko looks at the generational accumulation of housing wealth in 1983 the 75th percentile 25 to 34 year old had 45 000 in home value thirty years later that same group had only 21 000 of net housing wealth among 65 to 74 year olds by contrast the 75th percentile household s net housing wealth rose from 150 000 to 225 000 over that period and the 95th percentile s climbed from 427 000 to 700 000 housing is the main store of wealth for most americans and regulations have clearly helped redistribute wealth from young home buyers to old home sellers the tendency of government regulation to entrench incumbents is hardly limited to housing elizabeth warren has proposed that employee representatives make up 40 percent of all corporate boards such representatives might look after the interests of incumbent employees but they would have little incentive to care about new workers a pervasive feature of labor markets in social democracies is a large gap between insiders and outsiders and the young inevitably begin as outsiders the case for socialism starts with anger against a system that seems to increase inequality and leave the most vulnerable unprotected but we can enhance upward mobility and create a better safety net by empowering entrepreneurship and redirecting existing funding the connection between entrepreneurial freedom and mobility is easy to make social insurance is harder to fit within the case for a new freedom but to succeed today the case for liberty must also make peace with reasonable protections against economic and physical calamity entrepreneurship can improve social mobility because so many new americans make their own futures by starting businesses we could do much more to help them appallingly america regulates the entrepreneurship of the wealthy far less stringently than it regulates the entrepreneurship of the poor if a harvard undergraduate wants to launch an internet firm in his dorm it might accumulate 1 billion users before regulators start paying attention if a haitian immigrant wants to start a grocery in harvard square that say sells milk he must cut through a dense thicket of local regulations we should apply more rigorous cost benefit analysis to local regulations and set up one stop permitting for local entrepreneurs with permitting offices fluent in several languages mentoring programs with older entrepreneurs providing guidance to young prot√©g√©s would also help spark business creation we should experiment with after school programs that teach entrepreneurship relevant skills entrepreneurship fires job creation which we will need more than ever we must ensure too that our tax policies encourage firms to hire new workers and that our wage and labor regulations don t discourage firms from hiring them entrepreneurship can improve social mobility because so many new americans start businesses finally entrepreneurship can also be part of providing better schooling and cheaper health care not all charter schools which operate free from sundry labor restrictions of traditional public schools are great but in many communities they provide a successful alternative to conventional schools i would also like to see vocational training provided after school on weekends and over the summer but entrepreneurship isn t enough on its own the most entrepreneurial economy in the world won t provide insurance against mental illness or ensure that every person gets a steady income the advocates of liberty have often turned their backs on social insurance but if they want to be relevant to a new generation they can t keep doing that nevertheless the new freedom should emphasize that social insurance in the u s today represents a massive transfer from young to old medicare and social security are vast government programs funded by taxes on the young and that benefit people over the age of 65 who are often wealthy a proposal compatible with the cause of freedom is to make our social insurance system fairer even if total spending remains constant means testing benefits would be a great start cost containment for medicare and medicaid would provide trillions of extra dollars we can offer more meaningful social insurance for the poor and young if we stop spending so much on the wealthy and old the current vogue for socialism among the young does not mean that most twentysomethings want the government to run pizzerias and gaming platforms but many do want more government control over sectors of the economy old ideological tethers have largely dissolved and america is at risk of moving in a far more statist direction in this new wide open world the cause of capitalism has struggled republicans won the 2016 elections primarily due to older whiter voters many of whom were suspicious of markets the future could increasingly belong to the radical left even socialists in the true sense of the term the global shift to the left after world war i and the great depression called forth a generation of legendary scholars friedrich hayek karl popper and friedman among others who used their voices to advocate for freedom not only because of its economic benefits but also because all humans deserve a chance to chart their destiny free from the overweening grip of the state today a new generation must make the case for liberty again the free market is far from perfect but the track record of state dominated economies is far worse

president donald trump sent asian markets plunging monday after threatening to hike tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods at the end of the week in a bid to speed up stuttering trade talks between the economic superpowers shanghai plunged more than 5 0 per cent as it led big losses across the region with the chinese yuan also taking a battering after the president threw a spanner into the high level negotiations which many observers were expecting to wrap up imminently for 10 months china has been paying tariffs to the usa of 25 on 50 billion dollars of high tech and 10 on 200 billion dollars of other goods trump tweeted sunday night the 10 will go up to 25 on friday the warning will throw a shadow over the next round of talks with a delegation from beijing due in washington this week with bloomberg news reporting the chinese side are considering their position the two sides have imposed tariffs on 360 billion in two way trade since last year but trump and his chinese counterpart xi jinping agreed a truce in december helping fan a surge across world stock markets for the past four months trump has taken the proverbial sledgehammer to the walnut this morning and the only two words likely to be on the minds of traders and investors this week are trade talks said oanda senior market analyst jeffrey halley hong kong tumbled 3 3 per cent by the break and shanghai was off 5 2 per cent as investors there returned for the first time since tuesday news that the people s bank of china would slash the amount of cash lenders must keep in reserve to support small businesses had little impact in the face of trump s warning singapore was off 3 3 per cent and taipei shed 1 8 per cent while sydney and wellington were each 1 0 per cent down manila and jakarta were also sharply lower tokyo and seoul were closed for holidays yuan tumbles trade had been put to the side by many market participants said andrew tilton chief asia pacific economist at goldman sachs market pricing assumed there would be some kind of a deal and no further escalation in tariffs and meanwhile the growth outlook was actually improving he told bloomberg tv trump s threat now raises the spectre of a significant hit to growth should these tariffs escalate and should the uncertainty associated with that weigh on investment going forward the yuan also took a hiding shedding more than 1 3 per cent at one point against the dollar its heaviest fall in more than three years the currency had been sitting around 10 month highs on the back of optimism the two sides would sign off on a trade pact investors will remain bearish on the yuan as they reprice in trade war risks because the new developments are a reversal of previous positive progress ken cheung senior foreign exchange strategist at mizuho bank the news was unexpected the flight to safety saw the dollar surge against higher yielding higher risk units with south africa s rand off 1 0 per cent the mexican peso 0 9 per cent lower and the australian dollar 0 6 per cent lower on oil markets both main contracts were hammered more than two percent by worries that a trade war between the world s top two economies could hit demand for the commodity adding to weakness in the sector is the us drive to increase output which comes as it reports rising stockpiles which are offsetting unrest in libya tensions with iran and production caps by opec and russia however while trading floors are awash with red stephen innes at spi asset management remained positive we do know the president tends to retreat from more aggressive displays so i am viewing this thinly veiled threat as political posturing or a tactical decision to apply more pressure on china to put through a trade deal that aligns with the best usa economic interest at heart despite us china trade talks hitting an apparent impasse based on the tweet i think a deal will be signed shortly trump s outburst overshadowed another blockbuster us jobs report friday that reinforced the view that the economy is in rude health while measured wage inflation eased pressure on the federal reserve to hike interest rates

holiday dow future is currently down 465 pts trump to push us china trade war to full blown level on friday in his tweets on sunday trump complained that the trade deal with china continues too slower as they attempt to renegotiate thus he decided to push trade war with china to full blown level on friday even though treasury secretary steven mnuchin and trade representative robert lighthizer are planning to wrap up trade talks with chinese vice premier liu he in washington this week trump claimed that the great economic results of the us as of late can partially be attributed to the additional tariffs china has been paying for 10 months the included 5 tariffs on usd 50b of high tech goods and 10 on usd 200b of other goods trump also claimed that the tariffs paid to the usa have little impact of product cost mostly borne by china on friday trump will raise the 10 tariffs on the usd 200b of other goods to 25 additionally currently untaxed usd 325b will be tariffed at rate of 25 trump got full support from democrat schumer on trade war escalation but others unsure trump s move to escalate trade war with china got firm support from democrat senate leader chuck schumer schumer urged trump to hang tough on china in a tweet and don t back down he added strength is the only way to win with china white house economic adviser larry kudlow tried to tone down the threat and said trump is merely issuing a warning here he told fox news that we bent over backwards earlier we suspended the 25 percent tariff to 10 and then we ve left it there that may not be forever if the talks don t work out however an informal trade adviser to trump michael pillsbury clearly disagreed with kudlow he said i take the president s tweet at face value i was disappointed that larry kudlow downgraded it to a mere warning which may tend to undermine american credibility as the chinese delegation prepares its position it s unsure for now whether trump is really intending to drop the negotiations abruptly or he s just trying to push china for last minute concessions on some key issues but the act could firstly undermine credibility of the us in negotiations with other countries and it could also undermine trump s own credibility as he s told the public numerous times that a deal was close yuan dives as trade tensions re escalate pboc cut rrr for smaller banks at this point it s unsure how china will respond to renewed tariff threats by trump at this very last stage of negotiations vice premier liu he is originally scheduled to travel to washington on

all of its exports he said the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no that knocked sentiment immediately in asia where the shanghai composite index closed 5 6

resolving a tariffs battle that has rattled world markets the wall street journal citing unidentified sources said china s government was considering canceling this week s talks but a chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang said monday that the delegation was still planning to go he would not say exactly who might attend the talks though trump s tweet has weighed on market sentiment on monday there is still a prevailing view that a deal will get done although trump s strategy is risky because the chinese could refuse to negotiate at gunpoint and decide to walk out on the trade talks

temper expectations suggesting that washington was willing to move on if it can t get the deal it wants a substantive deal would require china to rethink the way it pursues its economic ambitions abandoning or scaling back subsidies to its companies easing up on the pressure for foreign companies to share trade secrets and giving them more access to the chinese market philip levy senior fellow at the chicago council on global affairs and a white house economist under president george w bush said the talks are too complicated for trump s high pressure tactics to work the president treats this like we re haggling over the price of a used car levy said trump has made a priority of shaking up u s trade policy as a candidate for the presidency trump raged repeatedly about alleged chinese perfidy so much so that a video mashup of him spitting out the word china went viral and collected more than 15 million views on youtube trump charged that previous administrations gullible and weak had let china get away with abusive trade practices accepting empty promises from beijing and allowing the u s china economic relationship to grow ever more lopsided as evidence he cited america s vast trade deficit with china 379 billion last year by far the biggest with any country in the world once he took office trump s relationship with xi seemed to get off to a good start the two men shared chocolate cake and amiable conversation at trump s resort in mar a lago florida in april 2017 a few weeks later china agreed to open its market to u s beef cooked chicken and natural gas in what commerce secretary wilbur ross called a herculean accomplishment the romance faded in march 2018 the office of the u s trade representative issued a report accusing china of using predatory tactics to strengthen its tech companies last july the trump administration gradually began slapping import taxes on chinese goods to pressure beijing into changing its policies it has imposed 10 tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports and 25 tariffs on another 50 billion the chinese have retaliated by targeting 110 billion in u s imports the fight between the world s two biggest economies is raising worries about global economic growth the international monetary fund the world bank and others have downgraded their forecasts for the world economy saying the u s china standoff is reducing world trade and creating uncertainty for companies trying to decide where to buy supplies build factories and make investments trump claims his tariffs are a moneymaker for the united states but a march study by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university found that the burden of trump s tariffs including taxes on steel aluminum solar panels and chinese imports falls entirely on u s consumers and businesses who buy imported products by the end of last year the study found they were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency nonetheless the overall u s economy has remained healthy on friday the government reported that the u s unemployment rate had fallen to the lowest level in half a century markets rallied but on monday those gains were reversed as investors reversed course this is a big surprise given the increasingly positive messages from the various us officials involved in the trade talks in recent weeks tao wang and ning zhang of ubs said in a commentary certainly the risk of an all out us china trade war has increased significantly

presentation hence the bank s technical staff that has laboured to produce this report should deserve commendation by all alarmingly declining growth rates however an important line graph which has been obscured by other colourful presentations has depicted the sad story of sri lanka s economic performance during the last four year period showing the annual real economic growth rate during the reign of the present government it has drawn a downward spiralling staircase with a growth of 5 in 2015 but falling continuously since then to reach the lowest stair of 3 2 in 2018 on average the annual growth during this period has been at 4 and when it is adjusted for an annual population growth of about 1 the real income per person known as the per capita income or pci has increased only by 3 a rate much below the planned growth rate of 8 needed to become a rich country within a generation thus as i have argued previously it is four wasted years which cannot be recovered by sri lanka now need for quick recovery measures hence what the government whether it is this government or any other government that would come to power in the future should do is to plan for a quick economic recovery in the next few years and lay foundation for a firm and consistent high economic growth in the subsequent 20 to 30 year period the strategies for economic recovery during the next few years is essential since the central bank itself has painted a gloomy economic picture for the country in the years to come according to its predictions growth will slightly recover in 2019 to 4 and move upward sluggishly to about 5 during 2021 to 2023 this is a little higher than what the international agencies like the world bank and the asian development bank have predicted for sri lanka which is on average below 4 per annum even that higher prediction of the central bank is still on average below 5 a growth rate woefully inadequate to deliver prosperity to sri lankans this is a warning signal that cannot be ignored by the government synthesis presented in chapter 1 chapter 1 of the bank s annual report is a prerogative of its director of economic research the officer historically known as the brain of the bank synthesising the detailed analysis made in the rest of the report the director usually presents a summary of the behaviour of the key sectors in the economy on top of this he or she presents a prediction of its performance in the next five year period in the light of the expected developments in the global economy which has serious bearing on sri lanka this is then followed by an outline of the policy to be followed by the government if it is desirous of supporting economic recovery on a sustainable basis gloomy forecast and essential economic reforms since the predictions made for the next five years are gloomy this year s annual report has come up with a set of essential economic reforms that have to be implemented by the government on a priority basis in my view the policy package in the present annual report highlighting what the government should do and what it should not to do is a comprehensive set dealing with the policy reforms needed in all the areas if any political party contesting the next election is interested in mapping out its economic strategy for sustained high growth this section surely provides the base for it economic reforms to address the low growth conundrum economic growth in the last four years has been low by any standard but the central bank apparently not willing to embarrass the government has chosen to call it a moderate growth according to the bank the reasons for this so called moderate growth have been the postponement of the structural economic reforms which the country should have undertaken many years ago these reforms had been recommended by international lending organisations such as the international monetary fund world bank and the asian development bank for some time at the same time the domestic private sector chambers too had advocated for them yet all the successive governments demonstrating their inability to manage economic policy programmes properly had either abandoned them midway after embarking on them or not tried out at all for fear of antagonising certain quarters in society ignoring the needed reforms in the past to the top policymakers in the previous mahinda rajapaksa government reforms had been an anathema the present government started its career after the general elections in august 2015 with many promises of economic reforms as pronounced by prime minister ranil wickremesinghe in the first economic policy statement delivered in parliament in november 2015 there were promises about tax reforms making the central bank independent integrating sri lanka seamlessly to global trade trade facilitating bilateral agreements with almost all the countries in the world and converting sri lanka s low tech production base to a high tech base to plan out these reforms an economic summit was held in colombo in january 2016 with the support from the george soros foundation and harvard university s centre for international development yet the achievements on economic reforms during the four year period have been less than expected it is ironic that now the central bank has to remind the government of the need for moving into action on the country s reform agenda if the country is to accelerate its economic growth to required levels key reforms needed the bank has identified in its annual report for 2018 the key areas of failure by the government on this count incidentally they had all been promised in the government s first economic policy statement according to the central bank these failures have been in the areas such as measures for export promotion attraction of foreign direct investments or fdis reduction of budget deficits and debt levels reform of factor markets to make them more conducive for growth strengthening of the government s administrative machinery and observation of the rule of law the failure to undertake these structural reforms has not only contributed to the country s low economic growth but also made it a laggard among its peer countries this is observable when one compares sri lanka with bangladesh while sri lanka s average economic growth during 2014 18 has been at around 4 bangladesh had managed to maintain on average a growth rate of about 6 5 during this period despite many natural calamities political disputes and terrorist attacks no more cheap labour the bank has also noted that sri lanka no longer has cheap labour and a young labour force according to estimates made by the world bank in its sri lanka development update 2019 the country s working age population has peaked in 2005 and begun to decline since then thus the country can no longer enjoy the luxury of moving toward labour intensive industries such as apparel industry hence improvements in productivity and efficiency are a must for the country to move up from a middle income country to a rich country a feat known as beating the middle income trap the failure will result in trapping the country in the middle income category forever enhance value addition of exportable raw materials via advanced technology sri lanka has been exporting natural resources in raw material form and the bank in its recommendations has advocated for enhancing their value added so that the country could get not only better prices for same but also increase the overall export earnings but this requires the adoption of high technology to process these raw materials into value added products high technology in the very short run had to be acquired from countries that have developed it though the bank has not spelt it out one way to acquire high technology immediately has been the attraction of global companies to the country either as joint ventures or fdis when the country does so it has to choose products which have huge market potential in the future in an era where electrical vehicles are being promoted across the globe better and more efficient batteries will be demanded by users if sri lanka goes into partnership with an international company like tesla or panasonic it is possible for the country to tap this market easily in the medium to long run technology can be developed within the country by engaging its universities and research institutions in this connection sri lanka can learn a lesson or two from thailand which is presently on a move to increase its high tech production base to support this move its universities are competitively getting connected to high tech firms in china taiwan japan and south korea in addition to providing support services to local high tech companies wide reforms to promote trade competitiveness the increase in the earnings from the export of merchandise goods and services will enable the country according to the central bank to meet foreign exchange liabilities more confidently in the future for that purpose the bank has recommended that barriers to trade have to be removed in this respect the new trade policy announced by the government has called for wide reforms in the trade sector to promote the country s competitiveness this includes bringing the country to a uniform tariff regime by eliminating numerous tariff measures in force and para tariff that has been enforced a single simple tariff system will always help exporters to sell their goods and services to foreigners fdis to bring in new technology the bank has also recommended that fdis should be routed to more productive sectors in the economy sri lanka or for that matter any emerging economy in the world cannot have the luxury of attracting every type of fdis today this was the policy adopted by sri lanka in the initial phase of opening its economy to foreign investors it helped sri lanka to establish a world class apparel industry that provided an imitation effect to local entrepreneurs over the years it therefore contributed to the transmission of the export structure from predominantly agriculture based exports to manufacturing based exports now apparels are on shored or near shored however today it faces several challenges due to loss of cheap labour on the one hand and the presence of new competitor countries such as bangladesh and myanmar on the other the worst scenario has arisen due to new production systems adopted by apparel consuming western nations taking advantage of robotisation and automation both north america and western europe have begun to establish apparel factories on their own lands a system known as on shoring or re shoring as against off shoring that had ruled the world a few decades ago this has been strengthened by the need for having garments within a short delivery time like three to four days in this context garments produced by sri lanka will take about 30 days to be delivered to the market but the factories located close to the market in countries now known as near shoring such as turkey morocco in europe and mexico and honduras in north america will deliver them to the markets within a short time span thus sri lanka has no choice but to change from the present low tech production system to high tech production systems this has been cogently recommended by the central bank in its annual report for 2018 tear free understanding of cb reports one of the weaknesses in the central bank annual reports has been that they are presented in technical language not easily comprehensible by ordinary readers hence it is necessary to write commentaries on the annual report to facilitate tear free understanding despite these weaknesses they contain a wealth of information hence it will not be a waste of time if the top leaders of the government spend some time in perusing and understanding the messages that have been delivered in the report for 2018 w a

the sharp depreciation of the rupee against the dollar has been affecting a large number of people strengthening of the us dollars and its impact on the indian rupees since september 2017 is about 13 per cent indian rupee has depreciated about 11 per cent against the british pound since september 2017 and has depreciated by about 9 per cent against the canadian dollar since september 2017 depreciation of indian rupee has been a bit higher against these currencies compared to the previous years which has mostly affected people with expenses in foreign currencies for instance along with foreign travel education abroad is also getting more expensive several parents are taking the tough call of not sending their children abroad for higher studies it has affected more the people who already have children studying abroad as the depreciation of the rupee has increased the quantum of their education loan how does this affect you for students pursuing higher education in foreign countries such as the usa the expenses are incurred in dollars hence when the rupee falls the amount that needs to be paid in the dollar increases because of which the funding requirement also increases the effect of the fall in the rupee against the dollar also depends on the country where the student is pursuing his her education the rupee depreciation impact on a person varies depending upon the country they are going for higher studies a student going to countries like the usa australia and canada will be affected by the rupee depreciation against the us dollar and experts suggest they need to plan their finances well in advance other countries such as austria belgium germany and norway also offer quality education at subsidized rates which experts say can also be opted for ajay bohora co founder md and ceo of hdfc credila says currency fluctuation is only one of the many other parameters which students evaluate while taking a decision about the destination country for their higher education other important parameters like the quality of education in the destination country credentials of that particular university overall state of the economy immigration friendly policies for graduating students course curricula and availability of employment opportunities after the completion of the given course should also be noticed as important decision factors for the parents and students when they decide on the destination country for the given course what do you need to do parents funding for their child or students who are there by themselves need to re assess their financial situation at this point if they are low on funds to fund their expenses they should consider applying for an additional education loan secured education loans are generally linked to the cost of the collateral or to the cost of education these loans normally cover the full tuition fees as determined by the university along with all other living expenses you can also apply for another education loan even if you already have taken an education loan but need more money to fund your further education you can opt for this loan from the existing bank from where the previous loan was taken the second loan amount is calculated based on your current outstanding amount with the bank and the maximum loan amount that you can avail for example based on the collateral provided by you if you were eligible for a loan of rs 70 lakh and you had taken only rs 30 lakh out of which rs 10 lakh has already been paid back the total outstanding amount remains rs 20 lakh consequently your net eligibility will become rs 50 lakh rs 70 rs 20 lakh if however your loan requirement is not fulfilled by your current bank you can always look for other banks or nbfcs for funds experts suggest borrowers can either opt for a fresh loan from a new bank or apply for a transfer of the loan from the old to the new bank if you are opting for an additional loan from nbfcs like credila and avanse they come in the form of top up loans to re finance students the approval of these top up loans from nbfcs depends on whether the students meet their requirement or not you might also have to provide security coverage which varies from applicant to applicant and depends on your credit worthiness and merit interest rates for top up loans are generally higher than the existing loan rate and vary between 12 and 15 per cent it also depends on the prevailing loan interest rate and the collateral provided one can also look for scholarships to cope with high living and tuition fees which will reduce the tuition fees significantly

trade war update 2 monday s session saw market sentiment rebound slightly as the day wore on despite continued trade related tweets from president donald trump confirmation from chinese officials that scheduled talks in washington would resume as intended helped to partially alleviate some market concerns of an immediate escalation from china s perspective a break up in negotiations isn t really favourable for the domestic economy i think they want to get a deal one way or the other said yukio ishizuki senior currency strategist at daiwa securities the rebound in risk sentiment saw the greenback soften as the session progressed looking ahead it remains to be seen how the us china trade deal pans out if it does at all with talks in their final stages it could be make or break for us china trade relations it is still up in the air how the road to a trade deal will be but we believe a deal will be reached by the end of q2 the last bits left in the trade talks are also the most difficult wrote danske bank senior analyst mikael olai milh√∏j adding but one way or the other we expect the two sides to find a solution as the alternative of no deal would be very unattractive for countries nevertheless given trump s propensity for spontaneous outbursts investors should remain on high alert given the clear and immediate impact just a few hundred characters can have on global markets the weekend headlines were a reminder that geopolitical tape bombs continually lurk beneath the surface said mark mccormick north american head of fx strategy at td securities trade war update the risk averse onslaught continued at a lesser pace as monday s session progressed with the chinese yuan on track to register it s largest intraday drop in over 10 months while global equity markets continued to reel in the wake of resurgent trade war concerns the new zealand and australian dollars were also clear victims of the sell off hitting multi month and in the case of the aud multi year

weakest of the major currencies so far but a sustained escalation in trade tensions will certainly spillover into the g 10 space going forward european equities failed to escape the rout with a group of equities tumbling by nearly 2 in early trade advertisement while initially unclear whether trump s weekend tweets would deter chinese officials from progressing high stakes trade negotiations which are now in their final stages comments from chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang indicate the chinese team at least are expecting to continue talks this week we are also in the process of understanding the relevant situation what i can tell you is that china s team is preparing to go to the united states for the discussions said shaung speaking to cnbc ceo of berkshire hathaway which invests in a number of multinationals which do business in both china and the us including apple inc in which it has more than 50b invested warren buffett said a trade war between the us and china would be bad for the whole world buffett added that you re talking about two personalities who are very much used to getting their way in politics and talking about how they will be perceived in their own country in terms of their behaviour the early weekly session saw the us dollar surge against risk sensitive peer currencies including the australian dollar chinese yuan and a basket of asian fx and ems following comments by president of the us donald trump which look set to thrust us china trade tensions back to the fore despite seeming progress towards an overarching trade deal between the economic juggernauts while recent weeks has seen news flow surrounding the high stakes trade negotiations generally upbeat with suggestions that a mutually acceptable deal appeared to be close to fruition trump s tweets sent markets spiralling prompting a fresh wave of uncertainty to sap risk appetite before entering what was supposed to be the last round of trade talks trump threatens new tariffs on all of us imports from china it is a huge turn of events that adds renewed uncertainty to the outcome of the trade talks wrote danske bank chief analyst allan von mehren adding it may be that it is just a bluff and an attempt to squeeze out more of china but bullying rarely works on china and trump s threat could backfire for 10 months china has been paying tariffs to the usa of 25 on 50 billion dollars of high tech and 10 on 200 billion dollars of other goods these payments are partially responsible for our great economic results the 10 will go up to 25 on friday 325 billions dollars donald j trump realdonaldtrump 5 may 2019 of additional goods sent to us by china remain untaxed but will be shortly at a rate of 25 the tariffs paid to the usa have had little impact on product cost mostly borne by china the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no donald j trump realdonaldtrump 5 may 2019 currency wise the aussie dollar already on the back foot amid heightened expectations of an rba rate cut lost out heavily on market open with the us to australian dollar exchange rate spiking to an overnight high of au 1 4358 the australian dollar is often perceived as a gauge of chinese sentiment given the predominance of china as australia s primary trading partner the chinese yuan was also rocked lower by the tweets with

greenback since early october 2018 at the time of writing the usd to try exchange rate was last seen at try5 99774 after briefly breaching the 6 0 level in early trade also feeling the bite global equities were down in early trade with chinese stock markets down over 5 as markets reprice for the resurfacing potential for a full blown trade war in the wake of trump s market rocking tweets neither white house nor chinese officials were forthcoming over whether talks set to resume this week would continue the atmosphere of the negotiations has changed said a chinese official adding when asked if talks would proceed all that depends on the attitude of the united states the tweets come mere days after treasury secretary steven mnuchin called the latest round of talks in beijing productive with one white house official even hinting at a potential june meeting between presdeitns trump and xi jinping to finalise the deal elsewhere analysts were open to the possibility that trump s tweet could be a bluff to force better terms from chinese negotiators one with the potential to cause significant market repercussions head of international trade analysis raoul leering of ing wrote in our view trumps tweets are a negotiation strategy although trumps strategy is risky because the chinese could refuse to negotiate at gunpoint and decide to walk out on the trade talks both sides have invested too much political capital in the negotiations to let this happen trump plays hard ball there is still a question of whether this is one of the famous trump negotiation tactics or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs said nick twidale at rakuten securities if it s the latter we ll see massive downside pressure across all markets according to trump should a deal not be reached in the coming days 10 tariffs on 200b of chinese goods will be hiked to 25 on friday with a further 325b of goods set to see tariffs raised to 25 shortly looking at the next potential steps some analysts feel chinese officials could forgo talks this week which could lead to resurgent uncertainty china may very well decide to skip talks this week which could be the start of a new escalation of the trade war that would give a big hit to risk sentiment and could derail the brewing signs of recovery in the global economy wrote danske s mehren similarly tai hui asia pacific chief market strategist at j p morgan asset management wrote as we learnt a year ago beijing could be willing to walk away if the u s applies negotiation tactics that they don t agree with that said both sides have invested significant time and resources to come this far the coming days could prove decisive for whether or not we re set for fresh escalation of trade uncertainty which has so heavily weighed on the global economy over recent months or whether trump s tweets are merely a bluff to expedite the finalisation of a deal

for more project topics and materials visit abstract taxation and its product tax have been very important vehicles for economic policies of many countries of the world for a very long time tax has been a major source of revenue for various levels of governments for instance in nigeria the laws of the land stipulate the categories of taxes that are collect able by each of the three tiers of government this is with a view to enhancing basic economic growth and development at all levels of government however the manner in which taxes are administered on corporations in nigeria is a major concern to the majority of nigerians traditional schools of thought advocated the theory of low income tax rates influencing economic development whereas modern schools of thought propagated the theory of higher income tax rates producing greater economic growth especially for developed nations in order to justify these thoughts an attempt was made taking nigeria as a case study to pin point the effect of low and high income tax rates on economic growth of developing nations secondary data sources were utilized in this study in this study various parameters were taken into account including income tax rates income tax revenue total revenue and gdp of the country in the nominal and real value of the money it was located that high income tax rates negatively affect the economic growth of nigeria the study found that government s policies on income tax affect the revenue of corporations in the country it was concluded that tax regulation is very relevant in order for government to be able to act justly on the various sectors of the economy chapter one introduction 1 1 background of the study according to black law dictionary tax is a rate able portion of the produce of the property and labor of the individual citizens taken by the nation in the exercise of its sovereign rights for the support of government for the administration of the laws and as the means for continuing in operation the various legitimate functions of the state the institute of chartered accountants of nigeria 2006 and the chartered institute of taxation of nigeria 2002 view tax as an enforced contribution of money enacted pursuant to legislative authority if there is no valid statute by which it is imposed a charge is not tax tax is assessed in accordance with some reasonable rule of apportionment on persons or property within tax jurisdiction sanni 2007 5 advocated tax an instrument of social engineering which can be used to stimulate general or special economic growth the company income tax among st countries of the world varies especially in the developing countries gordon and wei li 2008 notes that to some extent these differences may simply reflect differences in social preferences for public vs private goods countries differ substantially for example in the amount spent on the military on infrastructure investments on publicly provided education or on social insurance higher spending levels require higher revenue leading to higher tax rates to some extent these differences may also reflect differences in the political support for redistribution more redistribution naturally requires higher tax rates on the rich in order to finance lower tax rates or transfers to the poor governments with a stronger preference for redistribution would rely more on progressive personal income taxes whereas other governments may choose less progressive personal taxes and make more use of proportional taxes such as a value added tax or a payroll tax other differences though are more puzzling based on conventional models of optimal tax structure regardless of a country s tastes for public vs private goods or for more or less redistribution diamond and mirrlees forecast that the optimal tax structure will preserve production efficiency under plausible assumptions coelho isaias and graham 2001 this rule out tariffs in any country that lacks market power in international markets it rules out differential taxes on goods produced domestically in one industry vs another atkinson and stiglitz 1996 go further and argue that as long as a country can flexibly choose the rate structure under the personal income tax then it has no reason to choose differential tax rates on the consumption of different goods not only does this rule out differential excise tax rates by good but it also rules out taxes on income from savings which implicitly impose higher tax rates on goods consumed further into the future regarding possible revenue from seignorage friedman 1999 argued that a country would optimally choose a deflation rate sufficient to generate a nominal interest rate close to zero so as to avoid any real costs of liquidity while these forecasts of no tariffs no taxes on capital income uniform taxes on consumption and deflation are not consistent with any existing tax structures they are not sharply inconsistent with observed tax policies among the most developed countries with gatt and now the wto tariffs are indeed very low among developed countries at this point nominal interest rates are very low among most developed countries even if deflation is rare while capital income is still subject to tax in various ways gordon kalambokidis and slemrod report evidence that the u s collects little or no net revenue from taxes on capital income and imposes relatively low distortions on investment and savings while even the richest countries maintain some important excise taxes e g on gasoline cigarettes and liquor an argument can easily be made that these specific taxes help internalize various consumption externalities tax policies in developing countries are much more puzzling however in light of these forecasts from the optimal tax models these differences are laid out in more detail in section i the corporate income tax is a much more important source of tax revenue among developing vs developed countries as are tariffs and seignorage poorer countries collect much less revenue from personal income taxes yet it seems puzzling that distributional preferences should systematically be so much weaker among poorer countries bird 1999 on net poorer countries collect on average only two thirds or less of the amount of tax revenue that richer countries do as a fraction of gdp yet given the severe needs for investments in say infrastructure and education in these countries is it plausible that the lack of revenue simply represents differing tastes for public vs private goods in poor vs rich countries one natural response to these differences between forecaster policies and those observed in developing countries is to conclude that the policies in developing countries should be changed newbery and stern for example set out the standard forecasts from optimal tax models as an ideal tax structure that developing countries should emulate this is also the basis for recommendations e g from the world bank and imf that developing countries should reduce their tariff and inflation rates and rely more on value added taxes with a uniform rate across industries rather than on excise taxes or corporate income taxes campillo marta and jeffrey 1997 in this study we explore whether the inconsistency between the forecasts from optimal tax models and the data reflects instead a problem with the models the starting point for our approach is the observation of greater tax enforcement problems in poorer countries according to the estimates reported in schneider and enste for example the informal economy on average is only about 15 of gdp among oecd countries and thus small enough that it should not be a driving factor in the choice of tax structure however among developing countries the median size of the informal economy they report is 37 of gdp ranging from 13 in hong kong and singapore to 71 in thailand and 76 in nigeria with such a large informal sector any effects of the tax structure or of government policies more generally on the size of the informal sector can be of first order importance in the choice of these policies yet at this point we know relatively little about how policies affect the size of the informal sector or why the informal sector is so much larger in developing than in developed economies diamond peter and james mirrlees 2001 it is in this respect that this present study shall examine the impact of company income tax revenue on developing economies using nigeria as a reference point 1 2 statement of the problem poorer countries have indeed shifted towards more use of the value added tax in recent years in part based on the advice and assistance of international organizations but otherwise the puzzling differences remain this leaves unanswered why poorer countries so systematically choose the wrong policies and why these wrong policies have remained so stable over time perhaps political economy problems are more severe among developing countries and some important domestic constituency gains from the policies that standard models find perverse yet these puzzling policies are found under many different types of governments drawing their support from many different constituencies coelho isaias and harris 2001 perhaps poorer countries lack the best enforcement methods e g based on modern information technology certainly computer technology helps pool information from different sources bird 1999 argues however that the key problem is acquiring reliable information not processing it in considering problems associated with income tax of developing economies problems statements like the following arises does government policy on company income tax affect the revenue of corporations in developing countries of what relevance is tax regulation on the development of companies in developing economies does effective income tax helps in the building strong economies 1 3 objectives of the study the main purpose of this study is to i to examine whether government s policies on income tax affect the revenue of corporations ii to examine the relevance of tax regulation on the development of companies in developing economies and iii to ascertain the impact of the company income tax revenue on the development of the nigeria economy 1 4 scope of study this study is to effectively make an in depth study on the impact of company income tax revenue on developing economies using nigerian economy as reference point this study will reveal the impact of taxation on revenue of organizations and as well focus on taxation policies and variances that occur among selected developing countries the duration for this study will cover a five year period 2004 2008 1 5 significance of study in this project work efforts will be made to examine companies income tax and organization s efforts at fulfilling their financial obligations this analysis will throw more light on the adequacy of revenue generation of companies and taxes imposed on such income generation however this study will be of great significance to shareholders investors and management of companies as it reveals the openness of standards of financial reporting practices it as well enable companies capitalizes on their gains while focusing on areas of comparative advantage also major beneficiaries of this study are auditors and accountants as well as financial analysts government personnel and the revenue taxation board will benefit from this study 1 6 limitation of the study in the process of writing this project the

and materials visit abstracttaxation and its product tax have been very important vehicles for economic policies of many countries of the world for a very long time tax has been a major source of revenue for various levels of governments for instance in nigeria the laws of the land stipulate the categories of taxes that are collect able by each of the three tiers of government this is with a view to enhancing basic economic growth and development at all levels of government however the manner in which taxes are administered on corporations in nigeria is a major concern to the majority of nigerians traditional schools of thought advocated the theory of low income tax rates influencing economic development whereas modern schools of thought propagated the theory of higher income tax rates producing greater economic growth especially for developed nations in order to justify these thoughts an attempt was made taking nigeria as a case study to pin point the effect of low and high income tax rates on economic growth of developing nations secondary data sources were utilized in this study in this study various parameters were taken into account including income tax rates income tax revenue total revenue and gdp of the country in the nominal and real value of the money it was located that high income tax rates negatively affect the economic growth of nigeria the study found that government s policies on income tax affect the revenue of corporations in the country it was concluded that tax regulation is very relevant in order for government to be able to act justly on the various sectors of the economy chapter oneintroduction1 1 background of the studyaccording to black law dictionary tax is a rate able portion of the produce of the property and labor of the individual citizens taken by the nation in the exercise of its sovereign rights for the support of government for the administration of the laws and as the means for continuing in operation the various legitimate functions of the state the institute of chartered accountants of nigeria 2006 and the chartered institute of taxation of nigeria 2002 view tax as an enforced contribution of money enacted pursuant to legislative authority if there is no valid statute by which it is imposed a charge is not tax tax is assessed in accordance with some reasonable rule of apportionment on persons or property within tax jurisdiction sanni 2007 5 advocated tax an instrument of social engineering which can be used to stimulate general or special economic growth the company income tax among st countries of the world varies especially in the developing countries gordon and wei li 2008 notes that to some extent these differences may simply reflect differences in social preferences for public vs private goods countries differ substantially for example in the amount spent on the military on infrastructure investments on publicly provided education or on social insurance higher spending levels require higher revenue leading to higher tax rates to some extent these differences may also reflect differences in the political support for redistribution more redistribution naturally requires higher tax rates on the rich in order to finance lower tax rates or transfers to the poor governments with a stronger preference for redistribution would rely more on progressive personal income taxes whereas other governments may choose less progressive personal taxes and make more use of proportional taxes such as a value added tax or a payroll tax other differences though are more puzzling based on conventional models of optimal tax structure regardless of a country s tastes for public vs private goods or for more or less redistribution diamond and mirrlees forecast that the optimal tax structure will preserve production efficiency under plausible assumptions coelho isaias and graham 2001 this rule out tariffs in any country that lacks market power in international markets it rules out differential taxes on goods produced domestically in one industry vs another atkinson and stiglitz 1996 go further and argue that as long as a country can flexibly choose the rate structure under the personal income tax then it has no reason to choose differential tax rates on the consumption of different goods not only does this rule out differential excise tax rates by good but it also rules out taxes on income from savings which implicitly impose higher tax rates on goods consumed further into the future regarding possible revenue from seignorage friedman 1999 argued that a country would optimally choose a deflation rate sufficient to generate a nominal interest rate close to zero so as to avoid any real costs of liquidity while these forecasts of no tariffs no taxes on capital income uniform taxes on consumption and deflation are not consistent with any existing tax structures they are not sharply inconsistent with observed tax policies among the most developed countries with gatt and now the wto tariffs are indeed very low among developed countries at this point nominal interest rates are very low among most developed countries even if deflation is rare while capital income is still subject to tax in various ways gordon kalambokidis and slemrod report evidence that the u s collects little or no net revenue from taxes on capital income and imposes relatively low distortions on investment and savings while even the richest countries maintain some important excise taxes e g on gasoline cigarettes and liquor an argument can easily be made that these specific taxes help internalize various consumption externalities tax policies in developing countries are much more puzzling however in light of these forecasts from the optimal tax models these differences are laid out in more detail in section i the corporate income tax is a much more important source of tax revenue among developing vs developed countries as are tariffs and seignorage poorer countries collect much less revenue from personal income taxes yet it seems puzzling that distributional preferences should systematically be so much weaker among poorer countries bird 1999 on net poorer countries collect on average only two thirds or less of the amount of tax revenue that richer countries do as a fraction of gdp yet given the severe needs for investments in say infrastructure and education in these countries is it plausible that the lack of revenue simply represents differing tastes for public vs private goods in poor vs rich countries one natural response to these differences between forecaster policies and those observed in developing countries is to conclude that the policies in developing countries should be changed newbery and stern for example set out the standard forecasts from optimal tax models as an ideal tax structure that developing countries should emulate this is also the basis for recommendations e g from the world bank and imf that developing countries should reduce their tariff and inflation rates and rely more on value added taxes with a uniform rate across industries rather than on excise taxes or corporate income taxes campillo marta and jeffrey 1997 in this study we explore whether the inconsistency between the forecasts from optimal tax models and the data reflects instead a problem with the models the starting point for our approach is the observation of greater tax enforcement problems in poorer countries according to the estimates reported in schneider and enste for example the informal economy on average is only about 15 of gdp among oecd countries and thus small enough that it should not be a driving factor in the choice of tax structure however among developing countries the median size of the informal economy they report is 37 of gdp ranging from 13 in hong kong and singapore to 71 in thailand and 76 in nigeria with such a large informal sector any effects of the tax structure or of government policies more generally on the size of the informal sector can be of first order importance in the choice of these policies yet at this point we know relatively little about how policies affect the size of the informal sector or why the informal sector is so much larger in developing than in developed economies diamond peter and james mirrlees 2001 it is in this respect that this present study shall examine the impact of company income tax revenue on developing economies using nigeria as a reference point 1 2 statement of the problempoorer countries have indeed shifted towards more use of the value added tax in recent years in part based on the advice and assistance of international organizations but otherwise the puzzling differences remain this leaves unanswered why poorer countries so systematically choose the wrong policies and why these wrong policies have remained so stable over time perhaps political economy problems are more severe among developing countries and some important domestic constituency gains from the policies that standard models find perverse yet these puzzling policies are found under many different types of governments drawing their support from many different constituencies coelho isaias and harris 2001 perhaps poorer countries lack the best enforcement methods e g based on modern information technology certainly computer technology helps pool information from different sources bird 1999 argues however that the key problem is acquiring reliable information not processing it in considering problems associated with income tax of developing economies problems statements like the following arises does government policy on company income tax affect the revenue of corporations in developing countries of what relevance is tax regulation on the development of companies in developing economies does effective income tax helps in the building strong economies 1 3 objectives of the studythe main purpose of this study is to i to examine whether government s policies on income tax affect the revenue of corporations ii to examine the relevance of tax regulation on the development of companies in developing economies andiii to ascertain the impact of the company income tax revenue on the development of the nigeria economy 1 4 scope of studythis study is to effectively make an in depth study on the impact of company income tax revenue on developing economies using nigerian economy as reference point this study will reveal the impact of taxation on revenue of organizations and as well focus on taxation policies and variances that occur among selected developing countries the duration for this study will cover a five year period 2004 2008 1 5 significance of studyin this project work efforts will be made to examine companies income tax and organization s efforts at fulfilling their financial obligations this analysis will throw more light on the adequacy of revenue generation of companies and taxes imposed on such income generation however this study will be of great significance to shareholders investors and management of companies as it reveals the openness of standards of financial reporting practices it as well enable companies capitalizes on their gains while focusing on areas of comparative advantage also major beneficiaries of this study are auditors and accountants as well as financial analysts government personnel and the revenue taxation board will benefit from this study 1 6 limitation of the studyin the process of writing this project the researcher encountered some

officer tom bene thomas l bene president and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us i d like to start off this morning with an overview of our third quarter performance and the discussion around our business segments and the key highlights for the quarter following that joel will cover the financial results in further detail overall we are pleased by our overall operating and financial performance for the third quarter we delivered improved year over year growth in line with our expectations and managed cost well including the ongoing cost savings associated with our business transformation initiatives the improved pace the performance for the second half of fiscal 2019 we previously spoke off is in fact taking shape and while we still have work to do we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted operating income growth target and now expect that to be at the low end of the 650 million to 700 million range joel and i will both elaborate on this further from a total sysco perspective our third quarter results include increased sales of 2 2 to 14 7 billion gross profit growth of 2 9 and adjusted operating expense decreased of 0 4 which translated into an adjusted operating income increase of 16 6 to 620 million and an adjusted earnings per share increase of 17 4 to 0 79 turning the us restaurant industry data the overall sales trends remain mixed according to black box and naftrack saw some choppiness throughout the quarter as march data was generally positive compared to february in part due to weather which negatively impacted february sales additionally same store sales were positive for the quarter although traffic once again declined however even with this recent choppy industry choppy industry performance the overall macro trends remained generally favorable for our customers as illustrated by continued low unemployment which was at 3 8 for march and strong gdp growth for the first quarter at 3 2 economic growth in the international markets in which we operate was mostly positive this includes modest growth in the food service sector although we continue to see the impacts of brexit on our uk business due to uncertainty and low consumer confidence in canada the consumer confidence index continues to rise with march seeing the third consecutive monthly increase with technomic forecasting the canadian food service industry to grow 0 6 in real terms or 4 1 on a nominal basis for calendar year 2019 additionally we continue to see reasonable overall trends in the other international markets where we do business as we discussed last quarter we anticipated seeing an increased benefit from our transformation initiatives beginning in the second half of this year and we began to see those benefits show up this quarter overall our results included a bit softer top line than expected offset by good overall expense management which delivered solid operating profit performance that was in line with our expectations examples of initiatives that are driving benefits from an expense management perspective include our field finance transformation and the corporate office administrative restructuring which we implemented last quarter as it relates to acquisitions in april we acquired j m wholesale meats and imperio foods two smaller central california distributors j m meats is a food service distributor that specializes in key center of the plate products and imperio foods carries dry canned good products which both are complementary to our existing broadline business in the central california area they also provide sysco with the opportunity to further extend our reach to the important hispanic customer segment we will begin to see the impact to our business in the fourth quarter from both of these acquisitions additionally in the quarter we made the decision to sell our iowa premium cattle processing business while our three year plan forecast included positive operating income for this business we believe the divestiture of this business is in alignment with our strategic priorities and allows us to focus on our core strength as a distributor the transaction will result in a reduction of planned operating income of approximately 25 million and is the reason for us now projecting to achieve the low end of our adjusted operating income growth range now i d like to transition to our third quarter results by business segment beginning with us foodservice operations sales for the third quarter were 10 1 billion an increase of 4 1 gross profit grew 5 1 including an improvement in gross margin of 18 basis points adjusted operating expenses grew 2 3 and adjusted operating income increased 10 total case volume within us broadline grew modestly at 2 1 for the quarter of which 1 3 was organic however we delivered relatively solid growth in our local business as local case growth was up 3 1 of which 2 2 was organic we are pleased with the gross profit growth we delivered for the quarter which was impacted by a number of factors including continued positive momentum from category management as we continue to deepen our relationships with our strategic supplier partners year over year favorability from the impact of inbound freight and continued growth in our sysco branded products which increased by 28 basis points with our local customers this quarter in addition the inflation rate for the quarter was 2 3 in us broadline up nearly a point in the second quarter of this fiscal year technology continues to be one of our fundamental enablers of growth as we transform our business to serve our customers in ways that best meet their needs we are continuing to provide new capabilities and tools to enable an improved experience of doing business with sysco including new ordering tools which has driven our e commerce ordering utilization to more than 53 with our local customers from a cost perspective within us foodservice operations our expense management was solid as adjusted operating expenses were 2 3 for the quarter while we continue to see supply chain cost challenges in the warehouse and transportation areas we are seeing positive momentum from our recruiting on boarding and retention initiatives these challenges were partially offset by continued improvement seen as a result of our routing optimization initiatives and ongoing process improvements furthermore our finance transformation and smart spending initiative have also provided benefits in the quarter moving on to international foodservice operations for the quarter sales decreased 1 5 gross profit decreased 3 1 adjusted operating expenses decreased by 5 8 and adjusted operating income grew 30 we saw solid overall performance in canada with strong top line growth and solid gross profit dollar growth of more than 5 driven in part by an inflation rate of 2 6 along with strong expense management partially benefiting from our ongoing regionalization efforts which are progressing well in europe we continue to have mixed results the uk continues to feel the effects of brexit uncertainty causing depressed consumer confidence however our brakes uk business continues to stabilize operationally as a result of our multi year initiatives to transform the business in france social unrest continues to impact tourism and consequently food away from home consumption our sales performance during the third quarter was adversely impacted by this unrest and by some operational challenges associated with integrating brakes france and davigel into sysco france that said the overall integration and supply chain transformation continues to be on track to deliver long term benefits that are part of our multi year plan as for our business in latin america we continue to see growth opportunities in this region both with our chain restaurant customers and with our expansion of cash and carry locations to complement our broad line footprint in both costa rica and panama moving on to sygma we continue to make disciplined choices in an effort to deliver improved profitability in q3 we saw expected softness in the top line due to transition customers while seeing gross margin increased by 28 basis points year over year solid expense management drove adjusted operating expenses down 7 1 versus prior year resulting in significantly improved operating performance in an effort to improve overall profitability in this important segment of the business we will continue to take a very disciplined approach to growth as we move forward lastly in our other business segment we ve recently announced the restructuring of gas supply as the industry landscape evolves we are focusing on optimizing our business model in creating a more focused and agile organization to better meet the changing needs of our customers the new operating structures created three distinct business units under the parent company guest worldwide the business units include gilchrist soames our amenity manufacturing unit manchester mills one of the world s leading textile producers and guest supply which serves the world s top hotel chains and independent properties in over 100 countries as a full spectrum distribution solution provider in summary we continue to feel good about the fundamentals of our business our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around enriching our customers experience doing business with sysco and we remain focused on engaging our 67 000 dedicated associates around the world to deliver against our financial objectives associated with our three year plan let me now turn the call over to joel grade our chief financial officer joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you tom and good morning everyone i d like to provide you with additional financial details surrounding our performance for the quarter as tom mentioned earlier we saw improved year over year results for the third quarter although we saw some softness in the top line our earnings reflect solid expense management and strong adjusted operating income growth which are in line with what we previously stated and our results of our enterprise wide transformational initiatives these initiatives which are designed to streamline efficiencies and allow us to reinvest in the business to facilitate continued growth include our finance transformation roadmap smart spending and the canadian regionalization initiative for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 total sysco sales grew 2 2 foreign exchange rates negatively affected total sysco sales by approximately 1 1 in our us broadline business we experienced 2 3 inflation driven by a few categories including the frozen potato poultry and meat categories and we are managing this modest increase in inflation well gross profit in the third quarter increased 2 9 and gross margin increased 14 basis points while adjusted operating expenses decreased by 0 4 resulting in strong adjusted operating income growth of 16 6 to 620 million changes in foreign exchange rates decreased adjusted operating income by 34 basis points although it will vary from quarter to quarter we are focused on maintaining the 150 basis point gap between gross profit dollars and operating expense dollars that we committed to as part of our three year plan in order to achieve our adjusted operating income growth target turning to earnings per share our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 0 12 to 0 79 per share our eps results this quarter were impacted by our strong operating income adjusted tax rate foreign exchange impact and stock option exercises i d now like to discuss our tax rate for the quarter the gaap effective tax rate of negative 2 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily attributable to the determination made during the quarter to recognize the favorable impact of 95 million of foreign tax credits generated as a result of distributions to sysco from our foreign operations at the end of fiscal 2018 our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21 looking to our fourth quarter we would expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23 to 25 range now turning to cash flow cash flow from operations was 1 4 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 which is 244 million higher compared to the prior year period pre cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 was 1 billion which was 233 million higher compared to the prior year the improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to last year s pension contribution partially offset by cash taxes and the impact to working capital from an increase in day sales outstanding net capital expenditures totaled 367 million for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 which was 10 8 million higher compared to the prior year period for the full year fiscal 2019 we now expect the capital expenditure forecast of approximately 1 1 of sales down slightly from our previously stated 1 2 that said there are no changes to the prioritize order of capital allocation which is as follows investing in the business consistently growing our dividend participating in m a and a balanced approach to share buybacks and paying down debt as tom mentioned earlier with the anticipated sale of iowa premium we expect to achieve our target at the low end with 650 million to 700 million range as a result of our planned operating income being decreased by 25 million in summary we saw improved year over year results for the third quarter led by a continued momentum from improved underlying business performance solid local case growth and good cost management that said we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives of our three year plan although we remain confident in our ability to achieve these objectives we are committed to serving our customers and delivering at a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term operator we are now ready for q a questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question is from christopher mandeville from jefferies your line is open christopher mandeville jefferies analyst hey good morning can you speak to the gross margin improvement in the quarter and maybe help us understand those referenced impacts by order of magnitude and then tom or joel as it relates to private label penetration it was again expansion but it was one of the lower rates we ve seen in recent quarters so maybe you could kind of help us understand that as to whether or not it was an anomaly and we can return back to that 50 bps to 60 bps of expansion going forward or any color would be appreciated joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure chris good morning it s joel yes i think the way i ll think about that again it s truly balanced across some of the levers outside but i mean certainly our continued opportunities in our sysco brand certainly are a strong driver as well as continuing category management efforts and we continue this again obviously this is not one when it was five years ago when we had this giant year over year jump but the reality of it is we continue to enhance our relationships with our suppliers and we continue to drive our category management as well across our again our business and so i think those are some of the areas that s certainly are driving again inaudible the margin percentage but yeah i m really talking about what we think about most and that is our gross profit dollars we obviously also have some favorable inaudible inflation in our world clearly it s something that ultimately certainly in the moderate range it s at today is a good driver of opportunities again to move to continue to push cost of goods through to our customers and so that s certainly beneficial in terms of the dollars and gross profit and i would say it s not necessarily at the levels of that detrimental really again it s the composite that i think we manage we re managing this cost of goods inflation well and i think that s really really going to be a factor this is yes this comp inflation inaudible in our warehouse in terms where this thing now functions best so i don t really say those are still the main drivers of what we re looking at here and just in general some of the tools that you heard about in the past in terms of again revenue management continue to help us to drive our margins in a positive way thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey chris this is thomas just maybe two other things that i reinforce as well we didn t get some positive year over year benefit on the inbound freight side which is we ve talked in the past doesn t impact gross margin and then your specific question around sysco brand and we look at 28 basis point improvement is a very positive number still as long as that continues to move in the right direction that s a reflection for us so but a couple of things one our customers still reacting positively to all sysco brand and two we continue to bring innovative ideas and solutions to the market so we have to view that to be a solid number well it might be a little less on the growth than you ve seen in a couple of other quarters it s still early good number christopher mandeville jefferies analyst okay and then just my final question would be as you brought it up your inflation what should we ll be expecting in the coming quarter and if there s a willingness would you guys be able to disclose organic case growth quarter to date joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and so i mean i think the just on your question on inflation i mean i think certainly our forecast is we continue to see i ll say moderate levels of inflation as we as we move forward certainly over the next couple of quarters there s nothing that jumps out necessarily that would be really significant in terms of the overall inflation numbers so i don t think we expect certainly additional again moderate levels of inflation over the next couple of quarters organic case growth but i think that was part of the us foodservice sales 2 2 was the overall number that was organic thomas l bene president and chief executive officer but you re asking year to date right chris and that s joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes christopher mandeville jefferies analyst quarter to date thomas l bene president and chief executive officer quarter to date numbers ok christopher mandeville jefferies analyst yes just joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so christopher mandeville jefferies analyst if i strip out some of the noise from weather and what have you and maybe expect the calendar shift for easter as well joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i think so when you talk about there is local our local case volume for the quarter was the question i was answering was 2 2 it was organic total case volume organically was 1 3 inaudible christopher mandeville jefferies analyst but is there any real comment for april thomas l bene president and chief executive officer not really i mean we continue to were off i think we feel good about the continued momentum of the business and i don t use anything necessarily easter there was a bit of an easter shift but not a big shift given the timing of when it fell last year in the quarter versus this year christopher mandeville jefferies analyst okay thanks guys joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes operator your next question comes from the line of edward kelly from wells fargo your line is open edward kelly wells fargo analyst yes hi guys good morning thomas l bene president and chief executive officer good morning edward kelly wells fargo analyst can i i want to start with opex and i was hoping that you could give us a little bit of help here i mean obviously you had a big quarter from a cost perspective maybe just dig in a little bit more related to the drivers and i m asking this question because i think a lot of the accelerated efforts that you guys have been talking about weren t supposed to be at a full run rate this quarter so i m just trying to figure out how we think about opex going forward and then as part of this q4 s comparison looks pretty hard i think at workers comp benefit last year at the lap ph can you get to that 1 5 spread in q4 joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer well i ll start ed i mean i think a couple of things i would say to that number one i ll maybe take the last point first 1 5 point spread obviously in and i think it s in my prepared comments is it s something we looked at over the course of the three year plan that doesn t mean that necessarily every quarter is going to look the same some actually higher some actually possibly will be more as obviously we ve seen in both here i think the way i would look at it though i mean again as we did signal we do anticipate some improved performances in the second of the year obviously some of these plans have started kick in from our finance technology roadmap smart spending work the canadian regionalization some of the other administrative class work that we did around some of our corporate office transitions i think the again we feel good about our those things kicking in as we said in the second half this year as we head into the next year as well i would also call out just again overall our operating performance continues to be pretty strong and the expense line that s a good face of actually we had some a little bit of a few headwinds this particular quarter and that was about 0 03 a case so i mean we had i think question is do you expect this to continue in these areas i do to your point there are some headwinds that we re anticipating that we re going up against in the fourth quarter but certainly as we ve talked about here for a little while we certainly anticipated our leverage in the second half of the year to be better than first half and i think we certainly start to see that edward kelly wells fargo analyst okay and then just a follow up on capex so the capex guidance is down a bit can you just talk a bit about what s driving that i don t know if iowa premium has anything to do with it and how sustainable rate of sort of 1 1 will be going forward joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer well i mean i again i the way i always look at that i mean number one it s not bad inaudible forecast but i mean in reality if it is we spend our capex make our investments based truly underneath of the business there s been absolutely no change in terms of our perspective on our capital allocation priorities that always start with investing in our business we re obviously very committed to doing that we ve got a lot of change programs and if things transitioning our organization will continue to require investment i would just tell you from a timing perspective some of those things happened again at things do move around in the businesses in some ways so some of that probably timing versus anything but i will definitely not take away that there is some change in terms of the way we re looking at forecasting our capex we just yes we just adjust spending an investment in terms of the needs of business edward kelly wells fargo analyst great thanks guys thomas l bene president and chief executive officer thanks ed operator your next question comes from the line of karen short from barclays your line is open karen short barclays capital analyst hi thanks first thing i do want to ask was in terms of the composition of the now i guess kind of 650 million is there any change to this the breakout between gross profit and then the supply chain versus the admin joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer no karen so there is not that was just we only shifted that was related to the demonstrated sales of business but no there is no bucketing difference if you will karen short barclays capital analyst okay and then the same question i just want to ask i know you have obviously mentioned and you have been mentioning positive same store sales but traffic weakness so i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about trends with traffic and i guess same store sales on a true like mom and pop local basis in terms of the independent versus kind of the micro chains any patterns or differences you could point to there thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes good morning karen this is tom i mean look i think we ve seen certainly some choppiness this quarter particular and i think there are probably a bunch of different things driving that but it depends really on what source you look at i mean npd would call out that well overall spend is up traffic is up in some areas as well and down in others and black box and naftrack as they re probably more a little bit more consistent and they called traffic down really across most of the segments so i think it s driven by everything from some weather choppiness in q3 our q3 and mostly in february and then i think again kind of consumer efforts during that time the small chains seem to be doing a little bit better so that s going to be kind of micro chains and then the pure independents at least in this quarter according to npd tend to be a little bit softer but i wouldn t say from our perspective we have seen necessarily any major difference in trend line that we ve experienced over the last couple of quarters so we continue to feel like this independent growth that we ve had in that sector is doing well and then we continue to feel pretty confident in our ability to continue to grow and take share in that space karen short barclays capital analyst okay and then just last housekeeping and corporate came in on a dollar basis so a lot higher than i was i would have expected given the layoffs that you d announced i don t know if that s just an allocation issue or what because i would have thought on the dollar basis it would have been quite a bit down sequentially in year over year joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean when you re talking about the last kind of the specifically corporate layoffs inaudible again part of we re talking in total new administrative cost karen short barclays capital analyst yes joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer obviously there s a lot of things that are part of what we say our finance psychology roadmap that are very much fueled focused and so in fact one of the things we talked about in the first half year is that there were again why don t we feel confident about this inaudible by notification the sizable number of our field personnel and so i would tell you i think the majority which you re seeing is pretty is probably even more fuel focused than the corporate franchise balanced between the two karen short barclays capital analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of andrew wolf from loop capital markets your line is open andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst good morning wanted to follow up on the cadence of sales question that people asked about you guys said january was strong on a good weather comparison february a bit not good should we take away from there sort of march and april of somewhat normalized i mean people trying to get were obviously trying to get sense of whether the industry has slowed or not year over yea sort of and on a normalized basis thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes i think we would say that that s we feel like certainly things since the weather impacts in the early part of the quarter things have stabilized andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst and i noticed you gave us i may have missed this but i heard a technomic s forecast for canada do you have one for the us that you might be able to share with us thomas l bene president and chief executive officer as you know technomic kind of gets out ahead off and they do it by quarter kind of by sorry by some segment i may have that information which should i i have but i can get it to you we maybe need to get back to you on that but we generally do have that information andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst okay and i just had one other question unrelated sales so in the you took a 35 million charge that was related to the a change in the business technology strategy so could you expand a little upon that what the changes in your business expand business technology strategy thomas l bene president and chief executive officer so just can you clearer inaudible excuse me ask the question little more clearly andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst of the 72 million charges you excluded out of operating expense and 35 million was allocated for what you call the change in business technology strategy is that basically go into the cloud and could you expand on so we can understand a little better thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes and some of that is also got kind of a variety of things when there was actually an accelerated position we took in europe that was related also to a technology change so i mean yeah there s been a few things that again and that number also it just accelerated our g a a little bit but i wouldn t say there s one thing that is fell into there are a number of things that are just parts of our technology strategy they are included in that number and there s not necessarily one big thing there and there is not one thing i would inaudible to take away would not be that we somehow have a significant change in technology because we do not there s just a variety of things going on andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst and that was what i was trying to get to so appreciate it thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes think of it is more specifically around the finance transformation which is the technology component of it and then the european work we ve been doing where we had and erp in france that we ve been updating and so those are the two main drivers of it andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst thank you joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes operator your next question comes from the line of marisa sullivan from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst great good morning thanks for taking the question i just wanted to touch on fuel quickly and you call it that there was a slight headwind in the third quarter how should we think about fuel in the fourth quarter as it impacts your expense joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i can on fuel side i d anticipate some of those continued headwinds as we headed into the fourth quarter and probably a little bit in as we head into the next year as well marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you and then just we haven t heard you guys talk about category management a while on these calls please i m wondering was there anything you guys were doing differently in the third quarter that kind of made it a greater impact anything that you re planning for the fourth quarter as we should think about gross margin in catman thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey marisa it s tom no i wouldn t say anything unique i think what we re just trying to highlight is we continue to it s an ongoing process it has been now for years and we re starting to do some deeper work with some of our more strategic supplier partners and think about inaudible is some potentially long term benefits as we began to partner more deeply with some suppliers marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you and are you seeing any impacts or any customer feedback on category management are they liking what you re doing or is it are they having to adjust through assortment changes thomas l bene president and chief executive officer no i think we re at a point now where it s early early days so kind of a few years ago now i think we because we were changing some suppliers in some areas or products that was creating some choppiness so we ve actually continued to have a very good feedback from our customers around the work we re doing in catman obviously that drives cost benefit for them they re very excited about that and as i mentioned we are getting more focused on strategic partnerships so that we can have more consistent supply for the long term so generally it s very positive marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of judah frommer from credit suisse your line is open judah frommer credit suisse analyst hi thanks for taking the question maybe first just on the changes to guidance related to iowa premium i think you said it s the entire kind of reduction in guidance is due to iowa premium but if we re stripping 25 million out obviously that s not necessarily the low end so when you say the low end are you saying 650 million to 675 million effectively joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i think and here s they way i would think about that judah i think what we talked about really inaudible really around the midpoint of the range and so if you do 650 million to 700 million that will be 675 million really we re talking about here is a 25 million related iowa premium and yes that is the only adjustment to our guidance at this point which takes us from that midpoint down to that lower end of the range judah frommer credit suisse analyst okay that s helpful and switching gears i thought you said that that freight was a tailwind on the inbound side in q3 is that right are you telling us that you re actually getting a benefit there or that it was less of a headwind year over year and any commentary around kind of the freight situation and driver shortages and ability to retain drivers lately would be helpful thomas l bene president and chief executive officer sure just remember we have separated a couple of things here so inbound is our gross margin and i did mention that we had some year over year positive impact of that again because later year ago we were still dealing with quite a few challenges related inbound freight so how to think about it is it has gotten better we re not feeling that kind of impact and there was a piece of that gross margin improvement that was driven by that this year as it relates to outbound we continue to have certainly we ll be managing now i think better than we were a year ago as well but we still have challenges from a transportation perspective although albeit i think the work that we re doing around recruiting and retention is much improved and we are seeing positive impacts across our operations versus a year ago in that regard joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes judah just one thing i d just to add i think i would characterize the inbound freight as less of a headwind and not necessarily a benefit in other words we ve there was some level of resetting in the overall structure that happened and but relative to tom s point to where we were at last year we re really up against the some real major challenges we have less a headwind this year we have to think about that judah frommer credit suisse analyst great thanks operator your next question comes from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim securities your line is open john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst so tom maybe 18 months ago you guys selectively added mas in a few markets so how are they performing and then if you think about the opportunity on the share side is there an opportunity today to go out and redirect some of the cost savings into more ma hiring to try to drive more share or is that not productive thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey good morning john appreciate the question so i would say first of all well feel really good about the work we did around mas a little over year ago and if you recall when talked about it back then when we have really focused on was a few tools that enabled us to do a better job of understanding where biggest opportunities were and then applying those resources to those specific geographies or areas and so we continue to believe that that targeted approach and because i think over time it s so it s not as much just about adding mas for the sake of adding mas it s about adding them where we now know we have the biggest opportunity to succeed and so we ll continue to selectively do that and we re candidly all the time evaluating our territories in each of our opportunity areas and that may yet encourage us to shift in certain areas versus others but i would say just outright adding a bunch more mas for the sake of that is not really our strategy we continue to see our territory size get a little bit larger as we are able to provide the marketing associates with more tools and support we talk a lot about the tools and support that we offer our customers on that side of the business and we continue to do i think a really nice job of building out those capabilities whether that be things like menu planning analysis for our business review process where we have our chefs engaged so i think we re continuing to focus those total resources on the local side of the business not just the marketing associate but leveraging the mas to bring these other kind of tools and capabilities that we build behind them to the market john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst and then if you guys started to give what to when you provide the next plan right what s the timeframe for that and is the idea another three year plan or sort of shift to a year by year outlook thomas l bene president and chief executive officer i don t think we haven t made a call on that yet john and so we re i think we re still working through ourselves to what s the best approach and so i d say kind of more to come we ll certainly talk with you all on where place we want to do that john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst okay thank you thomas l bene president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of ajay jain from pivotal research group your line is open ajay jain pivotal research group analyst yes hi i know you guys don t typically comment on case growth internationally in time you did mention in the prepared comments that top line in canada is really strong and then you also talked about some of the challenges in france and the uk but is there any way you can give some directional commentary about organic case growth internationally specifically for canada the uk and the rest of europe sequentially and year over year thomas l bene president and chief executive officer honestly ajay i think its part of the challenge for us in certain areas the way we are still i would say managing through that transition the cases that we talked about in the us and the consistency that we can provide you guys does not exist in that business yet and so potentially over time we might be in a place to do that but today the way we still account for the sales and the way we think about the cases of the pounds of the units that we sell in different parts of the world are not on a kind of on a consistent basis what i did say and i will reinforce here we did have a strong top line growth in canada and what we said in europe is look we had a couple of things going on in europe that are impacting us certainly that the uk and everything with brexit has created some choppiness over there our sales are positive it s just that they re not they re not growing at the rate we would like them to or we want them to at this point and then in france look i think we all thought the unrest that was going on the social unrest of france would have by now certainly clear and it just has not and while that s it s not a huge impact as that s a big country there are certainly still some things going on there that are creating issues for our customers and there for us getting products to them so long way of saying i think we still feel generally good about those businesses we would have like to see a little more top line growth in europe in this last quarter and that s kind of built into my prepared comments driving that overall numbers we feel good about the us numbers and certainly about canada we just don t have the information in a way that we feel like it s easily providable to you guys ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay thank you would it be possible to confirm how much you ve allocated for severance in q3 and year to date i think there were some kind of breakdown provided last quarter for canada and europe but i m just wondering if there s any update on severance that includes us foodservice and also wondering if you can give your outlook for severance for q4 joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer ajay there s volumes to that i mean they re non gaap rest i mean we do have a fair amount of details that is probably the best i d be able to give you here in terms of spilling that out again obviously if you think about the areas certainly really across our business we ve had a little bit finance technology roadmaps certainly we talked about at corporate here in the us side obviously the canada regionalization some of the work being done freight in terms of those programs i mean obviously again some of that i think you ll see fallout in some of our non gaap direct but i think that s inaudible the best to view that and the only thing i would say is obviously there s some pretty sizable numbers in there particularly last quarter as it relates to europe obviously that was well not all inclusive if i would say that was obviously the biggest majority what s going to come there in at least in that part of the world ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay and in terms of the impact from the recent headcount restructuring will that be more reflected in q4 or was the majority of that allocated in q3 joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean i think the majority again the majority of that is actually going to be in within q2 but then also here in q3 so i wouldn t expect that a lot of that which reflected in q4 obviously the benefits we were starting to realize here as we talked about in the second half of the year as we head into next year ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay i had one final question if i can i think you ve made some adjustments in the financials for accelerated depreciation year to date i m not sure if there was any impact in q3 itself but i thought at this point you should have cycled the technology restructuring plan from a few years ago and maybe i can get some clarification offline but i thought conceptually at this point there should be any residual impact from the sap accelerated depreciation unless your year to date adjustments are for europe or unrelated to the previous joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i wouldn t think about it that way i mean we actually had some d a in particularly on d side volume increased this quarter that was related to i would call accelerated depreciation in europe for the most part there s some as tom referred to this earlier there are some of the technology changes we re making over there that again allowed us to actually accelerate some depreciation there and so the majority of the depreciation increase you re seeing is related to some technology transitions in europe but it s not related to what you re talking about before in terms of the inaudible here in the us ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vincent sinisi from morgan stanley your line is open vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst hey great good morning guys thanks very much for taking my questions wanted to just go back to the choppiness in the top line in the domestic business obviously as you said a few times it seems like more kind of february and weather specifically but just wondering was there a lot of variability that you could see by region another way of asking was it basically the weather and largely february the way to think of it or were there any other factors that might just be worth us knowing thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes i would say nothing that was inconsistent with what you just said i mean i think we just when i talked about weather we saw certain parts of the country where there were more impacts than others so i wouldn t say nothing else beyond that that we saw vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay and then just on i appreciate the color on the iowa premium versus the three year plan but as you had this quarter very nice expense control just kind of curious more from like a high level perspective like with the buckets that you are getting more the kind of cost cuts efforts pulled to date how much kind of lead time or planning is there with some of the levers that you had to pull kind of said in another way like kind of how much quarter by quarter planning or impact or not is there any kind of way to think about that thomas l bene president and chief executive officer maybe i ll start and then let joel chime in if you think about the way our business operates we have regular operating expense which is generally built into the businesses that is going to have probably a pretty consistent cadence depending on volume and our top line being a big driver right so there s a lot of that s driven by cost per unit in addition we ve talked about big strategic initiatives like finance transformation like canada regionalization like smart spending that we have planned out and we believe we have a good use to win those impacts will be happening and then we have things like our last quarter when we announced the corporate restructuring that s more of a one time event where we would see that coming into the business so a long way of saying it i think generally speaking our operating expense moves with our business performance meeting our volume and then and certainly any headwinds or tailwinds we see in the business fuel being a great example of headwind we re feeling right now certainly things like driver and warehouse turnover in the past and just a low employment rates driving higher cost of some of those roles in the company but everything else is generally planned out and we have visibility to that except for these one timers does that get what you re asking vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst yes no that was very helpful and did get out of it thank you tom thomas l bene president and chief executive officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of john ivankoe from jpmorgan your line is open john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst hi thank you i wanted to follow up on some comments that were made about maybe independent restaurants being a little bit softer in the march quarter i mean whether we adjust for weather or not and i mean the context of the question really what i m getting at is have you seen a significant rate of openings for independent restaurants in other words your addressable customer base maybe over the last 12 months and considering the amount of labor pressure that independent restaurants are facing and just margins which were in general lower than chains are you actually seeing a pickup in closures on the independent side that s noteworthy even on like a very market specific basis thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey john good morning look i wouldn t say anything that s unique that s happened there i mean as you we all know in this industry you ve got a lot of new business coming online all the time and you also have folks that are closing i don t wouldn t say we have seen any dramatic shift in that area as i mentioned the different data sources have some mixed information but all of them generally talk about positive spend dollars being up in that kind of 2 5 to 3 5 range and then you have traffic generally down with the exception of npd which is showing slight increase in traffic so i don t think there s anything unique or anything in this quarter that we ve seen that is highly different than what we ve seen in the past quarters john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst and is there anything to note by category or by regional that you re beginning to see and obviously you might think there s a lot of questions that are being asked you of whether you think there s a slowdown and i think the answer at least as it stands today is no but when you look at different categories or different regions is there anything interesting that you re seeing in the marketplace a little bit more detail either positive or negative that you can basically talk about now that gives us i guess a little somewhat of a forecast of the future from sysco s perspective as opposed to some of the third party sources that you use for your data thomas l bene president and chief executive officer not really i mean there s nothing else that i would tell you that we re seeing is any different john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst understood thank you thomas l bene president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of kelly bania from bmo capital your line is open kelly bania bmo capital analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions just going back to expenses again it seems like there was a good amount of upside at least in our model on the international can we think about the performance this quarter i think it was down about 30 million year over year is that kind of the right run rate to think about for the next few quarters international and then maybe can you tie in just the impact of the corporate restructuring on the expense performance this quarter joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes kelly i ll start and i think the answer to that is i mean obviously we re continuing to do a lot of work there as to streamline and make our operations more efficient i guess i d say there is some run rate consistency there but right i would also tell you is that i mean there is inaudible a lot of moving parts right now in some of our international business what i would not necessarily tie it to one of the things we talked about in the past is the sizable transformation we re doing in france i think the majority of that benefit really we start to see next year so i would not tie a lot of that necessarily to the sort of that the restructuring that we re doing in our french business but i would say generally speaking i think it s i mean it s fair to continue to see that as a relative run rate realizing again we just got a lot of moving parts over there that in terms of transformation we re doing so i guess my answer is generally is yes but again there is just realize things are not going to move around quarter to quarter based on the amount of stuffs we got moving around in that business kelly bania bmo capital analyst okay that s helpful and maybe just in terms of the us broadline business can you talk a little bit about some of the specialty meat and produced some of the categories that aren t necessarily part of the normal case growth and what kind of trends you re seeing in those other areas of the us business thomas l bene president and chief executive officer sure this is tom kelly good morning i think we continue to feel really good about our specialty company strategy as we ve talked for a few years we know that our customers truly value broadline but they also have these oftentimes they can be better met by some specialty companies and in our case meat seafood poultry and that side and then the produced freshpoint and so i think we continue to feel really good about overall what we bring to the market and the value proposition we have there we ve been working on ways of even helping our customers to make that easier for them to procure products both from sysco and from the sysco specialty companies and we re seeing benefits of that as well and so creating the environment where it s easier for them to kind of do business with both of those entities as they need to and as they feel like they want to and so versus the feeling maybe like two or three different companies with they re doing business with the idea that they can do business with one sysco and then get the value out of that so we continue to believe that s an important part of the market and we continue to feel really good about the work we re doing there kelly bania bmo capital analyst thank you thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes operator your final question comes from the line of bob summers at buckingham your line is open bob summers buckingham analyst hey good morning guys so i just wanted to dig a little deeper into the transportation dry van spot rates have been contracting all year so can you maybe talk about how that flows through in your business either by talking about the percent of business that you do at the spot rate maybe talk about how that spot rate influences contract rates as you may be threatened to move more to the spot market and then lastly how that impacts what you have to pay your drivers thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey bob again getting back to this conversation about transportation and cost the piece you re really referring to is the inbound freight part for us which does hit our gross margin and we called out in the prepared comments and we ve talked a bit here this morning about that we are seeing some year over year improvement benefit there it s not huge and it s not something that is a major driver for us but the market has come down certainly from where it was a year ago and obviously everybody benefits from that we obviously try to minimize the spot market because when that that s the one that gets the most out of whack the fastest and that s what happened a year ago so we continue to manage that side of our business mostly with contracts but yes it certainly as that whole market comes down that affects both sides the spot and contract side and as it relates to our drivers as we said i think we ve done a lot of work around both recruiting and retention and the way we re operating our business to improve as much as we can our driver retention and so we feel better about where we re at than we were year ago but it continues to be a challenging part of the business and i think will be as long as of the markets the way it is meaning unemployment s low and there s a lot of freight on the road so we feel a much better where we are now than we were a year ago but that doesn t mean that we don t still have ongoing challenges associated with hiring and retention of drivers bob summers buckingham analyst okay thanks thomas l bene

it is difficult to say that there is an arab spring or something similar in venezuela i think there is rather an unconventional style of war against the country that has been going on since the arrival of former president hugo chavez to presidential power we are talking about more than 20 years of bolivarian socialism in the country since then the us has sought to increase economic hardship by disrupting the product market and triggering artificial inflation indeed the venezuelan opposition sought to experiment in 2014 and 2017 with the characteristics of colour revolutions similar to those that took place in kiev between 2013 and 2014 the aim was to contribute to this unconventional war the number of victims in the violent demonstrations that left more than 600 injured and 39 dead disgusted the population and failed to convince people of the illegality of the state regency the financial military and paramilitary influence from abroad was insufficient so the overthrow of the venezuelan government has been impossible i believe that from that perspective the people of venezuela have adopted a social conscience that day after day is becoming more like the one that the people of cuba have had in more than 50 years of blockade on both sides of nicaragua there seems to be a new attempt to change the government under the format of revolution of colours let us remember that nicaragua for its part has been intervened by the us on several occasions and that important geopolitical and geostrategic interests are at stake there from my point of view insurgency 2 0 is part of a continuous operation of the resurrection of the condor plan as for colombia a country neighbouring venezuela i do not think it will experience a colour revolution for several reasons the colombian opposition is not pro western it has no foreign military and financial support they adopt a progressive line contrary to sharp s theoretical principles and as if that were not enough the violence of the demonstrations is encouraged by the colombian state and not by the demonstrators massively violating the human rights of the people as a whole if things get more serious in colombia the revolution will be totally different and i think it could be very violent following more than 60 years of civil war sputnik the mainstream media is intensively covering juan guaid√≥ but very little is said about his political program how competent is he as a politician which reforms can be carried out if he comes to power in your opinion which external or internal political forces support guaid√≥ who can benefit from him coming to power david lopez torres i don t think juan guaido has a political project for the country or at least a socially holistic project for venezuela just by seeing who supports guaido in the media we can conclude that there is a clear intention to create a parallel government in venezuela that responds to washington s interests a non existent parallel government outside the standards of international law that has been falling and burning the self proclaimed president for lack of total internal and external support if juan guaido or any other us backed candidate came to power the important and recognised social achievements of the governments of hugo chavez and the current president of the republic nicolas maduro could be overthrown the question is if he doesn t have a political project for venezuela what is mr guaido looking for i think that looking at it from a psychological point of view the individual is eager to get out of that conflict that is becoming uncontrollable he is one more piece of ammunition an agent placed by the instances of power managed by the most powerful countries in the world by being all in the same line to administer what they can possibly plunder from venezuela waiting for orders that compromise it in addition to eradicating any vestige of socialist ideology that seeks structural change in countries and rejects interference it is purely a class struggle to this we cannot forget from outside the hands of the european union the oas paramilitary groups and drug trafficking supported by √°lvaro uribe v√©lez and iv√°n duque in colombia mario abdo ben√≠tez in paraguay sebasti√°n pi√±era in chile mauricio macri in argentina and jair bolsonaro in brazil more discreetly but increasingly present in the destabilising factor in venezuela we can even perceive the government of lenin moreno in ecuador inside there is a big division of the opposition that does not have a political project either and that does not support guaido or the military intervention guaido has lost so much strength that not even the imf recognises him as interim president the venezuelan situation is slowly getting out of hand for donald trump who faces presidential elections next year with little popularity and the urgency of appropriating venezuelan resources to argue his good offices as us president i do not think he is going to stand idly the soft coup d etat continues and today more than ever

by lance roberts wow that is all i could utter as my brain spun listening to an interview with chamrath palihapitiya on cnbc last week i don t see a world in which we have any form of meaningful contraction nor any form of meaningful expansion we have completely taken away the toolkit of how normal economies should work when we started with qe i mean the odds that there s a recession anymore in any western country of the world is almost next to impossible now save a complete financial externality that we can t forecast it is a fascinating comment particularly at a time where the federal reserve has tried unsuccessfully to normalize monetary policy by raising interest rates and reducing their balance sheet however an almost immediate upheaval in the economy not to mention reprisal from the trump administration brought those efforts to a halt just a scant few months after they began a quick google search on chamrath revealed a pretty gruesome story about his tenure as ceo of social capitalwhich will likely cease existence soon however his commentary was interesting because despite an apparent lack of understanding of how economics works his thesis is simply that economic cycles are no longer relevant this is the quintessential uttering of this time is different economists wanting to get rid of recessions is not a new thing emi nakamura this years winners of the john bates clark medal honoring economists under 40 stated in an interview that she wants to tackle some of her fields biggest questions such as the causes of recessions and what policy makers can do to avoid them the problem with central bankers economists and politicians intervening to eliminate recessions is that while they may successfully extend the normal business cycle for a while they are most adept at creating a boom to bust cycles to be sure the last three business cycles 80 s 90 s and 2000 were extremely long and supported by a massive shift in financial engineering and credit leveraging cycle the post depression recovery and wwii drove the long economic expansion in the 40 s and the space race supported the 60 s you can see the length of the economic recoveries in the chart below i have also shown you the subsequent percentage market decline when they ended currently employment and wage growth is fragile 1 in 4 americans are on government subsidies and the majority of american s living paycheck to paycheck this is why central banks globally are aggressively monetizing debt in order to keep growth from stalling out despite a surging stock market and an economy tied for the longest economic expansion in history it is also is running at the weakest rate of growth with the highest debt levels since the great depression recessions are an important part of the cycle i know i get it if you mention the r word you are a pariah from the mainstream proletariat this is because people assume if you talk about a recession you mean the end of the world is coming the reality is that recessions are just a necessary part of the economic cycle and arguably an crucial one recessions remove the excesses built up during the expansion and reset the table for the next leg of economic growth without recessions the build up of excess continues until something breaks the outcomes of previous attempts to manipulate the cycles have all had devastating consequences in the current cycle the fed s interventions and maintenance of low rates for a decade have allowed fundamentally weak companies to stay in business by taking on cheap debt for unproductive purposes like stock buybacks and dividends consumers have used low rates to expand their consumption through debt once again the government has piled on debts and increased the deficit to levels normally seen during a recession such will only serve to compound the problem of the next recession when it comes however it is the fed s mentality of constant growth with no tolerance for recession has allowed this situation to inflate rather than allowing the natural order of the economy to perform its darwinian function of weeding out the weak the two charts below show both corporate debt as a percentage of economic growth and total system leverage versus the market do you see the issue the fact that over the past few decades the system has not been allowed to reset has led to a resultant increase in debt to the point it has impaired the economy to grow it is more than just a coincidence that the fed s not so invisible hand has left fingerprints on previous financial unravellings given the years of ultra accommodative policies following the financial crisis the majority of the ability to pull forward consumption appears to have run its course this is an issue that can t and won t be fixed by simply issuing more debt which for last 40 years has been the preferred remedy of each administration in reality most of the aggregate growth in the economy has been financed by deficit spending credit creation and a reduction in savings we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us in turn this surge in debt reduced both productive investments into and the output from the economy as the economy slowed and wages fell the consumer was forced to take on more leverage which continued to decrease the savings rate as a result of the increased leverage more of their income was needed to service the debt since most of the government spending programs redistribute income from workers to the unemployed this keynesians argue increases the welfare of many hurt by the recession what their models ignore however is the reduced productivity that follows a shift of resources from productive investment to redistribution all of these issues have weighed on the overall prosperity of the economy and what has obviously gone clearly awry is the inability for the current economists who maintain our monetary and fiscal policies to realize what downturns encompass the keynesian view that more money in people s pockets will drive up consumer spending with a boost to gdp being the result is clearly wrong it has not happened in four decades what is missed is that things like temporary tax cuts or one time injections do not create economic growth but merely reschedules it the average american may fall for a near term increase in their take home pay and any increased consumption in the present will be matched by a decrease later on when the tax cut is revoked this is of course assuming the balance sheet at home is not broken as we saw during the period of the great depression most economists thought that the simple solution was just more stimulus work programs lower interest rates government spending etc did nothing to stem the tide of the depression era the problem currently is that the fed s actions halted the balance sheet deleveraging process keeping consumers indebted and forcing more income to pay off the debt which detracts from their ability to consume this is the one facet that keynesian economics does not factor in more importantly it also impacts the production side of the equation since no act of saving ever detracts from demand consumption delayed is merely a shift of consumptive ability to other individuals and even better money saved is often capital supplied to entrepreneurs and businesses that will use it to expand and hire new workers the continued misuse of capital and continued erroneous monetary policies have instigated not only the recent downturn but actually 40 years of an insidious slow moving infection that has destroyed the american legacy here is the most important point recessions should be embraced and utilized to clear the excesses that accrue in the economic system during the first half of the economic growth cycle trying to delay the inevitable only makes the inevitable that much worse in the end the r word despite hopes to the contrary the u s and the globe will experience another recession the only question is the timing as i quoted in much more detail in this past weekend s newsletter doug kass suggests there is plenty of gasoline awaiting a spark slowing domestic economic growth slowing non u s economic growth the earnings recession the last two times the fed ended its rate hike cycle a recession and bear market followed the strengthening u s dollar message of the bond market untenable debt levels credit is already weakening t he abundance of uncertainties political uncertainties and policy concerns valuation positioning is to the bullish extreme rising bullish sentiment and the bull market in complacency non conformation of transports but herein lies the most important point about recessions market reversions and systemic problems what chamrath palihapitiya said was both correct and naive he is naive to believe the fed has everything under control and recessions are a relic of the past central banks globally have engaged in a monetary experiment hereto never before seen in history therefore the outcome of such an experiment is also indeterminable secondly when central banks launched their emergency measures the global economies were emerging from a financial crisis not at the end of a decade long growth cycle the efficacy of their programs going forward is highly questionable but what chamrath does have right were his final words even though he dismisses the probability of occurrence save a complete financial externality that we can t forecast every financial crisis market upheaval major correction recession etc all came from one thing an exogenous event that was not forecast or expected this is why bear markets are always vicious brutal devastating and fast it is the exogenous event usually credit related which sucks the liquidity out of the market causing prices to plunge as prices fall investors begin to panic sell driving prices lower which forces more selling in the market until ultimately sellers are exhausted it is the same every time while investors insist the markets are currently not in a bubble it would be wise to remember the same belief was held in 1999 and 2007 throughout history financial bubbles have only been recognized in hindsight when their existence becomes apparently obvious to everyone of course by that point is was far too late to be of any use to investors and the subsequent destruction of invested capital this time will not be different only the catalyst magnitude and duration will be my advice to emi nakamura would be instead of studying how economists can avoid recessions focus on the implications costs and outcomes of previous attempts and why recessions are actually a healthy thing
donald trump president donald trump sent asian and european stock markets plunging on monday by threatening to hike tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods in a bid to speed up stuttering trade talks between the economic superpowers equities in asia europe and the us were a sea of red as trump s remarks rekindled fears of a trade war with potentially devastating consequences for world growth on wall street the dow jones index lost over 400 points at the new york opening bell while eurozone markets were down by more than 1 5 per cent at that time having earlier plunged more than two per cent asian exchanges saw some of the worst falls with shanghai plunging more than five per cent and the chinese yuan also taking a battering after the president threw a spanner into the high level negotiations for 10 months china has been paying tariffs to the usa of 25 on 50 billion dollars of high tech and 10 on 200 billion dollars of other goods trump tweeted sunday night the 10 will go up to 25 on friday sledgehammer walnut the warning threw a shadow over the next round of talks ahead of a visit by a chinese delegation to washington this week a number of news outlets reported that china was considering delaying or cancelling the meeting but a foreign ministry spokesman said a delegation would head to the us as planned the period of historic calm across global financial markets is staring at the prospect of a rude awakening said han tan market analyst at fxtm risk off sentiment has been the response to this swerve from trump the two sides have imposed tariffs on 360 billion in two way trade since last year but trump and china s xi jinping agreed a truce in december fuelling a surge in global stocks for the past four months trump has taken the proverbial sledgehammer to the walnut this morning and the only two words likely to be on the minds of traders and investors this week are trade talks said oanda senior market analyst jeffrey halley news that the people s bank of china would slash the amount of cash lenders must keep in reserve to support small businesses had little impact in the face of trump s warning trade had been put to the side by many market participants said andrew tilton chief asia pacific economist at goldman sachs but trump s threat now raises the spectre of a significant hit to growth should these tariffs escalate and should the uncertainty associated with that weigh on investment going forward he told bloomberg tv the yuan sank 1 3 per cent at one point against the dollar its heaviest fall in more than three years investors will remain bearish on the yuan as they reprice in trade war risks ken cheung senior foreign exchange strategist at mizuho bank the news was unexpected flight to safety saw the dollar surge across the board particularly against higher yielding higher risk units although the yen held its own against the greenback on oil markets both main contracts were hammered by worries that a trade war between the world s top two economies could hit demand however stephen innes at spi asset management remained positive calling trump s tweet political posturing a deal was still likely said innes raoul leering head of international trade analysis at ing agreed saying both sides had invested too much political capital in the talks to allow them to fail we still expecte a us china trade deal he said meanwhile china said on monday that a delegation was still preparing to go to the united states for trade talks even as us president donald trump dramatically increased pressure on beijing to reach a deal saying he would hike tariffs on chinese goods this week trump s comments on sunday marked a major escalation in tensions between the world s two largest economies and a shift in tone from the president who as recently as friday had cited progress toward a deal stock markets sank and oil prices tumbled on his remarks as negotiations to end the months long trade war were thrown into doubt we are also in the process of understanding the relevant situation what i can tell you is that china s team is preparing to go to the united states for the discussions chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a news briefing but geng did not say if vice premier liu he who is china s lead official in the negotiations will be part of the delegation as originally planned negotiations are set to start may 8 in washington what is of vital importance is that we still hope the united states can work hard with china to meet each other half way and strive to reach a mutually beneficial win win agreement on the basis of mutual respect geng said agencies

revenue of 27 7 million an increase of 16 9 on a per share basis versus the comparable 2018 period and a 9 3 increase over q4 2018 the increase is due to distributions from new investments into gwm bcc fleet and heritage organic growth through the 2019 reset and the appreciation of the us dollar versus the comparable period this was partially offset by the reduction in distributions stemming from profitable redemptions from labstat end of the roll and agility normalized ebitda of 0 68 per share increased 23 6 compared to the three months ending march 31 2018 due to an increase in

blocked subsequently the corporation providence and the lender came to an agreement to restart distributions immediately on a modified basis the lender agreed to forbear for a two year period as a result of providence s owners contributing a material amount of capital into the business the proceeds of which will be used as a partial repayment of the senior debt and to fund working capital as part of the forbearance and beginning in april 2019 april distribution has already been received contracted distributions to alaris of us 195 000 per month us 2 34 million annually are permitted for

distributions in january february and march and nine months at us 195 000 per month the agreement with the lender requires providence to meet a liquidity threshold management of providence is confident such threshold will be easily maintained based on their forecast due to the change in expected future distributions over the next 24 months the fair value of the providence units were reduced by us 5 0 million for the three months ending march 31 2019 providence as a percentage of total contracted distributions to the corporation accounts for approximately 5 of total revenue cad 5

regardless of who wins the democratic nomination for president one year from now the party s deep pockets already are prepping the groundwork to make sure that history or herstory if you will does not repeat itself in 2020 the democratic presidential candidate s path to the white house doesn t run along the acela corridor or the pacific coast highway but rather across interstate 94 in the upper midsection of the country democrats learned this the hard way in 2016 for all her excuses russian social media bots former fbi director james comey traitorous married white women hillary clinton lost the presidential election for one reason she failed to carry the midwest including the crucial states of michigan and wisconsin her refusal to shake the weathered hands of working class whites in those two states and in pennsylvania prior to the election cost her the presidency even though her intentional snub of three must win states now is a running joke among the political commentariat it no doubt will haunt clinton campaign strategists and the candidate herself for perpetuity her candidacy will be remembered as a cautionary tale rather than an historical event but it wasn t just clinton s unbridled hubris and political miscalculation that caused the midwest s blue wall to unexpectedly crumble on november 8 2016 donald trump the brash manhattan billionaire with no ties to the heartland at the same time connected with the voters whom clinton decided to ignore subsequently he did something in 2016 that no republican presidential candidate had been able to do since the glory days of madonna and michael j fox nearly running the electoral table in the midwest trump was the first republican since 1988 to win the state of michigan to put that in political context representative alexandria ocasio cortez the shadow speaker of the house of representatives hadn t even been born yet the last republican to win the state of wisconsin was ronald reagan in 1984 although trump s margin of victory in both states was slim that doesn t tell the full story barack obama trounced mitt romney in michigan and wisconsin even though romney s running mate the former speaker of the house paul ryan was a popular badger state native trump amassed 160 000 more votes in michigan than romney won in 2012 the only midwestern state that clinton won comfortably was her home state of illinois she scraped by in minnesota beating trump by roughly forty thousand votes four years after barack obama beat mitt romney there by nearly one quarter of a million votes so democrats already are preparing to make sure that electoral nightmare doesn t recur in 2020 earlier this year priorities usa a super pac populated with obama and clinton loyalists announced it would spend 100 million in an early engagement program to start shoring up democratic voters for the 2020 election two of the four states targeted in the first phase of the program are michigan and wisconsin the acknowledgement that any democratic presidential candidate automatically is in trouble against president trump in midwestern states considered a lock for more than three decades represents a stunning reversal of fortune for the party of the 206 so called pivot counties areas that twice elected obama but flipped to elect trump in 2016 a majority are located in the midwest trump beat clinton by at least twenty percentage points in three michigan counties seven minnesota counties eight wisconsin counties and fourteen iowa counties it wasn t even close and there s more bad news about the midwest for the twenty or so democrats running for president democrats already seems resigned to lose both ohio and iowa two states that barack obama won twice despite a massive turnout for democrats in the buckeye state in the 2018 midterm election republicans still won every constitutional office and only lost five statehouse seats it s not in our initial spending plans josh schwerin a spokesman for priorities usa said about ohio it is in the states to watch and see if an investment is worth making president trump now seems well positioned to win the midwest again next year but it wasn t supposed to be this way democrats were certain that trump wouldn t even survive his first term if he did by some miracle run for reelection republicans would rush to support a more genteel more acceptable candidate to challenge him in the primary if a primary opponent didn t materialize democrats would be well positioned to defeat the massively unpopular president in a landslide but spending tens of millions of dollars in michigan and wisconsin a full eighteen months before the general election while abandoning ohio and iowa that certainly was never in the democrats original 2020 victory plan further a corrupt scheme manufactured by the obama justice department his cia and probably the white house itself about how the trump campaign illegally conspired with the kremlin to sway the election in his favor was supposed to permanently cripple trump s presidency special counsel robert mueller was supposed to haul trump out of the oval office in handcuffs trump s alleged mental instability dictator worship shady business dealings corrupt personal lawyer porn star dalliances and child caging policies were supposed to result in a massive public uprising against the forty fifth president the stock market was supposed to crash our strongest allies were supposed to abandon the united states trade wars were supposed to devastate american farmers and manufacturers north korea was supposed to start a nuclear war white supremacists were supposed to take over the streets of washington d c while steve bannon passed out tiki torches and steven miller personally kidnapped guatemalan housekeepers out of kalorama mansions to send them back home establishment republicans warned that trump would destroy the gop and lead to devastating losses up until he was finally removed from office in a landslide in 2020 if he somehow managed to evade impeachment arrest or the nuthouse the party s hierarchy predicted doom if trump was the nominee and ultimately elected president i believe donald trump would be an absolute disaster for the republican party destroy conservatism as we know it we would get wiped out bemoaned senator lindsey graham in march 2016 some crusty stalwarts such as george will left the party but none of the most calamitous scenarios have been realized despite losing the house of representatives in 2018 republicans picked up two senate seats nine of out ten republicans approve of trump s job performance no legitimate republican primary challenger has yet to emerge and lindsey graham has been converted into a presidential booster and confidante the trump economy fueled by tax cuts and unprecedented deregulation continues to notch record numbers the unemployment rate is at a fifty year low overall economic growth is at a pace most experts claimed would never occur and new job creation blows by expectations month after month trump is tackling unfair international trade agreements that mostly harmed agriculture and manufacturing sectors in the midwest after decades of neglect while exposing the folly of republicans devotion to imaginary free trade principles the president s standing in the midwest now is arguably stronger than when he nearly swept the region in 2016 polling shows trump s job approval rating in the midwest is in the mid forties and his overall favorability rating is highest in the midwest trump s approval rating in the region is roughly the same as obama s was during the same point in his presidency according to gallup tracking polls the working class the nearly 70 percent of americans without a college degree who have been ignored and even ridiculed by both political parties is flourishing five of the top ten cities enjoying the greatest job opportunities for lower wage workers are in the midwest a majority of the metro areas with the highest shares of opportunity employment are located in the midwest after adjusting for cost of living differences median annual earnings tend to be relatively high in that region according to an april 2019 study by the federal reserve bank of cleveland finding enough workers is a problem playing out in many parts of the midwest a region with lower unemployment and higher job opening rates than the rest of the country according to an april 2018 wall street journal report citing hiring challenges by employers in iowa indiana and wisconsin southwestern ohio solid trump country is in the midst of a warehousing boom the construction industry is thriving nationwide but the midwest is leading the pack the administration s attempts to secure the southern border are gaining popularity in the midwest according to a recent washington post poll 40 percent of midwesterners say trump s approach to illegal immigration will make them more likely to support him in 2020 compared to 36 percent who say they are less likely further 83 percent of midwesterners called the situation at the mexican border a crisis or a serious problem it will take some smooth convincing by the democratic presidential candidate to not only disabuse midwesterners of their views but to assure them that open borders are best for families in racine and grand rapids trump continues to court midwestern voters filling public venues from ohio to minnesota about once a month with enthusiastic crowds since election day the president has hosted two dozen events in the midwest his patriotic plain even salty language connects with midwesterners in a way that perhaps other americans might find jingoistic or distasteful his first stop after winning the white house was ohio a state he won by eight points we had people running our country who didn t know what the hell they were doing he told the packed crowd in cincinnati on december 1 2016 we re going to defend the american worker they forgot about the american worker they forgot that it was the american worker who truly built our country we are not going to forget believe me at a rally in wisconsin on april 27 trump had a story of fulfilled promises to tell his midwestern brethren together we are building a new chapter of american greatness he assured the green bay crowd one founded on the idea that all citizens are entitled to live in safety prosperity and peace this is an exciting time in our country trump touted his effort to reorganize failed trade pacts after decades of calamitous trade deals that stripped away our wealth and our jobs took away our dignity when great companies would leave the united states for another country because of stupid taxes because of stupid regulations but now the choices are going to be other states democrats face another headwind off the great lakes flagging union membership and waning political support from union rank and file one reason is right to work laws in states like indiana michigan and wisconsin that let workers opt out of unions according to an april 2019 wall street journal editorial after wisconsin enacted right to work in 2015 the union share of the state workforce fell 30 the union bosses might still help pad the campaign coffers of democratic candidates but union workers are the muscle behind the party knocking on doors registering voters and filling union halls for campaign events last summer s supreme court decision to halt the compulsory collection of dues from public sector employees will undoubtedly diminish the buying power of these once influential union donors but trump s biggest advantage in the midwest is of the democratic party s own making a national party and presidential field populated by left wing lunatics the crop of candidates running for president on the democratic side is the twenty first century version of a collection of college sophomores crammed into a phone booth making a collect call to the 1960s baby boomer slogans such as soak the rich free stuff for all and save the earth are making a comeback largely thanks to the star power of a millennial freshman congressperson her term from new york city the options for democratic voters range from aging hippies bernie sander to two time losers joe biden to out of work lawmakers beto o rourke john delaney to unhinged megalomaniacs eric swalwell kirsten gillibrand elizabeth warren cory booker add to that a woman who allegedly mistreats her staff amy klobuchar and a college town mayor with a thin resume pete buttigieg and you ve got the makings of an electoral disaster in the heartland none of the candidates appear to have a clue how to attract working class midwesterners instead the nearly two dozen democrats are one upping each other to see who would win a popularity contest in silicon valley or the upper east side rather than who can earn back votes from folks living in benton harbor or wauwatosa the collective agenda for the democrats going into 2020 looks like this install federal tax rates upwards of 70 percent enact a green new deal that would curtail the production of fossil fuels impose crippling new taxes and regulations and overhaul the economy as we know it commit trillions of dollars to free college free healthcare reparations for african americans and the forgiveness of college debt open up the southern border eliminate quotas on immigrants from other countries and demonize ice workers alienate israel and ignore alarming trends of anti semitism around the world and allow anyone to vote including illegal immigrants convicted terrorists and child killers oh and speaking of child killers the freedom to perform post birth abortions formerly known as murder would be the law of the land in the meantime anyone who objects to their agenda will automatically be branded a white supremacist a homophobe a racist a sexist or an islamophobe regular americans particularly white working class men will be demonized under the false flag of equality their destructive approach will get constant reinforcements from the more reprehensible democrats in congress including rep adam schiff rep ilhan omar and rep rashida talib some recognize that this extreme agenda and approach won t play in peoria and are considering an unconventional election strategy that bypasses the midwest there is a growing school of thought that democrats should not spend so much time money and psychic energy tailoring their message to a heavily white rural and blue collar part of the country when their coalition is increasingly made up of racial minorities and suburbanites wrote jonathan martin and alexander burns in a february 2019 new york times piece that reported on the intra party tension about which states democrats need to woo in 2020 should democrats redouble their efforts to win back the industrial heartland that effectively delivered the presidency to donald j trump or should they turn their attention to more demographically promising sun belt states like georgia and arizona even if the democrats capture georgia and arizona but still lose wisconsin and michigan it will result in a plus one net electoral vote for their candidate still not enough to win and if wisconsin and michigan go for trump it s safe to assume that pennsylvania does too minnesota also will be in play for a potential loss of ten electoral votes for the democratic candidate a shocking pick up in either texas or florida would be the only way for the democrats to prevail over a solid red tide with the exception of illinois from philadelphia to minneapolis there s another risk for the democrats in forsaking the midwest in 2020 the chance to lose the house of representatives eight of the most vulnerable congressional districts that democrats snatched from republicans last year are in the midwest one more is in pennsylvania republicans only need to win back eighteen seats to regain control of congress without a vote driving senate contests in any midwestern state republicans could focus their resources into winning these close congressional races while democrats pursue vanity projects in texas and north carolina of course not everything looks rosy for the gop in 2020 the national party infrastructure seems unable or unwilling to compete with the well funded grassroots mobilization that democrats showcased in 2018 to win the house republicans don t appear to have any legitimate strategy to challenge the egregious tactic of ballot harvesting which led to the defeat of seven california republican representatives last year and no doubt will be replicated in competitive states all over the country the republican national committee is flush with cash but there s plenty of uncertainty whether the money will wind up in the right races or wasted on grudges or pet candidates and trump could harm his own reelection chances too an escalation of the trade war could dampen his support in the agriculture community a misguided intervention in venezuela would be inimical to trump s america first pledge and the continued failure to stop record numbers of central american migrants from breaching our border could be exploited by democrats as trump s biggest unkept promise but for now trump s midwestern base is thriving and the blue wall that once stretched along i 94 for democratic presidential candidates since the late 1980s now seems to be a permanent pile of electoral rubble under the trump era a message from the editors your donation

turkey s relationship with europe and with the west more generally is rooted in several factors relations are affected by the domestic politics in all countries concerned while conflicts at turkey s borders have implications for the country s security and for migration flows toward the eu economic and financial ties ankara s intensified links with russia and iran and turkey s rule of law also have significant consequences despite growing divergences between turkey and its traditional western allies neither side can afford for political economic and security relations to deteriorate beyond a certain point this is especially true of the eu turkey economic relationship where trade foreign direct investment and technology transfers play important roles both ways the rest of 2019 will be full of testing moments for all the critical components of the relationship it is up to both sides to renew the search for realistic avenues for constructive cooperation marc pierini pierini is a senior fellow at carnegie europe where his research focuses on developments in the middle east and turkey from a european perspective more marcpierini1 turkey s current situation turkey s present situation can be assessed in five dimensions economics domestic politics foreign policy defense policy and the rule of law together these strands paint a challenging picture that leaves europe and turkey with limited options for how to respond the economic backdrop the turkish economy has entered a contractionary period after a decade of uninterrupted growth the policy the government chooses in response will determine the severity and duration of the recession the economic slowdown is due to rising structural vulnerabilities exposed by a buildup of private sector debt on the back of cheap global liquidity the country s private credit to gdp ratio reached 70 percent by the end of 2018 a decade ago it was 27 percent this trend illustrates the consequences of the growth model pursued by the turkish authorities which was based on a domestic lending boom a more sustainable option would have been to focus on productivity enhancing reforms to decrease turkey s reliance on foreign savings turkey now faces a serious problem of corporate debt overhang a situation in which firms debt is so great that they cannot easily borrow more which negatively affects domestic investment and consumption on top of this accumulated debt the economy suffers from problems of currency mismatch and resource misallocation more than half of the corporate debt is denominated in foreign currency leading to an open foreign exchange position defined as the foreign exchange owed by turkish companies to international financial investors of more than 200 billion or 25 percent of turkey s gdp many corporations have had balance sheet problems and are facing financing difficulties as a result of the currency shock in summer 2018 when the turkish lira depreciated by 40 percent against major currencies in addition the foreign funding turkey has received over the years has been increasingly allocated to non foreign exchange earning sectors of the economy like real estate and construction the latter industry now accounts for nearly 10 percent of turkey s national income a level witnessed in spain before its construction led economic crisis ankara s policy response will need to incorporate a large scale debt restructuring scheme to alleviate the burden on corporate balance sheets this will be a complex operation that can be done effectively only with international financial assistance that is why a deal with the international monetary fund imf is becoming increasingly necessary the more turkish policymakers procrastinate in devising financing and implementing a large scale corporate debt adjustment program the more difficult it will be for the turkish economy to return to a growth trajectory as an additional objective turkish policymakers will have to change their growth paradigm away from capital deepening which necessarily raises financial liabilities at home to a model driven by increases in productivity this goal will require a structural transformation of the current economic approach with consequences for the country s political economy it will also need an improvement in turkey s investment climate which will in turn require enhanced rule of law the domestic political backdrop turkey has reached the end of a particularly heavy electoral schedule the country has been through three national elections a constitutional referendum and a presidential election since 2015 in the meantime turkey has transitioned from a parliamentary to a presidential system with recep tayyip erdoƒüan elected as the country s first executive president local elections were held on march 31 2019 but no further votes are scheduled until 2023 the local elections created a political shock as the ruling justice and development party akp lost hold of turkey s major metropolitan areas including the capital ankara and istanbul where the party has challenged the vote count this result was due primarily to the country s ongoing economic slowdown which undermines support for the government but it was also because the normally ineffective turkish opposition had created a political alliance led by the main opposition republican people s party chp and the center right good party that seriously challenged the akp s dominance in some of turkey s big cities the fact that the pro kurdish peoples democratic party hdp decided not to nominate candidates in some of these constituencies was also a boon for the opposition alliance the outcome of the local elections is set to embolden the opposition which now controls cities that represent 65 percent of turkey s gdp the potential for economic rent distribution linked to seizing major local authorities will also benefit the opposition financially as a result the outcome can be seen as the start of a rebalancing of turkey s political landscape at the same time erdoƒüan and his ruling political alliance remain the dominant forces in turkey s domestic politics having received a slim majority of the popular vote nationwide after the elections erdoƒüan can now operate without the pressure of an electoral calendar for the foreseeable future in theory this political backdrop should create a favorable environment for turkey to finally address its democratic backtracking and enhance the rule of law a core motivation for doing so would be that improving the rule of law can assuage ongoing economic difficulties the same argument can be made in relation to the kurdish problem higher rule of law standards would help appease turkey s kurdish minority but the akp s alliance with the conservative nationalist movement party mhp creates an ever present hindrance to such reforms in this context the turkish leadership keeps putting pressure on the hdp saying that the kurdish origin party is no different from the kurdistan workers party pkk a terrorist entity erdoƒüan and the akp need the alliance with the mhp to retain their majority in turkey s parliament but if for some reason that alliance came to an end and an imf agreement could trigger such a fission then new political realignments would become necessary foreign policy on foreign policy the fact that the ruling akp has entered an alliance with the mhp has prompted the country s leadership to harden its anti western narrative mostly against the united states and to a lesser extent against the eu this partnership has also diminished the probability of an agreement on a comprehensive settlement for the divided island of cyprus the most significant foreign policy developments have been on syria based on the belief that the syrian kurdish people s protection units ypg are an extension of turkey s own kurdish insurgency the pkk ankara has made the protection of its borders and the creation of buffer zones on the syrian side central elements of its policy this resulted in the intervention by the turkish armed forces and the turkish backed free syrian army to seize control of the jarablus area north of aleppo in 2016 and of the kurdish ruled district of afrin in 2018 the fates of the kurdish governed town of manbij and of the kobane and jazira districts all in northern syria have become the center of a lasting dispute with the united states which is leading the coalition fight against the so called islamic state with the help of the ypg and french forces the abrupt decision by u s president donald trump on december 19 2018 to withdraw u s troops from northeast syria has provided ankara with both a victory in principle and a fresh military challenge aside from the slow and incomplete implementation of the u s withdrawal turkey faces another quandary both moscow and tehran continue to support efforts by the regime of syrian president bashar al assad to recapture all land within syria s borders this over time will inevitably mean the complete withdrawal of turkish troops from syria beyond ankara s recurrent threats to launch a cross border operation targeting the part of syria northeast of the euphrates river where the ypg is based difficult discussions on an international agreement to protect the turkey syria border will continue to dominate turkey s foreign policy agenda the economy however may produce shifts in turkey s foreign policy the challenging economic environment will force ankara to become less confrontational with its partners in the west that will be the case especially if a deal with the imf becomes inevitable ultimately the large financing needs of the turkish economy heightened by an acute economic downturn can be sourced only from western savings an improbable but significant alternative could have been for turkey to turn to china for its financing needs turkish finance minister berat albayrak was in beijing in july 2018 the likelihood of this scenario has dwindled however as turkey has recently become more vocal on china s human rights violations in its autonomous xinjang territory defense policy currently turkey s defense policy debates are dominated by the s 400 dilemma this combined with a series of knock on effects means that the western view of turkey s defense policy is of a growing divergence from the country s commitments to nato one of the major disagreements between turkey and the united states relates to ankara s ongoing willingness to acquire from russia the s 400 strategic weapons system to boost its air defense capabilities the delivery of the first battery is expected in july 2019 but the united states has declared that such an acquisition which would effectively lead to the introduction of a russian made missile system and associated russian military personnel at the heart of one of the largest nato air forces would trigger sanctions against turkey under the countering america s adversaries through sanctions act that act provides for the imposition of sanctions on third parties that make significant transactions with companies linked to russia s military industry in addition washington has warned that such a transaction with moscow would affect the delivery of the f 35 fighter jets turkey has ordered from the united states the u s fear is not only that the s 400 would obtain critical information about the stealth characteristics of the f 35 but also and more importantly that it could hack the f 35 s communications platform endangering the security of the f 35 fleet around the world washington has therefore proposed an alternative package to turkey including the u s made patriot missile system the official rhetoric in ankara is that turkey will seek to procure both systems but in reality turkey is compelled to choose between the russian and the u s equipment from washington s perspective these are two mutually exclusive options unless ankara changes its acquisition plans a move that is difficult to envisage given that good relations with russia have become critical for turkey at the very least for achieving its aims in syria the outcome would be another turkey u s escalation and a major blow to the north atlantic alliance furthermore the u s congress could also halt the participation of turkey s military industry in the production of components for the f 35 the onset of the 2020 u s presidential election campaign toward the end of this year could be a further destabilizing factor the rule of law the view in european capitals is that ankara has distanced itself from the eu s democratic norms to such a degree that progress on turkey s eu accession bid is no longer realistic the june 2018 eu council conclusions stated clearly the concern in europe over the continuing and deeply worrying backsliding on the rule of law and on fundamental rights including the freedom of expression and the deterioration of the independence and functioning of the judiciary the accession process is neither alive nor formally dead because it is up to turkey to fulfill the conditions that the two sides have agreed are the basic requirements for accession the eu s view on the rule of law is unlikely to soften much after two recent developments first an indictment dated march 4 accused sixteen civil society figures of organizing mass protests in 2013 as part of an international conspiracy the request that the defendants receive sentences of aggravated life imprisonment has made their upcoming trial look like a politically motivated operation second the local elections on march 31 were marked by deviations from democratic rule the campaign was unfair the akp mhp coalition did not admit defeat in istanbul and victories by some hdp candidates were declared invalid the european parliament approved a resolution on march 13 recommending that the commission and the council of the european union in accordance with the negotiating framework formally suspend the accession negotiations with turkey one of the negative consequences of turkey s backsliding on the rule of law is that the eu council has extended the freeze on accession talks to the modernization of the eu turkey customs union apart from politics on the eu side turkey s rule of law situation linked to unconventional economic policies and the concentration of economic power in the hands of the president has created a distinct malaise in turkish and european business circles however it remains clear that the twenty three year old customs union has allowed a massive transformation of turkey s manufacturing industry the agreement has equally benefited eu industrialists by providing them with efficient and profitable production platforms especially in the automotive industry more generally the eu remains an indispensable partner for turkey in the fields of trade foreign direct investment and technology transfers this interdependence works both ways options for the european union the eu s policy on turkey is conditioned by the union s principled approach to the rule of law and by the lingering memory of heavy turkish interference in the domestic politics mostly of germany and the netherlands in 2017 ahead of turkey s constitutional referendum in april that year turkish ministers wanted to launch campaigns aimed at turks living in those countries berlin and the hague refused and as a result they faced extreme criticism from ankara the impact of the aggressive language used then at the highest level has never been erased and attempts to improve critical bilateral relationships such as the turkish presidential visit to france in january 2018 and state visit to germany in september 2018 have yielded no tangible benefits the european appetite for photo opportunities at summits and high level visits has dwindled and a policy of containment currently prevails in several european countries more broadly the evolution of the eu s political landscape has resulted in greater euroskeptic and turcoskeptic forces which does not bode well for a rapid improvement in the eu turkey relationship the fundamental difficulty in shaping the eu policy response to turkey involves designing a novel framework that balances a transactional approach with rules based engagement the risk is that in the absence of a positive dynamic on accession the relationship will become purely transactional that is already the case in many collaborative policy areas such as the 2016 refugee package under which the eu provides syrian refugees and their host communities in turkey with 6 billion 6 8 billion of aid or foreign policy dialogue given the absence of credible signals from ankara on a return to the rule of law in 2019 it is clear that a degree of transactionalism will inevitably be part of the future turkey eu relationship but the challenge will be whether ankara and brussels can still nurture some rules based order four areas of potential cooperation stand out the customs union counterterrorism visa liberalization and economic and political dialogue modernize the customs union at present the most realistic option for the rules based component of this relationship is the modernization of the eu turkey customs union with new technologies and vast increases in trade in services there is a need to upgrade this trade deal which was concluded more than two decades ago its modernization must involve not only the expansion of its scope to services and possibly agriculture but also horizontal areas such as the monitoring of state aid and more importantly a more functional dispute settlement mechanism the latter is important to resolve the ever larger number of disagreements over the functioning of the regime the key issue is whether turkey is willing to advance with modernizing the customs union despite the significant impact this could have on the country s political economy the aim to renew the customs union seems to have gained traction among both political and business circles in turkey upgrading the arrangement would certainly introduce a more rules based form of economic governance in contrast to the current erosion of institutional rule it would also introduce much needed transparency and fair competition provisions to enhance overall governance in short the modernization of the customs union is much more important for its indirect impact on turkey s governance than for its direct commercial effects the eu has yet to decide whether negotiations on deepening the customs union can start the european commission submitted a negotiations mandate to the council in december 2016 but so far the council has refused to approve the mandate on account of turkey s democratic backtracking as justified as this principled position is it is unclear what is formally required from turkey for the eu council to give the go ahead for the start of the negotiations a practical option would be for the eu to specify how a return to a decent level of the rule of law would help unblock the negotiations on a modernized customs union cooperate on counterterrorism despite differences in the two sides priorities it is likely that counterterrorism cooperation with turkey will remain high on the agendas of concerned eu member governments and the eu itself this is because despite a drastic weakening of the islamic state s military strength and land control the islamist insurgency is still active in syria and importantly includes among its members several hundred jihadists with eu passports some of these militants are in the custody of the ypg with the islamic state s recent territorial losses these eu citizens and other jihadists will likely try to head back to the eu via turkey they represent a threat to both turkey and their countries of origin a situation that warrants tighter cooperation yet while the eu priority is to fight the islamic state in syria requiring cooperation with the ypg and turkey ankara s chief aim is to combat the ypg on a different matter it is unlikely that european governments will consider ankara s hunt for presumed turkish members of the movement of self exiled turkish preacher fethullah g√ºlen to be counterterrorism rather europeans see this as the continuation of a domestic feud between two former political allies liberalize visa rules in theory liberalizing visa regulations for turkish citizens traveling to eu countries should be one of the most beneficial improvements in the eu turkey relationship however such liberalization is based on rules including the conduct of turkey s antiterrorism policy for the time being no agreement seems possible on reforming turkey s antiterror law yet progress has been achieved on the more technical aspects of this complex negotiation such as turkey s introduction of biometric passports foster economic and political dialogues a number of eu turkey dialogues have made a modest beginning these have been in the fields of economic policy transportation energy and foreign policy with the objective of exchanging views and positions on more issues and projects of common interest these dialogues will probably continue or expand later in 2019 however their real significance is contingent on improvements in the rule of law in turkey and on significant convergence between ankara and brussels on foreign policy conclusion difficulties abound in the eu turkey relationship in the coming months domestic politics on both sides and the international environment will probably not help much the possibility of a complete standstill in the eu turkey relationship should not be underestimated if turkey squarely refuses to improve its rule of law situation for the sake of revamping the eu turkey customs union this would be a major reason for eu political circles to prolong the standstill ankara s artificial narrative to the effect that turkey has fulfilled all the criteria for accession does not help politically in addition political trends in several eu countries are not favorable to turkey as the campaign for the may 2019 european parliament elections is illustrating yet a sustained deterioration of the political economic and security relationship will run counter to both turkey s and the eu s interests even if populist and anti european statements continue to emerge from turkey

bene president and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you all for joining us i d like to start off this morning with an overview of our third quarter performance and the discussion around our business segments and the key highlights for the quarter following that joel will cover the financial results in further detail overall we are pleased by our overall operating and financial performance for the third quarter we delivered improved year over year growth in line with our expectations and managed cost well including the ongoing cost savings associated with our business transformation initiatives the improved pace the performance for the second half of fiscal 2019 we previously spoke off is in fact taking shape and while we still have work to do we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted operating income growth target and now expect that to be at the low end of the 650 million to 700 million range joel and i will both elaborate on this further from a total sysco perspective our third quarter results include increased sales of 2 2 to 14 7 billion gross profit growth of 2 9 and adjusted operating expense decreased of 0 4 which translated into an adjusted operating income increase of 16 6 to 620 million and an adjusted earnings per share increase of 17 4 to 0 79 turning the us restaurant industry data the overall sales trends remain mixed according to black box and naftrack saw some choppiness throughout the quarter as march data was generally positive compared to february in part due to weather which negatively impacted february sales additionally same store sales were positive for the quarter although traffic once again declined however even with this recent choppy industry choppy industry performance the overall macro trends remained generally favorable for our customers as illustrated by continued low unemployment which was at 3 8 for march and strong gdp growth for the first quarter at 3 2 economic growth in the international markets in which we operate was mostly positive this includes modest growth in the food service sector although we continue to see the impacts of brexit on our uk business due to uncertainty and low consumer confidence in canada the consumer confidence index continues to rise with march seeing the third consecutive monthly increase with technomic forecasting the canadian food service industry to grow 0 6 in real terms or 4 1 on a nominal basis for calendar year 2019 additionally we continue to see reasonable overall trends in the other international markets where we do business as we discussed last quarter we anticipated seeing an increased benefit from our transformation initiatives beginning in the second half of this year and we began to see those benefits show up this quarter overall our results included a bit softer top line than expected offset by good overall expense management which delivered solid operating profit performance that was in line with our expectations examples of initiatives that are driving benefits from an expense management perspective include our field finance transformation and the corporate office administrative restructuring which we implemented last quarter as it relates to acquisitions in april we acquired j m wholesale meats and imperio foods two smaller central california distributors j m meats is a food service distributor that specializes in key center of the plate products and imperio foods carries dry canned good products which both are complementary to our existing broadline business in the central california area they also provide sysco with the opportunity to further extend our reach to the important hispanic customer segment we will begin to see the impact to our business in the fourth quarter from both of these acquisitions additionally in the quarter we made the decision to sell our iowa premium cattle processing business while our three year plan forecast included positive operating income for this business we believe the divestiture of this business is in alignment with our strategic priorities and allows us to focus on our core strength as a distributor the transaction will result in a reduction of planned operating income of approximately 25 million and is the reason for us now projecting to achieve the low end of our adjusted operating income growth range now i d like to transition to our third quarter results by business segment beginning with us foodservice operations sales for the third quarter were 10 1 billion an increase of 4 1 gross profit grew 5 1 including an improvement in gross margin of 18 basis points adjusted operating expenses grew 2 3 and adjusted operating income increased 10 total case volume within us broadline grew modestly at 2 1 for the quarter of which 1 3 was organic however we delivered relatively solid growth in our local business as local case growth was up 3 1 of which 2 2 was organic we are pleased with the gross profit growth we delivered for the quarter which was impacted by a number of factors including continued positive momentum from category management as we continue to deepen our relationships with our strategic supplier partners year over year favorability from the impact of inbound freight and continued growth in our sysco branded products which increased by 28 basis points with our local customers this quarter in addition the inflation rate for the quarter was 2 3 in us broadline up nearly a point in the second quarter of this fiscal year technology continues to be one of our fundamental enablers of growth as we transform our business to serve our customers in ways that best meet their needs we are continuing to provide new capabilities and tools to enable an improved experience of doing business with sysco including new ordering tools which has driven our e commerce ordering utilization to more than 53 with our local customers from a cost perspective within us foodservice operations our expense management was solid as adjusted operating expenses were 2 3 for the quarter while we continue to see supply chain cost challenges in the warehouse and transportation areas we are seeing positive momentum from our recruiting on boarding and retention initiatives these challenges were partially offset by continued improvement seen as a result of our routing optimization initiatives and ongoing process improvements furthermore our finance transformation and smart spending initiative have also provided benefits in the quarter moving on to international foodservice operations for the quarter sales decreased 1 5 gross profit decreased 3 1 adjusted operating expenses decreased by 5 8 and adjusted operating income grew 30 we saw solid overall performance in canada with strong top line growth and solid gross profit dollar growth of more than 5 driven in part by an inflation rate of 2 6 along with strong expense management partially benefiting from our ongoing regionalization efforts which are progressing well in europe we continue to have mixed results the uk continues to feel the effects of brexit uncertainty causing depressed consumer confidence however our brakes uk business continues to stabilize operationally as a result of our multi year initiatives to transform the business in france social unrest continues to impact tourism and consequently food away from home consumption our sales performance during the third quarter was adversely impacted by this unrest and by some operational challenges associated with integrating brakes france and davigel into sysco france that said the overall integration and supply chain transformation continues to be on track to deliver long term benefits that are part of our multi year plan as for our business in latin america we continue to see growth opportunities in this region both with our chain restaurant customers and with our expansion of cash and carry locations to complement our broad line footprint in both costa rica and panama moving on to sygma we continue to make disciplined choices in an effort to deliver improved profitability in q3 we saw expected softness in the top line due to transition customers while seeing gross margin increased by 28 basis points year over year solid expense management drove adjusted operating expenses down 7 1 versus prior year resulting in significantly improved operating performance in an effort to improve overall profitability in this important segment of the business we will continue to take a very disciplined approach to growth as we move forward lastly in our other business segment we ve recently announced the restructuring of gas supply as the industry landscape evolves we are focusing on optimizing our business model in creating a more focused and agile organization to better meet the changing needs of our customers the new operating structures created three distinct business units under the parent company guest worldwide the business units include gilchrist soames our amenity manufacturing unit manchester mills one of the world s leading textile producers and guest supply which serves the world s top hotel chains and independent properties in over 100 countries as a full spectrum distribution solution provider in summary we continue to feel good about the fundamentals of our business our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around enriching our customers experience doing business with sysco and we remain focused on engaging our 67 000 dedicated associates around the world to deliver against our financial objectives associated with our three year plan let me now turn the call over to joel grade our chief financial officer joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you tom and good morning everyone i d like to provide you with additional financial details surrounding our performance for the quarter as tom mentioned earlier we saw improved year over year results for the third quarter although we saw some softness in the top line our earnings reflect solid expense management and strong adjusted operating income growth which are in line with what we previously stated and our results of our enterprise wide transformational initiatives these initiatives which are designed to streamline efficiencies and allow us to reinvest in the business to facilitate continued growth include our finance transformation roadmap smart spending and the canadian regionalization initiative for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 total sysco sales grew 2 2 foreign exchange rates negatively affected total sysco sales by approximately 1 1 in our us broadline business we experienced 2 3 inflation driven by a few categories including the frozen potato poultry and meat categories and we are managing this modest increase in inflation well gross profit in the third quarter increased 2 9 and gross margin increased 14 basis points while adjusted operating expenses decreased by 0 4 resulting in strong adjusted operating income growth of 16 6 to 620 million changes in foreign exchange rates decreased adjusted operating income by 34 basis points although it will vary from quarter to quarter we are focused on maintaining the 150 basis point gap between gross profit dollars and operating expense dollars that we committed to as part of our three year plan in order to achieve our adjusted operating income growth target turning to earnings per share our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 0 12 to 0 79 per share our eps results this quarter were impacted by our strong operating income adjusted tax rate foreign exchange impact and stock option exercises i d now like to discuss our tax rate for the quarter the gaap effective tax rate of negative 2 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily attributable to the determination made during the quarter to recognize the favorable impact of 95 million of foreign tax credits generated as a result of distributions to sysco from our foreign operations at the end of fiscal 2018 our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21 looking to our fourth quarter we would expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23 to 25 range now turning to cash flow cash flow from operations was 1 4 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 which is 244 million higher compared to the prior year period pre cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 was 1 billion which was 233 million higher compared to the prior year the improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to last year s pension contribution partially offset by cash taxes and the impact to working capital from an increase in day sales outstanding net capital expenditures totaled 367 million for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 which was 10 8 million higher compared to the prior year period for the full year fiscal 2019 we now expect the capital expenditure forecast of approximately 1 1 of sales down slightly from our previously stated 1 2 that said there are no changes to the prioritize order of capital allocation which is as follows investing in the business consistently growing our dividend participating in m a and a balanced approach to share buybacks and paying down debt as tom mentioned earlier with the anticipated sale of iowa premium we expect to achieve our target at the low end with 650 million to 700 million range as a result of our planned operating income being decreased by 25 million in summary we saw improved year over year results for the third quarter led by a continued momentum from improved underlying business performance solid local case growth and good cost management that said we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives of our three year plan although we remain confident in our ability to achieve these objectives we are committed to serving our customers and delivering at a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term operator we are now ready for q a questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question is from christopher mandeville from jefferies your line is open christopher mandeville jefferies analyst hey good morning can you speak to the gross margin improvement in the quarter and maybe help us understand those referenced impacts by order of magnitude and then tom or joel as it relates to private label penetration it was again expansion but it was one of the lower rates we ve seen in recent quarters so maybe you could kind of help us understand that as to whether or not it was an anomaly and we can return back to that 50 bps to 60 bps of expansion going forward or any color would be appreciated joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure chris good morning it s joel yes i think the way i ll think about that again it s truly balanced across some of the levers outside but i mean certainly our continued opportunities in our sysco brand certainly are a strong driver as well as continuing category management efforts and we continue this again obviously this is not one when it was five years ago when we had this giant year over year jump but the reality of it is we continue to enhance our relationships with our suppliers and we continue to drive our category management as well across our again our business and so i think those are some of the areas that s certainly are driving again inaudible the margin percentage but yeah i m really talking about what we think about most and that is our gross profit dollars we obviously also have some favorable inaudible inflation in our world clearly it s something that ultimately certainly in the moderate range it s at today is a good driver of opportunities again to move to continue to push cost of goods through to our customers and so that s certainly beneficial in terms of the dollars and gross profit and i would say it s not necessarily at the levels of that detrimental really again it s the composite that i think we manage we re managing this cost of goods inflation well and i think that s really really going to be a factor this is yes this comp inflation inaudible in our warehouse in terms where this thing now functions best so i don t really say those are still the main drivers of what we re looking at here and just in general some of the tools that you heard about in the past in terms of again revenue management continue to help us to drive our margins in a positive way thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey chris this is thomas just maybe two other things that i reinforce as well we didn t get some positive year over year benefit on the inbound freight side which is we ve talked in the past doesn t impact gross margin and then your specific question around sysco brand and we look at 28 basis point improvement is a very positive number still as long as that continues to move in the right direction that s a reflection for us so but a couple of things one our customers still reacting positively to all sysco brand and two we continue to bring innovative ideas and solutions to the market so we have to view that to be a solid number well it might be a little less on the growth than you ve seen in a couple of other quarters it s still early good number christopher mandeville jefferies analyst okay and then just my final question would be as you brought it up your inflation what should we ll be expecting in the coming quarter and if there s a willingness would you guys be able to disclose organic case growth quarter to date joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and so i mean i think the just on your question on inflation i mean i think certainly our forecast is we continue to see i ll say moderate levels of inflation as we as we move forward certainly over the next couple of quarters there s nothing that jumps out necessarily that would be really significant in terms of the overall inflation numbers so i don t think we expect certainly additional again moderate levels of inflation over the next couple of quarters organic case growth but i think that was part of the us foodservice sales 2 2 was the overall number that was organic thomas l bene president and chief executive officer but you re asking year to date right chris and that s joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes christopher mandeville jefferies analyst quarter to date thomas l bene president and chief executive officer quarter to date numbers ok christopher mandeville jefferies analyst yes just joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so christopher mandeville jefferies analyst if i strip out some of the noise from weather and what have you and maybe expect the calendar shift for easter as well joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i think so when you talk about there is local our local case volume for the quarter was the question i was answering was 2 2 it was organic total case volume organically was 1 3 inaudible christopher mandeville jefferies analyst but is there any real comment for april thomas l bene president and chief executive officer not really i mean we continue to were off i think we feel good about the continued momentum of the business and i don t use anything necessarily easter there was a bit of an easter shift but not a big shift given the timing of when it fell last year in the quarter versus this year christopher mandeville jefferies analyst okay thanks guys joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes operator your next question comes from the line of edward kelly from wells fargo your line is open edward kelly wells fargo analyst yes hi guys good morning thomas l bene president and chief executive officer good morning edward kelly wells fargo analyst can i i want to start with opex and i was hoping that you could give us a little bit of help here i mean obviously you had a big quarter from a cost perspective maybe just dig in a little bit more related to the drivers and i m asking this question because i think a lot of the accelerated efforts that you guys have been talking about weren t supposed to be at a full run rate this quarter so i m just trying to figure out how we think about opex going forward and then as part of this q4 s comparison looks pretty hard i think at workers comp benefit last year at the lap ph can you get to that 1 5 spread in q4 joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer well i ll start ed i mean i think a couple of things i would say to that number one i ll maybe take the last point first 1 5 point spread obviously in and i think it s in my prepared comments is it s something we looked at over the course of the three year plan that doesn t mean that necessarily every quarter is going to look the same some actually higher some actually possibly will be more as obviously we ve seen in both here i think the way i would look at it though i mean again as we did signal we do anticipate some improved performances in the second of the year obviously some of these plans have started kick in from our finance technology roadmap smart spending work the canadian regionalization some of the other administrative class work that we did around some of our corporate office transitions i think the again we feel good about our those things kicking in as we said in the second half this year as we head into the next year as well i would also call out just again overall our operating performance continues to be pretty strong and the expense line that s a good face of actually we had some a little bit of a few headwinds this particular quarter and that was about 0 03 a case so i mean we had i think question is do you expect this to continue in these areas i do to your point there are some headwinds that we re anticipating that we re going up against in the fourth quarter but certainly as we ve talked about here for a little while we certainly anticipated our leverage in the second half of the year to be better than first half and i think we certainly start to see that edward kelly wells fargo analyst okay and then just a follow up on capex so the capex guidance is down a bit can you just talk a bit about what s driving that i don t know if iowa premium has anything to do with it and how sustainable rate of sort of 1 1 will be going forward joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer well i mean i again i the way i always look at that i mean number one it s not bad inaudible forecast but i mean in reality if it is we spend our capex make our investments based truly underneath of the business there s been absolutely no change in terms of our perspective on our capital allocation priorities that always start with investing in our business we re obviously very committed to doing that we ve got a lot of change programs and if things transitioning our organization will continue to require investment i would just tell you from a timing perspective some of those things happened again at things do move around in the businesses in some ways so some of that probably timing versus anything but i will definitely not take away that there is some change in terms of the way we re looking at forecasting our capex we just yes we just adjust spending an investment in terms of the needs of business edward kelly wells fargo analyst great thanks guys thomas l bene president and chief executive officer thanks ed operator your next question comes from the line of karen short from barclays your line is open karen short barclays capital analyst hi thanks first thing i do want to ask was in terms of the composition of the now i guess kind of 650 million is there any change to this the breakout between gross profit and then the supply chain versus the admin joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer no karen so there is not that was just we only shifted that was related to the demonstrated sales of business but no there is no bucketing difference if you will karen short barclays capital analyst okay and then the same question i just want to ask i know you have obviously mentioned and you have been mentioning positive same store sales but traffic weakness so i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about trends with traffic and i guess same store sales on a true like mom and pop local basis in terms of the independent versus kind of the micro chains any patterns or differences you could point to there thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes good morning karen this is tom i mean look i think we ve seen certainly some choppiness this quarter particular and i think there are probably a bunch of different things driving that but it depends really on what source you look at i mean npd would call out that well overall spend is up traffic is up in some areas as well and down in others and black box and naftrack as they re probably more a little bit more consistent and they called traffic down really across most of the segments so i think it s driven by everything from some weather choppiness in q3 our q3 and mostly in february and then i think again kind of consumer efforts during that time the small chains seem to be doing a little bit better so that s going to be kind of micro chains and then the pure independents at least in this quarter according to npd tend to be a little bit softer but i wouldn t say from our perspective we have seen necessarily any major difference in trend line that we ve experienced over the last couple of quarters so we continue to feel like this independent growth that we ve had in that sector is doing well and then we continue to feel pretty confident in our ability to continue to grow and take share in that space karen short barclays capital analyst okay and then just last housekeeping and corporate came in on a dollar basis so a lot higher than i was i would have expected given the layoffs that you d announced i don t know if that s just an allocation issue or what because i would have thought on the dollar basis it would have been quite a bit down sequentially in year over year joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean when you re talking about the last kind of the specifically corporate layoffs inaudible again part of we re talking in total new administrative cost karen short barclays capital analyst yes joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer obviously there s a lot of things that are part of what we say our finance psychology roadmap that are very much fueled focused and so in fact one of the things we talked about in the first half year is that there were again why don t we feel confident about this inaudible by notification the sizable number of our field personnel and so i would tell you i think the majority which you re seeing is pretty is probably even more fuel focused than the corporate franchise balanced between the two karen short barclays capital analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of andrew wolf from loop capital markets your line is open andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst good morning wanted to follow up on the cadence of sales question that people asked about you guys said january was strong on a good weather comparison february a bit not good should we take away from there sort of march and april of somewhat normalized i mean people trying to get were obviously trying to get sense of whether the industry has slowed or not year over yea sort of and on a normalized basis thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes i think we would say that that s we feel like certainly things since the weather impacts in the early part of the quarter things have stabilized andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst and i noticed you gave us i may have missed this but i heard a technomic s forecast for canada do you have one for the us that you might be able to share with us thomas l bene president and chief executive officer as you know technomic kind of gets out ahead off and they do it by quarter kind of by sorry by some segment i may have that information which should i i have but i can get it to you we maybe need to get back to you on that but we generally do have that information andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst okay and i just had one other question unrelated sales so in the you took a 35 million charge that was related to the a change in the business technology strategy so could you expand a little upon that what the changes in your business expand business technology strategy thomas l bene president and chief executive officer so just can you clearer inaudible excuse me ask the question little more clearly andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst of the 72 million charges you excluded out of operating expense and 35 million was allocated for what you call the change in business technology strategy is that basically go into the cloud and could you expand on so we can understand a little better thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes and some of that is also got kind of a variety of things when there was actually an accelerated position we took in europe that was related also to a technology change so i mean yeah there s been a few things that again and that number also it just accelerated our g a a little bit but i wouldn t say there s one thing that is fell into there are a number of things that are just parts of our technology strategy they are included in that number and there s not necessarily one big thing there and there is not one thing i would inaudible to take away would not be that we somehow have a significant change in technology because we do not there s just a variety of things going on andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst and that was what i was trying to get to so appreciate it thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes think of it is more specifically around the finance transformation which is the technology component of it and then the european work we ve been doing where we had and erp in france that we ve been updating and so those are the two main drivers of it andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst thank you joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes operator your next question comes from the line of marisa sullivan from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst great good morning thanks for taking the question i just wanted to touch on fuel quickly and you call it that there was a slight headwind in the third quarter how should we think about fuel in the fourth quarter as it impacts your expense joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i can on fuel side i d anticipate some of those continued headwinds as we headed into the fourth quarter and probably a little bit in as we head into the next year as well marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you and then just we haven t heard you guys talk about category management a while on these calls please i m wondering was there anything you guys were doing differently in the third quarter that kind of made it a greater impact anything that you re planning for the fourth quarter as we should think about gross margin in catman thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey marisa it s tom no i wouldn t say anything unique i think what we re just trying to highlight is we continue to it s an ongoing process it has been now for years and we re starting to do some deeper work with some of our more strategic supplier partners and think about inaudible is some potentially long term benefits as we began to partner more deeply with some suppliers marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you and are you seeing any impacts or any customer feedback on category management are they liking what you re doing or is it are they having to adjust through assortment changes thomas l bene president and chief executive officer no i think we re at a point now where it s early early days so kind of a few years ago now i think we because we were changing some suppliers in some areas or products that was creating some choppiness so we ve actually continued to have a very good feedback from our customers around the work we re doing in catman obviously that drives cost benefit for them they re very excited about that and as i mentioned we are getting more focused on strategic partnerships so that we can have more consistent supply for the long term so generally it s very positive marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of judah frommer from credit suisse your line is open judah frommer credit suisse analyst hi thanks for taking the question maybe first just on the changes to guidance related to iowa premium i think you said it s the entire kind of reduction in guidance is due to iowa premium but if we re stripping 25 million out obviously that s not necessarily the low end so when you say the low end are you saying 650 million to 675 million effectively joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i think and here s they way i would think about that judah i think what we talked about really inaudible really around the midpoint of the range and so if you do 650 million to 700 million that will be 675 million really we re talking about here is a 25 million related iowa premium and yes that is the only adjustment to our guidance at this point which takes us from that midpoint down to that lower end of the range judah frommer credit suisse analyst okay that s helpful and switching gears i thought you said that that freight was a tailwind on the inbound side in q3 is that right are you telling us that you re actually getting a benefit there or that it was less of a headwind year over year and any commentary around kind of the freight situation and driver shortages and ability to retain drivers lately would be helpful thomas l bene president and chief executive officer sure just remember we have separated a couple of things here so inbound is our gross margin and i did mention that we had some year over year positive impact of that again because later year ago we were still dealing with quite a few challenges related inbound freight so how to think about it is it has gotten better we re not feeling that kind of impact and there was a piece of that gross margin improvement that was driven by that this year as it relates to outbound we continue to have certainly we ll be managing now i think better than we were a year ago as well but we still have challenges from a transportation perspective although albeit i think the work that we re doing around recruiting and retention is much improved and we are seeing positive impacts across our operations versus a year ago in that regard joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes judah just one thing i d just to add i think i would characterize the inbound freight as less of a headwind and not necessarily a benefit in other words we ve there was some level of resetting in the overall structure that happened and but relative to tom s point to where we were at last year we re really up against the some real major challenges we have less a headwind this year we have to think about that judah frommer credit suisse analyst great thanks operator your next question comes from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim securities your line is open john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst so tom maybe 18 months ago you guys selectively added mas in a few markets so how are they performing and then if you think about the opportunity on the share side is there an opportunity today to go out and redirect some of the cost savings into more ma hiring to try to drive more share or is that not productive thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey good morning john appreciate the question so i would say first of all well feel really good about the work we did around mas a little over year ago and if you recall when talked about it back then when we have really focused on was a few tools that enabled us to do a better job of understanding where biggest opportunities were and then applying those resources to those specific geographies or areas and so we continue to believe that that targeted approach and because i think over time it s so it s not as much just about adding mas for the sake of adding mas it s about adding them where we now know we have the biggest opportunity to succeed and so we ll continue to selectively do that and we re candidly all the time evaluating our territories in each of our opportunity areas and that may yet encourage us to shift in certain areas versus others but i would say just outright adding a bunch more mas for the sake of that is not really our strategy we continue to see our territory size get a little bit larger as we are able to provide the marketing associates with more tools and support we talk a lot about the tools and support that we offer our customers on that side of the business and we continue to do i think a really nice job of building out those capabilities whether that be things like menu planning analysis for our business review process where we have our chefs engaged so i think we re continuing to focus those total resources on the local side of the business not just the marketing associate but leveraging the mas to bring these other kind of tools and capabilities that we build behind them to the market john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst and then if you guys started to give what to when you provide the next plan right what s the timeframe for that and is the idea another three year plan or sort of shift to a year by year outlook thomas l bene president and chief executive officer i don t think we haven t made a call on that yet john and so we re i think we re still working through ourselves to what s the best approach and so i d say kind of more to come we ll certainly talk with you all on where place we want to do that john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst okay thank you thomas l bene president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of ajay jain from pivotal research group your line is open ajay jain pivotal research group analyst yes hi i know you guys don t typically comment on case growth internationally in time you did mention in the prepared comments that top line in canada is really strong and then you also talked about some of the challenges in france and the uk but is there any way you can give some directional commentary about organic case growth internationally specifically for canada the uk and the rest of europe sequentially and year over year thomas l bene president and chief executive officer honestly ajay i think its part of the challenge for us in certain areas the way we are still i would say managing through that transition the cases that we talked about in the us and the consistency that we can provide you guys does not exist in that business yet and so potentially over time we might be in a place to do that but today the way we still account for the sales and the way we think about the cases of the pounds of the units that we sell in different parts of the world are not on a kind of on a consistent basis what i did say and i will reinforce here we did have a strong top line growth in canada and what we said in europe is look we had a couple of things going on in europe that are impacting us certainly that the uk and everything with brexit has created some choppiness over there our sales are positive it s just that they re not they re not growing at the rate we would like them to or we want them to at this point and then in france look i think we all thought the unrest that was going on the social unrest of france would have by now certainly clear and it just has not and while that s it s not a huge impact as that s a big country there are certainly still some things going on there that are creating issues for our customers and there for us getting products to them so long way of saying i think we still feel generally good about those businesses we would have like to see a little more top line growth in europe in this last quarter and that s kind of built into my prepared comments driving that overall numbers we feel good about the us numbers and certainly about canada we just don t have the information in a way that we feel like it s easily providable to you guys ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay thank you would it be possible to confirm how much you ve allocated for severance in q3 and year to date i think there were some kind of breakdown provided last quarter for canada and europe but i m just wondering if there s any update on severance that includes us foodservice and also wondering if you can give your outlook for severance for q4 joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer ajay there s volumes to that i mean they re non gaap rest i mean we do have a fair amount of details that is probably the best i d be able to give you here in terms of spilling that out again obviously if you think about the areas certainly really across our business we ve had a little bit finance technology roadmaps certainly we talked about at corporate here in the us side obviously the canada regionalization some of the work being done freight in terms of those programs i mean obviously again some of that i think you ll see fallout in some of our non gaap direct but i think that s inaudible the best to view that and the only thing i would say is obviously there s some pretty sizable numbers in there particularly last quarter as it relates to europe obviously that was well not all inclusive if i would say that was obviously the biggest majority what s going to come there in at least in that part of the world ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay and in terms of the impact from the recent headcount restructuring will that be more reflected in q4 or was the majority of that allocated in q3 joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean i think the majority again the majority of that is actually going to be in within q2 but then also here in q3 so i wouldn t expect that a lot of that which reflected in q4 obviously the benefits we were starting to realize here as we talked about in the second half of the year as we head into next year ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay i had one final question if i can i think you ve made some adjustments in the financials for accelerated depreciation year to date i m not sure if there was any impact in q3 itself but i thought at this point you should have cycled the technology restructuring plan from a few years ago and maybe i can get some clarification offline but i thought conceptually at this point there should be any residual impact from the sap accelerated depreciation unless your year to date adjustments are for europe or unrelated to the previous joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i wouldn t think about it that way i mean we actually had some d a in particularly on d side volume increased this quarter that was related to i would call accelerated depreciation in europe for the most part there s some as tom referred to this earlier there are some of the technology changes we re making over there that again allowed us to actually accelerate some depreciation there and so the majority of the depreciation increase you re seeing is related to some technology transitions in europe but it s not related to what you re talking about before in terms of the inaudible here in the us ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vincent sinisi from morgan stanley your line is open vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst hey great good morning guys thanks very much for taking my questions wanted to just go back to the choppiness in the top line in the domestic business obviously as you said a few times it seems like more kind of february and weather specifically but just wondering was there a lot of variability that you could see by region another way of asking was it basically the weather and largely february the way to think of it or were there any other factors that might just be worth us knowing thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes i would say nothing that was inconsistent with what you just said i mean i think we just when i talked about weather we saw certain parts of the country where there were more impacts than others so i wouldn t say nothing else beyond that that we saw vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay and then just on i appreciate the color on the iowa premium versus the three year plan but as you had this quarter very nice expense control just kind of curious more from like a high level perspective like with the buckets that you are getting more the kind of cost cuts efforts pulled to date how much kind of lead time or planning is there with some of the levers that you had to pull kind of said in another way like kind of how much quarter by quarter planning or impact or not is there any kind of way to think about that thomas l bene president and chief executive officer maybe i ll start and then let joel chime in if you think about the way our business operates we have regular operating expense which is generally built into the businesses that is going to have probably a pretty consistent cadence depending on volume and our top line being a big driver right so there s a lot of that s driven by cost per unit in addition we ve talked about big strategic initiatives like finance transformation like canada regionalization like smart spending that we have planned out and we believe we have a good use to win those impacts will be happening and then we have things like our last quarter when we announced the corporate restructuring that s more of a one time event where we would see that coming into the business so a long way of saying it i think generally speaking our operating expense moves with our business performance meeting our volume and then and certainly any headwinds or tailwinds we see in the business fuel being a great example of headwind we re feeling right now certainly things like driver and warehouse turnover in the past and just a low employment rates driving higher cost of some of those roles in the company but everything else is generally planned out and we have visibility to that except for these one timers does that get what you re asking vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst yes no that was very helpful and did get out of it thank you tom thomas l bene president and chief executive officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of john ivankoe from jpmorgan your line is open john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst hi thank you i wanted to follow up on some comments that were made about maybe independent restaurants being a little bit softer in the march quarter i mean whether we adjust for weather or not and i mean the context of the question really what i m getting at is have you seen a significant rate of openings for independent restaurants in other words your addressable customer base maybe over the last 12 months and considering the amount of labor pressure that independent restaurants are facing and just margins which were in general lower than chains are you actually seeing a pickup in closures on the independent side that s noteworthy even on like a very market specific basis thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey john good morning look i wouldn t say anything that s unique that s happened there i mean as you we all know in this industry you ve got a lot of new business coming online all the time and you also have folks that are closing i don t wouldn t say we have seen any dramatic shift in that area as i mentioned the different data sources have some mixed information but all of them generally talk about positive spend dollars being up in that kind of 2 5 to 3 5 range and then you have traffic generally down with the exception of npd which is showing slight increase in traffic so i don t think there s anything unique or anything in this quarter that we ve seen that is highly different than what we ve seen in the past quarters john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst and is there anything to note by category or by regional that you re beginning to see and obviously you might think there s a lot of questions that are being asked you of whether you think there s a slowdown and i think the answer at least as it stands today is no but when you look at different categories or different regions is there anything interesting that you re seeing in the marketplace a little bit more detail either positive or negative that you can basically talk about now that gives us i guess a little somewhat of a forecast of the future from sysco s perspective as opposed to some of the third party sources that you use for your data thomas l bene president and chief executive officer not really i mean there s nothing else that i would tell you that we re seeing is any different john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst understood thank you thomas l bene president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of kelly bania from bmo capital your line is open kelly bania bmo capital analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions just going back to expenses again it seems like there was a good amount of upside at least in our model on the international can we think about the performance this quarter i think it was down about 30 million year over year is that kind of the right run rate to think about for the next few quarters international and then maybe can you tie in just the impact of the corporate restructuring on the expense performance this quarter joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes kelly i ll start and i think the answer to that is i mean obviously we re continuing to do a lot of work there as to streamline and make our operations more efficient i guess i d say there is some run rate consistency there but right i would also tell you is that i mean there is inaudible a lot of moving parts right now in some of our international business what i would not necessarily tie it to one of the things we talked about in the past is the sizable transformation we re doing in france i think the majority of that benefit really we start to see next year so i would not tie a lot of that necessarily to the sort of that the restructuring that we re doing in our french business but i would say generally speaking i think it s i mean it s fair to continue to see that as a relative run rate realizing again we just got a lot of moving parts over there that in terms of transformation we re doing so i guess my answer is generally is yes but again there is just realize things are not going to move around quarter to quarter based on the amount of stuffs we got moving around in that business kelly bania bmo capital analyst okay that s helpful and maybe just in terms of the us broadline business can you talk a little bit about some of the specialty meat and produced some of the categories that aren t necessarily part of the normal case growth and what kind of trends you re seeing in those other areas of the us business thomas l bene president and chief executive officer sure this is tom kelly good morning i think we continue to feel really good about our specialty company strategy as we ve talked for a few years we know that our customers truly value broadline but they also have these oftentimes they can be better met by some specialty companies and in our case meat seafood poultry and that side and then the produced freshpoint and so i think we continue to feel really good about overall what we bring to the market and the value proposition we have there we ve been working on ways of even helping our customers to make that easier for them to procure products both from sysco and from the sysco specialty companies and we re seeing benefits of that as well and so creating the environment where it s easier for them to kind of do business with both of those entities as they need to and as they feel like they want to and so versus the feeling maybe like two or three different companies with they re doing business with the idea that they can do business with one sysco and then get the value out of that so we continue to believe that s an important part of the market and we continue to feel really good about the work we re doing there kelly bania bmo capital analyst thank you thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes operator your final question comes from the line of bob summers at buckingham your line is open bob summers buckingham analyst hey good morning guys so i just wanted to dig a little deeper into the transportation dry van spot rates have been contracting all year so can you maybe talk about how that flows through in your business either by talking about the percent of business that you do at the spot rate maybe talk about how that spot rate influences contract rates as you may be threatened to move more to the spot market and then lastly how that impacts what you have to pay your drivers thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey bob again getting back to this conversation about transportation and cost the piece you re really referring to is the inbound freight part for us which does hit our gross margin and we called out in the prepared comments and we ve talked a bit here this morning about that we are seeing some year over year improvement benefit there it s not huge and it s not something that is a major driver for us but the market has come down certainly from where it was a year ago and obviously everybody benefits from that we obviously try to minimize the spot market because when that that s the one that gets the most out of whack the fastest and that s what happened a year ago so we continue to manage that side of our business mostly with contracts but yes it certainly as that whole market comes down that affects both sides the spot and contract side and as it relates to our drivers as we said i think we ve done a lot of work around both recruiting and retention and the way we re operating our business to improve as much as we can our driver retention and so we feel better about where we re at than we were year ago but it continues to be a challenging part of the business and i think will be as long as of the markets the way it is meaning unemployment s low and there s a lot of freight on the road so we feel a much better where we are now than we were a year ago but that doesn t mean that we don t still have ongoing challenges associated with hiring and retention of drivers bob summers buckingham analyst okay thanks thomas l bene president and chief executive officer good day operator that

business transformation initiatives the improved pace the performance for the second half of fiscal 2019 we previously spoke off is in fact taking shape and while we still have work to do we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted operating income growth target and now expect that to be at the low end of the 650 million to 700 million range joel and i will both elaborate on this further from a total sysco perspective our third quarter results include increased sales of 2 2 to 14 7 billion gross profit growth of 2 9 and adjusted operating expense decreased of 0 4 which translated into an adjusted operating income increase of 16 6 to 620 million and an adjusted earnings per share increase of 17 4 to 0 79 turning the us restaurant industry data the overall sales trends remain mixed according to black box and naftrack saw some choppiness throughout the quarter as march data was generally positive compared to february in part due to weather which negatively impacted february sales additionally same store sales were positive for the quarter although traffic once again declined however even with this recent choppy industry choppy industry performance the overall macro trends remained generally favorable for our customers as illustrated by continued low unemployment which was at 3 8 for march and strong gdp growth for the first quarter at 3 2 economic growth in the international markets in which we operate was mostly positive this includes modest growth in the food service sector although we continue to see the impacts of brexit on our uk business due to uncertainty and low consumer confidence in canada the consumer confidence index continues to rise with march seeing the third consecutive monthly increase with technomic forecasting the canadian food service industry to grow 0 6 in real terms or 4 1 on a nominal basis for calendar year 2019 additionally we continue to see reasonable overall trends in the other international markets where we do business as we discussed last quarter we anticipated seeing an increased benefit from our transformation initiatives beginning in the second half of this year and we began to see those benefits show up this quarter overall our results included a bit softer top line than expected offset by good overall expense management which delivered solid operating profit performance that was in line with our expectations examples of initiatives that are driving benefits from an expense management perspective include our field finance transformation and the corporate office administrative restructuring which we implemented last quarter as it relates to acquisitions in april we acquired j m wholesale meats and imperio foods two smaller central california distributors j m meats is a food service distributor that specializes in key center of the plate products and imperio foods carries dry canned good products which both are complementary to our existing broadline business in the central california area they also provide sysco with the opportunity to further extend our reach to the important hispanic customer segment we will begin to see the impact to our business in the fourth quarter from both of these acquisitions additionally in the quarter we made the decision to sell our iowa premium cattle processing business while our three year plan forecast included positive operating income for this business we believe the divestiture of this business is in alignment with our strategic priorities and allows us to focus on our core strength as a distributor the transaction will result in a reduction of planned operating income of approximately 25 million and is the reason for us now projecting to achieve the low end of our adjusted operating income growth range now i d like to transition to our third quarter results by business segment beginning with us foodservice operations sales for the third quarter were 10 1 billion an increase of 4 1 gross profit grew 5 1 including an improvement in gross margin of 18 basis points adjusted operating expenses grew 2 3 and adjusted operating income increased 10 total case volume within us broadline grew modestly at 2 1 for the quarter of which 1 3 was organic however we delivered relatively solid growth in our local business as local case growth was up 3 1 of which 2 2 was organic we are pleased with the gross profit growth we delivered for the quarter which was impacted by a number of factors including continued positive momentum from category management as we continue to deepen our relationships with our strategic supplier partners year over year favorability from the impact of inbound freight and continued growth in our sysco branded products which increased by 28 basis points with our local customers this quarter in addition the inflation rate for the quarter was 2 3 in us broadline up nearly a point in the second quarter of this fiscal year technology continues to be one of our fundamental enablers of growth as we transform our business to serve our customers in ways that best meet their needs we are continuing to provide new capabilities and tools to enable an improved experience of doing business with sysco including new ordering tools which has driven our e commerce ordering utilization to more than 53 with our local customers from a cost perspective within us foodservice operations our expense management was solid as adjusted operating expenses were 2 3 for the quarter while we continue to see supply chain cost challenges in the warehouse and transportation areas we are seeing positive momentum from our recruiting on boarding and retention initiatives these challenges were partially offset by continued improvement seen as a result of our routing optimization initiatives and ongoing process improvements furthermore our finance transformation and smart spending initiative have also provided benefits in the quarter moving on to international foodservice operations for the quarter sales decreased 1 5 gross profit decreased 3 1 adjusted operating expenses decreased by 5 8 and adjusted operating income grew 30 we saw solid overall performance in canada with strong top line growth and solid gross profit dollar growth of more than 5 driven in part by an inflation rate of 2 6 along with strong expense management partially benefiting from our ongoing regionalization efforts which are progressing well in europe we continue to have mixed results the uk continues to feel the effects of brexit uncertainty causing depressed consumer confidence however our brakes uk business continues to stabilize operationally as a result of our multi year initiatives to transform the business in france social unrest continues to impact tourism and consequently food away from home consumption our sales performance during the third quarter was adversely impacted by this unrest and by some operational challenges associated with integrating brakes france and davigel into sysco france that said the overall integration and supply chain transformation continues to be on track to deliver long term benefits that are part of our multi year plan as for our business in latin america we continue to see growth opportunities in this region both with our chain restaurant customers and with our expansion of cash and carry locations to complement our broad line footprint in both costa rica and panama moving on to sygma we continue to make disciplined choices in an effort to deliver improved profitability in q3 we saw expected softness in the top line due to transition customers while seeing gross margin increased by 28 basis points year over year solid expense management drove adjusted operating expenses down 7 1 versus prior year resulting in significantly improved operating performance in an effort to improve overall profitability in this important segment of the business we will continue to take a very disciplined approach to growth as we move forward lastly in our other business segment we ve recently announced the restructuring of gas supply as the industry landscape evolves we are focusing on optimizing our business model in creating a more focused and agile organization to better meet the changing needs of our customers the new operating structures created three distinct business units under the parent company guest worldwide the business units include gilchrist soames our amenity manufacturing unit manchester mills one of the world s leading textile producers and guest supply which serves the world s top hotel chains and independent properties in over 100 countries as a full spectrum distribution solution provider in summary we continue to feel good about the fundamentals of our business our customer and operational strategies are firmly aligned around enriching our customers experience doing business with sysco and we remain focused on engaging our 67 000 dedicated associates around the world to deliver against our financial objectives associated with our three year plan let me now turn the call over to joel grade our chief financial officer joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you tom and good morning everyone i d like to provide you with additional financial details surrounding our performance for the quarter as tom mentioned earlier we saw improved year over year results for the third quarter although we saw some softness in the top line our earnings reflect solid expense management and strong adjusted operating income growth which are in line with what we previously stated and our results of our enterprise wide transformational initiatives these initiatives which are designed to streamline efficiencies and allow us to reinvest in the business to facilitate continued growth include our finance transformation roadmap smart spending and the canadian regionalization initiative for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 total sysco sales grew 2 2 foreign exchange rates negatively affected total sysco sales by approximately 1 1 in our us broadline business we experienced 2 3 inflation driven by a few categories including the frozen potato poultry and meat categories and we are managing this modest increase in inflation well gross profit in the third quarter increased 2 9 and gross margin increased 14 basis points while adjusted operating expenses decreased by 0 4 resulting in strong adjusted operating income growth of 16 6 to 620 million changes in foreign exchange rates decreased adjusted operating income by 34 basis points although it will vary from quarter to quarter we are focused on maintaining the 150 basis point gap between gross profit dollars and operating expense dollars that we committed to as part of our three year plan in order to achieve our adjusted operating income growth target turning to earnings per share our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter increased 0 12 to 0 79 per share our eps results this quarter were impacted by our strong operating income adjusted tax rate foreign exchange impact and stock option exercises i d now like to discuss our tax rate for the quarter the gaap effective tax rate of negative 2 for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 is primarily attributable to the determination made during the quarter to recognize the favorable impact of 95 million of foreign tax credits generated as a result of distributions to sysco from our foreign operations at the end of fiscal 2018 our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21 looking to our fourth quarter we would expect our effective tax rate to be in the 23 to 25 range now turning to cash flow cash flow from operations was 1 4 billion for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 which is 244 million higher compared to the prior year period pre cash flow for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 was 1 billion which was 233 million higher compared to the prior year the improvement in free cash flow was primarily due to last year s pension contribution partially offset by cash taxes and the impact to working capital from an increase in day sales outstanding net capital expenditures totaled 367 million for the first 39 weeks of fiscal 2019 which was 10 8 million higher compared to the prior year period for the full year fiscal 2019 we now expect the capital expenditure forecast of approximately 1 1 of sales down slightly from our previously stated 1 2 that said there are no changes to the prioritize order of capital allocation which is as follows investing in the business consistently growing our dividend participating in m a and a balanced approach to share buybacks and paying down debt as tom mentioned earlier with the anticipated sale of iowa premium we expect to achieve our target at the low end with 650 million to 700 million range as a result of our planned operating income being decreased by 25 million in summary we saw improved year over year results for the third quarter led by a continued momentum from improved underlying business performance solid local case growth and good cost management that said we have more work to do in order to achieve the financial objectives of our three year plan although we remain confident in our ability to achieve these objectives we are committed to serving our customers and delivering at a high level of execution in all areas of our business that will improve our financial performance in both the near and long term operator we are now ready for q a questions and answers operator operator instructions your first question is from christopher mandeville from jefferies your line is open christopher mandeville jefferies analyst hey good morning can you speak to the gross margin improvement in the quarter and maybe help us understand those referenced impacts by order of magnitude and then tom or joel as it relates to private label penetration it was again expansion but it was one of the lower rates we ve seen in recent quarters so maybe you could kind of help us understand that as to whether or not it was an anomaly and we can return back to that 50 bps to 60 bps of expansion going forward or any color would be appreciated joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes sure chris good morning it s joel yes i think the way i ll think about that again it s truly balanced across some of the levers outside but i mean certainly our continued opportunities in our sysco brand certainly are a strong driver as well as continuing category management efforts and we continue this again obviously this is not one when it was five years ago when we had this giant year over year jump but the reality of it is we continue to enhance our relationships with our suppliers and we continue to drive our category management as well across our again our business and so i think those are some of the areas that s certainly are driving again inaudible the margin percentage but yeah i m really talking about what we think about most and that is our gross profit dollars we obviously also have some favorable inaudible inflation in our world clearly it s something that ultimately certainly in the moderate range it s at today is a good driver of opportunities again to move to continue to push cost of goods through to our customers and so that s certainly beneficial in terms of the dollars and gross profit and i would say it s not necessarily at the levels of that detrimental really again it s the composite that i think we manage we re managing this cost of goods inflation well and i think that s really really going to be a factor this is yes this comp inflation inaudible in our warehouse in terms where this thing now functions best so i don t really say those are still the main drivers of what we re looking at here and just in general some of the tools that you heard about in the past in terms of again revenue management continue to help us to drive our margins in a positive way thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey chris this is thomas just maybe two other things that i reinforce as well we didn t get some positive year over year benefit on the inbound freight side which is we ve talked in the past doesn t impact gross margin and then your specific question around sysco brand and we look at 28 basis point improvement is a very positive number still as long as that continues to move in the right direction that s a reflection for us so but a couple of things one our customers still reacting positively to all sysco brand and two we continue to bring innovative ideas and solutions to the market so we have to view that to be a solid number well it might be a little less on the growth than you ve seen in a couple of other quarters it s still early good number christopher mandeville jefferies analyst okay and then just my final question would be as you brought it up your inflation what should we ll be expecting in the coming quarter and if there s a willingness would you guys be able to disclose organic case growth quarter to date joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and so i mean i think the just on your question on inflation i mean i think certainly our forecast is we continue to see i ll say moderate levels of inflation as we as we move forward certainly over the next couple of quarters there s nothing that jumps out necessarily that would be really significant in terms of the overall inflation numbers so i don t think we expect certainly additional again moderate levels of inflation over the next couple of quarters organic case growth but i think that was part of the us foodservice sales 2 2 was the overall number that was organic thomas l bene president and chief executive officer but you re asking year to date right chris and that s joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes christopher mandeville jefferies analyst quarter to date thomas l bene president and chief executive officer quarter to date numbers ok christopher mandeville jefferies analyst yes just joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so christopher mandeville jefferies analyst if i strip out some of the noise from weather and what have you and maybe expect the calendar shift for easter as well joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes so i think so when you talk about there is local our local case volume for the quarter was the question i was answering was 2 2 it was organic total case volume organically was 1 3 inaudible christopher mandeville jefferies analyst but is there any real comment for april thomas l bene president and chief executive officer not really i mean we continue to were off i think we feel good about the continued momentum of the business and i don t use anything necessarily easter there was a bit of an easter shift but not a big shift given the timing of when it fell last year in the quarter versus this year christopher mandeville jefferies analyst okay thanks guys joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes operator your next question comes from the line of edward kelly from wells fargo your line is open edward kelly wells fargo analyst yes hi guys good morning thomas l bene president and chief executive officer good morning edward kelly wells fargo analyst can i i want to start with opex and i was hoping that you could give us a little bit of help here i mean obviously you had a big quarter from a cost perspective maybe just dig in a little bit more related to the drivers and i m asking this question because i think a lot of the accelerated efforts that you guys have been talking about weren t supposed to be at a full run rate this quarter so i m just trying to figure out how we think about opex going forward and then as part of this q4 s comparison looks pretty hard i think at workers comp benefit last year at the lap ph can you get to that 1 5 spread in q4 joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer well i ll start ed i mean i think a couple of things i would say to that number one i ll maybe take the last point first 1 5 point spread obviously in and i think it s in my prepared comments is it s something we looked at over the course of the three year plan that doesn t mean that necessarily every quarter is going to look the same some actually higher some actually possibly will be more as obviously we ve seen in both here i think the way i would look at it though i mean again as we did signal we do anticipate some improved performances in the second of the year obviously some of these plans have started kick in from our finance technology roadmap smart spending work the canadian regionalization some of the other administrative class work that we did around some of our corporate office transitions i think the again we feel good about our those things kicking in as we said in the second half this year as we head into the next year as well i would also call out just again overall our operating performance continues to be pretty strong and the expense line that s a good face of actually we had some a little bit of a few headwinds this particular quarter and that was about 0 03 a case so i mean we had i think question is do you expect this to continue in these areas i do to your point there are some headwinds that we re anticipating that we re going up against in the fourth quarter but certainly as we ve talked about here for a little while we certainly anticipated our leverage in the second half of the year to be better than first half and i think we certainly start to see that edward kelly wells fargo analyst okay and then just a follow up on capex so the capex guidance is down a bit can you just talk a bit about what s driving that i don t know if iowa premium has anything to do with it and how sustainable rate of sort of 1 1 will be going forward joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer well i mean i again i the way i always look at that i mean number one it s not bad inaudible forecast but i mean in reality if it is we spend our capex make our investments based truly underneath of the business there s been absolutely no change in terms of our perspective on our capital allocation priorities that always start with investing in our business we re obviously very committed to doing that we ve got a lot of change programs and if things transitioning our organization will continue to require investment i would just tell you from a timing perspective some of those things happened again at things do move around in the businesses in some ways so some of that probably timing versus anything but i will definitely not take away that there is some change in terms of the way we re looking at forecasting our capex we just yes we just adjust spending an investment in terms of the needs of business edward kelly wells fargo analyst great thanks guys thomas l bene president and chief executive officer thanks ed operator your next question comes from the line of karen short from barclays your line is open karen short barclays capital analyst hi thanks first thing i do want to ask was in terms of the composition of the now i guess kind of 650 million is there any change to this the breakout between gross profit and then the supply chain versus the admin joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer no karen so there is not that was just we only shifted that was related to the demonstrated sales of business but no there is no bucketing difference if you will karen short barclays capital analyst okay and then the same question i just want to ask i know you have obviously mentioned and you have been mentioning positive same store sales but traffic weakness so i was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about trends with traffic and i guess same store sales on a true like mom and pop local basis in terms of the independent versus kind of the micro chains any patterns or differences you could point to there thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes good morning karen this is tom i mean look i think we ve seen certainly some choppiness this quarter particular and i think there are probably a bunch of different things driving that but it depends really on what source you look at i mean npd would call out that well overall spend is up traffic is up in some areas as well and down in others and black box and naftrack as they re probably more a little bit more consistent and they called traffic down really across most of the segments so i think it s driven by everything from some weather choppiness in q3 our q3 and mostly in february and then i think again kind of consumer efforts during that time the small chains seem to be doing a little bit better so that s going to be kind of micro chains and then the pure independents at least in this quarter according to npd tend to be a little bit softer but i wouldn t say from our perspective we have seen necessarily any major difference in trend line that we ve experienced over the last couple of quarters so we continue to feel like this independent growth that we ve had in that sector is doing well and then we continue to feel pretty confident in our ability to continue to grow and take share in that space karen short barclays capital analyst okay and then just last housekeeping and corporate came in on a dollar basis so a lot higher than i was i would have expected given the layoffs that you d announced i don t know if that s just an allocation issue or what because i would have thought on the dollar basis it would have been quite a bit down sequentially in year over year joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer i mean when you re talking about the last kind of the specifically corporate layoffs inaudible again part of we re talking in total new administrative cost karen short barclays capital analyst yes joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer obviously there s a lot of things that are part of what we say our finance psychology roadmap that are very much fueled focused and so in fact one of the things we talked about in the first half year is that there were again why don t we feel confident about this inaudible by notification the sizable number of our field personnel and so i would tell you i think the majority which you re seeing is pretty is probably even more fuel focused than the corporate franchise balanced between the two karen short barclays capital analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of andrew wolf from loop capital markets your line is open andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst good morning wanted to follow up on the cadence of sales question that people asked about you guys said january was strong on a good weather comparison february a bit not good should we take away from there sort of march and april of somewhat normalized i mean people trying to get were obviously trying to get sense of whether the industry has slowed or not year over yea sort of and on a normalized basis thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes i think we would say that that s we feel like certainly things since the weather impacts in the early part of the quarter things have stabilized andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst and i noticed you gave us i may have missed this but i heard a technomic s forecast for canada do you have one for the us that you might be able to share with us thomas l bene president and chief executive officer as you know technomic kind of gets out ahead off and they do it by quarter kind of by sorry by some segment i may have that information which should i i have but i can get it to you we maybe need to get back to you on that but we generally do have that information andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst okay and i just had one other question unrelated sales so in the you took a 35 million charge that was related to the a change in the business technology strategy so could you expand a little upon that what the changes in your business expand business technology strategy thomas l bene president and chief executive officer so just can you clearer inaudible excuse me ask the question little more clearly andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst of the 72 million charges you excluded out of operating expense and 35 million was allocated for what you call the change in business technology strategy is that basically go into the cloud and could you expand on so we can understand a little better thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes and some of that is also got kind of a variety of things when there was actually an accelerated position we took in europe that was related also to a technology change so i mean yeah there s been a few things that again and that number also it just accelerated our g a a little bit but i wouldn t say there s one thing that is fell into there are a number of things that are just parts of our technology strategy they are included in that number and there s not necessarily one big thing there and there is not one thing i would inaudible to take away would not be that we somehow have a significant change in technology because we do not there s just a variety of things going on andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst and that was what i was trying to get to so appreciate it thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes think of it is more specifically around the finance transformation which is the technology component of it and then the european work we ve been doing where we had and erp in france that we ve been updating and so those are the two main drivers of it andrew wolf loop capital markets analyst thank you joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes operator your next question comes from the line of marisa sullivan from bank of america merrill lynch your line is open marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst great good morning thanks for taking the question i just wanted to touch on fuel quickly and you call it that there was a slight headwind in the third quarter how should we think about fuel in the fourth quarter as it impacts your expense joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i can on fuel side i d anticipate some of those continued headwinds as we headed into the fourth quarter and probably a little bit in as we head into the next year as well marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you and then just we haven t heard you guys talk about category management a while on these calls please i m wondering was there anything you guys were doing differently in the third quarter that kind of made it a greater impact anything that you re planning for the fourth quarter as we should think about gross margin in catman thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey marisa it s tom no i wouldn t say anything unique i think what we re just trying to highlight is we continue to it s an ongoing process it has been now for years and we re starting to do some deeper work with some of our more strategic supplier partners and think about inaudible is some potentially long term benefits as we began to partner more deeply with some suppliers marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you and are you seeing any impacts or any customer feedback on category management are they liking what you re doing or is it are they having to adjust through assortment changes thomas l bene president and chief executive officer no i think we re at a point now where it s early early days so kind of a few years ago now i think we because we were changing some suppliers in some areas or products that was creating some choppiness so we ve actually continued to have a very good feedback from our customers around the work we re doing in catman obviously that drives cost benefit for them they re very excited about that and as i mentioned we are getting more focused on strategic partnerships so that we can have more consistent supply for the long term so generally it s very positive marisa sullivan bank of america merrill lynch analyst got you thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of judah frommer from credit suisse your line is open judah frommer credit suisse analyst hi thanks for taking the question maybe first just on the changes to guidance related to iowa premium i think you said it s the entire kind of reduction in guidance is due to iowa premium but if we re stripping 25 million out obviously that s not necessarily the low end so when you say the low end are you saying 650 million to 675 million effectively joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so i think and here s they way i would think about that judah i think what we talked about really inaudible really around the midpoint of the range and so if you do 650 million to 700 million that will be 675 million really we re talking about here is a 25 million related iowa premium and yes that is the only adjustment to our guidance at this point which takes us from that midpoint down to that lower end of the range judah frommer credit suisse analyst okay that s helpful and switching gears i thought you said that that freight was a tailwind on the inbound side in q3 is that right are you telling us that you re actually getting a benefit there or that it was less of a headwind year over year and any commentary around kind of the freight situation and driver shortages and ability to retain drivers lately would be helpful thomas l bene president and chief executive officer sure just remember we have separated a couple of things here so inbound is our gross margin and i did mention that we had some year over year positive impact of that again because later year ago we were still dealing with quite a few challenges related inbound freight so how to think about it is it has gotten better we re not feeling that kind of impact and there was a piece of that gross margin improvement that was driven by that this year as it relates to outbound we continue to have certainly we ll be managing now i think better than we were a year ago as well but we still have challenges from a transportation perspective although albeit i think the work that we re doing around recruiting and retention is much improved and we are seeing positive impacts across our operations versus a year ago in that regard joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes judah just one thing i d just to add i think i would characterize the inbound freight as less of a headwind and not necessarily a benefit in other words we ve there was some level of resetting in the overall structure that happened and but relative to tom s point to where we were at last year we re really up against the some real major challenges we have less a headwind this year we have to think about that judah frommer credit suisse analyst great thanks operator your next question comes from the line of john heinbockel from guggenheim securities your line is open john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst so tom maybe 18 months ago you guys selectively added mas in a few markets so how are they performing and then if you think about the opportunity on the share side is there an opportunity today to go out and redirect some of the cost savings into more ma hiring to try to drive more share or is that not productive thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey good morning john appreciate the question so i would say first of all well feel really good about the work we did around mas a little over year ago and if you recall when talked about it back then when we have really focused on was a few tools that enabled us to do a better job of understanding where biggest opportunities were and then applying those resources to those specific geographies or areas and so we continue to believe that that targeted approach and because i think over time it s so it s not as much just about adding mas for the sake of adding mas it s about adding them where we now know we have the biggest opportunity to succeed and so we ll continue to selectively do that and we re candidly all the time evaluating our territories in each of our opportunity areas and that may yet encourage us to shift in certain areas versus others but i would say just outright adding a bunch more mas for the sake of that is not really our strategy we continue to see our territory size get a little bit larger as we are able to provide the marketing associates with more tools and support we talk a lot about the tools and support that we offer our customers on that side of the business and we continue to do i think a really nice job of building out those capabilities whether that be things like menu planning analysis for our business review process where we have our chefs engaged so i think we re continuing to focus those total resources on the local side of the business not just the marketing associate but leveraging the mas to bring these other kind of tools and capabilities that we build behind them to the market john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst and then if you guys started to give what to when you provide the next plan right what s the timeframe for that and is the idea another three year plan or sort of shift to a year by year outlook thomas l bene president and chief executive officer i don t think we haven t made a call on that yet john and so we re i think we re still working through ourselves to what s the best approach and so i d say kind of more to come we ll certainly talk with you all on where place we want to do that john heinbockel guggenheim securities analyst okay thank you thomas l bene president and chief executive officer thank you operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of ajay jain from pivotal research group your line is open ajay jain pivotal research group analyst yes hi i know you guys don t typically comment on case growth internationally in time you did mention in the prepared comments that top line in canada is really strong and then you also talked about some of the challenges in france and the uk but is there any way you can give some directional commentary about organic case growth internationally specifically for canada the uk and the rest of europe sequentially and year over year thomas l bene president and chief executive officer honestly ajay i think its part of the challenge for us in certain areas the way we are still i would say managing through that transition the cases that we talked about in the us and the consistency that we can provide you guys does not exist in that business yet and so potentially over time we might be in a place to do that but today the way we still account for the sales and the way we think about the cases of the pounds of the units that we sell in different parts of the world are not on a kind of on a consistent basis what i did say and i will reinforce here we did have a strong top line growth in canada and what we said in europe is look we had a couple of things going on in europe that are impacting us certainly that the uk and everything with brexit has created some choppiness over there our sales are positive it s just that they re not they re not growing at the rate we would like them to or we want them to at this point and then in france look i think we all thought the unrest that was going on the social unrest of france would have by now certainly clear and it just has not and while that s it s not a huge impact as that s a big country there are certainly still some things going on there that are creating issues for our customers and there for us getting products to them so long way of saying i think we still feel generally good about those businesses we would have like to see a little more top line growth in europe in this last quarter and that s kind of built into my prepared comments driving that overall numbers we feel good about the us numbers and certainly about canada we just don t have the information in a way that we feel like it s easily providable to you guys ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay thank you would it be possible to confirm how much you ve allocated for severance in q3 and year to date i think there were some kind of breakdown provided last quarter for canada and europe but i m just wondering if there s any update on severance that includes us foodservice and also wondering if you can give your outlook for severance for q4 joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer ajay there s volumes to that i mean they re non gaap rest i mean we do have a fair amount of details that is probably the best i d be able to give you here in terms of spilling that out again obviously if you think about the areas certainly really across our business we ve had a little bit finance technology roadmaps certainly we talked about at corporate here in the us side obviously the canada regionalization some of the work being done freight in terms of those programs i mean obviously again some of that i think you ll see fallout in some of our non gaap direct but i think that s inaudible the best to view that and the only thing i would say is obviously there s some pretty sizable numbers in there particularly last quarter as it relates to europe obviously that was well not all inclusive if i would say that was obviously the biggest majority what s going to come there in at least in that part of the world ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay and in terms of the impact from the recent headcount restructuring will that be more reflected in q4 or was the majority of that allocated in q3 joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean i think the majority again the majority of that is actually going to be in within q2 but then also here in q3 so i wouldn t expect that a lot of that which reflected in q4 obviously the benefits we were starting to realize here as we talked about in the second half of the year as we head into next year ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay i had one final question if i can i think you ve made some adjustments in the financials for accelerated depreciation year to date i m not sure if there was any impact in q3 itself but i thought at this point you should have cycled the technology restructuring plan from a few years ago and maybe i can get some clarification offline but i thought conceptually at this point there should be any residual impact from the sap accelerated depreciation unless your year to date adjustments are for europe or unrelated to the previous joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i wouldn t think about it that way i mean we actually had some d a in particularly on d side volume increased this quarter that was related to i would call accelerated depreciation in europe for the most part there s some as tom referred to this earlier there are some of the technology changes we re making over there that again allowed us to actually accelerate some depreciation there and so the majority of the depreciation increase you re seeing is related to some technology transitions in europe but it s not related to what you re talking about before in terms of the inaudible here in the us ajay jain pivotal research group analyst okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vincent sinisi from morgan stanley your line is open vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst hey great good morning guys thanks very much for taking my questions wanted to just go back to the choppiness in the top line in the domestic business obviously as you said a few times it seems like more kind of february and weather specifically but just wondering was there a lot of variability that you could see by region another way of asking was it basically the weather and largely february the way to think of it or were there any other factors that might just be worth us knowing thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes i would say nothing that was inconsistent with what you just said i mean i think we just when i talked about weather we saw certain parts of the country where there were more impacts than others so i wouldn t say nothing else beyond that that we saw vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst okay and then just on i appreciate the color on the iowa premium versus the three year plan but as you had this quarter very nice expense control just kind of curious more from like a high level perspective like with the buckets that you are getting more the kind of cost cuts efforts pulled to date how much kind of lead time or planning is there with some of the levers that you had to pull kind of said in another way like kind of how much quarter by quarter planning or impact or not is there any kind of way to think about that thomas l bene president and chief executive officer maybe i ll start and then let joel chime in if you think about the way our business operates we have regular operating expense which is generally built into the businesses that is going to have probably a pretty consistent cadence depending on volume and our top line being a big driver right so there s a lot of that s driven by cost per unit in addition we ve talked about big strategic initiatives like finance transformation like canada regionalization like smart spending that we have planned out and we believe we have a good use to win those impacts will be happening and then we have things like our last quarter when we announced the corporate restructuring that s more of a one time event where we would see that coming into the business so a long way of saying it i think generally speaking our operating expense moves with our business performance meeting our volume and then and certainly any headwinds or tailwinds we see in the business fuel being a great example of headwind we re feeling right now certainly things like driver and warehouse turnover in the past and just a low employment rates driving higher cost of some of those roles in the company but everything else is generally planned out and we have visibility to that except for these one timers does that get what you re asking vincent sinisi morgan stanley analyst yes no that was very helpful and did get out of it thank you tom thomas l bene president and chief executive officer okay operator your next question comes from the line of john ivankoe from jpmorgan your line is open john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst hi thank you i wanted to follow up on some comments that were made about maybe independent restaurants being a little bit softer in the march quarter i mean whether we adjust for weather or not and i mean the context of the question really what i m getting at is have you seen a significant rate of openings for independent restaurants in other words your addressable customer base maybe over the last 12 months and considering the amount of labor pressure that independent restaurants are facing and just margins which were in general lower than chains are you actually seeing a pickup in closures on the independent side that s noteworthy even on like a very market specific basis thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey john good morning look i wouldn t say anything that s unique that s happened there i mean as you we all know in this industry you ve got a lot of new business coming online all the time and you also have folks that are closing i don t wouldn t say we have seen any dramatic shift in that area as i mentioned the different data sources have some mixed information but all of them generally talk about positive spend dollars being up in that kind of 2 5 to 3 5 range and then you have traffic generally down with the exception of npd which is showing slight increase in traffic so i don t think there s anything unique or anything in this quarter that we ve seen that is highly different than what we ve seen in the past quarters john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst and is there anything to note by category or by regional that you re beginning to see and obviously you might think there s a lot of questions that are being asked you of whether you think there s a slowdown and i think the answer at least as it stands today is no but when you look at different categories or different regions is there anything interesting that you re seeing in the marketplace a little bit more detail either positive or negative that you can basically talk about now that gives us i guess a little somewhat of a forecast of the future from sysco s perspective as opposed to some of the third party sources that you use for your data thomas l bene president and chief executive officer not really i mean there s nothing else that i would tell you that we re seeing is any different john ivankoe jpmorgan analyst understood thank you thomas l bene president and chief executive officer thank you operator your next question comes from the line of kelly bania from bmo capital your line is open kelly bania bmo capital analyst hi good morning thanks for taking my questions just going back to expenses again it seems like there was a good amount of upside at least in our model on the international can we think about the performance this quarter i think it was down about 30 million year over year is that kind of the right run rate to think about for the next few quarters international and then maybe can you tie in just the impact of the corporate restructuring on the expense performance this quarter joel t grade executive vice president and chief financial officer yes kelly i ll start and i think the answer to that is i mean obviously we re continuing to do a lot of work there as to streamline and make our operations more efficient i guess i d say there is some run rate consistency there but right i would also tell you is that i mean there is inaudible a lot of moving parts right now in some of our international business what i would not necessarily tie it to one of the things we talked about in the past is the sizable transformation we re doing in france i think the majority of that benefit really we start to see next year so i would not tie a lot of that necessarily to the sort of that the restructuring that we re doing in our french business but i would say generally speaking i think it s i mean it s fair to continue to see that as a relative run rate realizing again we just got a lot of moving parts over there that in terms of transformation we re doing so i guess my answer is generally is yes but again there is just realize things are not going to move around quarter to quarter based on the amount of stuffs we got moving around in that business kelly bania bmo capital analyst okay that s helpful and maybe just in terms of the us broadline business can you talk a little bit about some of the specialty meat and produced some of the categories that aren t necessarily part of the normal case growth and what kind of trends you re seeing in those other areas of the us business thomas l bene president and chief executive officer sure this is tom kelly good morning i think we continue to feel really good about our specialty company strategy as we ve talked for a few years we know that our customers truly value broadline but they also have these oftentimes they can be better met by some specialty companies and in our case meat seafood poultry and that side and then the produced freshpoint and so i think we continue to feel really good about overall what we bring to the market and the value proposition we have there we ve been working on ways of even helping our customers to make that easier for them to procure products both from sysco and from the sysco specialty companies and we re seeing benefits of that as well and so creating the environment where it s easier for them to kind of do business with both of those entities as they need to and as they feel like they want to and so versus the feeling maybe like two or three different companies with they re doing business with the idea that they can do business with one sysco and then get the value out of that so we continue to believe that s an important part of the market and we continue to feel really good about the work we re doing there kelly bania bmo capital analyst thank you thomas l bene president and chief executive officer yes operator your final question comes from the line of bob summers at buckingham your line is open bob summers buckingham analyst hey good morning guys so i just wanted to dig a little deeper into the transportation dry van spot rates have been contracting all year so can you maybe talk about how that flows through in your business either by talking about the percent of business that you do at the spot rate maybe talk about how that spot rate influences contract rates as you may be threatened to move more to the spot market and then lastly how that impacts what you have to pay your drivers thomas l bene president and chief executive officer hey bob again getting back to this conversation about transportation and cost the piece you re really referring to is the inbound freight part for us which does hit our gross margin and we called out in the prepared comments and we ve talked a bit here this morning about that we are seeing some year over year improvement benefit there it s not huge and it s not something that is a major driver for us but the market has come down certainly from where it was a year ago and obviously everybody benefits from that we obviously try to minimize the spot market because when that that s the one that gets the most out of whack the fastest and that s what happened a year ago so we continue to manage that side of our business mostly with contracts but yes it certainly as that whole market comes down that affects both sides the spot and contract side and as it relates to our drivers as we said i think we ve done a lot of work around both recruiting and retention and the way we re operating our business to improve as much as we can our driver retention and so we feel better about where we re at than we were year ago but it continues to be a challenging part of the business and i think will be as long as of the markets the way it is meaning unemployment s low and there s a lot of freight on the road so we feel a much better where we are now than we were a year ago but that doesn t mean that we don t still have ongoing challenges associated with hiring and retention of drivers bob summers buckingham analyst okay thanks thomas l bene president and chief executive officer good day operator that

msci asia ex japan sinks 1 9 pct china blue chips drop more than 6 pct despite targeted rrr cut safe haven yen jumps china s yuan plummets markets see higher chance of further easing asian stock markets by andrew galbraith shanghai may 6 reuters global financial markets tumbled on monday after u s president donald trump unexpectedly jacked up pressure on china to reach a trade deal in the midst of negotiations saying he would hike u s tariffs on chinese goods this week equity markets which have been largely expecting the two sides to reach a trade accord soon fell sharply as further talks to end their bruising trade war were thrown into doubt advertisement advertisement chinese shares plunged more than 6 percent at one point while u s stock market futures fell close to 2 percent oil prices sank and the chinese yuan weakened sharply trump sharply escalated tensions between the world s two largest economies with tweeted comments on sunday that trade talks with china were proceeding too slowly and that he would raise tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 percent on friday from 10 percent he also said he would target a further 325 billion of chinese goods with 25 percent tariffs shortly the tweets upended the previously calm market mood that had benefited from signs of improving economic growth in china and the united states and from comments from trump and other senior u s officials that trade talks were going well advertisement advertisement the wall street journal reported on monday that china was considering canceling trade talks scheduled for this week following trump s threats i think this has got the potential to be a real game changer said nick twidale sydney based analyst at rakuten securities australia there is still a question of whether this is one of the famous trump negotiation tactics or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs if it s the latter we ll see massive downside pressure across all markets he said msci s broadest index of asia pacific shares outside japan was down 1 9 percent after earlier losing more than 2 percent advertisement advertisement chinese blue chips lost more than 6 percent at one point in the morning session having closed higher before a three day national holiday amid expectations that pressures on china s economy were easing they later clawed back some losses and were last

e mini futures for the s p 500 slid 1 9 percent erasing memories of gains on friday after the u s payroll data had helped to lift wall street and signaling a rough open for u s stocks on monday the risk for trump is that the chinese don t play ball and don t go ahead with the negotiation said shane oliver head of investment strategy at amp in sydney it s not in his interest for shares to go down

home world business china considers delaying next trade talks after trump s tariff threat u s president donald trump photographer alex wroblewski bloomberg may 6th 2019 10 48 am 1201 views china china is considering delaying a trip by its top trade negotiators to washington this week according to people familiar with the matter after u s president donald trump threatened the country with steeper tariffs over the pace of trade talks trump on sunday raised pressure on beijing to strike a trade deal by announcing he would increase tariffs on 200 billion of chinese imports to 25 percent from 10 percent on friday he also floated the possibility of extending a new 25 percent duty on another 325 billion in imports that aren t now covered risks of a full blown trade war are escalating said chua hak bin a senior economist at maybank kim eng research pte in singapore trump s threat may backfire as china will not want to negotiate with a gun pointing at their heads china s yuan plunged the most in more than three years and its equity markets were roiled as markets unwound bets on a resolution to a trade war that s weighed on global commerce and forced companies to rethink supply chains the aussie dollar fell while the yen climbed lengthy talks chinese vice premier liu he was scheduled to arrive in washington on wednesday with a delegation of about 100 people for what had been shaping up to be possibly the final round of negotiations u s trade representative robert lighthizer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin visited beijing last week for talks they described as productive the u s had been targeting may 10 to announce a deal that would be finalized and signed by trump and chinese president xi jinping later at an official summit people familiar with the negotiations said last week the two sides have been locked in intense negotiations since last year for an agreement to address u s concerns over china s trade surplus alleged theft of intellectual property and forced technology transfers trump and xi agreed to a tariff truce on dec 1 to allow their senior negotiators time to come up with an agreement the truce helped soothe investors concerns about a further escalation in a trade war between the world s two largest economies which imposed tariffs on about 360 billion of each other s good last year trump s latest tweets on the tariff increase marked an abrupt reversal in stance for the white house after both sides had been saying for weeks that negotiations were going well a warning that shift reflects growing u s frustration with china s backpedaling on some of its earlier commitments including on the crucial matter of technology transfer two people familiar with the situation said that s emboldened trade hawks within the trump administration to push for a harder line including the raising of tariffs the people said the wall street journal earlier reported that china was mulling a cancellation of the next round of talks after trump s tweet white house economic adviser larry kudlow said on fox news that the president was issuing a warning while great progress has been made in the talks structural and enforcement issues remained he said we hope they ll come around with this deal but if they don t the president is saying guess what the tariffs will remain kudlow said buckle up major u s stock indexes had been trading at or near record highs in part on optimism that the u s and china would soon put their bruising trade war in the rear view mirror this has all the makings of a complete disaster that could lead the stock market to crater chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank in new york said in a note sunday to clients buckle up your seat belt investors trump imposed duties of 25 percent on an initial 50 billion of chinese goods last year and then 10 percent on an additional 200 billion in products in september those duties were set to rise to 25 percent on jan 1 and then again on march 1 but trump delayed that as talks continued china has imposed tariffs on 110 billion of u s exports in retaliation based on calculations by bloomberg economics tariffs at the current level add up to a 0 5 percentage point drag on china s gross domestic product growth this year an increase to 25 percent tariffs on 200 billion in chinese exports from 10 percent would raise the drag to 0 9 percentage point tariffs on all of china s exports to the u s would increase the burden to 1 5 point what our economists say without more information it s difficult to know how to interpret trump s tweets it s possible talks are breaking down with china offering insufficient concessions and an increase in tariffs a genuine prospect more likely in our view is that this renewed threat is an attempt to extract a few more minor concessions in the final days of talks either way trump s tweet has added uncertainty to the final stage of the negotiation trump also said on sunday that tariffs paid by china are partially responsible for our great economic results although economic studies have shown it s the companies that import chinese goods and u s consumers not china itself that pay the bulk of the additional costs the conflict has already contributed to a slump in global trade dented business confidence and forced companies to upend their supply chains the international monetary fund cut its global outlook last month to the slowest pace since the financial crisis warning that an escalation in tariffs could push growth even lower source courtesy of bloomberg by jenny

will a possibly imminent us china trade agreement exacerbate global business cycles or even plant the seeds of the next asian financial crisis if the eventual agreement assuming there is one forces china to hew indefinitely to its outmoded overly rigid exchange rate regime then the answer may be yes keeping the renminbi s exchange rate stable against the us dollar would require the chinese authorities either to match changes in us interest rates or go through capital control contortions to try to offset exchange rate pressures in other ways but china is simply too big and too global to adhere to an exchange rate policy that is better suited to a small open economy moreover neither approach to keeping the renminbi stable maintaining interest rate parity or applying capital controls makes sense for an economy with business cycles that seldom coincide precisely with those of the united states with its declining trend economic performance overbuilt housing sector and overleveraged regional governments china will inevitably confront politically sensitive growth problems when it does the people s bank of china will need to be able to loosen monetary conditions without having to worry about supporting the exchange rate when a country comes under serious financial and macroeconomic pressures maintaining an inflexible exchange rate is a well known recipe for disaster the international monetary fund along with most academic economists has been making this point for a very long time such an exchange rate deal between america and china would be out of tune with other elements of a potential bilateral trade agreement many of which are win win for example china has pledged to enforce intellectual property rights much more vigorously although just how strongly remains to be seen greater chinese rigour in this area may benefit american and european firms in the near term but over the long run it will help to fuel competition and innovation in china s own manufacturing and tech sectors illustration ajay mohanty after all back in the 1800s the us like china today had little interest in protecting the intellectual property rights of foreign then mostly british firms and americans widely copied their ideas and blueprints however as american innovators became more successful they too needed their rights protected and in due course the us brought its patent and intellectual property laws up to world leading standards another win win could result from america s insistence that the chinese government refrain from lavishing subsidies on exporters most of these subsidies go to china s inefficient state owned firms sucking credit and other resources away from the more dynamic private sector more generally a trade deal may well give fresh impetus to economic reforms in china which seem to have stalled or gone into reverse in the past few years on a recent trip to beijing to attend the china development forum i asked a very senior chinese official about this slowdown i had expected him to reel off a long list of inconsequential reforms in keeping with the usual line that china is doing things very gradually all the time so i was surprised when he candidly admitted that we only do major economic reforms when there is a crisis and there has not been a big enough crisis of late in this sense us president donald trump seems to be just what the doctor ordered because he has forced the chinese authorities to recognise that they can no longer rely on american consumer demand to keep china s growth locomotive moving indeed some observers joke that trump is the saviour of the chinese economy because panic at a possible trade war is helping to catalyse long stalled structural reforms but american pressure on china to commit to a more stable renminbi dollar exchange rate and avoid competitively devaluing its currency could undermine further economic reform in particular such a regime would prevent china from gradually adopting the greater exchange rate flexibility required for a more independent monetary policy trump s team seems to be under the misguided impression that china has been intervening to keep its currency weak in order to promote exports the view that china manipulates its currency long overblown by some commentators downplays the fact that the root of china s hyper competitiveness has long been its relatively low wages more fundamentally the accusation that china is manipulating the exchange rate is completely out of touch with recent history in recent years the pressures on the renminbi have been largely downward and the government has responded with much tighter restrictions on capital outflows that go both over and under the table far from putting a ceiling on the renminbi s exchange rate the chinese authorities have been putting a floor beneath it partly out of fear that overly rapid depreciation would lead to a massive exodus of capital an inflexible exchange rate might not be the only potential weakness in an eventual us china trade deal american negotiators also have not seemed to appreciate the accounting rule that a country s current account a broad measure of its trade balance is always equal to national savings minus national investment if american consumption growth is strong and the us government runs a massive fiscal deficit the country has to borrow from somewhere and if china is forced to reduce its bilateral trade surplus with america it will simply offshore the final stages of goods production so that us imports will be recorded as coming from another asian country such as vietnam true pushing china to conform to conventional global trade practices is important for the entire world recent speeches by chinese president xi jinping are encouraging in this regard though one wishes that the trade talks would address environmental protection but if a final deal prevents china from gaining greater monetary policy autonomy it could create major problems when the next big asian recession hits in that case american negotiators will have demonstrated their bargaining power but not their wisdom the writer is a former chief economist

already on the back foot against a basket of peer currencies the turkish lira fell to a seven month low on monday amid continued internal political unease and deteriorating global risk sentiment following resurgent us china trade concerns the pound to turkish lira exchange rate having risen for five consecutive weeks remained on an upwards trajectory posting a seven month best in early trade try7 9171 sterling was last seen trading at 7 8797 up 0 41 from last week s close against the us dollar the lira breached the key psychological level 6 0 in early trade with the dollar to try last seen trading at 6 01245 domestic political uncertainty weighs on try appetite following recent local elections which saw incumbent president erdogan s akp party lose key seats including istanbul uncertainty remains rife around whether or not turkey s election board will grant a re run of the election for isntanbuli mayor i have kept quiet until this day but i have had enough erdogan said over the weekend there is a clear case of fraud the president who s route to prominence included winning the istanbul mayor ship in the 1990 s has refused to accept the outcome of the initial ballot citing fraudulent vote counting procedures according to sinan ulgen chairman of instanbul based think tank edam the decision by the electoral board will serve as a litmus test for the maturity of turkey s democracy if the board rules to renew the elections in istanbul they need to have a clear and acceptable reason that is in line with the law and public conscience he said should the board defy that it would mean a step backward for democracy advertisement the main issue for the markets is whether istanbul elections will be re run or not the dominant expectation in the market is that it will be repeated said beste naz sullu deputy manager at gedik investment adding inflation which has not receded fully is among the risk factors as well on the inflation front friday s data indicated that inflation fell more than expected in april dropping to 19 5 trump torpedoes global risk sentiment in two tweets compounding the already abundant uncertainty a series of tweets from us president donald trump over the weekend regarding us china trade negotiations prompted a mass sell off in risk assets including ems as markets reopened this week weighing further on the try while the chinese yuan australian and new zealand dollars were the clear losers in terms of immediate market impact ems have failed to gain any traction through monday s session of additional goods sent to us by china remain untaxed but will be shortly at a rate of 25 the tariffs paid to the usa have had little impact on product cost mostly borne by china the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no donald j trump realdonaldtrump 5 may 2019 while reports regarding us china trade talks as recent as friday had highlighted the productive nature of ongoing negotiations and hinted at a possible culmination over the coming weeks trump s impatience with the pace of progress could see a return to the threat of a global tariff war as early as the end of the week whether a bluff or reflecting legitimate intent president trump followed his weekend tweets with continued tough talk during monday s session the united states has been losing for many years 600 to 800 billion dollars a year on trade with china we lose 500 billion dollars sorry we re not going to be doing that anymore donald j trump realdonaldtrump 6 may 2019 there is still a question of whether this is one of the famous trump negotiation tactics or are we really going to see some drastic increase in tariffs said nick twidale sydney based analyst at rakuten securities australia if it s the latter we ll see massive downside pressure across all markets despite concerns based on previous behaviour that the chinese delegation due to resume talks in washington this week could forgo the opportunity in light of trump s tweets chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang on monday affirmed the intent to continue talks we are also in the process of understanding the relevant situation what i can tell you is that china s team is preparing to go to the united states for the discussions shuang told a news briefing adding what is of vital importance is that we still hope the united states can work hard with china to meet each other half way and strive to reach a mutually beneficial win win agreement on the basis of mutual respect for the lira the outlook looks decidedly skewed to the downside with little in the way of investor appeal armed with a fair value model which suggests the turkish lira remains 7 overvalued despite the recent declines chief investment officer for lombard odier private bank st√©phane monier summarised the bank s lira perspective in short the country s currency reflects its political and economic weaknesses while the try has undoubtedly already priced in a host of bad news there are still enough uncertainties to make further declines probable until the political landscape settles and even more importantly the country s central bank recovers credibility we see no fundamental argument for exposure to turkish assets

we are reminded again how fortunate we are to have the guiding principles that we embrace in this organization and the uniquely spectacular leaders that surround us this quarter s record results are due to dozens of victories large and small across a vast number of communities and operations that have been blessed by the inspiring and comforting leadership of so many we celebrate the transformative impact our local leaders have had on their teams and communities that had been oft neglected or even long forgotten prior to the infusion of this culture that we love christensen noted that much of the improvement has come from the continued organic growth in transitioning and newly acquired operations but also by the steady improvement in some of the organization s most mature operations he added while we celebrate our growth and our financial health and our transformative impact in the market place and the hundreds of operations that have been improved we still have dozens more that need to be transformed we are excited about the progress some of our struggling operations continue to make but want to make sure everyone understands that tremendous potential remains

results including the continued achievement of quality healthcare outcomes strong regulatory results enhanced efforts in collections and strengthened relationships with managed care providers he also

sources said china s government was considering canceling this week s talks beijing has responded to previous us threats by saying it wouldn t negotiate under pressure advertisement stock markets fell on the news the future for the dow jones industrial average lost 1 5 percent while tokyo s nikkei 225 retreated 0 2 percent trump had twice pushed back deadlines√¢ in january and march√¢ to raise the tariffs in a bid to buy more time for a negotiated settlement but on sunday trump who has called himself a tariff man said he s losing patience advertisement the trade deal with china continues but too slowly as they attempt to renegotiate no trump tweeted in his tweets trump also threatened to slap tariffs on another 325 billion in chinese imports covering everything china ships annually to the united states advertisement the two countries are locked in a high stakes dispute over china s push to establish itself as a technological super power the us charges that china is resorting to predatory tactics √¢ including cyber theft and forcing foreign companies to hand over technology√¢ in a drive to establish chinese companies as world leaders in advanced industries such as robotics and electric vehicles the administration has repeatedly suggested that the negotiators are making progress a month ago trump said that the two countries were rounding the turn and predicted that something monumental would be achieved in the next few weeks but last week treasury secretary steven mnuchin seemed to temper expectations suggesting that washington was willing to move on if it can t get the deal it wants advertisement a substantive deal would require china to rethink the way it pursues its economic ambitions abandoning or scaling back subsidies to its companies easing up on the

spitting out the word china went viral and collected more than 15 million views on youtube com advertisement trump charged that previous administrations gullible and weak had let china get away with abusive trade practices accepting empty promises from beijing and allowing the us china economic relationship to grow ever more lopsided as evidence he pointed to america s vast us trade deficit with china√¢ 379 billion last year by far the biggest with any country in the world once he took office trump s relationship with his chinese counterpart xi jinping seemed to get off to a good start advertisement the two men shared chocolate cake and amiable conversation at trump s resort in mar a lago florida in april 2017 a few weeks later china agreed to open its market us beef cooked chicken and natural gas in what commerce secretary wilbur ross called a herculean accomplishment the romance faded in march 2018 the office of the us trade representative issued a report accusing china of using predatory tactics to strengthen its tech companies advertisement last july the trump administration gradually began slapping import taxes on chinese goods to pressure beijing into changing its policies it now has imposed 10 percent tariffs on 200 billion in chinese imports and 25 percent tariffs on another 50 billion the chinese have retaliated by targeting 110 billion in us imports the fight between the world s two biggest economies is raising worries about global economic growth advertisement the international monetary fund the world bank and others have downgraded their forecasts for the world economy saying the us china standoff is reducing world trade and creating uncertainty for companies trying to decide where to buy supplies build factories and make investments trump has portrayed his tariffs as a moneymaker for the united states and a benefit to the us economy but a march study by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york columbia university and princeton university found that the burden of trump s tariffs√¢ including taxes on steel aluminum solar panels and chinese imports√¢ falls entirely on us consumers and businesses who buy imported products advertisement by the end of last year the study found they were paying 3 billion a month in higher taxes and absorbing 1 4 billion a month in lost efficiency nonetheless the overall us economy has remained healthy on friday the government reported that the us unemployment rate had fallen to the lowest level in half a century the prospect of higher tariffs and heightened tensions could alarm investors when markets open monday when the president puts his foot down it makes the market go down chris rupkey chief financial economist at mufg union bank wrote in a research note sunday tariff

the new zealand dollar weakened amid jitters over the us china trade negotiations and ahead of monetary policy decisions in australia and at home the kiwi was trading at 66 08 us cents at 8am down from 66 23 at 5pm yesterday the trade weighted index fell to 72 17 from 72 41 the us dollar rose as the renewed trade tensions between the us and china spooked markets reports that a delegation from china will proceed with trade negotiations in the us this week helped steady sentiment according to the south china morning post china is still preparing to send a delegation to washington for the trade talks despite the latest threats by president donald trump to increase tariffs foreign ministry spokesperson geng shuang said the focus will now be on the reserve bank of australia rate decision later today according to market pricing there is a 50 percent chance the rba could move to cut rates to 1 25 percent from 1 50 percent anz bank expects the rba to cut the cash rate by 25 basis points in response to a worrying fall in core inflation seen in the first quarter despite a decline in unemployment if they do cut rates across the tasman it will increase the likelihood that the reserve bank of new zealand will also cut interest rates to 1 50 percent from 1 75 percent on wednesday afternoon the odds of a cut in new zealand are currently around 60 percent according to bnz bank the only thing one can say with any confidence about this week s monetary policy statement is that market pricing will move on the day just after 2 00pm on wednesday the movement in yields and potentially the nzd will be significant the question is in which direction said bnz head of research stephen toplis toplis said the best approach for new zealand s central bank is to keep interest rates on hold while formally building in an easing bias into its rate track for all intents and purposes this would be a time buying exercise which would limit the chances of the rbnz making a policy mistake increase the chances of a rate cut being impactive if it was eventually utilized minimize future market volatility the new zealand dollar was trading at 94 37 australian cents from 94 75 at 50 45 british pence from 50 46 at 58 96 euro cents from 59 17 at 73 26 japanese yen from 73 39 and at 4 4671 chinese yuan from 4 4875 businessdesk comments from our readers no comments yet add your comment your name your email not displayed to the public comment comments to sharechat go through an approval process comments which are defamatory abusive or in some way deemed inappropriate will not be approved it is allowable to use some form of non de plume for your name however we recommend real email addresses are used comments from free email addresses such as gmail yahoo hotmail etc may not be approved anti spam verification type the text you see in the image into the field below you are asked to do this in order to verify that this enquiry is not being performed by an automated process related news hgh meets challenger bank milestone nz 210m equity raise april 8th morning report being ai limited trade with caution statement fletcher building executive team announcement manawa energy appoints gm market operations gm people april 5th morning report paysauce quarterly market update march 2024 april 3rd morning report bank of china new zealand limited director change ccc appointment of ceo aiden keegan
