last wednesday u s secretary of state mike pompeo gave a disturbing interview to fox business network in which he divulged his plans to form a nato type alliance against iran the u s has long accused iran of supporting terrorism accusations that have ramped up under the trump administration pompeo said without a hint of irony that iran s government was leading the country into wars in syria yemen iraq and lebanon against the will of the iranian people furthermore the absurd accusation that hezbollah is in venezuela seemed a crude attempt to link the two countries in order to delegitimize both of their governments at the same time the announcement foreshadows the potential for an abrupt and extreme escalation of u s attacks on iran similar to the recent escalation of u s venezuela relations washington s playbook for regime change has become more and more obvious as it is used more frequently in the cases of countries with powerful militaries like venezuela iran north korea or china outright invasion is unfeasible as disapproving public opinion would drag morale down demonizing the target via some pretext to isolate it from the international community has been the preferred model to deal with larger threats the u s imposes financial sanctions under the guise of targeting regime figureheads and their inner circle of cronies and sweeping banking restrictions that cut a country s entire economy off from investment and foreign reserves as the country deteriorates under the weight of these sanctions washington points to the chaos it has created and says again without a hint of irony this is clearly a consequence of a neglectful and incompetent regime that must be overthrown the time period between the present and that unknown future date when the u s escalates is a crucial time for iran to prepare itself for the worst case scenario the u s is able to dictate these econo warfare policies through its disproportionate control of the world financial system iran has been sounding warnings about this strategy for some time and has been a vocal advocate of creating a new global financial system that will bypass u s control of the existing global financial system iran though is not the only country interested in such an arrangement russia china and venezuela have all found themselves facing arbitrary economic penalties levied by the u s and have also taken steps to wean the world off the dollar and use alternative currencies to conduct business a global trend that could seriously impact u s dominance over the world economy but in order to understand where king dollar is going we have to understand where it came from the birth of the petrodollar one of the first lessons we learn in econ 101 is that money has value only because we believe it does in a practical sense this means the currencies that are most used or most needed to purchase things are the most valuable a reserve currency is simply a widely accepted currency most countries have both a domestic currency for domestic use and foreign reserves which are designated for foreign trade and other international activities a few powerful countries issue reserve currencies or widely recognized and accepted currencies and have an advantage in international trade because they can simply print world reserve currencies instead of exchanging currencies or selling goods to acquire that currency today the u s dollar holds the status of world reserve currency because it is the most recognizable and widely used unit of currency in the world you can take a dollar to any random country any market on the side of the street and show them a greenback and chances are they will accept that funny little paper as payment if i decide to start a seashell based currency today chances are i won t be able to buy anything with my seashells there is nothing inherently more special about our green piece of paper than someone else s blue paper red paper or yellow paper the dollar is special only because it represents a very special country the united states of america a superpower the likes of which the world has never seen where american power goes its money always follows to become the region s unit of economic measurement the currency that goods are priced in is very important because if for example oil is priced in dollars you need dollars to buy oil this creates demand for dollars and not yen or rubles giving a tremendous advantage to the country that prints dollars at no cost before the international dollar standard there were other world reserve currencies the worldwide dominance of the dutch east india company made the dutch guilder the world reserve currency in the 17th and 18th centuries with the ascendance of the british empire came the ascendance of the pound sterling to world reserve currency status as the world s leading exporter of manufactured goods and services british banks had accumulated a large amount of gold deposits the bank of england issued sterling certificates paper that could be exchanged for gold making the sterling as good as gold this gave foreigners confidence that the paper sterling was not just paper but backed up by something of tangible value british investors chasing higher returns expanded the reach of sterling further by making sterling denominated long term investments read loans around the world at its height over 60 percent of world trade was denominated in pound sterling but as had all empires before it the british empire over expanded and collapsed unable to militarily control the land it claimed as its own however as the british cities were reduced to rubble in the second world war the united states untouched throughout the war got rich selling weapons to the other allied powers through exporting weapons ammunition equipment and food america s war economy accumulated 75 percent of the world s gold making it the undisputed economic power of the capitalist world no other country had enough gold to back its currency s value recognizing this the leaders of the european capitalist powers agreed to make the dollar the new world reserve currency by pegging the dollar to gold at a fixed exchange rate of 35 dollars per ounce of gold other countries could exchange their currency for dollars instead of gold the logic being the dollar was as good as gold the international monetary fund was set up to ensure the u s maintained this exchange rate and the imf acted as a lender of last resort if a country s currency value fell too low compared to the dollar this was not just a convenient arrangement but a necessary one as the european capitalist empires had fallen and needed to pass their power on to an heir it was the recognition that now the united states was the only country powerful enough to organize and enforce worldwide markets in addition the use of nuclear weapons to wipe hiroshima nagasaki and 200 000 japanese civilians off the map sent a message to the world that the united states was more militarily advanced and ruthless than any other country on the planet a new global empire was born the united states immediately embarked on a series of invasions mass killings and covert regime change operations in places like korea guatemala iran and vietnam to expand its spheres of influence in order to fund these excursions the united states began printing dollars a privilege enjoyed solely by the united states since a dollar represented 1 35th of an ounce of gold the united states was essentially printing claim checks for gold gold that the united states didn t actually have a number of countries began to suspect that there were more than 35 dollars per ounce of gold in existence and began to turn in their dollars and ask for gold french president charles de gaulle famously remarked the fact that many countries accept as a principle dollars as good as gold for the payment of the differences existing to their advantage in the american balance of trade this very fact leads americans to get into debt and to get into debt for free at the expense of other countries because what the u s owes them it is paid at least in part with dollars they are the only ones allowed to emit considering the serious consequences a crisis would have in such a domain we think that measures must be taken in time to avoid it we consider necessary that international trade be established as it was the case before the great misfortunes of the world on an indisputable monetary base and one that does not bear the mark of any particular country which base in truth no one sees how one could really have any standard criterion other than gold the erosion of confidence in the dollar gold peg was called the triffin dilemma to understand how quickly the u s undermined the exchange rate consider that from 1790 to 1944 the u s accumulated around 200 billion dollars of debt from 1944 to 1971 the debt doubled to around 400 billion at least part of which was simply printed the nixon administration devalued the dollar a few times before suspending the convertibility of the dollar into gold completely on august 15th 1971 holding the world s gold and leaving them with pieces of green paper over the next decade the price of gold steadily increased to all time highs nixon s move a desperate attempt at stopping inflation failed to do so as the world rejected the dollar in order to avoid global loss of confidence in the dollar the dollar needed to be tied to a new commodity something equally as universally demanded the u s found that commodity in 1973 during the saudi imposed oil embargo saudi arabia was infuriated by u s support for israel in the yom kippur war and imposed an oil embargo on the u s as punishment henry kissinger led the diplomatic effort to end the embargo in 1974 a deal was struck to end the saudi embargo and bring u s saudi relations to previously unseen heights john perkins author of confessions of an economic hitman and former economic hitman himself summarized the deal aptly in the early 70s opec didn t like what we were doing in israel same old story so they cut off our oil supplies so some of you will remember these long lines at the gas stations and we feared we were gonna have another depression like the 1929 depression so the u s treasury department came to me and other economic hitmen and said listen you know we can t allow opec to blackmail us anymore you guys gotta come up with a plan so this doesn t happen again we knew this plan had to involve saudi arabia because it had more oil than anybody else and it also the house of saud was corrupt and corruptible the long version is explained in the book but the short version of what we did the deal we finally struck with the house of saud was a deal whereby they would return almost all the money they made from selling to the u s invest it in u s government securities the u s treasury department would use the interest from those securities which over the years amounted to trillions of dollars to hire us companies to westernize saudi arabia build petrochemical complexes desalination plants whole cities out of the desert mcdonalds and all the other things that go along with our western culture the house of saud would also agree to keep the price of oil within limits acceptable to the oil companies possibly not acceptable to you and me but acceptable to the oil companies and this is very very important they agree that they will never ever sell oil for anything other than u s dollars this happened in the early 70 s right after we had went off the gold standard because we were bankrupt because we could not pay our debts to the european countries in gold nixon took us off the gold standard and then we were stuck with the situation why would anyone in the world use u s dollars so then we came up with this plan which in essence put the dollar on the oil standard you cannot buy oil on the world market for anything other than dollars and that s very important for corporatocracy we our part of the bargain was we agreed to keep the house of saud in power in control it was an amazing deal the deal of the century it was history making incredibly powerful deal that we struck with saudi arabia and it s held crude oil is the most traded commodity in the world every country needs it the petrodollar system requires every country to have u s dollars on hand to buy oil it keeps demand for the u s dollar as high as it was when the dollar was the only currency that could buy gold if a country needs oil it will have to manufacture and export a tangible good of value like a car or a refrigerator to the united states while the u s can simply print or borrow paper dollars to use as immediate payment even more advantageous to the u s opec nations take the profits from their oil sales to buy u s securities read lend america money a system called petrodollar recycling the deal with saudi arabia allowed the u s to continue being the only country able to print the world reserve currency and run massive deficits to become the consumer capital of the world the petrodollar and the empire the takeaway from the petrodollar phenomenon is that as long as countries need oil they will need the dollar as long as countries demand dollars the u s can continue to go into massive amounts of debt to fund its network of global military bases wall street bailouts nuclear missiles and tax cuts for the rich but what happens if countries catch on to the scheme and try to break free of the petrodollar system the most notable example of this is iraq which began selling its oil for euros instead of dollars which iraq called the currency of an enemy state in the year 2000 this was a logical move for iraq as the country was under a brutal u n sanctions regime which caused 500 000 iraqi children to die of malnutrition a price acceptable to u s ambassador to the united nations madeleine albright iraq knew that the u s could use its control over the international financial markets to further punish a dollar dependent country its ditching of the dollar was just another reason why iraq ended up in george bush s so called axis of evil only weeks before the invasion of iraq saddam hussein boasted that iraq s euro filled oil account was earning a higher interest rate than it would have had it been stuffed with dollars the united states promptly turned iraq into a hell on earth overthrowing saddam s government and leaving over a million dead iraqis in its wake iraq s oil supply was back under u s corporate control and by extension under control of worldwide dollar hegemony as well libya also had plans to undermine the dollar s grip over the global oil trade an email from hillary clinton advisor and ally sidney blumenthal which was scrubbed from the state department s website revealed that french intelligence had discovered libya s vast gold and silver reserves and feared they would be used to back a pan african currency the dinar to rival the french franc the euro and the dollar the email goes on to casually describe france s motivations for intervening oil unsurprisingly topping the list a desire to gain a greater share of libya oil production increase french influence in north africa improve his internal political situation in france provide the french military with an opportunity to reassert its position in the world address the concern of his advisors over qaddafi s long term plans to supplant france as the dominant power in francophone africa while the initial efforts to destroy libya were spearheaded by france and britain none of these goals were in any way objectionable or contrary to u s foreign policy objectives and the interest of maintaining the petrodollar system which is why the u s quickly became a leader in the assassination campaign despite mass pro government protests of over a million people against the nato intervention which went nearly unreported in the corporate media in the following months libyan leader muammar gaddafi was beaten to death by nato armed rebels in the streets of tripoli part of the reason the united states continues to maintain such a heavy military presence in bahrain iraq kuwait oman qatar saudi arabia united arab emirates egypt israel jordan yemen syria and so on is that u s bases in these countries serve as launching pads for invasion against the next oil bearing country that tries to defy the global financial order where oil is buried in a way the u s must go in order to ensure the petrodollar system is preserved oil quite literally guides u s foreign policy however more and more people are seeing america s financial trickery for what it is and america can force the world to comply only for so long creating a new global financial system today two opec countries are trying to shake loose the petrodollar system venezuela and iran contrary to what we ve been taught to believe they don t do these things because they hate america or hate freedom but because they re forced to both countries have faced decades of slander and in recent years outright economic warfare in the form of restrictive financial sanctions that limit their access to international markets as mentioned in the beginning of the article these sanctions are designed to limit venezuela and iran s ability to acquire foreign reserves and by extension import things like medicine this isn t even a secret it s an openly stated goal of the sanctions policy donald trump s lawyer rudy giuliani celebrated the success of the sanctions after reports stated iranians were selling their organs and begging for food in a particularly genocidal episode mike pompeo said that the iranian leadership would have to make a decision that they want their people to eat meaning install a u s aligned government or continue to starve under the sanctions regime faced with no good options both countries have been experimenting with more creative ways of transacting with international trade partners most obviously both countries have dropped the dollar from their international exchanges pricing goods in other reserve currencies like euros and yuan this means you cannot import goods from these countries with dollars furthermore both countries are trying to repopularize gold as a means of international payment as sanctions crashed the value of the iranian rial demand for gold in iran hit four year highs iran is relying more heavily on its gold reserves to conduct trade iran is exploring exporting oil products to various african nations in exchange for gold iran has made similar agreements with india and turkey similarly venezuela is attempting to use its gold to acquire foreign reserves venezuela recently tried to withdraw 1 2 billion worth of its own gold stored in the vaults of the bank of england only to be denied in response to caracas attempts to subvert financial sanctions venezuela s enemies namely the lima group a u s sponsored organization of latin american countries have insisted that venezuela should be prevented from using oil and gold to conduct international trade the u s has already imposed sanctions on venezuela s gold mining industry which prevent american individuals and companies from buying venezuelan gold finally both countries have created gold backed cryptocurrencies which will be used as alternatives to the dollar as means of payment venezuela s crypto petro is backed by venezuela s natural resource wealth gold diamonds oil iron and so on western pundits wasted no time warning people on the internet that petro was a bad investment the only problem being that petro wasn t created as a vehicle for money making as most western cryptos are petro was created solely for the purpose of being a currency for venezuelans to send to other countries to buy goods they could not buy under the sanctions regime with oil and gold backing petro s value is largely decided by the global oil and gold prices you won t make a lot of money speculating on the value of petro iran recently unveiled its own gold backed cryptocurrency the paymon weeks ago similar to petro paymon gives iran the ability to get around u s financial sanctions iran and venezuela s maneuvers have raised eyebrows but in the context of the larger global trend of de dollarization they pose a much greater threat than as individual occurrences much larger economies are also moving to end their dependence on the dollar and are seriously considering creating multilateral trading blocks free of the dollar after washington tightened sanctions on russia regarding russia s activities in crimea russian president vladimir putin said that russia would work towards completely dumping the dollar so far russia has made good on this promise dumping 84 percent of its u s debt holdings and massively increasing its gold reserves in the last two years as russian foreign minister sergey lavrov once stated washington immediately stops servicing any banking operations in dollars in relation to both the country that they want to punish and also all those who have some kind of relationship with it china and japan america s biggest foreign debt holders have also been shedding u s debt holdings albeit at a steady pace turkey and india have also lowered their u s bond holdings by similar amounts in recent months each country in the shanghai cooperation organization has eliminated the use of the dollar in trade with at least one other country in the organization it s hardly inconceivable that eventually these countries will conduct deeper more robust trade within the organization without the dollar even the eu is considering asserting the euro s role on the international stage last year china what do all of these actions amount to as discussed earlier at its root money has power because people believe it does each of these small changes reduces the belief in the dollar s hegemony just a little bit eventually in theory these small material changes will lead to a larger qualitative change in the world financial system this type of massive change will not happen overnight but the world financial system may encounter a series of unrectifiable challenges in the next decade but of course as any empire would the u s will not simply allow the world to trigger a second triffin dilemma while it sits silently and watches it will fight to maintain the status quo that made it an empire by kei pritsker and cale holmes

venezuela recently tried to withdraw 1 2 billion worth of its own gold stored in the vaults of the bank of england only to be denied in response to caracas attempts to subvert financial sanctions venezuela s enemies namely the lima group a u s sponsored organization of latin american countries have insisted that venezuela should be prevented from using oil and gold to conduct international trade the u s has already imposed sanctions on venezuela s gold mining industry which prevent american individuals and companies from buying venezuelan gold finally both countries have created gold backed cryptocurrencies which will be used as alternatives to the dollar as means of payment venezuela s crypto petro is backed by venezuela s natural resource wealth gold diamonds oil iron and so on western pundits wasted no time warning people on the internet that petro was a bad investment the only problem being that petro wasn t created as a vehicle for money making as most western cryptos are petro was created solely for the purpose of being a currency for venezuelans to send to other countries to buy goods they could not buy under the sanctions regime with oil and gold backing petro s value is largely decided by the global oil and gold prices you won t make a lot of money speculating on the value of petro iran recently unveiled its own gold backed cryptocurrency the paymon weeks ago similar to petro paymon gives iran the ability to get around u s financial sanctions myths lies and oil wars engdahl f william buy new 9 99 as of 07 15 utc details iran and venezuela s maneuvers have raised eyebrows but in the context of the larger global trend of de dollarization they pose a much greater threat than as individual occurrences much larger economies are also moving to end their dependence on the dollar and are seriously considering creating multilateral trading blocks free of the dollar after washington tightened sanctions on russia regarding russia s activities in crimea russian president vladimir putin said that russia would work towards completely dumping the dollar so far russia has made good on this promise dumping 84 percent of its u s debt holdings and massively increasing its gold reserves in the last two years as russian foreign minister sergey lavrov once stated washington immediately stops servicing any banking operations in dollars in relation to both the country that they want to punish and also all those who have some kind of relationship with it china and japan america s biggest foreign debt holders have also been shedding u s debt holdings albeit at a steady pace turkey and india have also lowered their u s bond holdings by similar amounts in recent months each country in the shanghai cooperation organization has eliminated the use of the dollar in trade with at least one other country in the organization it s hardly inconceivable that eventually these countries will conduct deeper more robust trade within the organization without the dollar even the eu is considering asserting the euro s role on the international stage last year china what do all of these actions amount to as discussed earlier at its root money has power because people believe it does each of these small changes reduces the belief in the dollar s hegemony just a little bit eventually in theory these small material changes will lead to a larger qualitative change in the world financial system this type of massive change will not happen overnight but the world financial system may encounter a series of unrectifiable challenges in the next decade but of course as any empire would the u s will not simply allow the world to trigger a second triffin dilemma while it sits silently and watches it will fight to maintain the status quo that made it an empire
the forth international conference for the equilibrium of the world took place in havana cuba from 28 to 31 january 2019 the conference organized by the josé marti project of international solidarity was sponsored by unesco and a number of local and international organisms and ngos it coincided with the 60th anniversary of the cuban revolution and as such was also a celebration of that successful demonstration to the world that socialism solidarity and love for life can actually survive against all odds and yes cuba has faced more hardship than any other country in recent history through boycotts embargoes and all sorts of economic sanctions heinous military infiltrations and assassination attempts initiated by the united states and followed largely under threats from washington by most of the western world viva cuba a celebration well deserved and in the name of josé marti who was born 166 years ago but whose thoughts and spiritual thinking for a new world are as valid today as they were then they may perhaps best be summarized as love solidarity justice living well for all and in peace these principles were taken over by fidel and raul castro che and hugo chávez they transcend current generations and reach far beyond latin america the conference had many highlights brilliant speakers a torch march was organized at the university of havana in honor of josé marti and the organizers offered the participants an extraordinary music and modern ballet performance at the national theater from my point of view some of the important messages came from the representative of china who talked about the new silk road or the belt and road initiative bri of building bridges and connecting countries and people whereas the west was building walls a russian speaker sadly admitted that it took his government a long time and relentless trying to build alliances with the west until they realized relatively recently that the west could not be trusted professor adan chavez frias chavez hugo s brother described an invasive history over the past 100 years by the united states of latin america and called upon the brother nations of the americas and the world to bond together in solidarity to resist the empire s infringement and steady attempts to subjugate sovereign nations with a vision towards a multipolar world of equals of sovereign nations living together in peaceful relations my own presentation focused on economy of resistance and what a better place than cuba to talk about economy of resistance impossible cuba has a 60 year history of successful resistance against a massive embargo ordered by washington and followed by almost the entire western world thus demonstrating that the west has been reduced to a us colony this was true already during the cold war but became even clearer when the soviet union fell here too the west led by washington was instrumental in the collapse of the ussr but that s another story and the us grabbed the opportunity to become the emperor of a unipolar world cuban troops also resisted and conquered the attempted us bay of pigs playa girón invasion launched by president kennedy in 1961 and not least fidel castro survived more than 600 cia initiated assassination attempts the principles of economy of resistance cover a vast domain of topics with many ramifications this presentation focused on four key areas food medical and education sovereignty economic and financial sovereignty the fifth column and water resources a human right and a vital resource for survival on food health and education sovereignty cuba is 100 autonomous as far health and education go however cuba imports more than 70 of the food her citizens consume and that at present mostly from the european union cuba has the capacity and agricultural potential to become not only fully self sufficient but to develop and process agricultural produce into an agricultural industry and become a net exporter of agricultural goods this process might be addressed as a priority policy issue however it will take some time to fully implement meanwhile it may be wise to diversify imports from other parts of the world than the eu i e russia china central asia friendly alba countries because europe is not trustworthy they tell you today they will always honor your purchasing contracts but if the empire strikes down with sanctions as they did recently for anyone doing business with iran cuba may be cooked spineless europe will bend to the orders of washington they have demonstrated this time and again not least with iran despite the fact that they signed the so called nuclear deal the joint comprehensive plan of action or jcpoa on 14 july 2015 the permanent members of the united nations security council the united states uk russia france and china plus germany and the eu and iran after which obama lifted all sanctions with iran only to have trump break the agreement and reimpose the most draconian sanctions on iran and on enterprises doing business with iran the us government and by association europe does not adhere to any agreement or any international law for that matter when it doesn t suit them there are plenty of indications venezuela today to be followed by nicaragua and cuba these should be valid signals for cuba to diversify her food imports until full self sufficiency is achieved already in 2014 mr putin said the sanctions were the best thing that could have happened to russia it forced her to revamp her agriculture and rebuild her industrial parks with the latest technology to become fully independent from imports today sanctions are a mere propaganda tool of the west but they have hardly an impact on russia russia has become the largest wheat exporter in the world cuba could do likewise she has the agricultural potential to become fully food autonomous on economic and financial sovereignty four facets are being addressed the first one foreign investments cuba may want to focus on i technology ii assuring that a majority of the investment shares remain cuban iii using to the extent possible cuba s own capital reserves for investments foreign capital is bound to certain conditionalities imposed by foreign investors thus it bears exchange rate and other risks to the point where potential profits from foreign assets are usually discounted by between 10 and 20 and iv last but not least cuba ought to decide on the sectors for foreign investors not the foreign investor following scenario as propagated by opposition lawyer and economist pablo de cuba in miami should be avoided cuba cedes a piece of her conditions of sovereignty and negotiates with foreign investors puts a certain amount of discounted debt at the creditors disposal so as to attract more investments in sectors that they the investors choose for the internal development of cuba as the hegemony of the us dollar is used to strangle any country that refuses to bend to the empire a progressive dedollarization is of the order meaning in addition to the us dollar itself move progressively away from all currencies that are intimately linked to the us dollar i e canadian and australian dollars euro yen pound sterling and more this is a strategy to be pursued in the short and medium term for the protection against more sanctions dished out by the us and its spineless allies simultaneously a rapprochement towards other monetary systems for example in the east especially based on the chinese gold convertible petro yuan may be seriously considered russia and china and in fact the entire sco shanghai cooperation organization have already designed a monetary transfer system circumventing the western swift system which has every transaction channeled through and controlled by a us bank this is the key motive for economic and financial sanctions there is no reason why cuba could not gradually but pointedly join such an alternative system to move out of the western claws of embargo the sco members today encompass about half of the world population and control one third of the globe s gdp drawbacks would be that the import markets would have to be revisited and diversified unless western suppliers would accept to be paid in cuc or yuan through a system different from swift moving away from the western monetary transfer system may also impact remittances from cubans living in the us and elsewhere in the west about us 3 4 billion 2017 less than 4 of gdp it would mean departing from monetary transactions in the euro and european monetary zones be aware the future is in the east the west is committing slowly but steadily suicide another crucial advice is stay away from imf world bank inter american development bank idb world trade organization wto and the like they are so called international financial and trade organizations all controlled by the us and her western allies and tend to enslave their clients with debt case in point mexico president andres manuel lopez obrador amlo a leftist has little margin to maneuver mexico s economy inherited from his neoliberal predecessor enrique peña nieto mexico s finances are shackled by the international banking system led by the imf fed wb and by association the globalized wall street system for example amlo intended to revive pemex the petroleum state enterprise the imf told him that he first had to financially sanitize pemex meaning putting pemex through a severe austerity program the banking community agreed in case amlo wouldn t follow their advice they might strangle his country cuc versus the peso a dual monetary system cuc 1 cup 25 75 has also been used by china up to the mid 80s and by germany after wwi to develop export import markets however there comes a time when the system could divide the population between those who have access to foreign currencies cuc convertible and those who have no such access also the convertibility of the cuc with the euro swiss franc pound sterling and yen make the cuc de facto convertible with the dollar hence the cuc is dollarized this is what washington likes to keep cuba s economy despite the embargo in the orbit of the dollar hegemony which will be used in an attempt to gradually integrate cuba into the western capitalist economy however washington will not succeed cuba is alert and has been resisting for the last 60 years the fifth column refers to clandestine and or overt infiltration of opposing and enemy elements into the government they come in the form of ngos us cia trained local or foreigners to destabilize a country and especially a country s economy from inside there are ever more countries that do not bend to the dictate of the empire and are targets for fifth columns russia china iran syria venezuela pakistan and more and cuba the term fifth column is attributed to general emilio mola who during the spanish civil war in 1936 informed his homologue general francisco franco that he has four columns of troops marching towards madrid and that they would be backed by a fifth column hidden inside the city with the support of this fifth column he expected to finish with the legitimate republican government the process of infiltration is becoming ever more sophisticated bolder and acting with total impunity perhaps the most in famous organization to foment fifth columns around the world among many others is the national endowment for democracy ned the extended arm of the cia it goes as a so called ngo or foreign policy thinktank which receives hundreds of millions of dollars from the state department to subvert non obedient countries governments bringing about regime change through infiltration of foreign trained funded and armed disruptive forces sowing social unrest and even civil wars cases in point are ukraine syria afghanistan sudan somalia libya and more and now they attempt to topple venezuela s legitimate democratically elected government of nicolás maduro they work through national and international ngos and even universities in the countries to be regime changed part of this infiltration is a massive propaganda campaign and intimidation on so called allies or client states the process to reach regime change may take years and billions of dollars in the case of ukraine it took at least 5 years and 5 billion dollars in venezuela the process towards regime change started some 20 years ago as soon as hugo chavez was elected president in 1998 it brought about a failed coup in 2002 and was followed by ever increasing economic sanctions and physical military threats earlier this year washington was able to intimidate almost all of europe and a large proportion of latin america into accepting a us trained implant a trump puppet juan guaidó as the interim president attempting to push the true legitimate maduro government aside to put impunity to its crest the trump government blocked 12 billion dollars of venezuela s foreign reserves in ny bank accounts and transferred the authority of access to the money to the illegitimate self appointed interim president juan guaidó along the same lines the uk refused to return 1 2 billion dollars worth of venezuelan gold to caracas all these criminal acts would not be possible without the inside help i e the fifth column the members of which are often not readily identifiable it is not known how often the empire attempted regime change in cuba however none of these attempts were successful the cuban revolution will not be broken water resources is a human right and a vital component of an economy of resistance water resources will be more precious in the future than petrol the twin satellites grace gravity recovery and climate experiment discovered the systematic depletion of groundwater resources throughout the world due to over exploitation and massive contamination from agriculture and industrial waste examples among many are the northern punjab region in india with massive inefficient irrigation and in peru the pacific coastal region due to inefficient irrigation unretained runoff rain and river water into the pacific ocean and destruction of entire watersheds through mining privatization of water resources not only of drinking water and water for irrigation but of entire aquifers is becoming an increasing calamity for the peoples of our planet again with impunity giant water corporations led by france the uk and the us are gradually and quietly encroaching on the diminishing fresh water resources by privatizing them so as to make water a commodity to be sold at market prices manipulated by the water giants hence depriving ready access to drinking water to an ever growing mass of increasingly impoverished populations victims of globalized neoliberal economies for example nestlé and coca cola have negotiated with former brazilian president temer and now with bolsonaro a 100 year concession over the guaraní aquiver the largest known renewable freshwater underground resource 74 of which is under brazil bolsonaro has already said he would open up the amazon area for private investors that could mean privatization of the world s largest pool of fresh water the amazon basin economic resistance means water is a human right and is part of a country s sovereignty water should never be privatized for cuba rainwater on average about 1 300 mm year is the only resource of fresh water cuba like most islands is vulnerable to rainwater runoff estimated at up to 80 there are already water shortages during certain times of the year resulting in droughts in specific regions small retention walls may help infiltrate rainwater into the ground and at the same time regulate irrigation provide drinking water and possibly generate electricity for local use through small hydroelectric plants the national water resources institute inrh instituto nacional de recursos hidráulicos is aware of this issue and is formulating a forward looking water strategy and planning the construction of infrastructure works to secure a countrywide water balance other challenges include the hygienic reuse and evacuation of waste water as well as in the medium to long run an island wide integrated water resources management iwrm in conclusion economic resistance might be summarized as follows self sufficiency in food health services and education cuba has achieved the latter two and is now aiming at achieving 100 agricultural autonomy and in the meantime is advised diversifying food import markets health services and education cuba has achieved the latter two and is now aiming at achieving 100 agricultural autonomy and in the meantime is advised diversifying food import markets economic and financial sovereignty including progressive dedollarization deglobalizing monetary economy and creating internal monetary harmony including progressive dedollarization deglobalizing monetary

china and european union countries in view of trump with the american companies becoming wealthier they can generate higher taxes to fund the military growth of america how america started to change the trade policy steps by trump on september 2 2017 trump announced to withdraw from the u s trade agreement with south korea trump wants south korea to import more u s goods trump withdrew from further negotiations on the trans pacific partnership by signing an order on january 23 2017 he promised to replace it with number of bilateral agreements responding to this step japan and the european union announced their own trade deal on july 6 2017 they agreed to increase japanese auto exports to the eu and european food exports to japan heavy tariffs and quotas were imposed by trump administration on imported solar panels and washing machines on january 22 2018 china is the biggest exporter of solar panels and washing machines to u s then on march 1 2018 trump announced 25 percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on aluminum it may be noted that china and european union countries are the biggest exporter of these items to usa the steel users like automakers will see higher costs they ll pass on this cost to consumers with the tremendous fall in stock market analysts felt that trump s actions might start a trade war on august 16 2017 u s began renegotiating north american free trade agreement nafta with canada and mexico nafta is the world s largest trade agreement trump had threatened to withdraw from nafta and hit mexican imports with a 35 percent tariff further moving on his plan trump announced on may 8 2018 that he would withdraw the united states from the iran nuclear deal bba admissions 2024 open apply now tapmi bengaluru ipm

china retaliated the trade war the china united states trade war refers to the ongoing introduction of tariffs on goods traded between the united states and china on january 23 2018 president trump placed a 30 tariff on foreign solar panels which was to be reduced to 15 after four years china the world leader in solar panel manufacture decried the tariffs again on the same day tariffs of 20 were placed on washing machines for the first 1 2 million units imported during the year in united states in 2016 china exported 425 million worth of washers to the united states on april 3 2018 trump announced 25 tariffs on the chinese imported goods worth 50 billion the chinese products consisted of electronics aerospace and machinery the trump administration wants china to stop requiring u s companies to transfer their proprietary technology to chinese firms the companies must do this if they want to gain access to china s market china immediately retaliated hours later it announced 25 percent tariffs on 50 billion of u s exports to china again on april 6 2018 trump announced tariffs on 100 billion more of chinese imports interestingly it covers only one third of u s imports from china if china retaliates it could impose tariffs on all u s exports to china the trade negotiations to sort out the issue were going on however on april 10 2018 china said that trade negotiations had broken down the united states demanded that china should stop subsidizing the 10 industries prioritized in its made in china 2025 plan on the same day xi jinping president of china said that he would reduce tariffs on imported vehicles but it made little impact on trade regardless of tariffs the automakers find it is cheaper to build their products in china china agreed to remove tariffs on may 15 2018 on u s pork imports in exchange the united states will remove tariffs on chinese telecom company zte the move is seen as a weakness of trump this has led many european countries asking u s to avoid sanctions on companies that do business with iran they may threaten tariffs on u s imports as a bargaining tool liu he the economic advisor to chinese president xi jinping visited usa from may 15 to may 19 2018 for trade talks on may 20 it was reported that chinese officials had agreed to substantially reduce america s trade deficit with china by committing to increase its purchases of american goods on july 6 2018 the united states imposed 25 tariffs on 34 billion worth of chinese goods which led china to respond with similar sized tariffs on u s products again on july 10 following an order from u s president donald trump the u s trade representative ustr office published a list of 200 billion in chinese products to be subject to a newly proposed 10 tariff china blasted the proposed tariffs as irrational and unacceptable the trump administration said the tariffs were necessary to protect national security and the intellectual property of u s businesses and to help reduce the u s trade deficit with china in august 2017 trump had already opened a formal investigation into attacks on the intellectual property of america and its allies the theft of which had been costing america alone an estimated 225 billion to 600 billion a year u s vs european union trade policy it is not china alone trump trade policy is creating trade war with european union eu counties also although trump administration had announced earlier that it would delay the imposition of tariffs on eu countries canada mexico by another 30 days to renegotiate the trade terms there was no assurance that more time will yield any breakthroughs trump has imposed 25 import tariff on steel and 10 on aluminum this would apply to all of america s trading partners including close allies such as eu countries and canada rather than focussing on chinese producers alone the white house announced blanket import levies the secretaries and other trade experts in trump administration like robert lighthizer the u s trade representative and wilbur ross the commerce secretary argue that this blanket approach was necessary to prevent china from shipping steel and aluminum to the united states via third countries but to the europeans in particular the white house s move looks like the beginning of a campaign to eliminate the u s trade deficit by targeting a broad range of u s imports and promoting u s exports in fact this was the aim that donald trump had set out in speeches ever since the start of his presidential campaign after meeting with angela merkel the german chancellor at the white house trump brought up the u s steel industry saying its success was vital to national security he also talked about the u s trade deficit in goods with the e u which was 151 4 billion last year trump said that he was committed to remedy these trade balances trump has singled out the auto industry oblivious to the fact that general motors and ford have for many decades maintained extensive manufacturing operations in europe and since the nineteen nineties bmw and mercedes benz have had plants in the united states to protect their interest and to counter the trump trade policies angela merkel the german chancellor french president emmanuel macron and british prime minister theresa may spoke over telephone later merkel issued a statement saying that europe was resolved to defend its interests this was a signal that they wouldn t be pushed around by trump the e u has already drawn up a list of retaliatory tariffs targeted at iconic u s goods such as bourbon and harley davidson motorcycles that it would put in place if the white house goes ahead with its steel and aluminum tariff hike plans the trump administration reportedly wants the europeans to agree to a numerical cap on their steel exports as south korea has done as well as other measures designed to enhance access to the european market for american firms europeans are resisting the proposals from united states the european commission has issued a statement that says as a longstanding partner and friend of the u s we will not negotiate under threat any future transatlantic work program has to be balanced and mutually beneficial united states vs india trade policy india s trade with u s has been on the rise however with the imposition of tariffs by united states india has to rethink on some measures to protect its interests responding to a question on indo us bilateral trade deputy us trade representative jeffrey gerrish said that the progress made in bilateral relationship has been truly historic over the last several years the two way trade in 2017 reached 126 billion and that was a landmark after imposing tariffs on chinese imports washington filed a complaint at the world trade organization wto the first wto action of this administration over several export subsidy programmes in india these include the merchandise exports from india scheme the export oriented units scheme the electronics hardware technology parks scheme special economic zones and the export promotion capital goods scheme these actions may worry india india and u s have a trade imbalance of us 30 billion and given the current trends it is yet to be decided how to reduce it trump has made it clear that he wanted india to reduce the import tariff on its harley davidson motorcycles from 100 he has threatened to impose tariff otherwise on the motorcycles exported from india to the united states india u s trade has been on the rise and at present trump also wants to flourish it further the process is to be decided trump proposes to make immigration rules even more strict for indians also however many concessions are under discussion us trade representative jeffrey gerrish said we are two of the biggest economies in the world us biggest economy india is the sixth largest economy in the world given how larger economies are we think we can grow our trade significantly we think that it should be much larger than it is rationales by u s for tariffs pros president trump during his presidential campaign spoke to follow the policy of america first and cancel international trade deals creating deficit for the usa u s trade deficit is of 500 billion a year and with intellectual property ip theft of another 300 billion trump wants to eliminate it in january 2018 trump said he wanted the united states to have a good relationship with china but insisted that it should treat the united states fairly in his view america has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed its prosperity and shipped away its companies its jobs and nation s wealth the era of economic surrender is over from now on america expects trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal john ferriola the ceo and president of nucor america s largest steel producer and its largest metal recycler claimed that tariffs were not unfair but were simply leveling the playing field he explained that not only the european union but most countries in the world have a 25 percent or greater vat value added tax on products going into their countries from the united states so if we impose a 25 percent tariff all we are doing is treating them exactly as they treat us richard trumka president of the afl cio which represents over 12 million active and retired workers said that china has stolen u s intellectual property and bullied its way into acquiring critical u s advances in technology according to him tariffs aren t an end goal but an important tool to end trade practices that kill american jobs and drive down american pay a number of experts have focused on china s theft of intellectual property and that it forces u s firms that want to do business there into transferring its confidential technology and trade secrets before having access to their market trump trade policy may turn ineffective cons a july 2018 study indicated trump s policies have had little impact on the u s economy in terms of gdp or employment for example more jobs were created in president obama s last 19 months 3 89 million than in president trump s first 19 months 3 69 million till july 2018 the debt additions projected by cbo for the 2018 2027 period have increased from the 9 4 trillion that trump inherited from obama january 2017 cbo baseline to 13 7 trillion cbo current policy baseline a 4 3 trillion or 46 increase trump s trade policy is a rerun of a terrible 1980s policy where american consumers were the biggest losers president donald trump s trade policies are similar to protectionist trade policies of the 1980s the us s trade policies in the 1980s did little to reduce the trade deficit and ended up costing american consumers more than they helped the protected industries in the 1980s president ronald reagan and us lawmakers were concerned about the rising us trade deficit with japan as well as the country s strong entry into areas where the us typically dominated much like trump s focus on autos steel and emerging technologies reagan focused on autos steel and new semiconductor technology the 1980s policy also employed a series of tariffs quotas and other import restrictions to give a leg up to us companies in the fields the end result of the 1980s era policy was an inability to slow the growth in the us trade deficit according to the baml economists the deficit widened from 36 billion or 1 3 of gdp in 1980 to 170 billion or 3 7 of gdp in 1989 erecting trade barriers do not necessarily decrease the trade deficit one of the biggest problems with a focus on trade deficits is that they have as much to do with domestic policies as trade policy large government spending programs such as reagan s and trump s tax cuts and deficit spending can help fuel a trade imbalance the industries that are supposed to be protected may receive little help it happened in eighties too the restrictions on cars did shrink the total market share of japanese autos in the us but by less than three percentage points at the same time the total dollar value of japanese autos coming into the us rose due to large price increases similar experiences occurred in the steel and semiconductor industries with some small wins that came at substantial cost to the us consumer and american economy the moves can therefore do little to achieve their goal of reducing the us trade deficit china has announced retaliatory tariffs on us goods even the us s supposed allies mexico canada and the eu have imposed the tariffs of their own this risk of substantial

gluskin sheff has pointed out in the past that us stocks typically don t peak until after the moving average of jobless claims has hit a low for the cycle judged by the very small sample of past recessions on average the stockmarket peaks about 14 weeks after the trough with a recession following about a year later the most recent trough came on 15 september at 206 000 if that was the bottom

and then this week he pulled out of plans to build amazon s new headquarters in new york the reaction was predictably mixed both sides probably have a point it strikes me as self defeating to let a big company take its jobs elsewhere but it also strikes me as naive of amazon not to anticipate a backlash when it goes city shopping like this you can just imagine the moans if amazon had decided to open its hq in london and been given around 2bn worth of tax incentives to do so while local shops and small businesses are being crushed by ever rising rates you have to remember because it was easy to forget in the early 2000s and late 1990s when push comes to shove politics trumps economics and governments have more power than companies maybe the benefits of all those jobs outweigh the strain on the infrastructure and the cultural upheaval interesting isn t it that the same arguments made against gentrification are often those that are made against uncontrolled immigration yet one set of objections is deemed much more valid than the other but if people are no longer willing to accept that at face value then companies are going to need to rethink their approach amazon three months

abe was born in 1954 in tokyo to a political family his grandfather kishi nobusuke was imprisoned as a suspected war criminal before serving as prime minister between 1957 and 1960 his great uncle eisaku sato held the same position between 1964 to 1972 his views on japan s wartime past have often put him at odds with south korea and china abe studied political science in the 1970s in the us he joined the ldp and in 1982 became the secretary to his father abe shintaro who was serving as foreign minister abe became popular just after the turn of the century thanks in part to his tough stance against north korea first as a government official and then as prime minister he has consistently called for the return of 17 japanese citizens abducted by north korean operatives from 1977 to 1983 only five have been returned alive abe has also taken a hard line on the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula in july 2006 he became prime minister and was japan s youngest leader since fumimaro konoe in 1941 however by september 2007 his popularity had plummeted due in part to a series of financial scandals causing his party to lose control of the upper house abe resigned and yasuo kukuda became prime minister in 2012 abe was re elected leader of the ldp and two months later was elected to a second term as prime minister this time as part of a coalition between ldp and the new komeito party he angered china and south korea by visiting tokyo s yasukuni shrine a memorial to the country s war dead including several war criminals visits to the shrine by japanese politicians have remained a source of diplomatic tension between japan and its neighbours who claim it suggests a lack of contrition for wartime atrocities a more hawkish foreign policy the ldp won a snap election at the end of 2014 prompting abe to introduce a bill authorising japan to deploy its self defence forces overseas to defend allies or to confront a direct threat the legislation provoked protests in the streets but was enacted in 2015 the opposition criticised the abe administration for violating article 9 of japan s post war constitution which renounces war and bars the country from maintaining a military force critics fear the changes in defence policy would involve japan in conflict as an ally of the us abe s government justified the new law by pointing to china s growing military might and north korea s nuclear capabilities the us japan security alliance provides us armed forces with bases and ports in exchange for the guarantee of japan s security about 50 000 american troops are currently stationed in japan prime minister shinzo abe and his wife akie photo kyodo abenomics explained in his second term as prime minister abe set about stimulating the japanese economy through a series of reforms dubbed abenomics although the plan initially boosted growth increased consumption taxes contributed to a recession in 2014 according to abe his approach combines bold monetary policy flexible fiscal policy and a growth strategy that encourage private investments abe aimed to lift inflation above 2 per cent and drive growth to make the japanese economy more competitive long term in the early 1990s japan s real estate and stock market prices were inflated this asset bubble burst in 1992 and the japanese economy stagnated as a result different governments have tried to counter the situation by increasing public spending and lowering interest rates a certain amount of economic recovery was achieved abe s solution was to increase domestic spending and lead the country towards a sustainable recovery through three different methods or arrows the first is renewed fiscal stimulus worth trillions of yen particularly through infrastructure projects the second arrow and probably the most widely discussed was a new monetary policy adopted by japan lowering interest rates and initiating a massive asset purchase programme by 2015 the total amount of assets owned by the bank of japan boj amounted to about 70 per cent of the gdp of the country by comparison the us federal reserve s assets amount to 25 per cent of the country s gdp the third of abe s arrows is a raft of structural reforms to liberalise the labour market and the agricultural sector including corporate governance reform measures to help entrepreneurs and bring more women into the work force have abenomics worked japan has benefited from periods of economic growth and low unemployment since abe implemented his programme inflation however has remained lower than 2 per cent and the boj has conceded it will not reach that target until 2021 japanese corporations have also been reluctant to increase wages in 2017 real wages fell 0 2 per cent and household spending slowed by 0 1 per cent abe s reforms have also had limited success in putting more japanese women to work he may need to pursue more aggressive structural reforms or increased immigration some analysts worry the aggressive monetary and fiscal policies could leave the boj and the government little room to move in the event of any new economic crisis to offset some of these risks abe raised the national consumption tax from 5 per cent to 8 per cent in 2014 leading to recession another raise planned for 2017 was postponed until 2019 furthermore some have criticised a new possible boom in unnecessary infrastructure recalling the trillions of dollars spent building roads and bridges during the 1990s the lowering of the japanese yen s value has also prompted other countries to warn against a global currency war us president donald trump has accused abe of playing the devaluation market japanese prime minister shinzo abe and us president donald trump photo reuters domestic scandals and international standing abe was the first international leader to visit trump upon his election as us president in 2016 he has since sought to cultivate a close relationship with trump bearing in mind the threat from north korea and china s increasingly assertive conduct in the region despite this the us china trade war and the trump s administration lack of engagement in the asia pacific have led abe to seek rapprochement with china in october 2018 abe visited china after years of diplomatic strain over the disputed diaoyu islands known as the senkaku islands in japan and tokyo s handling of issues stemming from the second world war which still cast a shadow over ties between countries in asia this was the first formal visit by a japanese leader since 2011 domestically abe survived a corruption scandal involving several of his cabinet members public land was sold to a right wing school for a discounted price and akie abe the first lady was involved in the transaction

joining our call with me in greenwich are matt fassler our chief strategy officer and tavio headley senior director of investor relations well look there s no other way to say it we missed the quarter we miscalculated the weakness in france and the u k and in december our largest customer pulled back their postal injection business which is part of last mile that affected our ebitda in december this had a significant impact in december and in the quarter 10 stocks we like better than xpo logistics when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has quadrupled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy right now and xpo logistics wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 31 2019 that said we delivered record full growth profitability we generated organic revenue growth of 9 3 and we grew our adjusted ebitda faster than revenue at 14 3 in the fourth quarter in our logistics segment we realized organic revenue growth of 12 4 driven by our technology a few years ago before we developed our own warehouse management system it wouldn t have been possible to implement a hundred logistics start ups in one year in 2018 we completed a record 118 start ups up from 91 in 2017 in our north american less than truckload business we improved our adjusted operating ratio by another 260 basis points to 87 3 that s our best fourth quarter ratio in over 30 years in december our xpo direct network reached critical mass for very large customers with national distribution needs we ve grown xpo direct to more than 90 facilities now we have a backlog of blue chip customers hungry to get access to the variable cost solutions we offer contract logistics last mile labor technology transportation and the storage capabilities of xpo direct also in december our board authorized 1 billion stock buyback which we completed earlier this month as we announced yesterday the board has authorized an additional buyback of up to 1 5 billion while we love m a the acquisition that will create the most shareholder value right now is acquiring our stock as you saw in the release we brought down the numbers for 2019 we can t ignore the fact that our largest customer is curtailing about two thirds of its business with us we had substantial capacity dedicated to this customer in brokerage last mile and logistics but we believe the great bulk of these resources should be redeployed over the next couple of quarters and then there s the macro in europe not great on the bright side we have a new strategic account organization in europe it s very good at getting our message across to large customers with complex supply chains and to some degree this may help with volatility we have a number of other tailwinds working for us in 2019 and many of them are substantial there s a high demand for our e commerce services and we expect full year benefits from the record number of logistics projects we started out through 2018 also there s the expansion of our last mile hubs and our ltl pricing technology which we can get into more in our q a finally i d like to tip my hat to our 100 000 employees they ve created a culture that has led to fortune magazine naming us as one of the world s most admired companies for the second year in a row and the most admired company in our category we are also honored that we were voted the third best place to work in the u k in a survey taken by glassdoor we have 22 000 employees in the u k and i appreciate their enthusiasm and we share that enthusiasm we have a firm handle on 2019 plenty to be excited about and are and i m confident in our ability to create significant shareholder value with that i ll ask matt to review the numbers in more detail matt s been done a fantastic add to the team i hope you enjoy working with him as much as i do matt matt fassler chief strategy officer thanks brad i m delighted to be on the team xpo is an amazing organization and to those on the call i look forward to meeting many of you in the weeks and months ahead now i ll walk you through the numbers the backdrop and our strategic focus by business unit starting with our transportation segment we grew revenue in the quarter by 1 8 to 2 8 billion gaap operating income declined by 19 inclusive of a number of charges adjusted ebitda from transportation grew by 3 to 272 million while our revenue growth moderated we were disciplined with costs and expanded our adjusted ebitda margin for the quarter as we did for the year in north american ltl our tonnage declined 1 1 moderating from a 1 5 decline in q3 as we continued to target more profitable freight revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel rose 1 1 reflecting pricing initiatives higher rate per shipment and shorter length of haul we also achieved a 4 9 rate increase with contract renewals we re leveraging our labor more efficiently and improving our claims performance both of which are contributing to better profitability in ltl turning to freight brokerage our technology helped us navigate mixed market conditions in the quarter our net revenue increased 6 2 despite a 3 3 decline in gross revenue within freight brokerage truck brokerage revenue was down a bit more we re continuing to deploy technology across our brokerage business in xpo connect our digital freight marketplace we now have more than 14 000 carriers registered and we ve more than doubled the number of digital bids submitted by drivers seeking loads we ve also grown the number of transactions booked through xpo connect by more than four times compared to q3 and we ve increased the conversion of digital bids by a factor of three we attribute much of the success to our counteroffer future which negotiates automatically based on real life market conditions this has led to better gross margins in intermodal our fourth quarter revenue increased in the low double digits year over year the peak season was strong pricing in intermodal has recently become more subdued as the truck market loosens but keep in mind that with our multimodal footprint we re poised to move with the market and capitalize on transportation volume of any kind with last mile our revenue tracked flat year over year and net revenue declined by 10 million or 13 for context the largest part of our last mile business is heavy goods delivered directly to consumers on behalf of major retailers and consumer brands this is our core last mile business and we are the undisputed leader in north america this core business is performing well and we re continuing to win new contracts for dedicated service which is supported by our national network we have 85 last mile hubs in north america and we re excited to have that capacity for growth a smaller part of last mile for us is direct injection of freight into the postal system while we welcome this business it has lower barriers to entry and it s less differentiated than heavy goods we had a major impact to the fourth quarter when our largest customer decided to curtail its postal injection we ll be cycling through this in 2019 our european transportation business generated revenue growth of 6 1 in the quarter which on an organic basis equates to 4 and a half percent growth this was slower than our third quarter trend and it weighed in ebitda in france where we have our largest european presence the yellow vest disruption so to speak put a damper on ltl brokerage and dedicated truckload turning to our other segment the growth story in logistics remains terrific segment revenue was up 10 globally in the quarter and 12 on an organic basis operating income was 42 million and adjusted ebitda was 127 million up 11 from q4 of the prior year in north america our revenue growth in logistics reflects ongoing strength in consumer packaged goods food and beverage and e commerce in europe revenue grew 6 higher organically with the main tailwind coming from e commerce through 2018 we averaged more than one customer start up per week in each of the u s and europe now in 2019 we have a robust logistics pipeline of active bids and good long term visibility we expect some moderation in the pace of new logistics start ups coming off an exceptionally strong year the uncertainty in europe could be a factor but the segment overall is definitively in secular growth mode companywide cash flow from operations in the quarter was 566 million and free cash flow was 479 million for the full year we generated cash flow from operations of 1 1 billion and free cash flow of 694 million which was substantially above target our net capex was 408 million this included growth capex of 551 million and asset sales of 143 million i want to mention the fourth quarter restructuring charge we reported it was 19 million or 14 million after taxes this was largely for severance costs we expect to realize annualized savings of about 55 million before i wrap up i ll spend a minute on working capital management this was brought up on the third quarter call as a focus for the company going forward in the fourth quarter we did a good job of controlling our working capital through two initiatives the first is factoring our use of factoring become more significant in q4 and i want to provide you with some insights the majority of our factoring relates to large customers in our contract logistics business most of these customers require extended payment terms at the same time our logistics business is growing fast which uses more working capital so factoring is a good strategy here it s also a low cost source of funding for us in most cases our cost ranges from libor plus 70 to libor plus 110 basis points the incremental year over year benefit for our free cash flow from factoring was about 200 million the second initiative is collections this has been a big focus of our working capital management with progress on speeding up collections in q4 we outperformed our own expectations for operating cash flow and free cash flow for 2019 we re guiding to adjusted ebitda of 1 65 billion to 1 725 billion which represents 6 to 10 growth this range reflects the fact that we ll be managing through the significant reduction in business from our largest customer beyond postal injection and we re also taking a more cautious view of europe we do think we ll see increasing benefits from our internal growth initiatives in the back half of the year for the full year we re expecting free cash flow in the range of 525 to 625 million this compares to the 650 million target we shared with you in december it reflects the lower growth rate we expect for adjusted ebitda and the higher interest expense we expect from funding our new share repurchase program we anticipate net capex of 400 to 450 million and d a of 765 to 785 million we re planning cash interest expense of 275 to 315 million and we re using a tax rate of 26 to 29 with cash taxes in the range of 165 to 190 million we expect to be users of free cash in the first quarter with free cash flow building over the course of the year consistent with our typical seasonality so in summary 2018 was a strong year of growth and profitability ending on a down note that will impact part of 2019 but we are focused on growth there are many opportunities for us across the marketplace we have a broad range of integrated solutions for customers leading positions in fast growing areas of the industry and a strong track record as an innovator with that i ll turn back it back to the operator and we ll take your questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from the line of jack atkins with stephens inc please proceed with your question jack atkins stephens inc analyst hey guys good morning and thank you very much for taking my questions so brad i guess the first one is on the receivable factoring and i appreciate the additional commentary there but i can t think of another transportation logistics company that does that and does that i guess can you kind of help us think through why you re choosing to do that now versus in prior years and i guess will we see other companies do that as really to manage around liquidity challenges and is that the case here with xpo matt fassler chief strategy officer sure jack it s matt i m happy to take that question most of our factoring the majority of our factoring is associated with our contract logistics business and we believe that factoring is fairly common around among our contract logistics peers and our customers oftentimes have facilities in place with money center banks that are accustomed to working on factoring transactions with them we have ample liquidity as evidenced by our buyback and our ability to fund capital allocation at our discretion jack atkins stephens inc analyst ok matt and then i guess the second question brad for you bigger picture question but the message from yourself and xpo senior leaders during 2018 was that this company was investing for the future taking excess profits and reinvesting them so that you could drive sustainable double digit or midteens ebitda growth really regardless of what the cycle is doing that s why you guys told folks to expect not to expect a big surge in profits in 2018 despite an extremely strong freight cycle we have seen a significant reduction in your ebitda outlook over the last three months how do you explain the step functionn change in your growth outlook when you guys were supposed to be a secular growth story brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer good question jack so several quarters ago i was asked if the macro stays the same as it is what would we grew at and i said 15 to 18 which is the level we were growing at that s on the ebitda level if we have the same macro now as we had a year ago we would still be growing at that level we don t the macro softened when we saw that softening particularly in france and the u k where we have a quarter of our business we brought down guidance we brought down guidance when we saw that 15 to 18 was not there because the macro was deteriorating for the geographies that we have business in and we brought it down to 12 to 15 we had another significant development when our largest customer pulled back at least two thirds of their business and that s a big development and there s no way that you can t bring guidance down when you lose 600 million of revenue on very short notice i m optimistic that we will get that business back from other customers we ve got strong strong people in place technology in place access to capacity we give excellent service we gave excellent service to that customer we will we turned done business from other customers because we had limited resources we are going to redeploy those resources over the next couple of quarters and i believe that they ll be utilized in the second half of the year jack atkins stephens inc analyst ok fair enough brad thanks again for the time brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you jack operator our next question comes from the line of ariel rosa with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question ariel rosa bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning guys so i wanted to start talking about customer concentration one of the things that i think xpo has touted as one of its strengths is that it s not overly focused on any particular customer but here we ve seen kind of two quarters in a row where some disappointing news from a particular customer has really put a real dent in results and i want to talk about i kind of want to get your thoughts on the extent to which maybe that perception is changing or how you manage your customer base maybe has shifted or should investors be thinking about customer concentration differently from how they would have maybe six months ago brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer well in 2018 our top 5 customers represented about 11 of revenue and you saw that in the k the largest customer however represented roughly about four 5 of that two thirds of that business has gone away so that s a body blow no question about it going forward with that customer having downsized we anticipate that our top 5 customers in 2019 will represent about 8 of revenue so customer concentration will be less but when you lose your when you lose the majority of your top customer s business that hurts nothing you can do there s nothing positive it s only negative you mentioned also the house of fraser write off in the third quarter i don t view that as anywhere near as significant as losing 600 million of business from our top customer that was a bankruptcy cost us 16 million we did not take it as an add back we deducted it from earnings and that s that was a miss but 16 million of a miss when the full year is over 1 5 billion i don t view that as a big significant thing i view the loss of 600 million of revenue as a significant thing that we will rebound from in the second half of this year ariel rosa bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok great that s helpful color and then just on my second question i wanted to see if you can talk brad maybe about how you see xpo s technology differentiation as a point that maybe puts it apart from peers obviously you guys talk a lot about your it capabilities with this customer stepping away obviously they feel that they can replicate that i m wondering if that s a risk that is present with other customers or do you feel that your moat is still sufficient to make the business fairly defensible against this kind of thing recurring going forward and then maybe just really quickly if i could tag on a side note to that question maybe you can talk about the margin impact that we ll see from the departure of this customer brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer on tech i view what we do in tech extremely positively we spent about 500 million in tech in 18 we ll spend 550 million in tech this year and we go over the rois of every tech investment that we have very carefully and if we wanted to we would have a lot more opportunities to deploy in tech but what i like about our technology innovations are things like our labor productivity tools when a company has as many billions and billions of dollars of labor costs as we do managing labor productivity in terms of rightsizing the headcount in terms managing overtime not too much not too little has a big impact and the labor productivity tools that we rolled out last year in contract logistics improved our productivity between 2 and 5 and we are transferring those over to ltl and have a big employee base there too so in addition to labor productivity tools we rolled out new inventory management tools in contract logistics last year again helps us further differentiate ourselves from our competitors continued traction with xpo connect continues we ve got 14 000 carriers sign ups to date so the trajectory there has been very very fast and we have a whole bunch of ltl technology that rolled out over the course of 2018 from dynamic route optimization to advanced pricing algorithms to ai based load building to linehaul bypass models and many other features and if you look at the company in every country in every line of business automation automation automation is a key key focus where we have thousands and thousands of robots that just we keep rolling out particularly in contract logistics in the back office robotic process automation is having a real positive effect in many places of our organization so i think our technology is very strong and gives us an extremely competitive moat it s one of the main reasons that customers choose us yes we ve lost two thirds of our largest customer but we have 50 000 other customers and we feel very strong about the technology we bring to bear more importantly our customers feel very strongly and they value the technology ariel rosa bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok great and then just really quickly the margin impact matt fassler chief strategy officer yes so it s matt i ll take that so you should think about that margin flowing through because you have to think about contribution margin when we lose that business that business erodes we don t necessarily lose the corporate expenses associated with that not right away so think about that flowing through it s slightly higher than company average ebitda margin now obviously we have steps in place to defray that impact that would be more evident in the second half of the year so it s not a lot to the business based on everything we ve told you we re doing what we can do to keep the ebitda margin flattish the adjusted ebitda margin flattish in the first part of the year and then you would expect to see certainly embedded in our plan some adjusted ebitda margin expansion in the second half of the year some of that s associated with cycling house of fraser in q3 cycling the particularly painful impact of the direct postal injection business in q4 but it s also the general recovery we expect as we redeploy some of that capacity in the second half of the year ariel rosa bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it ok thank you for the time operator our next question comes from the line of chris wetherbee with citi please proceed with your question unknown speaker hi guys it s james on for chris thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask about organic growth where do you expect the lion s share of that to come from and what might the cadence of it be matt fassler chief strategy officer what was the second part of your question the cadence of organic growth unknown speaker correct matt fassler chief strategy officer sure the organic growth this year should be more weighted to supply chain it s where we have the highest visibility due to the contractual nature of the business and the new start ups that we spoke about over the course of 2018 the majority of the business that we re losing with our largest customer is going to come in the transport segment so that s where you re going to see more pressure on organic growth as you think about rules of thumb based on what we know this year looking at fx looking at fuel there is a point to a point plus of difference between organic growth and reported revenue growth on a full year basis that difference is bigger in the first part of the year which is a function of the strength in the dollar and that gap should narrow as you make your way through the year brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer i ll add on to that if you look at 2018 supply chain contract logistics was a juggernaut it definitely remains in secular growth mode and we remain in taking market share mode the in q4 globally our logistics organic revenue growth was up 12 4 and we ve been averaging more than two start ups a week and we did a record number of 118 start ups in contract logistics in 2018 including 28 in the fourth quarter so all those 118 contract logistics start ups that we layered in throughout 2018 we ll get the full year contribution of those here in 2019 unknown speaker and then focusing a little bit more on europe should we expect that to grow or do you should we see net revenues in decline across 2019 brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer well in order to answer that question you got to figure out what your assumption is for brexit and for france so in u k if there s a hard exit that s going to be a negative if there s a soft brexit that s going to be a positive if there s an extension of brexit and they just both agree to keep negotiating for a longer period of time that i would give that a neutral obviously if they change their whole position and it becomes remain and they say forget about brexit that d be extremely positive but from our perspective in our numbers we ve baked in status quo and that would change the positive to negative depending on where brexit ends up in france we re also assuming the status quo in the guidance we ve given france troy was in france representing us with president macron s annual event with business leaders and the tone was a lot different than it was a year ago a year ago everyone was bragging about their new commitments their new expansions and openings and capex and this year it was quite subdued we are assuming that the yellow jacket event continuing that it doesn t go into a recession but doesn t go two 3 gdp positive that the level of malaise to use a french word in france continues just the way it is right now obviously if you went into positive gdp in a significant way that would be a positive if it went into recession that would be a negative now we are taking actions in all these situations the things we can control there s things we can t control but even the things we don t control we can react to those and we can position ourselves for the best outcome in regards to eventuality so in france we ve added two fantastic executives jean emmanuel mongnot and bernard wehbe who were with us here in greenwich for a week a few weeks ago i m just very very impressed with them and they have replaced and upgraded about two thirds of their middle management teams so it s a strong morale it s a strong group obviously we re focused on cost control when there s not a lot of top line growth and in brexit we are in u k we ve had a fantastic team there and on the senior and middle level for a long long time and they re very agile very capable very competent to deal with and experienced in dealing with all types of economies unknown speaker thank you for taking the question brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of amit mehrotra with deutsche bank please proceed with your question amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst thanks operator brad the company has missed expectations two quarters in a row it s brought down guidance three times in the last four months just given that near term track record why i think there s a real question about why we should believe the company guidance today and i think it s an important question to understand how robust the 2019 guidance is and what are the assumptions that underpin it and how confident are you in achieving that and what s the likelihood that two months from now we re looking at flat ebitda and another down free cash flow number and then related to that what are you assuming for the 300 million that remains with the existing customer for 2019 brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer ok let me plenty of questions in there all good ones let me unpack them first of all i agree with the implication in the first question that is gee you ve missed two quarters in a row and you brought guidance down so you don t believe in exactly what our guidance is and having some skepticism in it is understandable and this has not been our track record this is not who we are we accurately forecasted our performance for seven years and then two quarters in a row we slipped on a banana peel twice not good having said that there was a reason why we missed in the third quarter one of our customers house of fraser went bankrupt and we had they had been a good customer until they went bankrupt and we had a 16 million write off so we missed and that s what it was and it s unfortunate and we ve tightened up our controls so we don t have another exposure like that in the fourth quarter the reason it has nothing to do with the bankruptcy really the main factor was in the middle of december we were notified by our largest customer who also happened to be our largest customer in postal injection that they were pulling the business and that turned into a business that was expected to have a significant profit in december and turned into a significant loss in december we had a lot of capacity all ready to go and it wasn t utilized and it was getting close to christmas and we kept the people and we just lost money simple as that so that blew the quarter and france and the u k were a little softer but the real big killer was postal injection look that s unfortunate all of the things that are unfortunate happen but those things happened and the results are what they are you asked about going forward the guidance that we ve given has been brought down significantly we believe that we can hit that guidance it s reasonable it s well considered it s a bottoms up guidance it s been pressure tested it changed a lot and was brought down this week because on tuesday we were notified of the bulk of that 600 million going away so we had to revise our guidance internally within a few days and we believe we ve put out guidance that we can hit are we going to beat a little bit or miss a little bit on certain lines we could we re human but overall the guidance that we ve given and the guidance that we believe in and you ve noticed that in our materials we ve especially brought down guidance for the first half of the year while we re regaining our traction from the business that we ve lost but i feel good about the second half of the year because while i have had the time to reposition to redeploy those people and those resources it s not going to happen overnight it s going to take a couple of quarters as i mentioned before we ll get the full year contribution of the 118 logistics start ups we did the whole year similarly we ll get the full year benefit of the 85 last mile hubs that we layered in through the year the north american strategic account manager organization is on fire the closed ones increased 45 in 2018 versus 2018 it s been so successful that we ve copied that winning strategy and formed a single point of contract sales organization in europe in november we hired a great person from dhl excuse me from db schenker and he s now hired 11 sams strategic account managers under him we have four more to go we ve assigned the top 200 customers to that team and i have a lot of positive expectations from them so the second half has easier comps than the first half does the second half we won t we ll have lapped that house of fraser write off we ll have lapped that department of defense contract we ll have lapped the fourth quarter last mile loss so life gets a little easier as we build back the business that we lost and that we lap these money losing events that happened in the second half of this year amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst i wrote down brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer but last i m sorry to interrupt you you asked also what are we assuming on the other 300 million that remains with that customer most of that business but not all of that business is under long term contracts that expire over the next three years so contractually that business shouldn t go away there s other parts of that business that could be at risk and we ve assumed some of it might go away not all of it and we haven t assumed all of it will stay amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst ok just for my follow up there s obviously a lot of highly valuable assets in the business on their own merits whether it s the ltl business that isn t being impacted by the largest customer moving out the faster growing logistics business but the implied valuation of these businesses suffering from like the conglomerate discount of the complexity of the model so just given that fact would you then maybe be more willing in light of what s occurred over the last six months just to spin off certain parts of the business bringing new management at those businesses and allow those business to float on their own to get the valuation that they deserve is that something that s more possible now brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer i don t think that would be a wise course of action and the reason i think that there s several reasons no 1 from a customer perspective and don t forget it s the customers who wire money from their accounts to ours so we have to always make our decisions based on what s going to please the customer what s going to get the customer give us more business what s going to do ingratiate ourselves with the customers what s going to delight the customer and having that total package of supply chain solutions and having for the big customers a single point of contact that can be a solutions provider is big it s really big it gets us talking to the most senior levels of supply chain officers in our customers and makes us more consultative rather than just a bidder on rfps on ltl the business is growing strong we grew adjusted operating income by 33 in the fourth quarter on a year over year basis we improved our operating ratio by 260 basis points we had our best operating ratio in 30 years in each quarter in 2018 our operating ratio improved on a year over year basis so i feel good about where we re going on ltl we have more opportunity to improve it ahead of us i think that business was separate it would be less valuable to our customers and therefore our shareholders than it is as part of an organization so if you look at our top customers in ltl almost all of them are using many other modes of our business as well i can t think of one of them that just uses ltl if you look at our top 25 ltl accounts on average they use five or six i mean they re very big users of all of our different services and when our sams our strategic account managers are meeting with those customers those are several hour meetings where there s many people from the customer in those meetings and we re going over how can we save them money how can we change modes for them how can we help redeploy their inventory how can they use our predictive analytics how can we update their technology how can they outsource more things to us that we can do better than they can if you have the company in separate pockets you would never have those conversations and your value proposition would be weaker now the other part i d like to address is so what do we want to use our capital for what we want to use our capital for is the best acquisition that is out there our own stock because we have confidence in the long term value of our stock and that s what i want to use the cash for amit mehrotra deutsche bank analyst got it all right thank you for taking my questions appreciate it brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you amit operator our next question comes from the line of ravi shanker with morgan stanley please proceed with your question ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst thanks good morning guys brad in addition to this the loss of your largest customer i think you guys closed a couple of warehouses in the last couple of months one with verizon and one with an unnamed customer can you give us some more color there i mean was that loss of business as well or was were you just kind of moving business between facilities brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer we are always opening and closing contract logistics facilities so last year we opened up 118 including 28 in the fourth quarter we did when we open a facility we don t put out a press release the press usually doesn t pick it up sometimes they do usually they don t when we close a facility so it has a certain number of employees we put out what s called a warn notice w a r n notice and that becomes widely distributed and gets a lot of attention but the amount of locations we closed last year you could count on a couple of hands so we re clearly in growth mode in the contract logistics growth remains very strong there you saw that in north america organic revenue growth in the fourth quarter is 17 and our strength in consumer packaged goods and in food and beverage and e com growth is accelerating in these places now i feel very very bullish about our i think on the supply chain part of our business very very strong so the challenge we have is more on the tech now you mentioned a couple of facilities that get a lot of press closing two of them which were one on the east coast one in the midwest that was with our largest customer so those were contracts that had been many year contracts and the contract were coming up for renewal or for ending and they chose to end them and i don t know for sure whether they brought them in house or not but whatever they decided to do with them we respect that decision the customer is the king and the customer can decide whatever they want to do with those you mentioned the verizon facility we have a great relationship with verizon it goes back decades they re an important partner of ours it s strong we serve them in many parts of the country and we love them we think they re an amazing company and we wish we had more of verizon we did close one facility in tennessee because verizon is always evaluating its supply chain they have a complex supply chain a big supply chain it s a global supply chain and they made the decision to transition the distribution of their wireless products out of memphis to several other distribution centers around the country so that is just one part of their ongoing process ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst got it that s really helpful and just a follow up on your largest customer i mean it looks like they ve made some moves pretty aggressively i d say in source logistics and maybe even build out their own logistics network i mean do you see them becoming a competitor over time as they build that network out brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer look most of our large customers are our competitor most of them have their own trucks their own fleet and their dedicated business for the most part they do themselves and the irregular and difficult and challenging and spot business they largely outsource and we get a lot of their backhaul business so they re running repetitive loads and they have a head haul they don t have a backhaul so they use 3pl like ourselves for the backhaul so there s it s not like customers are most customers are not all in house or all outsourcing most of them are a blend and some outsource more than others and some the trend is to outsource more over time and some customers the strategy is to in source more over time so we have 1 trillion ocean that we re swimming in here the addressable market even just between north america and europe for the exact services we provide is 1 trillion and we ve got even at 17 billion 18 billion we have less than 2 of that total addressable market so we can be agile we can be flexible and we can move to and fro with our changing needs of our customers ravi shanker morgan stanley analyst great thanks guys brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of scott schneeberger with oppenheimer and company please proceed with your question scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company analyst thanks good morning i guess if we could focus on ltl for a moment brad you touched on how it performed in 2018 i was curious what you re thinking about for operating ratio volume price yield things of that ilk as we look into 2019 and how much of that is a driver for the guidance brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer i think on ltl the strategy that we ve had will continue so we have been emphasizing more yield improvements than tonnage we like tonnage we ll take all the tonnage we can get as long as it matches our system and at a reasonable price we re not interested in practice runs with tonnage that we don t make a profit on and we ve had a multiyear process of calling out that freight and i mentioned earlier in the call that for good and bad our almost all of our top ltl customers use many other modes of business so we can t just fire a customer without having influences on other parts of the business so in getting reasonable yield improvements with both customers and other customers and sometimes that s been at the sacrifice of tonnage and that strategy is going to continue we re we see industrial economy is still good it s not great like it was a year ago but still good it s positive and growing and we re going to participate in that growth scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company analyst all right and then shifting gears it was asked about the remaining 300 million but the 600 million that s going away is sizable could you give us a sense of how much of that was the postal injection and then how much maybe was other parts of the business and matt touched upon the contribution margin but just wanted to get a feel for how large that postal injection business was and what the other parts are matt fassler chief strategy officer so you re going to be able to see this play out in the financial statements through gross revenue in the last mile segment which is likely to come down for most of the year because that is where the postal injection business was you should think about very high level ballpark a third or so of the 600 million associated with that business and we ll do our best as the year goes on to quantify its impact in any given period the rest of it would be in the transportation elsewhere in the transportation arena some of it in brokerage a little bit of it in intermodal and maybe a smattering of it in the contract logistics business but as we said earlier most of it in the transportation arena scott schneeberger oppenheimer and company analyst all right thanks very much brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott operator our next question comes from the line of kevin sterling with seaport global securities please proceed with your question kevin sterling seaport global securities analyst thank you good morning brad matt and tavio brad switching gears here real quick can you update us how the cfo search is going brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer cfo search is going well we did pivot in december what the specs should be when we had the short seller report come out the stock went down quite a bit we said hey we should really be buying our stock rather than buying companies given the valuation discrepancy so we had invested a fair amount of time in looking for cfo who was a cfo of a public company of at least our size and hopefully much more given the amount of acquisition activity that we re planning so we re looking for someone who had a lot of m a experience about integration and multiyear transformation experience when we pivoted to ok that s we have to deal with reality that is our stock price has come down our valuation s come down and therefore we should be doing our stock buyback our stock rather than buying another company so and we need a different type of cfo so we more or less restarted the search in december that s the good news is that s a much wider pool of candidates than ones who have been fortune 50 cfos who have m a experience so we ve seen a big upflow a big uptick in cfo candidates i can t put a time frame on it but i can tell you that we ve got good candidate flow kevin sterling seaport global securities analyst gotcha ok thank you and just i don t want to dwell on it too much but just understanding the business with your large customer that s pulling out when you guys got in the last mile business with the acquisition of 3pd was this customer a customer of 3pd or do you grow with this customer just recently i guess my question is had they always had this large customer always been a customer of 3pd or just recently have you had you grown with them brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer i m not 100 certain of that but i think that they were not a customer of 3pd or if they were they were a small one so the more important part of your question is have we grown with them yes we grew a lot up with them over the last few years and we knew that that business wasn t going to stay forever and ever and ever because of that particular customer s stated business plans and because that customer is transactional in some respect in terms of the nature that they have with their vendors and that s fair customers can have any kind of approach they want with their vendors we didn t think we re going to come to end so quickly we didn t think it was going to come to an end so abruptly and it really hasn t come to an end it s been downsized we still have a chance to prove to them that maybe we should get a second chance and come back and do something that can help them and i don t rule out that we could possibly get some business back but we re not counting on it we re counting on that they re going in a different direction for the most of their business and that we should be redeploying those resources for new customers kevin sterling seaport global securities analyst ok and last question here brad we re seeing some shake up in the ltl industry with some companies that are struggling some bankruptcies are you seeing an opportunity there as we see possible further consolidation in capacity reduction within ltl brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer i was surprised to see the ltl carrier bankruptcy announced recently in the northeast given that the market environment is pretty good for ltl to answer your question yes we have seen an uptick in inquiries from their customers some of that freight matches our network and we re happy to take it and other part of freight doesn t we were in a meeting earlier this week actually and our in ltl and everyone s phones were lighting up and it was basically from customers looking for replacement capacity there kevin sterling seaport global securities analyst ok well that s all i had thank you for your time this morning brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of allison landry with credit suisse please proceed with your question allison landry credit suisse analyst thanks good morning in terms of the excess capacity related to the customer loss could you give us a sense of where rather what segments you plan to redeploy those resources and then i wanted to get your thoughts on whether this loss of business is also hurting your ability to attract contract carriers in last mile since presumably the utilization is now a lot lower brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer allison the answer to the first part of your question is transportation far more than logistics in the logistics segment it really was a few warehouses so not the end of the world in the other parts of transportation very significant and with respect to geography north america almost entirely the business we have in europe with that customer is of a long term contractual nature and on the logistics side you asked another question about our ability to attract contract carriers in last mile we are doing great in last mile for heavy goods for big and bulky that is a different part of the business than what this customer was removed from us the business that we did for that customer that left was postal injection meaning going into fulfillment centers in the middle of the night and getting lots of parcels and putting shrink wrap around them and putting them on pallets and putting them in the truck and zipping them over to the post office so that business has been very substantially decreased in our big and bulky business we still are the largest one our customers love us the feedback we get from our customers is extremely positive carriers like working with us since we have a steady repeatable business when we gain customers and lose customers that s you can do that in any business including that one but overall that business is healthy allison landry credit suisse analyst ok and then in fedex has also talks about entry into last mile heavy goods maybe in the next 12 months or so so just curious to know how you re thinking about that and how you re handicapping the competitive risk brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer i have a huge amount of respect for fedex i think fedex is just an amazingly run company and they re a great competitor and customer and vendor of ours so we have a good relationship with fedex in this particular case we re going to be a competitor and we re going to be honorable competitors competing in the market they have an amazing brand they have an amazing sales force they know how to run a transportation business so i m sure they re going to do very well they re going to test pilot it and we ll see them in the competitive arena we like the positioning we ve got like the critical mass we have the technology we like the long term it s a business in last mile that s a business that takes a long time to figure out and get right and customers demand extremely high levels of customer satisfaction if anyone can copy us and get it right it would be fedex they are not the only competitor we have in last mile that s also a fantastic company that we re seeing in the marketplace j b hunt has made a big move in last mile another well run company ryder is coming to the business another well run company on balance we like having competent competitors because they know how to run a business for p l they know how to run a business to make money they don t do sloppy pricing they re rational and are honorable so we welcome the competition and we like our position here in last mile allison landry credit suisse analyst ok that s really helpful thank you brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of brian ossenbeck with jp morgan please proceed with your question brian ossenbeck jp morgan analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the questions just two quick ones here on going back to the restructuring of the cost structure a bit you mentioned matt some severance costs there in the prepared remarks just wanted to get some clarity as to that 55 million is a full run rate for 19 that s baked into guidance it seems like it s separate from kind of ongoing labor productivity and inventory management so if you could just speak and run through that in more detail and then just from a bigger picture perspective are there any barriers of the cost structure you think will take a little bit more time to flex down if the macro doesn t cooperate here matt fassler chief strategy officer sure i ll start with that so the charge that we took was largely for headcount and the severance associated with that that number of approximately 55 million is an annualized run rate we re not quite there at the outset of the veer but we re likely to make our way to that run rate reasonably soon keep in mind that we re experiencing labor inflation like everyone else and we did not execute on this restructuring tactically to counter labor inflation but as you think about the modeling of the business there is a reality that we re facing labor inflation in this economy as our competitors and our peers and from a modeling process the proceeds if you will or the run rate benefits of the restructuring will aid the earnings of the business but they re somewhat of an offset to that from the underlying weight inflation in the marketplace your second question again if you would please brian ossenbeck jp morgan analyst yes sure on the any structural impediments whether it s labor agreements unions that would take a little bit more time to adjust if volume doesn t hit that guidance or hit the mark where you think it could be matt fassler chief strategy officer that s not applicable to us we don t have labor agreements and any significant measure here in north america that s only in europe brian ossenbeck jp morgan analyst ok and then just a quick follow up on the buyback obviously you announced and completed the last one fairly quickly and i understand you re buying back the best company you think there is right now which is the xpo portfolio when do you think you d be in the market are you watching to see what the do you see kind of what the market s tell you which is maybe keep some dry powder for another deal down the road just how do you envision that program rolling out here coming on the heels of the other one you just completed brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer well we ended the year in about 2 4 net debt to ebitda if we buyback another a billion or so out of a billion and a half in the coming let s say a month for the sake of discussion that would bring our leverage up to 3 3 3 4 and then if we use our cash flow to pay down net debt it will bring our leverage back down to 2 6 2 7 so we re comfortable in that range and we ll take into consideration leverage levels and we ll take into consideration economic conditions if the economic conditions get better we d be more aggressive but we and if the economic conditions worsen we d be a little bit more cautious but we d also take into consideration the stock price and at various levels we would be more opportunistic than others i think you also mentioned something about m a brian as i said earlier and you intimated yes m a is in our corporate dna there s no question about that we love m a we have a very good track record of creating significant shareholder value through m a but today even though we spent a lot of time we re getting very close to concluding a long search for a good m a candidate the best m a target is acquiring our own stock and for that that s where we re going to deploy our resources for the foreseeable future not on external m a brian ossenbeck jp morgan analyst ok thanks for the color appreciate it brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator ladies and gentlemen our final question this morning comes from the line of todd fowler with keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst great thanks and good morning hey brad i guess just to help contextualize we see freight move around a lot but with the downsizing of your large customer can you put some context around what happened specifically in the fourth quarter and the fact that this is across a couple of different service lines and maybe outside of the bid season do you have a sense of why they made this decision at the time that they did brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer i can t speak to their reasoning i can t speak to their timing i can t speak to their long term planning in part because i don t fully know what i do know is the customer is king and if the customer wants to move in a different direction whether that s in sourcing or whether that wants to go to a they want to try out another competitor of ours we or they want to give us more business while we prefer the third curtain the first two curtains are their choice and we always respect the customer when they exit us and when they do we ask in a very respectful way and take a high road on it and make sure we leave them with a good taste in their mouth as they re going out the door and that s what we did here and we ll continue to do with them in terms of timing it was an unfortunate timing we had guidance that we put out on december i forget whether it was 11th december 12th without knowing this within a few days our postal injection business was significantly impacted by this customer s actions and then here in the last just literally just last week we had significant news about the rest of it going but the customer has the choice and the customer can control the timing that s suitable for them and we respect that todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst yes no i understand and i was just trying to get some context if there was service issues or change in supply chain or something like that because again when we see freight move around it s just something i guess unique that i haven t experienced where it s across a couple of different service lines at this time so that s helpful look i know we re up against the hour the question i did want to ask though is with the ebitda guidance it still looks likes that you re looking for let s call it roughly 90 to maybe 160 million of incremental ebitda into 2019 maybe just to close if you could give us some idea of the buckets where you d expect to see that ebitda improvement i think previously you talked about ltl showing 100 million of improvement over a couple of years can you give us some of the buckets where you re expecting to grow ebitda into 19 given some of the headwinds that you re facing brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer the biggest growth driver in ebitda and revenues is going to be on the logistics segment we ve got headwinds on the transportation because that s the bulk of where this business is going away and the biggest headwind is going to be in north america where most almost all of it went away as well so that s where you re going to see the biggest growth for the full year but we re going to see a lot of growth in the second half of the year as we rebound from redeploying those resources look we re resilient we re strong we re very well positioned in the business we have excellent employees morale is very very high we have extremely high levels of customer satisfaction fantastic technology we are very well positioned for the future we have a headwind a significant headwind that we ll work ourselves through over the next couple of quarters and that s our sip todd fowler keybanc capital markets analyst ok good thanks for taking everybody s questions and the candor today appreciate it brad jacobs chairman and chief executive officer thank you very much todd ok thanks everyone for your questions we re fully available over the next few days and at the upcoming conferences to meet with any and all of you and to answer any and all of your questions have a great

the role of the central bank is quite significant in regulating the banks and financial institutions in a country it s closely linked with the performance of the economy and of all sectors like trade commerce industry exports imports and most importantly ensuring the financial stability in an economy central banks everywhere have a very difficult situation in its struggle to stay away from the influence of politics and politicians the independence of a central bank is directly related to its efficacy in ensuring independence in the affiliated banks and financial institutions under its control the matter boils down to governance issues the modern notion of independence of the central bank evolved overtime following the great depression of 1929 1939 the us and other developed countries gave the central bank the power to set the objectives goals targets and instruments of monetary policy in the wake of inflation in 1960s and 1970s many central banks were successful in keeping their policies out of political influence but in the us the then chief of staff of president regan advised mr paul volcker the chairman of federal reserve bank of usa not to raise policy rates ahead of 1984 election mr volcker left the meeting without a word but his policy ultimately resulted in lower inflation and steady economic growth as a result independence of central bank has been emphasised upon by economists and bankers the independence of the central bank is viewed from two major aspects one is goal independence and the second is the instrument independence in all these features of independence the central bank enjoys fairly greater amount of autonomy in comparison to the other regulatory bodies of the government the major goals maintenance of price level inflation and growth are usually taken as the primary ones however the growth rate and inflation rate are often determined by the broad policy consultation of the government in achieving accelerated growth and financial stability federal reserve bank of usa fed probably enjoys maximum independence and autonomy the bank of england till 1997 was not purely independent because it was largely influenced by the chancellor of the exchequer the european central bank which oversees interest rates for all countries sharing the common euro currency was independent since 1998 but recently us government is putting increasing pressure on fed to reduce interest rate which is a sign of political intervention on fed the bank of japan in 2013 agreed to coordinate policy with the government a step towards reducing the independence of its central bank central bank autonomy is a debatable but crucial issue however to achieve the objectives of the bank such as inflation control and economic stability better financial management etc it is necessary for the central bank to be free from all influences thus the bank should be fully autonomous in all its functional and decisional activities some attributes of interdependence are whether the central bank can refuse credit to the government whether it can meet its expenses without depending on government whether its governor or board of directors can function independently whether its governor is independent in following monetary policy whether it is free to choose its monetary instruments and finally whether it is free to regulate the banking policy and the banks full autonomy of the central bank can be exercised in achieving three types of independence political macroeconomic and financial political independence encompasses objectives like price stability independent board of directors who will be appointed for long terms separate from others accountability of the central bank s action to the parliament and legislature and mechanism for complete dispute resolution macroeconomic independence indicates the formulation of monetary and exchange rate policies without any interference financial independence focuses on transparency of accounts adherence to prudential norms quasi fiscal subsidies such as preferential interest rate exchange rate guarantees restriction of the distribution of non cash profits and linkage of losses and net worth of the banks therefore the autonomy must be both administrative and operational the main purposes of bangladesh bank are monetary policy functions bankers bank banker of the government and regulators as well as supervisor of the commercial banks the bank of england boe which basically deals with monetary policy functions and other functions is regulated by prudential regulation authority pra and financial conduct authority fca two independent bodies under the overall guidance of boe most of the central banks have the dual functions like those of bangladesh bank therefore its tasks are enormous the performance of the economy as a whole and that of the different sectors are closely linked with the performance of the bangladesh bank the vison and mission given below state the functions of bangladesh bank vision to develop continually as a forward looking central bank with competent and committed professionals of high ethical standards conducting monetary management and financial sector supervision to maintain price stability and financial system robustness supporting rapid broad based inclusive economic growth employment generation and poverty eradication in bangladesh mission bangladesh bank is carrying out its functions as the country s central bank as per the following mission statements formulating monetary and credit policies managing currency issue and regulating payment system managing foreign exchange reserves and regulating the foreign exchange market regulating and supervising banks and financial institutions and advising the government on interactions and impacts of fiscal monetary and other economic policies economic policies the vision and mission of bangladesh bank are quite appropriate but putting these into action has faced serious challenges and limitations in the context of bangladesh bank the debates on macro economic issues centred around how bangladesh bank can set up monetary targets without political pressure and how far monetary policy can be implemented without any political and structural limitations the authority of the bangladesh bank over the constituent banks and financial institutions has recently shown some limitations in controlling corruption increasing non performing loans lack of good governance weak management and finally erosion of public faith in banks it seems that bangladesh bank due to both internal within the bank itself and external outside the purview of the bank hurdles is finding it difficult to exert effective control over the banking sector the pressure groups of stakeholders namely bangladesh association of bankers bab an association of bank owners and the association of bankers bangladesh abb an association of ceos mds of banks play vital roles in the regulatory aspects of the banking sector it must be pointed out that a balance must be made between the regulation and independence of a bank this means that banks should neither be overregulated nor should they be left alone to enjoy complete freedom which often results in banking disasters this point has been very aptly articulated by jean tirole the nobel prize winner in economics in a book jointly written with his colleagues it is important to keep in mind what financial regulation is meant to achieve the most important objective is to protect depositors investors the general public and the real economy real goods and services as a whole the second rationale for regulation is to minimise the domino effect of the systematic risks of the financial institutions which destroy the foundation of economic activities resulting in loss of real output lower growth higher unemployment and reduction of human welfare good governance in the banking sector is an important agenda of our country especially in the present context of the crisis in the banking sector a perfect example of lack of both transparency and accountability are sonali and basic bank scams where both the borrowers and the officials colluded in a non transparent manner and siphoned off huge amounts of public money those responsible for such fraud have not yet been subjected to strong administrative and legal actions in fact they got perverse incentives and the honest and dedicated people working in the same bank and elsewhere were marginalised and pushed back into oblivion in bangladesh there is a dual system of control of the banking sector the state owned commercial banks scbs like sonali rupali janata and agrani and specialised banks like basic bank limited bangladesh small industries and commerce bank limited bangladesh krishi bank bkb bangladesh development bank ltd bdbl and some statutory banks like ansar vdp unnyan bank and karmasangsthan bank are controlled by the bank and financial institution division of the ministry of finance on the other hand all private commercial banks foreign banks non bank financial institutions are regulated by the bangladesh bank this duality of control has resulted in uncoordinated often weak policy measures for the government regulated banks bangladesh bank has serious limitations in enforcing prudential and management norms in these banks which have made the whole banking sector weak and vulnerable through domino effect small economies like bangladesh are by no means invulnerable to fallouts from global downturns or negative spill over of policies of large economies and therefore have a strong stake in global stability and economic growth in forums such as the g 20 countries like bangladesh need to argue forcefully for the same priority in stability as in recovery as well as for stability action agenda going beyond addressing the symptoms i e lapses in risk management inadequacies of regulation and supervision to addressing underlying causes i e lax policies non compliance of prudential and management norms poor financial reporting unbridled liquidity expansion that incubates bubbles financial crisis of 2007 08 is due to massive regulatory failure a breakdown that goes all the way from regulatory fundamentals to implementation of prudential and management norms to have an independent and effective bangladesh bank three major steps are necessary a a strong and independent central bank with more focus on core banking issues b a well thought out set of prudential and management norms of the central bank that are not subject to frequent changes due to external political administrative pressure and c a system of prompt corrective actions for management of crises and for legal administrative actions against persons responsible for crises in a particular bank or in the banking system as a whole in a real world situation extraordinary independence and full autonomy to the central bank may not be easily achieved therefore central banks like bangladesh bank can minimise political and other external pressure by constantly engaging with them and gaining public support for actions which may make bangladesh bank autonomous and effective whether in good or bad times supervisors always face pressure from lobbyists and from politicians that can undermine the stability of the financial system for bangladesh bank to be successful in regulating the financial sector it has to have very relevant and pragmatic policies prudential management rules and ensure that these are fully followed by all banks and financial institutions discretionary powers or ad hoc measures have to be avoided in order to safeguard the independence and autonomy of bangladesh bank the typical case of policy versus discretion has to be resolved with strong stance of bangladesh bank where policies and rules will be supreme not the discretionary powers of any individual and agency time has come for bangladesh bank to strike a balance showing appropriate professional stance while avoiding the danger of politically motivated reforms in a highly technical domain dr salehuddin ahmed is former governor bangladesh bank and currently professor brac university

plutocratic insurgency note 11 low paid part time gig economy as a new involuntary labor model pamela ligouri bunker and robert j bunker a modern miracle related to the effects of the globalized economy upon the united states and the united kingdom is the fact that we are now witnessing the lowest levels of unemployment seen in almost a generation in the u s since 2001 and two generations in the uk since 1971 on the surface while such low levels of unemployment may appear to represent the triumph of unfettered capitalism and the belief in the benefits of a globalized and supranational liberal economic order something far more ominous for the western middle classes is taking place full time jobs with benefits and secure retirement packages are increasingly being replaced with low paid and part time gig economy positions as a new involuntary labor model this labor model not only benefits predatory i e hyper efficient extractive capitalism but may also be considered a component of the larger transition to human worker replacement by robotic automation and artificial intelligence ai systems and the continued hollowing out of the western welfare state by the plutocratic class key information jim edwards unemployment is low only because involuntary part time work is high business insider 27 january 2019 unemployment is at record lows in both the uk and the us but involuntary part time work is at least 40 higher in both countries than it was 10 years ago the structure of the labour market has fundamentally changed and what we used to think of as unemployment has been replaced by mass part time work much of it unwanted gig economy jobs are to blame according to rob valletta of the san francisco fed britain just notched up yet another record breaking low for unemployment according to the government unemployment stayed at just 4 while the number of people with jobs rose to 32 54 million or 75 8 the highest since comparable estimates began in 1971 according to the uk s office for national statistics but once again the monthly jobs tally eclipsed how that miracle was achieved headline unemployment is only at a record low because of a 42 increase in the number of people who are in involuntary part time work since 2006 the number of people in involuntary part time work has risen from 620 000 to 881 000 today an increase of 42 ons involuntary means they re only working part time because they cannot get a full time job here is the situation in america involuntary part time work is probably 40 higher than normal in the us during early 2018 involuntary part time work was running nearly a percentage point higher than its level the last time the unemployment rate was 4 1 in august 2000 according to rob valletta a vice president in the economic research department of the federal reserve bank of san francisco this represents about 1 4 million additional individuals who are stuck in part time jobs these numbers imply that the level of ipt work is about 40 higher than would normally be expected at this point in the economic expansion mass unemployment the historic kind with dole queues unemployment benefits and idle workers on street corners has been replaced by low paid part time gig economy or zero hours contract work key information macy bayern how the gig economy will change in 2019 techrepublic 12 december 2018 the gig economy is type of employment made up of independent workers who typically engage in short term job positions freelancers uber drivers airbnb hosts and more make up this new wave of employment one in which employees are free to make their own schedules be their own bosses and work where they want more than one third 36 of us workers are a part of the gig economy totaling to about 57 million people according to forbes while the gig economy used to be a way to make ends meet in between traditional jobs workers are starting to morph the gig economy into full time professions people realize that the dynamics when it comes to the workforce are changing in the next 10 years 25 of the jobs will not exist anymore said marcos jacober ceo of life hacks wealth at first people saw that as an opportunity to make a side gig but it actually came and replaced the old part time job people realized that this is actually kind of cool not to have a boss i can be managing my own hours i can make extra cash so they migrate to that and it is now the new trend for 2019 this is a very lucrative business this way of work is especially popular with younger crowds said matthew guarini research director serving cio professionals at forrester nearly half 46 of generation z workers are freelancers a number that is only expected to grow as nearly 61 million gen zers come into the workforce in the next couple years however the gig economy has the potential to change even more as more people adopt the gig mindset said jacober and more companies are going to start catering to gig employees added guarini here are the three biggest shifts the gig economy will see in 2019 1 more companies will jump on the gig economy bandwagon 2 positions will target selective problems 3 a change in mentality key information nicole torres are there good jobs in the gig economy harvard business review july august 2018 issue there s no denying the growth of the gig economy economists estimate that the portion of u s workers earning a living as independent contractors freelancers temps and on call employees jumped from 10 in 2005 to nearly 16 in 2015 and the trend shows little sign of slowing advocates of these alternative work arrangements many of which are enabled by sharing or on demand apps such as uber and taskrabbit bill them as a way to trade unemployment burnout or hating one s job for freedom flexibility and financial gains skeptics meanwhile point to the costly trade offs unstable earnings few or no benefits reduced job security and stalled career advancement but what do the gig workers themselves say gigged a new book by sarah kessler an editor at quartz focuses on their perspective in profiling a variety of people in contingent jobs from a 28 year old waiter and uber driver in kansas city to a 24 year old programmer who quit his new york office job to join gigster to a 30 something mother in canada who is earning money through mechanical turk kessler illuminates a great divide for people with desirable skills the gig economy often permits a more engaging entrepreneurial lifestyle but for the unskilled who turn to such work out of necessity it s merely the best of bad options financial insecurity is a big and ever present concern so is the lack of human connection when you re managed by an algorithm that sends notifications to your phone it becomes harder to build relationships with bosses or even fellow employees relationships that can help you advocate for better working conditions kessler writes i don t think silicon valley was wrong to attempt to restructure the job our current model wasn t working and the startup spirit of experimentation was necessary but attempting to tackle the problems of the job without fixing the support structures around it can t quite count as progress and it certainly doesn t look like innovation that tension is also a central theme of temp a forthcoming book that explains our new world of work author louis hyman a cornell professor and economic historian notes that in america traditional organizations began moving away from offers of full time employment and toward more flexible short term staffing jobs as a result of both new management ideas such as the lean revolution and changing values such as prioritizing short term profits this restructuring of the workforce was facilitated he emphasizes by management consultants who believed that the long hours the tensions the uncertainty were all a perfectly reasonable way to work and by temp agencies which created pools of standby on demand labor by the 1980s temps were providing not emergency help but cyclical replacement hyman s stats are striking by 1988 about nine tenths of businesses were using temp labor since 1991 every economic downturn has meant a permanent loss of jobs by 1995 85 of companies were outsourcing all or part of at least one business function and hyman notes most of the affected employees fall on the wrong side of the divide kessler describes they became temps and gig workers owing to events beyond their control such as elimination of full time positions with their secure paychecks and perks although hyman does seem to hold out hope for this new era of employment the gig economy might have the best of both worlds the autonomy and independence of an economy before wage labor but with individuals possessed of the productive capacity of an industrial economy he also argues that the only sustainable path forward is to somehow reconnect temp workers to the support they once got from full time jobs that could come through either portable benefits which he thinks are feasible or a universal benefits system which he thinks is not americans need life security he writes not job security another new book offers a similar message but begins in a very different place in bullshit jobs david graeber a professor of anthropology at the london school of economics lambastes today s corporations for engaging in ruthless downsizing layoffs and speed ups which invariably fall on that class of people who are actually making moving fixing and maintaining things even worse as the doers among us are pushed into tenuous low paid benefit less gig work somehow the number of salaried paper pushers ultimately seems to expand key information abha bhattarai now hiring for a one day job the gig economy hits retail the washington post 4 may 2018 the gig economy is clocking in to retailers and restaurants the unemployment rate is at a 17 year low but stagnant wages chronic underemployment and growing inequality are leading more americans to take on so called side hustles some want to supplement their incomes others are just trying to eke out a living nearly 1 in 4 americans now earn money from the digital platform economy according to the pew research center most of that work is for domestic tasks such as housecleaning and repairs or driving for companies such as uber by moving into shops and cafes on demand work stands to reshape a broader slice of the u s economy there are implications for low wage workers too as a new class of employers fills its labor pool with on call temp workers retail and hospitality which accounts for 20 percent of u s positions according to the bureau of labor statistics is the on ramp for many employees to better jobs but the sector is also pinched by rising minimum wages and health care costs and employers are seeking more flexible work arrangements that respond to the ebbs and flows of their businesses but labor experts say companies such as snag work could set a dangerous precedent employers are already wary of hiring full time employees because of overtime and health care costs they say and having a pool of potential gig workers at the ready could make matters worse for those seeking the stability benefits and protections that come with full time work we re seeing only one trend here which is that the gig economy is big and getting bigger said diane mulcahy a lecturer at babson college and author of the gig economy companies will do just about anything to avoid hiring full time employees add to that the fact that there is no job security anymore and workers are increasingly aware that they need to work differently if they want to create any sort of stability for themselves snag work and other new platforms are the go betweens allowing users

cola mcdonald s and papa john s pizza among its clients other start ups include allwork and coople key information patrick gillespie america s part time worker problem is permanent san francisco fed says cnn 11 april 2018 the us job market is one of the bright spots in the global economy america has millions of new jobs falling unemployment and even some nascent signs of growing paychecks one problem persists a historically high number of americans have part time jobs but want full time positions economists long argued that the trend known as involuntary part time was temporary but it now appears to be a permanent problem according to a blog post published wednesday by the san francisco federal reserve in the absence of public policies aimed directly at altering work schedules it looks like higher rates of involuntary part time work are here to stay san francisco fed economist rob valletta wrote related us job growth slowed in march with the current unemployment rate of 4 1 the number of involuntary part timers should be much lower but it s 40 higher now than it was when unemployment was last that low in 2000 that group does not include people who work part time because they want to nearly nine years after the great recession ended there are still more involuntary part time workers than there were before the crisis began according to the labor department some experts outside the fed call it hidden unemployment because the extra hours workers want go unpaid workers describe the jobs as dead ends with high demands from employers and low pay a surge of job growth in recent years at restaurants bars retail stores and freelance gigs has pushed more americans into part time work according to valletta there were 5 million involuntary part timers in march in 2006 despite a higher unemployment rate than today there were a million fewer part timers who labor human workers in the united states and the united kingdom unable to get full time employment positions with benefits that allow for upward economic mobility what the replacement of full time workers enjoying higher wages medical and retirement benefits and job security with part time temporary or gig workers who are lower paid have no benefits and have no job security this can be considered a new involuntary labor model which has turned american and united kingdom workers into disposable commodities that can be utilized as needed and then abandoned when an upward trend since the 1980s with temporary workers shifting from emergency labor to cyclical labor to a permanent condition with the elimination of more and more full time positions over the course of the last thirty five years this trend has steadily increased over the last decade where principally seen within the united states and the united kingdom but this new labor model is spreading to other post industrial western states why by eliminating full time positions corporations do not have to pay higher salaried wages and benefits and can hire and fire employees at will which gives them fast market reaction versatility allowing for business costs to be lowered profits to be increased and new opportunities to be maximized while the use of temporary workers is also said to allow corporations to better utilize high maintenance generation zers who have been socialized to work as freelancers but this socialization process was originally a result of corporate practices themselves as a component of their own just in time efficiency methods just as only enough inventory is kept on hand by corporations to aggressively minimize costs so too does at will contract labor human workers analysis the part time work force in america is said to have reached over one third of us workers according to an august 2018 forbes article more than one third 36 percent of u s workers are in the gig economy which works out to a very large number of approximately 57 million people this part time employment trending in the uk is not so nearly as advanced but has seen a 42 increase to 881 000 workers from march 2006 enough to change the uk unemployment levels from 4 to 7 if underemployment levels are figured into this statistic us underemployment levels are striking the younger generation z workers the hardest with nearly half of them 46 working in the gig economy such involuntary part time employment has become recognized as a permanent problem rather than a temporary one per a federal reserve bank of san francisco post in april 2018 part time gig contract workers provide corporations and their well heeled plutocratic shareholders with numerous economic advantages over full time benefit workers from a predatory capitalist perspective such throw away labor is ultimately utilized to maximize the profit line of corporations in the united states and increasingly the united kingdom within the larger and hyper competitive globalized economy rather than being a stand alone trending data point it should be considered to exist within the larger context of evolving western economic phases and labor models see table 1 italics speculative futures two contemporary economic and labor phases can be said to have existed for the us and the uk since post world war ii with an emergent phase now in the offing the initial phase beginning in roughly 1945 and extending into the 1970s can generally be considered the heyday of the modern industrial welfare state full time employment of blue and increasingly white collar workers with health and retirement benefits represented the archetype supported by strong labor unions economic elites were kept in check by high levels of taxation for societal redistribution purposes a lesson learned from the extreme measure of political influence and economic excesses which took place during the earlier gilded age and well into the late 1920s which contributed to a global depression this labor model existed within the context of the prevailing form of state moderated capitalism that was in play which resulted in the rise of a robust middle class in the us and the uk strong democratic representation was the order of the day with the tories and labour in the uk and republicans and democrats in the us not always ideologically agreeing on policies but able to mutually enact centrist legislation that keep the majority of their citizenry relatively franchised the dominant insurgency form of this era was politically based and maoist in its revolutionary tradition the second contemporary economic and labor phase that of industrial deconstruction and informational transition roughly spans the 1980s through the 2010s the recent here and now this phase has witnessed the rise of the part time no benefits or job security worker employment model along with this deconstruction process which saw the emergence of rust belts and communities within these states came the decline in the strength and political influence of labor unions this shifting labor model has taken place within the greater context of the ongoing compression of the middle class structure in both america and the united kingdom with the loss of living wage blue and white collar jobs the accelerating forces of globalization have also resulted in a winner take all form of predatory capitalism emerging in the west and in fact globally that has increasingly polarized wealth between the economic haves and have nots with the loss of the socio economic middle class buffer political fragmentation of the dominant party structures in both the us and the uk has taken place one component of this fragmentation has been the election of the populist trump administration in the us that is the antithesis of many republication party values a party that merely served as an expedient political vessel for its ascendancy during this era the dominant types of insurgency have shifted away from the political e g maoist revolutionary to religious e g spiritual primarily radical islamist and commercial criminal and plutocratic variant forms the emergent economic and labor phase of the 2020s and beyond is still relatively opaque however one component of it is already clear robotics and ai systems are increasingly being utilized in economic production with the projection that more and more human jobs will be replaced by these advanced technologies and manufacturing processes this will result in the loss of full time jobs as a cost saving measure by corporations seeking to squeeze out more profits in all likelihood part time employment levels will further increase as a result only serving to further cull the middle class in america and the united kingdom what is more speculative are the attributes of this emergent phase from a status quo perspective the pre existing ones will initially extend along their present trajectories however they will then begin to deviate as new governmental and non state actor policies and economic and social class structures begin to form for instance increasing wealth polarization in the western states along with high levels of public and private mass citizenry debt is unsustainable and will either result in the creation of new top down national governmental policies and or bottom up street level societal protest and unrest in response some sort of 3rd party political realignment in the us may also be expected with independent voters representing a void party now becoming the largest political bloc additionally concern exists that an authoritarian insurgent form representative of a fusion of plutocratic and criminal insurgency components will develop with china and potentially russia utilizing it to further undermine the western liberal democracies and their allies in retrospect the increasing permanent use of part time employees in the us and uk to the detriment of full time employee positions should on its own be cause for consternation however when considered within the larger context of broader economic and class structure changes taking place in the west these changes portend the increasing compression of the middle class and the ascendancy of plutocratic interests within western states as they further transition from industrial to post industrial informational based economic production the burning question now is whether the middle class citizenry of the us and the uk go quietly into the night or if they will begin to flex what electoral influence they still retain in order to enact more fair and equitable national wealth redistributive policies vis à vis the growing power and influence of the plutocratic class sources macy bayern how the gig economy will change in 2019 techrepublic 12 december 2018 abha bhattarai now

with the fall of robert mugabe from power people had every right to expect better things in zimbabwe or at least for the situation not to get worse but it seems the country is once again on a downward spiral as strikes and shortages cause unending misery for the population report by baffour ankomah if any country on this earth needs a break from economic suffering it is zimbabwe but there is no hope on the horizon at least not from the set of circumstances now engulfing the country since 2001 when robin cook the then british foreign secretary arrogantly told president robert mugabe s then foreign minister stan mudenge that if zimbabwe did not get rid of mugabe what would hit the country would make the citizens stone mugabe and his ministers in the streets it has been one long economic nightmare induced partly by foreign sanctions and partly by unenforced self destruction by the elite in power mugabe s loss of power on 15 november 2017 was partly political and partly economic his government appeared to have no solution to the economic problems preceding his ouster especially the shortage some say disappearance of cash in the banks forcing people to queue for hours inside and outside the banks to get as little as 50 per week by the time the political issues led to his overthrow in the coup that was not a coup mugabe s long suffering citizens had had enough of him and the economic problems hence the outpouring of joy in the streets the world saw robin cook s ghost must have allowed himself a knowing smile wherever he is enter president emmerson dambudzo mnangagwa popularly called ed after his initials having worked closely with mugabe for 54 years before the coup ed was not exactly a new man on the block but he had massive goodwill from the public when he succeeded mugabe on 24 november 2017 maybe this was because zimbabweans are a fickle people prone to shifting allegiances as the chameleon changes its colours for example in the immediate aftermath of the military intervention that led to mugabe s ouster soldiers could do no wrong in zimbabwean eyes military boots were in fact polished in the streets by adoring citizens to show their appreciation for the military heroes for leading the intervention the head of the armed forces general constantine chiwenga was cheered everywhere he went but just two months on when it appeared the military had become too dominant in the post mugabe government the public swiftly turned against the soldiers the animosity against the military and particularly gen chiwenga who became vice president under ed has grown to a point where he is now blamed sometimes comically for almost everything that goes wrong under ed s government now the economy has gone so pear shaped under ed s watch that people are calling for the return of mugabe the fickleness of politics they say mugabe was decisive and did not let business and retail houses abuse the public by increasing prices when they wanted price controls were very much an integral part of mugabe s arsenal ed who served in various positions under mugabe before and after independence has taken a different tact he would not touch price controls even with a barge pole but that is what is causing him the current economic headaches readers of new african are now aware of the misfiring of ed s finance minister prof mthuli ncube when ncube s faux pas caused a severe economic upheaval in early october 2018 that led to three weeks of sharp price increases and panic buying the public expected ed to intervene decisively against the mayhem but he did not his aides explained that he did not want to be seen as following mugabe s price control footsteps but the law of economics is clear that allowing retailers to increase prices by between 300 and 700 some in fact went as high as 1 000 ed was setting his government up for the high jump it meant that workers across the board would ask for high pay increases to match the price hikes and neither ed s cash strapped government nor the private sector would be able to meet the wage demands which means a season of labour unrest and with it general discontent and instability strikes and shortages it was a national security issue that the government strangely toyed with and as sure as day follows night trouble started when the country s junior doctors went on strike on 1 december asking not only for more pay but also to be paid partly in us dollars as many businesses including pharmacies and private hospitals and clinics were now accepting payment fees in us dollars the strike went on for 40 days until the government finally succeeded in appeasing the doctors but just as the doctors union was telling them to go back to work the country s teachers took up the chant by refusing to teach when schools reopened after the christmas holidays claiming that they had been incapacitated because they could not afford the new transport fares provoked by a three month long fuel shortage in the country and also the steep prices in the shops the season of discontent was well and kicking across the public sector the government had to move quickly to avoid a full scale public sector strike by bringing the civil service unions to the negotiating table to discuss new wage levels the negotiations were still on at the time of writing in the meantime the three month fuel shortage that started in early october was making matters worse as motorists now spend days in winding queues at petrol stations trying to fill up and that is not the only woe in harare the capital water is now being rationed because the only water source built by the colonialists in the 1950s cannot meet the demands of an increased city population and also the low maintenance culture has exacerbated the problem thus with living conditions eroded by high retail price increases leading to a sharp rise in inflation in early october inflation stood at 5 it jumped to 30 01 in november and topped 42 in december mixed with fuel shortages strikes and threats of strikes the country was swimming in a brew of high discontent in the midst of all this the president decided to increase the fuel price by 150 and announce it himself in a televised address at near midnight on the eve of his five nation tour of europe starting from russia belarus azerbaijan kazakhstan and switzerland where he attended the world economic forum in davos the increase was the second in less than two months statistics showed that zimbabwe s fuel price was the lowest in the southern african region but the president changed all that making it the highest in the whole wide world from 1 25 a litre diesel and 1 32 a litre petrol the president shot the price up to 3 11 a litre diesel and 3 31 a litre petrol and to leave nobody in doubt about what type of dollar he was talking about the president added for good measure these prices are predicated on the ruling official exchange rate of 1 1 between the bond note and the united states dollar and also on the need to keep fuel retailers viable in effect one litre of petrol in zimbabwe now sells at us 3 31 beating the then highest in the world hong kong just over us 2 00 a litre to second place monaco rich as it is comes third shy of us 2 00 a litre but according to ed zimbabwe s sharp increase was necessary because there had been a persistent shortfall in the fuel market attributable to the increased fuel usage in the economy compounded by rampant illegal currency and fuel trading activities essentially therefore the record high price is to control the population s consumption of fuel and also to curb the illegal fuel trading activities inevitable turmoil next the president announced a contradiction that he and his advisors had not foreseen foreign missions and registered foreign bodies in zimbabwe as well as tourists could fuel at designated points at us 1 24 per litre for diesel and us 1 32 per litre for petrol and that would be only in us dollars here either the president was saying the bond note and the us dollar were no longer 1 1 as his government insists or he was giving foreign missions and tourists a whopping rebate because they were not zimbabweans in fact rebate was mentioned a lot by the president in his televised address cognisant of the need to prevent generalised price increases for goods and services in the country with the attendant hardships that will entail especially the commuting workforce government has decided to grant a rebate to all registered business entities in manufacturing mining commerce agriculture and transport sectors ed said he went on government is putting in place measures to cushion its workers until a full review of the cost of living adjustment package due in april 2019 is affected in the context of the current budget the president added the cushion allowance for civil servants a one off payment will range from 22 5 to the lowest paid to 5 to the highest paid the rest of the population who are not government workers can look after themselves with such a policy nobody was surprised to see outrage in the streets when the zimbabwe congress of trade unions the country s main labour alliance called for three days of stay away in protest of the new fuel price and the high cost of living the response was eclectic unfortunately some criminal elements took advantage of the protests to cause violence forcing the government to shut down the internet and the social media for two days to control communication among the protestors brezh malaba a zimbabwean who tweeted just after the president finished his televised address spoke for many when he said zimbabwe s fuel price was pathetically low we all know that but the president cannot realistically expect the petrol price to jump from 1 32 to 3 31 without having a domino effect on prices of all other goods and services brace for inevitable turmoil and immense pain na
w hen the berlin wall fell in november 1989 many consigned socialism to the rubble the end of the cold war and the collapse of the soviet union were interpreted as the triumph not just of liberal democracy but of the robust market driven capitalism championed by ronald reagan in america and margaret thatcher in britain the west s left embraced this belief with leaders like tony blair bill clinton and gerhard schröder promoting a third way they praised the efficiency of markets pulling them further into the provision of public services and set about wisely shepherding and redistributing the market s gains men such as jeremy corbyn a hard left north london mp as far from mr blair in outlook as it was possible to be and bernie sanders a left wing mayor in vermont who became an independent congressman in 1990 seemed as thoroughly on the wrong side of history as it was possible to be listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not

economic growth she entered adulthood at the beginning of the global financial crisis she is now the youngest woman ever to serve in congress the subject of enthusiasm on the left and fascinated fear on the right and like mr corbyn and mr sanders she explicitly identifies herself as a socialist their democratic socialism goes considerably further than the market friendly redistributionism of the third way it envisages a level of state intervention in previously private industry either directly or through forced co operativisation that has few antecedents in modern democracies for the american generation which has grown up since the downfall of the ussr socialism is no longer the boo word it once was on the left a lot of americans are more sceptical than they used to be about capitalism see chart 1 indeed what might be called millennial socialism is having something of a cultural moment publications like jacobin and tribune bedeck the coffee tables of the hip young and socially conscious no film has ever made trade unions look cooler than last year s sorry to bother you written and directed by boots riley a rapper and activist when piers morgan a british television presenter found it impossible to believe that a young interviewee might come from a left beyond barack obama her response quickly turned up on t shirts i m literally a communist you idiot the fight you choose this currency aside avowed socialists are still a rarity in america s political class but when ms ocasio cortez or mr sanders speak of the need for radical change the disappointments and damage experienced in the past 30 years give their words resonance across a broad swathe of the less radical but still disenchanted left these people saw their third way leaders support misguided foreign wars and their supposedly robust economy end up in a financial crisis they feel economic growth has mainly benefited the rich see chart 2 and that ideologically driven spending cuts have been aimed at the poor they are angered by a global elite they see flitting from business to politics and back again unaccountable to anyone as economic inequality yawns ever wider though the picture is more complex than that see chart 3 the presence of donald trump in the white house underlines their discontent as does indelibly the unchecked rise of greenhouse gas emissions alongside global gdp endangering in many young eyes their very future in response to this mood on the left some parties which once embraced the third way have tacked decisively towards policies that seemed inconceivable ten years ago see for example the embrace of medicare for all by america s democratic presidential hopefuls other parties are dwindling into insignificance overshadowed by more radical alternatives jean luc mélenchon a far left candidate who championed a 100 marginal income tax rate on high earners in the french presidential election of 2017 comfortably outpolled the country s mainstream socialists indeed in the first round he got a vote 80 that of emmanuel macron s this swing within the left is not necessarily a new path to power indeed many caught up in it fear quite the reverse having achieved a better result than many expected in the election of 2017 labour still sits behind britain s chaotic conservatives in opinion polls though some far left parties may do well in the forthcoming elections for the european parliament they are unlikely to make up for the loss of support suffered by the centre left primary voters may be enthusiastic about the cornucopian environmentalism of ms ocasio cortez s green new deal but many senior democrats fear that it will scare away more voters than it entices many on the right agree with relish when president trump asserted in his state of the union address on february 5th that america will never be a socialist country it was not because he fears a socialist ascendancy it was because he thinks that the majority of americans including many democrats will look askance at such a prospect america was founded on liberty and independence and not government coercion domination and control mr trump told congress we are born free and we will stay free socialism versus capitalism is still an easy call for most americans socialism versus freedom is about as done as a deal gets millennial socialists though have their own ideas about freedom they are not satisfied with the protection of existing freedoms instead they want to expand and fulfil freedoms yet to be obtained spreading economic power more widely they say will allow more people to make choices about what they want in their lives and freedom without such capabilities is at best incomplete bhaskar sunkara founding editor of jacobin makes an analogy to india what is the point of an ostensibly free press if a huge share of the population is unable to read seizing power much of what the centrist left believed in the 1990s and 2000s has since been abandoned not just by vanguardist millennial socialists but by a broad swathe of left wing opinion the median supporter of left wing parties is increasingly sceptical about free trade averse to foreign wars and distrustful of public private partnerships what they still like is the income redistribution that came with those policies they want higher minimum wages and a lot more spending on public services mr sanders and ms ocasio cortez have energised young americans by promising free college tuition labour promises the same in england and wales many entirely non socialist europeans will see nothing that remarkable about publicly paid for health care and education america starts from an unusual position in such matters but almost any country would be staggered by a government initiative as all encompassing as the green new deal resolution that ms ocasio cortez and ed markey a senator from massachusetts have introduced into congress as well as promising emissions reduction efforts on a scale beyond hercules at a cost beyond croesus in framing global warming as a matter of justice rather than economic externalities it promises all sorts of ancillary goodies including robust economic growth which some hard line greens will have a problem with and guaranteed employment it abandons the economically efficient policies that have been the stamp of america s previous failed attempts to bring climate action about through legislation most notably those in the cap and trade bill mr markey sponsored in the late 2000s this is hardly surprising the most popular text on global warming in left wing circles naomi klein s this changes everything capitalism vs the climate derides such market based mechanisms millennial socialists want to do more than boost the incomes of the poor create better public services and slash emissions keynesianism is not enough in the words of james meadway an adviser to john mcdonnell mr corbyn s shadow chancellor it is also necessary to democratise the economy by redistributing wealth as well as income in part this is an economic argument having a wage but no wealth increasingly means settling for a lower standard of living in recent decades and in rich countries the share of total income accruing to owners of capital in the form of profits rent and interest has risen while the share paid to labour in the form of salaries and benefits has dropped this means the incomes of people with lots of capital will diverge from those who have none if the predictions made by thomas piketty a french economist noted for his studies of wealth inequality prove correct something that many economists doubt the total amount of capital in the economy will continue to rise relative to gdp further compounding the advantage of wealth holders but the argument for redistribution of wealth goes beyond economics and its roots spread far beyond the socialist canon james harrington a political theorist of the 17th century wrote that where there is inequality of estates there must be inequality of power he saw a reasonably even distribution of wealth and the freedom of democratic politics as two sides of the same coin his ideas were a strong influence on america s founding fathers john adams wrote that harrington has shewn that power always follows property though thomas jefferson plumped for life liberty and the pursuit of happiness as the rights to be mentioned in the declaration of independence he was inspired by john locke s trinity of life liberty and property and his love of the yeoman farmer stemmed from his belief that those who produced their own food never needed to bend to the will of another and thus were truly free well before karl marx started to write about alienation the idea that people treated only as factors of production would not only lack true freedom but also other opportunities to reach their full potential was a mainstay of enlightenment thought adam smith worried that the factory system where workers simply turned up and followed the instructions of capitalists would make its participants as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become john stuart mill who valued political freedom above all else also predicted that under capitalism people would become passive dull wage slaves he wanted to see many more working in co operatives the echoes of harrington smith and mill are clear in the works that articulate the views of today s left from mark fisher s capitalist realism to david graeber s bullshit jobs globalisation in their eyes is less an engine for prosperity and more a generator of insecurity unfreedom and unfairness share taking democracies on this reading today s task is to redistribute the economy s stock of wealth and thus political power freedom self worth and prosperity how best to do this is hotly debated some are keen on a centralised path matt bruenig of the people s policy project a crowd funded think tank touts social wealth funds through which the state could accumulate stakes in equity bond and property markets subsequently disbursing a share of the resulting income as a universal basic dividend norway and alaska already have something akin to this though funded by oil wealth others are sceptical of such measures a policy paper commissioned for the labour party argues that such state planning risks creating a small private and corporate elite resulting in little democratic scrutiny or debate receiving a monthly cheque from the state social wealth fund would be nice but would ordinary people feel empowered that concern is one reason why the left generally well disposed to welfare spending is divided on the question of universal basic income despite or perhaps because of the support such schemes also have from some on the right mr graeber and andy stern an american trade unionist are among those who have expressed support for the idea others worry that under such schemes we gain free time but we lose the historical agency we have as workers we are seen as passive alienated taking as given a world shaped by others as john marlow an economist argues in a recent edition of new socialist a journal a possibility for the centralised redistribution of wealth more compatible with the dignity of labour might be endowing all children with baby bonds a policy gordon brown tried in britain and which cory booker another senator running for president champions in america but many see a stronger case for transfers of wealth at a sub national scale such as through the expansion of worker owned co operatives which at present form a small proportion of firms in america and britain die linke germany s most left wing party has promised to create suitable legal forms to facilitate and promote the joint takeover of enterprises by the employees in the accountable capitalism act offered by elizabeth warren another democratic hopeful though not she insists a socialist workers would elect 40 of the members of corporate boards that is not the same as seizing a chunk of the firm s capital but senator warren has other plans for redistributing wealth she has proposed an annual tax of 2 on the wealth of americans with a net worth of more than 50m 3 on those worth more than 1bn perhaps the most radical detailed plans for the democratisation of an economy put forward by a mainstream party are labour s it says that it will double the size of the co operative sector if elected and that private firms of over 250 employees will have to transfer 10 of their shares to a fund managed by workers representatives staff would be entitled to dividends from the shares the representatives would have a say in how the company was run modern times as far as public services are concerned shareholders of england s water utilities would be bought out and regional water authorities created in their place to be run by councillors worker representatives and representatives of community consumer and environmental interests similar steps would encourage local energy provision proponents of such reforms speak glowingly of paris s municipal government which a decade ago brought its water companies in house and has created a mechanism for enabling local people to hold the new operation to account buying up chunks of the economy at the same time as greatly increasing public services would be a costly undertaking some on the socialist left try to wave this aside by invoking modern monetary theory mmt which holds that the primary constraint on government spending is not how much money can be raised through tax or bonds but how much of an economy s capital and labour the state can use without sparking rapid inflation adherents of mmt note the lack of inflation seen since the financial crisis despite big deficits and governments printing money to buy bonds through quantitative easing many on the left have come to see the concerns that the right raises about deficits which tend to surface only when it is not in power less as economic prudence than a partisan politics of impoverishment scholars such as stephanie kelton of stony brook university who has the ear of various left wing democrats suggest the very notion that spending must at some point be paid for by tax should be scrapped only when government spending pushes an economy beyond its capacity to produce goods and services should it be cooled using spending cuts and tax increases let the billionaires bleed resistance to millennial socialism comes in various forms critics may believe that the socialist goals are bad ones that as a matter of fact their policy ideas will not achieve those goals that even if the policies were to work they would be too illiberal to stomach or that whether they work or not they will cost the critic money it is possible to hold all four of these positions at once in various degrees take mmt most economists strongly resist the idea that governments can spend so freely and such disagreement can easily be found on the left as well as the right they also doubt that governments would in fact be able to cut spending or raise taxes when called on to do so by the tenets of the theory and if a government were to do so its actions could be quite regressive jonathan portes of king s college london points out that under mmt a country facing a combination of weak growth and high inflation as britain did in 2011 12 would require spending cuts rather than the increased stimulus called for by keynes the labour party which was at that time decrying government austerity has none of the sympathy for mmt seen in some of its fellow travellers across the atlantic mmt is just plain old bad economics unfortunately says mr meadway the non mmt answer to how to pay for it all is usually to soak the rich this is not always as popular a policy as some imagine but today it does look like quite an easy sell in america unfortunately it yields less money than many on the left suppose the best estimates of the extra revenues labour might raise through the tax increases it plans for high earners suggest there may be none at all in part because the rich may simply work less the party is ignoring more reliable revenue raisers like taxes on consumption and property yet its policies call for lots more government spending ms ocasio cortez has suggested a marginal tax rate of 70 on incomes above 10m one estimate puts the extra annual revenue at perhaps 12bn or just 0 3 of the tax take the original new deal cost a great deal more than that even if ambitious new steps were taken to stop the rich from hiding their lucre in tax shelters a broader tax base would be required there would be little help from ms warren s wealth tax which would discourage those whose wealth was the business that earned them their income and would be immensely hard to administer mr sanders s policy of increasing the inheritance tax which introduces much less distortion is a better one but it would still be a hard sell for relatively little return higher taxes on the rich can be about more than revenue emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman two economists argue in favour of ms ocasio cortez s tax plan on the grounds that shrinking top incomes is necessary to prevent america from sliding into oligarchy such plans can be read simply as punitive populism billionaires are not very well regarded on the left and thinning their number has an appeal all its own the rich are well aware of this it would be wrong to assume that michael bloomberg a businessman and former mayor who may run for president was motivated by the threat to his considerable personal wealth when he recently suggested that ms warren s wealth tax threatened to make america a new venezuela though taken at face value his hyperbole shows a profound pessimism about the durability of american institutions his broader point is that once you start saying some people are just too rich where do you draw the line however paid for efforts to democratise the economy have their own problems it is possible for companies partly controlled by their workers to raise capital the german principle of co determination which aims to give shareholders and employees an equal say in the decision making within firms has not hit the country s international competitiveness but some investment will surely either be scared off or rationally choose other destinations depending on the circumstances and or your perspective there is also a risk of capture a lot of people may feel they have better things to do of an evening than discuss metering policy down the water company trade union officials and government lackeys may feel differently experience suggests that firms run by people close to the state may come under pressure to give contracts to political insiders rather than to the best supplier and that they will often give in a worry from the left is that workers on boards might in self interest behave as badly as they think capitalists do even if there were not so many legitimate causes for concern and even setting aside their own interests many liberals and conservatives would still be against policies explicitly aimed at appropriating private wealth for the common good they see the confiscation of private property as an infringement of liberty just as sincerely as some socialists see it as the road to a wider popular freedom that is a powerful argument all the more so if it is offered alongside its own set of more acceptable approaches to empowering those currently without the capacity to exercise all their freedoms the possibility of the green new deal being enacted in all its pomp is nugatory seeing the full range of labour s schemes for worker empowerment established is unlikely and therein lies a paradox facing millennial socialism an unremitting pursuit of radicalism could easily contribute to defeat for the broader left a more incrementalist approach will be too slow to deliver for the impatient young not to mention their elderly leaders unless that is precipitating events as head over heelsy as the fall of the berlin wall intervene judge them then in decades to come when ms ocasio cortez is either forgotten or the grande dame of a washington risen again from the waves of sea level rise through monumental public works
the new trade agreement between the united state mexico and canada has been negotiated but it still needs congressional approval that will have to happen in a polarized political environment amidst an ongoing and bitter conflict over border security this week grant reeher talks with chris wilson deputy director of the mexico institute at the wilson center in washington d c interview highlights reeher i wanted to get a sense of the amount of trade that exists between the united states and mexico i think most of us know that it s a lot but let s just start by trying to quantify it a bit roughly what percentage of the u s gross domestic product is accounted for by trade with mexico and what percentage of the mexican economy is accounted for by trade with the u s wilson i don t have it exactly in gdp terms for the united states it would be a relatively small percentage of gdp very small actually but in terms of our percentage of overall exports we send about 15 percent of all of our exports to mexico mexico s our third largest trading partner behind only canada and china and there s about a half billion dollars of trade a year between the united states and mexico that means that every day there s more than a billion dollars worth of goods moving back and forth across the u s mexico border every minute there s a million dollars of commerce between our two countries we send more exports to mexico than to all of the brick countries combined so if you add up what we export to brazil russia india and china that still doesn t add up to what we export to mexico every year reeher and i imagine that the magnitude relatively speaking is greater for mexico because they have a smaller economy than ours wilson it s totally asymmetric in that sense it s very important for both countries of course but mexico sends 80 percent of its exports to the united states and mexico is a very trade dependent country so when you add up imports and exports and put them over gdp in mexico you get somewhere around two thirds of their economy that represents now that s not exactly a fair way to do it it doesn t actually mean that two thirds of all economic activity in mexico are related to trade but a huge chunk is this is an economy that depends on trade and within that depends very heavily on the u s market reeher i would think that the economic effects of trade between the two countries they spread out into the two countries economies in far reaching ways that may not be readily apparent at first thinking about the supplies that are needed in sectors and industries that produce other things for example so give us a sense of the downstream effects there wilson that s just it the u s mexico relationship is not just big but it s deep and it s rather unique in that sense our relationship with canada is similar but only with neighbors that are so close together do you have such deep supply chain connections and so actually half of u s mexico trade is trading intermediate goods those are the inputs that go to support manufacturing or other production processes on the other side of the border so we have parts and materials that are actually moving back and forth across the border six or seven times in some cases as a product is being made it s really deep supply chain connections that make our countries economic partners much more than economic competitors there is competition of course there s competition to attract investments and for specific aspects of production but on the bigger scale we really are economic partners because we re building things together that get sold on the global market reeher has this trade so far been affected by any of the political controversies over the border wilson very little we saw actually in 2017 trade grew again between the two countries 2018 numbers are incomplete still but looking like they re still a large and growing amount of u s mexico trade the trade deficit really hasn t changed very much which is another one of the things broadened by the political spotlight by the trump administration and the trump campaign it s very business as usual in many ways i d say that the one place where we do see some impact is not in the trade numbers itself but in some investments that maybe companies are sitting on they re saying there s this cloud of uncertainty sort of hanging over the mexican economy over this north american relationship and we d love to go and build that next factory but maybe we ll just wait a year or two and see where things stand before we decide to pull the trigger on that reeher let s talk about this new trade deal then canada the united states and mexico signed a new trade deal last november it s called the united states canada mexico agreement or usmca it would replace the north american free trade agreement which is better known as nafta my understanding is the deal still needs to be ratified by the three governments which means in the united states congress is still going to have to approve it so let s get some basics here again first broadly everybody talks about nafta but what did it establish and change wilson nafta was one of the first u s free trade agreements and so what it did is it brought tariffs those are the taxes on imports into the countries all three countries in this case it brought them to zero so it basically said if you want to import a car into the united states from mexico you don t have to pay a special tax on that if you want to import an apple from washington into mexico you don t have to pay a tax on that it also had some protections for investors in order to try to stimulate investments in these supply chains we were talking about factories on both sides of the border and actually the interesting thing sort of side note is mexican investment in the unites states while still smaller than u s investment in mexico has been growing at very high rates recently but that s what it was it was a trade and investment agreement i think it was sold as much more than that it was sold as a ticket to the first world for mexico it was sold as a solution to an immigration challenge in the united states and if we judge it on those terms it was definitely a failure it didn t do either of those things but if we judge it as a trade and investment agreement designed to spur both of those well it did just that reeher now as president trump said that was a bad deal for the united states and candidates like bernie sanders have pretty negative things to say about it as well from the labor front which we already talked about was it a bad deal is it possible just to evaluate it that simply did the united states come off on the short end of this wilson i don t think so there s two ways where you can judge trade agreements and i think we get mixed up between them one is the trade deficit it s seeing this as a pie that can t grow and saying who gets a bigger slice of the pie and the united states had a trade surplus with mexico before nafta now we have a small in global terms trade deficit with mexico but i think the real point is that you can grow the pie and you can make things better on both sides there s not a winner or loser in a trade agreement otherwise neither side would ever agree to one we have two winners in a trade agreement and in my mind that is what happened with nafta now that said it is really important to say that are distributional impacts as a result of trade agreements there are more winners than losers in the united states but there have been losers in the united states and i don t think that we as a country have done enough to deal with that fact so there are factories that went out of business as a result of nafta there were factories in mexico that went out of business as a result of nafta as well because they had a challenge trouble competing with strong u s companies but in certain industries where labor costs are very important there was a movement of certain factories to mexico and so the question is what do you do with those workers there s something that s called trade adjustment assistance that was put in place to try to help some of these workers when nafta was voted on but the reality is it s been too small of a program and too ineffective of a program and you have too many people who are left behind not only by trade because trade is a small piece of it but especially also by technological change it s not about recreating the new economy the economy of the 1950s it s about reskilling the american workforce so that it can succeed in the 21st century and unfortunately we ve done a pretty lousy job of that across the united states and therefore there s a lot of resistance to nafta and to globalization in general reeher let s take the new agreement then the usmca united states mexico canada agreement what are the most significant changes that that made to nafta wilson very few there are some there are some important ones but i think actually the starting point is recognizing that this is 90 percent nafta this is basically the same agreement as before a revised nafta the biggest changes were in the auto sector in particular there re special rules they call rules of origin essentially what does it take for a vehicle to be considered made in north america and get that tariff free access to the other countries under the original nafta a vehicle had to be 62 5 percent made in north america now it s up to 75 percent so it s a stricter rule of origin it means you can use less parts and materials from asia from europe as you re assembling cars in north america and the other piece of that was there was also 40 to 45 percent depending on what kind of vehicle test we made with wages workers earning wages of 16 hour or higher those essentially are workers in the united states or canada not line workers in mexico line workers in mexico make maybe 8 day 10 day not 16 hour some of the engineers and the managers in mexico might meet that threshold but these are the two biggest changes that could actually move production networks change the way that we build things in north america there was also a modernization of the agreement nafta was negotiated 25 years ago before we all had smartphones in our pockets before we shopped on amazon before we did business across the internet sending goods and services back and forth across national airs and so there s a lot of just basic housekeeping that needed to be done to modernize an agreement that was as we said one of the first trade agreements that the united states got into reeher is it a better deal now for the united states is this just a better deal wilson no it s half nafta 2 0 and half nafta 0 8 we took two steps forward two steps back so where did we end up i don t know how you average those two things out this is better nafta in certain ways for the three countries but there re also some things where there clearly are retro sessions and things that i don t actually believe will be a benefit to any of the three economies again though i have to say this is basically nafta this is basically still the same agreement this sort of interdependence that has been built up the integration of the north american production platforms the factories working together across borders all that will remain so more than anything this became a political promise that required a political solution and the economics of it are not all that different reeher was it worth all the conflict wilson i m just happy that we re for now on the other side and that things haven t gone really negatively that it hasn t all gone south but we still have to ratify the agreement and in the united states in this very polarized political environment in which we live that is going to be no easy task especially now that the democrats have the house this is something that s going to require support from both republicans and democrats not an easy thing to accomplish reeher i need to make sure that people understand we re talking on friday morning there s been an agreement on the budget which is going to provide about a quarter of the funding for the border wall or barrier whatever it is that we re going to call it that the president wanted that seems to have come together the president is also talking now about declaring an emergency declaring a crisis and using executive authority to get the rest of the money that he wants so that s where i think we are on friday morning let me just ask you a question here do you think that the changes in border security that are likely to come at least from what is in the deal that s been agreed that s really going to affect the trade between the two countries wilson there s actually some stuff in the agreement that will impact trade positively between the two countries so aside from all this stuff that s been really politically charged this debate about whether we do or do not build additional fencing or barrier along the u s mexico border in the bill there s also funding to modernize ports of entry in california and some other places there s funding to hire in addition approximately 600 custom officers so these are not the border patrol officers that work to stop unauthorized migration between the points of entry between the official crossing points but those who facilitate travel and ensure our security at official border crossings so there s some positive stuff in there the wall it s really from an economic perspective and a trade perspective the only thing it is is a symbol it s a symbol of division between the united states and mexico that makes u s mexico relations more complicated to manage and that can have some long term impacts on trade volumes on the ability to negotiate an agreement to have an ongoing dialogue to solve day to day problems but it s not something that s going to have a big impact on the type of trade that we ve been talking about reeher do you think it ll have an impact on labor supply in the united states wilson in that sense i agree with you that immigration can have an impact on labor dynamics and labor supply in the united states i don t believe that building an extra 100 miles of wall along the u s mexico border or even if you build more than that would have a significant impact on overall levels of migration i just don t think that it can be that effective and there are a few other pieces of the bill that offer investments in technology there are things that can be done to improve border security what we really need though if you want to deal with that broader migration issue is comprehensive immigration reform and you can mean that from a republican perspective or a democratic perspective but we need full on overall of our immigration system we need to find a way to do workplace enforcement it s not a border issue what i m trying to say is that solving the migration problem is not something you re really going to do at the border and definitely not only at the border reeher bottom line question on the border is the border situation as bad as the president portrays it to be wilson in my opinion there s absolutely no crisis at the border no security crisis i should say at the border there are some humanitarian crises going on and what s really happened is back in the 90s to the early 2000s we had a huge wave of mexican migrants that were seeking economic opportunity in the united states the situation has changed dramatically for the last several years it s no longer a majority of mexicans that are crossing the border rather they re central americans that are crossing the u s mexico border and they re not just trying to escape poverty they re also fleeing violence in their home countries so they re very motivated to get to the united states in a way that will get them across a wall if they need to get across a wall but they re also seeking asylum which means that they can show up at the ports of entry and turn themselves in they can sneak across the border and turn themselves in to border control they re not trying to sneak past they re trying to use u s law and international law as a way to gain access to the united states and so this is a totally different challenge that we re facing today and unfortunately i don t believe that we re addressing it in that way i think that we re treating as if it was the problem of several decades ago and it is true that more border security over the past couple of decades has had some level of impact on the number of mexican migrants trying to move for economic reasons to the united states reeher from a distance the country seems to be having trouble in terms of governability in terms of corruption in terms of the drug cartels violence can you give me an idea of has the situation become much worse in mexico just how bad is the problem wilson very serious challenge in terms of having the rule of law in mexico that has to do with drug trafficking but it also has to do with just the fact that mexico s still in nascent democracy it wasn t until 2000 that an opposition candidate won the presidency in mexico so it s a young democracy facing challenges that a lot of young democracies face and then the drug issue and the money comes from the united states to support that in mexico feeds into corruption and so the challenge is therefore much bigger that said let me just leave it on a little bit of a positive note mexico is also a modern country with a growing middle class it s all of those things at once
on the economic front state interventions in the private sector became increasingly common where all types of controls were imposed hundreds of private companies both national and foreign were

1999 2012 taking advantage of the financial strength provided by the extraordinary oil revenue the government borrowed massively from international markets chart 3 venezuelan imports 1999 2012 with all those resources the regime was able to expand public spending enormously creating a big consumption boom that was increasingly satisfied by imports domestic production severely debilitated and under constant threats was woefully incapable of satisfying demands in any sector chart 4 population under the poverty line 1999 2012 in different degrees that boom was enjoyed by almost everyone poverty had been reduced because a portion of the oil revenue and loans were used to fund a wide variety of social assistance programs these social programs made the regime more popular and enabled it to advance on its populist agenda chart 5 gdp per capita 2013 2018 the good times did not last long by 2012 2013 the signs of a crumbling model had become apparent a prolonged depression has ensued since then rivaling in its magnitude the great depression in the 1930s in the united states and most of the worst economic crisis documented in modern economic history chart 6 oil production and prices 1999 2018 as history has repeatedly shown it is not possible to have sustained economic growth while depending on the price of a single commodity and borrowing money moreover the venezuelan system became extremely corrupt and incompetent which further reduced the already declining resources venezuela s main source of income became increasingly limited chart 7 total imports 1999 2017 as oil revenue fell and international reserves were depleted the government responded by cutting imports massively there were not enough dollars to pay for imports and whatever was available was being used to service the enormous foreign debt and fill the pockets of government officials and collaborators chart 8 industrial establishments in venezuela 1999 and 2017 this meant that there was not enough foreign currency to import food medicine or raw materials needed to supply the companies that had managed to survive eventually the foreign debt payments also became untenable and the country was declared to be in selective default as the years passed venezuela became more dependent on oil revenue and loans from international financial markets however those two sources of funding have dried up still venezuela could not produce what could not be imported because either the infrastructure had been destroyed or it could not import the raw materials it needed for production as a result venezuela which in the 1990s used to produce 70 percent of the food it consumed and import 30 percent now produced only 30 percent and imported 70 percent chart 9 annual inflation rate 2012 2018 although the chávez regime did not have enough foreign exchange reserves to cover imports or service its foreign debt this did not prevent the regime from printing bolivars the national currency at an increasingly frantic pace this fueled massive inflation which today represents the only ongoing case of hyperinflation in the world chart 10 monthly minimum salaries in latin america as a result of this uncontrolled inflation wages plummeted wages in venezuela are the lowest in the entire region and among the lowest in the world currently 6 per month more shockingly not only is this the minimum salary it is the country s median wage this means that half of the workforce is earning less than 6 per month chart 11 population under poverty line by 2017 poverty had skyrocketed to record levels since data is only available up to that year the above graph does not even reflect the impact of hyperinflation in 2018 therefore it is safe to assume that these statistics are much worse today practically the entire country is living in poverty chart 12 beyond the economic numbers the terrible crisis facing the venezuelan people goes beyond economic problems venezuela s infrastructure a long time victim of negligence with limited investments has practically collapsed blackouts have become widespread occurring with increasing frequency and duration in every region access to clean running water is consistently declining limited by continuous interruptions approximately 70 percent of public transportation is completely out of service telecommunications from basic telephone services to the internet experience constant failures chart 13 homicide rate 1999 2017 crime is rampant in venezuela as a result of the complete institutional collapse the country has one of the highest murder rates in the world as the judicial system and other parts of government meant to provide law and order are not working chart 14 migration internal discontent is growing but so is the repression by the regime the country has around 235 political prisoners many of whom have been tortured or kept in inhumane conditions furthermore the most important opposition parties have simply been outlawed venezuelans feeling desperate and hopeless are fleeing from the disaster brewing in their home country according to the united nations at least 3 million or around 10 percent of the national population have left the country as of late 2018 venezuela has become a case of a failed state and the repercussions are not limited to the waves of refugees flooding the region the country has also become an international hub of criminal activity at least 12 high ranking governmental officials including the vice president tareck al aissami have been designated by the u s government as international drug kingpins overall the past two decades under chávez s regime have represented a brutal setback in all dimensions of social life for the venezuelan people this should serve as a dire warning to those in the region in the potential path of socialist and authoritarian leaders gerver torres is a non resident senior associate with the americas program at the center for strategic and

market economies are fast growing and underpinned by young workforces with money to spend this in turn provides a fertile backdrop for companies to grow earnings generate profits and provide shareholders with dividends but in practice the correlation between rapid economic growth and soaring stock markets does not always hold fast a number of factors can upset the applecart and derail markets for example an economy slowing down as china has done dampening investors expectations worrying external issues the threat of a full blown trade war between the united states and china higher commodity prices painful for industry and the value of the us dollar in general terms a strong dollar is bad news for most emerging markets first it results in us investors financial institutions such

banks operating in the egyptian market will hold on sunday high level meetings of their asset liability committees alco to discuss the fate of their deposit and loan interest rates after the central bank of egypt s cbe decision to cut the basic interest rate by 1 meanwhile two of the largest banks operating in the egyptian market the national bank of egypt nbe and banque misr have decided to keep the interest rates of fixed rate saving certificates unchanged and only change the interest rates of variable rate certificates the nbe maintained the interest rate of its three year fixed rate certificates at 15 with the yield disbursed every month and kept a rate of 15 25 for the certificates with the yield disbursed every three months said yehya aboul fotouh the bank s vice chairperson interests fell to 16 instead of 17 only for the bank s variable rate three year certificates with the yield disbursed every three months aboul fotouh added praising the cbe s decision to cut interest rates noting that it would attract investments to the egyptian market this decision comes in the light of the positive difference emerged between the announced inflation rates and banks interest rates aboul fotouh said pointing out that the stability in dollar exchange rates by the federal reserve system the central banking system in the united states has helped the cbe cut the interest rates with abundance of foreign reserves similarly banque misr has decided to keep the yields of three year certificates at the same level of 15 fixed and paid monthly without changes on the other hand the bank has decided to reduce the interest rate of three year variable rate certificates by 1 to 16 instead of 17 this week the two state run banks will be holding some meetings to discuss the fate of the interest rate of the rest of saving instruments as well as loans in a related context interest rates of many saving certificates and loan products related to the main prices of yield have declined once the cbe issued its decision to reduce these prices by 1 the cbe s monetary policy committee mpc decided last thursday to cut the overnight deposit and lending rates and the rate of the main operations by 100 basis points bps to 15 75 16 7 and 16 25 respectively the discount rate was also cut by 100 bps to 16 25 according to the cbe s statement headline and core inflation rose to 12 7 and 8 6 in january respectively due to unfavorable base effects the mpc said that this step comes after headline inflation declined to 12 0 in december 2018 due to the reversal of the transitory supply shock related to vegetables as a result the cbe s initial inflation target of 13 3 for the fourth quarter q4 of 2018 which was announced in may 2017 has been achieved while real gdp growth increased slightly to 5 5 in q4 2018 compared to 5 3 in q3 2018 and the unemployment rate declined to 8 9 from 10 0 its lowest level since december 2010 furthermore the statement indicated that net external demand continued to support economic activity while private domestic demand remained contained on the other hand the expansion of global economic activity weakened and the tightening of financial conditions eased and trade tensions continued to weigh on the global outlook the mpc decided to cut key policy rates by 100 bps this remains consistent with tight real monetary conditions and with achieving the inflation target of 9 3 in q4 2020 and price stability over the medium term the statement concluded this comes at a time when the market is anticipating the trend of yield prices on the treasury bills and bonds to be launched this week in order to understand how much they were impacted by the decision of cbe to reduce interest rates according to mohamed abdel aal a board member of suez canal bank and the arab sudanese bank the decision of cbe to reduce the main yield rates is expected to lead to a decrease in the cost of funding hence encourage economic growth it might also lead to a decline in the yield of treasury bills and bonds launched by the government which would help reduce local debt hence reduce the state budget deficit he added that reducing the interest rate and funding costs is expected to reduce the prices of locally produced goods which would help lower inflation rates it is not expected for this reduction in the prices of interests to lead to any change in exchange prices while a positive impact is expected on the performance of the egyptian exchange egx abdel aal said haitham abdel fattah head of the treasury and capital market sector at the industrial development bank idb said that the decision of cbe was greatly expected after it had managed to boost its control over the inflation and reached its targeted levels with this decision the cbe showed that it adopts expansionary monetary policies that target real and sustainable growth rates abdel fattah added noting that this decision will have a positive impact on all aspects of the economy he pointed out that alco at the idb will hold a meeting this week in order to discuss the impact of the decision on all saving instruments of the bank

need for a deliberate effort to revive local patronage of tourist sites ghana being a high cost destination is another challenge confronting the sector tourists are faced with the challenge of having to pay more by way of airfare and accommodation is another hurdle in the sector to cross furthermore issues of safety must not be swept under the carpet although government has begun auditing some tourist site to improve on safety many of them still lack the basic safety measures for patrons advertisement in addition poor sanitation along the country s beaches is also driving away tourists government has launched a crackdown on open defecation on our beaches but the menace still persists commitment of government the challenges i have stated above is largely due to finances that is why it is so important to explore public private financing model in the sector and also pass a law that will bring all recognised tourist sites under the ambit of the ministry of arts culture and tourism currently some of the tourist sites are under the management of local assemblies traditional authorities and the parks and gardens department in spite of all the stated challenges the nana akufo addo administration has shown commitment to the industry the government has developed a four year tourism development programme to improve the performance of tourism in targeted destinations in the country advertisement the program seeks to strengthen the tourism enabling environment develop tourism sites and destinations and provide support to tourism enterprise full implementation of the programme will commence this year and is expected to increase employment by about 150 000 and lead to an increase in international tourist arrivals by 300 000 at the end of the program according to the 2019 budget statement the marine drive tourism investment project has also started after a sod cutting ceremony by president nana addo dankwa akufo addo pulse ghana advertisement the project estimated to cost some 1 5 billion us dollars is situated on a total of 241 acres of prime beach front land stretching from the osu christianborg castle right to the arts centre and it is a public private

16 02 2019 listen frantz fanon warned us the future will have no pity for those men who possessing the exceptional privilege of being able to speak words of truth to their oppressors have taken refuge in an attitude of passivity of mute indifference and sometimes of cold complicity politics must be lubricated with the sense of national consciousness patriotism and public spiritedness a politics that takes these virtues into consideration and makes them the thrust and centre of national life is one that prioritizes the promotion of the general in contrast to the self and thus creates the condition for the ascent of the people to increase their capacity and master the law of nature and use technology to improve civilization conversely a politics which is based on no conviction and raft of principles is one which promotes the self relying on deception trickery and intrigue to throw oneself on the stage of history thus using the people as pitiful cannon fodder to achieve material splendour the tragedy of our country is the tragedy of the formation of political outfit on tribal irredentism and short sighted ends where one s loyalty is to the tribe and makes social progress only when an element of his tribe is catapulted to national political leadership this engenders a toxic fight in every election because one thinks that social mobility is not based on merit but a product of tribal patronage where kinsman politics and other vicious manipulations substitute for merit national consciousness and fair play within the polity this political oddity brushes aside the question of class domination and endeavours to limit the analysis of contradictions in the society to the constricted plane of the tribe thereby distorting the struggle for social emancipation and the prioritization of the genuine itinerary which focuses on national advances in all aspects of human development hence our national disaster our quest for a transformed homeland is essentially our search for human dignity that dignity to assert ourselves that dignity to exploit the wealth provided by nature to ensure national transformation that dignity to unwind the masses of the people from the clutches of mysticism and superstition to a celestial pinnacle of mastering the environment and using the tools of science to live a decent life we are referring to a dignity which regardless of social status and name affords everyone an opportunity based on merit to demand better and build a great nation out of this space such dignity holds that in order for the society to make a quantum leap in the appropriate direction our people s thought must be enriched by a sense of history so that they can participate in the affairs of politics and build an inclusive society as throughout history it is the people conscious and determined behind a popular vanguard who can build a progressive society besides in a third country such as ours a leader must not be a person who is affluent in material accumulation based on wholesale plunder of the national treasury a leader must have spiritual affluence in contrast to material opulence as the latter provides said individual with the crusading zeal to confront the contradictions of stagnation and backwardness that are break on social progress such person must be someone who throws himself herself against all odds making the ultimate sacrifice in order for the mass of the people to advance and usher in a higher form of civilization where nature will not take a violent toll on them but would use it for social emancipation our understanding of leadership and people we celebrate must be based on an appreciation of their struggles and the vanguard role they play in smashing the wretched trajectory of society to deliver a new society where the mass of the people will become masters of their destiny and faith which enable them to contribute to the flourishing of their environment historical accident has generated historical mirages and irresponsible nobodies on the centre stage of the national politics one of the fundamental factors that has deprived liberia of the social advance that we analysed above some of elements not possessing national consciousness have stagnated the people in a very nasty orgy this brings me to the rotten vestige of a dying order in amara m konneh who is a lousy yellow belly a well known tribalist and serial swindler who is an embodiment of all of the aberrations of national leadership and honest statesmanship this wretched soul panders to the politics of religious fundamentalism and tribal irredentism he toys with the fantasy of using the narrow formation of his tribe and religious heritage to project himself at the apex of national political leadership this man amara m konneh a noisy gate crasher who wants to exploit the fractures in these social formations due to the low level of political awareness of our people which can be attributed to the underdevelopment of the productive forces is not a national leader but a national scoundrel and not a patriot but a national traitor and not a nationalist but a crude ethnicist those proclivities make the megalomaniac in addition to his use of treachery and intrigue to hoodwink others an undesirable candidate for national political leadership in our society they make him incapable of contributing to the task of national renewal and the nation building efforts geared at delivering material emancipation to the mass of the population weighed down by the smorgasbord of social alienation grinding poverty and economic deprivation he is no visionary who is pierced with pains when his people suffer the cruelty of hunger humiliation and deprivation konneh is nothing more than a robber bureaucrat who is lust after power prestige and money and thus possesses an ambitions which far surpasses his capabilities that in order to achieve such ends he distributes pittance from the loot he amassed to buy loyalty and make people to toe his line amara m konneh is an acolyte of a status quo politics that has long kept the homeland as a plantation from america transplanted on african soil exploiting the subaltern classes and the urban masses as the nation remains a raw material producing vassal for countries of the capitalist metropoles his understanding of governance is essentially the mortgaging of our natural resources to the multinationals and transnationals in return for pittance in rent taxes and royalties that are capable of producing a 91 percent recurrent expenditure budget and a paltry 9 percent capital expenditure in social programs for health education and infrastructure this pattern of political economy which spokespersons of the decayed socio economic order call the modern development model for countries of the global south has failed to improve the income levels of peoples of the third world it has failed to increase the nutritional content of the diet of our young people so that their mental capacity develops and thus lead the complex effort of the reorganization of society so that wealth can benefit all people like amara konneh are the break on national progress and transformation he comes from a cabal which has no progressive idea to drag the republic out of its social backwardness but strives on dominance imbalance and brutal exploitation of the people and their natural resources as the distribution of wealth is unequal a disproportionate portion goes to the cabal while a morsel is given to the mass of the people who toil for survival and see no rest except in the grave he is a member of that cartel which retards and substitutes national development for national plunder and self enrichment that cabal with all of its greedy proclivities has no progressive fraternal developmental narrative for the mass of the exploited and oppressed people of our fatherland this get rich quick conman is incapable of espousing great ideas and a proper perspective for the progressive emancipation of the people other than vomiting those staid concepts and guesswork from the textbooks of the imf and world bank which have been the main menaces that have decimated and ravaged the african people after the attainment of flag independence in the 1960s the period which predates it was not only a century of colonial exploitation of the labour and natural resources of the african people but also four centuries of the brutal trans atlantic slave trade this brutal and inhumane forced labouring distorted historical development in africa and produced vast surplus for capitalism in europe and north america the world bank and imf are the products of the washington consensus with its neoliberal agenda for third world countries which are the bulwark for guaranteeing european and american capitalism so that five centuries of robbing africans of their future are not enough these institutions create the framework for the development of a parasitic national bourgeoisie which amilcar cabral referred to as false bourgeoisie in third world countries they are false bourgeoisie because they did not evolve from the ruins of decayed feudalism to own the means of production in the new society like their counterparts in the capitalist centre this false bourgeoisie amasses its wealth by plundering the national treasuries of third world countries this trend is the basis for creating that comprador class that uses the apparatuses of the third world states to pander to the whims and caprices of the prescriptions of the world bank and imf whose major aim is to create the condition for the exploitation of the resources and labour of the african people by foreign monopoly capital it is within this framework one must understand the role of the scumbag amara konneh these elements expect revolutionaries to tremble at the mention of the names of the troika of economic dominance of imperialism world bank imf and wto they must be psychopathic to think that we would be impressed that amara konneh is a cog in the machine of that imperialist organization established principally to protect the imperialist interests of the triad united states of america western europe and japan must we tell these people that in 1971 the nixon administration signed a pact with the wahhabi dictatorship of saudi arabia for the latter to sell its oil product in dollars in exchange for the us to provide weapons to save the decayed house of saud thus abandoning the international gold standard and introducing the petrodollar and making the dollars as the currency for international trade it changed the dollar from a worthless paper to an international reserve currency must we tell them the complicity of the imf world bank and wto in the war launched against col mummar gaddafi and saddam hussein simply because the duo opted to leave that petrodollar pact and toyed with the idea of creating a new currency for the sale of their crude products and currently should we tell them the complicity of the troika of economic dominance of imperialism in aiding and abetting the us to sabotage and destabilize the economy of venezuela simply because the people of the land of simon bolivar have refused to be subjected to the whims and caprices of imperialism and the diktats of its troika of economic dominance have they asked why the heads of the imf and world bank are either europeans or americans i don t want to recount the famine deaths and other casualties by the structural adjustment policy of those institutions in africa in the 1980s i am not bother in the least at these institutions that are established to further the interest of the triad as a man of conscience i educate our people against the disastrous policies of these institutions suffice it to mean whether amara konneh works there or not or even becomes head of anything there doesn t erase the fact that he is a common thief who must be condemned to prison hb an embodiment of virtues amara an embodiment of awful vices since the arch crook amara harboured the ambition of becoming a leader of the republic at a certain time in his sordid life the sponger started cleaning up himself in ways to not detect fraud and expose him as an economic imbecile whose claim to fame is avarice plunder and theft as he resigned his position the poster boy and his political godmother and mother in law initiated a farcical audit to vindicate him they then found a plaint stooge in boima kamara to hire a fly by night auditing firm to do their bidding and the ridiculous audit was conducted thus vindicating amara of all charges in anticipation of any inquiry in the near future the fact that the audit was done hastily says much about the mind set of the people and the reason behind such rush for a man who stole funds meant to address structural imbalances in our healthcare sector and reduce maternal fatalities for a social pimp whose hands were caught in the cookie jar by the warner committee for a yokel whose record of public service is overwhelmed with scandal for a guy who climbed through the ranks and file of the government by gossiping and bring others down hiring a low key auditing firm to give him a clean slate is a child s play this is why for amara konneh insofar as the miserable exploitation of the people can land loot in his many bank accounts and give him fame the people can be used as experimental guinea pigs as he did in the last election by when his cabal orchestrating a scheme to impose george m weah on us through a bogus electoral process but we have news for this chap who thinks he has the clairvoyance to outsmart everyone whether hundred years or thereabout amara konneh like president bio has done in sierra leone you will be dragged before a judicial commission of inquiry to account for your stewardship in public service even before that that discredited audit done by that bogus auditing firm will be discarded and rubbished to the trashcan kpmg auditing firm will be invited to conduct an audit of you for becoming an overnight millionaire you can comfort yourself and think you are so smart to not be busted but your day of reckoning is soon in spite of the charade the presidential position you are chasing which far exceeds your abilities will be your undoing history will have its last laugh on you meanwhile we are aware of your supermarket chain in philadelphia as well as your loot in conakry guinea they will be confiscated and used for the benefit of the people and by that time you the rascal will be serving prison term in an orange jumpsuit this fate seems like a fantasy to befall you for the cynics who cannot see beyond their noises but soon this will be the lot of the mocking little imp in amara konneh unlike amara konneh s role in public service in the homeland which is stained and pockmarked with avarice theft and loot at a tender age dr h boima fahnbulleh jr found a path and direction in life standing with the people and struggling against backward tendencies and at the forefront of noble causes that tend to liberate society from bondage and push it in the epoch of social justice and plenty this calling has been the motivation for his involvement in the politics of the republic to which he comes with virtues that distinguish him from others and thus put him in a unique league of immortals his service as minister of education led to a tremendous transformation in the sector in a very short stint just to name few tours de force of his at the ministry of education free education adult literacy program the abolishment of activities fees the purchasing of books at affordable and adjusted prices and other deliverables too numerous to name similarly at the ministry of foreign affairs he ensured that the prc regime was accepted by global bodies such as the un ecowas oau and now au etc he used his shrewd diplomatic skills to ensure liberia reclaim her glory within the realm of international relations the liberian missions across the world received their funds to operate within the appropriate time frame seasoned diplomats and economic attachés and other specialized individuals were assigned at those missions to seek opportunities for the country in keeping with its national interest i say the ideas expressed by us and the nature of our activism is one about the transformation of liberia and the bringing of the people into history as that is the only way we can extricate the homeland from the thralldom of economic backwardness where they will be totally involved in the national development of the country this will end the era of the development of underdevelopment and begin the process of liberia choosing the path of self determination in its internal and external affairs and exerting control of its economic activities then the framework of constructing a new society where machine and the instrument of human labour will not be used as instruments of exploitation but will be organized for the production of abundance for the common good of all and thus create leisure so the people can participate in other aspects of social development kiadii is the secretary general of the movement for social democratic alternative mosoda you can reach him through

outcome american savings bank was our start performer growing earnings by 23 stronger than expected and delivering 33 higher dividends to hei american hard work to improve efficiency and deliver disciplined growth in our state s continued healthy economy helped build on the benefits of tax reform which endured to the benefit of shareholders our utility also performed well with utility earnings up 11 over the prior year reflecting new rates at all three utilities with the resumption of our triennial rate case cycle after six years and the first implementation of the major projects interim recovery mechanism for mpir for our schofield project however utility earnings were not as strong as anticipated in addition to one time expenses that we ve provided updates on on our quarterly call in the fourth quarter we wrote off expenses incurred during the merger time period for evaluating the import of lng and in the last two weeks of december we experienced an outage of sufficient scope that combined with the impacts of severe weather events earlier in the year resulted in unexpected penalties under the reliability performance incentive mechanism or pim which applied to us for the first time in 2018 the commission has provided opportunities to evaluate how the new pims are working and we are looking into potential modifications after a year of experience with this new mechanism on the positive side we are eligible for a reward under the call center performance pim due to our strong call center results on oahu due to the release we obtained in this latest rate case cycle we will continue to see earnings grow in 2019 and anticipate further improvement through our next rate case cycle which began in december with the filing of our hawaii electric light 2019

carbon neutral and renewable transportation goals and to address hawaii s goal to be a leader in addressing climate change in 2018 our utility continues to transform to provide more customer value by moving aggressively to integrate more renewable resources for hawaii many of our 2018 accomplishments reflect goals and initiatives set forth in our 2015 to 2020 strategic transformation plan which focused on delivering a cost effective clean energy portfolio improving customer experience and offering customers innovative energy solutions creating a modern grid and technology platform strengthening stakeholder relationships working with stakeholders to align regulatory and market models with the transformation of our industry and company improving company culture and ensuring we have the financial strength to deliver on this transformation and our state s ambitious renewable energy goals our utility advanced each of these priorities in 2018 on clean energy we achieved 27 of the energy sales from renewables despite the shutdown of the third party owned puna geothermal plant due to lava flows we reduced our fossil fuel use by 19 since 2008 and cut our greenhouse gas emissions by 19 since 2010 we accelerated our ability to add even more clean energy and reduce carbon emissions implementing the state s largest and lowest cost renewable energy procurement program we ve asked the public utilities commission to approve power purchase agreement for seven new solar plus storage projects that will deliver 262 megawatts of solar and over one gigawatt hour of storage six of them have what have been called mind blowing very low prices that make us eligible for an award under the renewable rfp pim the commission established last year these prices are lower than the cost of fossil fuel generation and reflect our innovative new purchase power agreement which gives us flexibility to dispatch energy to meet grid needs and helps reduce uncertainty for independent power producers if approved and completed on schedule by 2022 these projects will help us reach 50 of energy sales from renewable sources reduce our fossil fuel use by 52 versus 2008 and cut our greenhouse gas emissions by 50 compared to 2010 on customer experience we achieved a 17 customer satisfaction improvement since 2014 and we continue to develop new programs to engage with and offer new ways for of customers to participate in the clean energy transformation as just a few examples we launched the commission improved community based renewable energy program to enable those who don t own their rooftop to benefit from renewable energy savings and earlier this month we established project footprint to reward customers for taking carbon reducing actions like moving to paperless billing adding rooftop solar or buying an electric vehicle we ve made it easier for customers to apply to add rooftop solar with our new online system and faster approval time i m proud to say that in 2018 we re again number one in the nation for rooftop solar adoption more than 35 of single family homes on oahu now have private solar we also laid the foundation for more customers to take advantage of electric vehicles filing our electrification of transportation strategic roadmap expanding charging infrastructure to provide drivers more options and advancing the state s electric bus effort we need a modernized grid enhanced technology and additional grid scale storage to integrate store and manage the growing levels of renewable and distributed energy on our system and to offer more and more value to customer in 2018 we applied for approval of phase i of our grid modernization effort and for two battery storage projects which are pending approval our pole ownership agreement last year with hawaiin telcom enables us to become the managing owner of 120 000 utility poles and optimize that asset to benefit customers it also provides opportunities to add new technologies like 5g as well as earn attachment revenues we made major strides with respect to stakeholder engagement and the transformation of utility regulatory and market model 2018 marked the beginning of our state s formal evaluation of performance based regulation or pbr to ensure alignment of our regulatory framer with our state s policy goals we have been working together with the commission the consumer advocate and to many stakeholders on this important effort which has been collaborative and productive and which has maintained gradualism and the financial integrity of the utility as guiding principle we look forward to continuing to work with the commission and other stakeholders in phase 2 of this pbr process which will focus on developing specific performance measures and incentives to achieve our collective goal we made significant progress on the utility s financial health in 2018 following resumption of triennial rate cases in the first use of the mpir mechanism we also advanced several efforts to increase utility operational and maintenance efficiency we successfully took our new enterprise system live in october consolidating many disparate systems into a common sap platform and increasing efficiency through automation and standardization we ll deliver 244 million in customer savings related to this new system over the next 12 years this enterprise system enables our one company initiative which is under way and will improve efficiency by standardizing procurement and other processes across our three utility five island system and capture greater economies of scale we will also reduce costs through other initiatives including facilities consolidation and to review of benefit programs we also continue to bring a greater sense of cultural cohesion across our five island system with organizational changes to align our teams around our one company initiative finally i m very proud of the way our team is prepared for and responded to several natural disasters in 2018 including lava flows in hawaii island a hurricane and the first tropical storm to make landfall on maui in recent memory our investments in resilience and disaster preparedness limited damage and outages had enabled us to recover very quickly turning to slide 4 in addition to record earnings our bank had a number of significant achievements in 2018 american strengthened its efficiency ratio to 59 4 a 220 basis point improvement over 2017 and a 550 basis point improvement since 2015 american has done this through its consistent focus on making banking easier for customers which permits the bank s culture and drives efforts to simplify and automate processes and increase the use of lower cost ways to deliver high levels of customer service american has also worked hard to lower its occupancy cost and has already reduced its non branch footprint by 52 looking ahead american is targeting annual improvement in its efficiency ratio by 100 basis points over the next several years a key driver of the bank s future efficiency gains is its new campus we are excited about the opportunities to consolidation of american s non branch employees into this new campus presents to further improve efficiency not to mention the other operational and cultural benefits of bringing its employees together the campus helps further our sustainability goals with hundreds of solar panels helping to power the building and state of the art energy efficiency and smart billing technology the campus also serves as a platform for community partnerships and revitalization of part of honolulu s urban core 2018 was also an important year in pacific current s development as well following our second acquisition a set of five solar plus storage projects being built at university of hawaii campuses the time was right to establish a management team we now have a small highly talented leadership team in place to lead pacific current forward further build out its strategy optimizing existing assets develop local partnerships and relationships and identify opportunities to further invest in our state s sustainable future we will update you in the future as pacific current undertakes new projects as you can see we ve had a very active and productive year and now i ll ask greg to update you on our 2018 financial results and our 2019 highilights greg gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks connie overall hawaii s economy remains healthy and continues to grow although the pace of growth is moderating hawaii s tourism industry is significant driver of the state s economy should strength in 2018 with visitors spending more time in making more purchases in our islands than in the prior year in 2018 visitor arrivals were up 5 9 and expenditures were up 6 8 we did see a slight dip in the expenditures at the end of the year with a monthly 3 5 decline in december compared to the december in 2017 hawaii still maintains one of the nation s lowest unemployment rates unemployment in december was 2 5 significantly below the national rate of 3 9 hawaii real estate fundamentals remain strong while sales volumes declined from the prior year by 7 7 for single family homes and 2 5 for condos median prices continued to rise with increases on oahu of 4 6 for single family homes and 3 7 for condos while the economies rate of expansion has slowed as the business cycle has matured continued growth is still expected turning to our financial results slide six shows hei s net income for the full year and fourth quarter as connie noted earlier in 2018 we had strong consolidated financial performance with both operating companies contributing to our reported results going from left to right on this slide consolidated gaap net income for the full year was 201 8 million in 2018 relative to 165 3 million for 2017 a 22 increase as you may remember in the fourth quarter of 2017 we had 14 2 million of adjustments across the consolidated companies due to certain onetime impacts from federal tax reform after adjusting for these non core impacts 2017 core net income was 175 179 5 million there were no non core adjustments to our 2018 net income full year earnings normalized for onetime from 2017 tax reform impacts grew by 22 3 million or 12 net income grew at both the utility and bank combined with a higher holding company and other segment net loss that was primarily driven by lower tax benefits on holding company expenses due to tax reform as well as higher interest in compensation expenses partially offset by earnings contributions by pacific current fourth quarter net income was up 7 over the same quarter of last year reflecting headwinds at the utility experienced late in the year partially offset by strong q4 performance at american savings bank pacific current which is included in the holding company and other segment contributed positively to net income and operating cash flow modestly offsetting some of the holding company expenses and or investment in the new enterprise for 2018 gaap earnings per share were 1 85 compared to 1 52 in 2017 excluding one time federal tax reform impact of 0 13 per share in 2017 core earnings per share were 1 65 as core net income grew by 0 20 per share through our holding company structures and stable earnings we are able to grow a bank dividend excuse me because of growing bank dividend and practically no dilution in 2018 net income growth of 22 translated into eps growth of 22 on a gaap basis and 12 for each on a core business as shown on the right side of the slide hei s consolidated roe for 2018 was 9 5 compared to 2017 gaap roe of 7 9 and core 2017 roe of 8 6 the higher 2018 roe reflects strong earnings growth at the bank and improved earnings at the utility notably management achieved utility roe improvement despite a lower utility allowed roe after our latest rate case increases of 9 5 compared to the prior 9 8 allowed on a core basis the 50 basis point increase despite with despite a loss of 30 basis points in allowed reflects an 80 basis point net improvement turning to slide 8 utility net income was 144 million in 2018 compared to 2017 gaap net income of 120 million and core net income which excludes the one time impact of tax reform of 129 million our utility 2018 net income contributed to eps of 1 32 per share 0 01 below our utility guidance range of 1 33 to 1 46 as connie mentioned one time events in the fourth quarter including penalties on our reliability pim impacted net income late in the year and as a result utility income was lower than expected on an after tax basis the most significant net income drivers were 57 million higher net revenues from the resetting of base rates through the rate case cycle and ram and npi recovery mechanisms 5 million from our pool licensing and operating agreements with hawaii telcom resulting in attachment fees including interest and the release of reserves after the settlement of receivables from hawaii telcom 37 million of higher o m expenses compared to 2017 primarily due to the reset of pension costs for the first time in six years as part of our rate case decisions the write off of project cost incurred during the merger period related to smart grid planning and the evaluating lng imports higher cost for preventative maintenance on underground circuits to ensure reliability generating station operation and maintenance and workers compensation claims and 2 million higher net income from net tax adjustments largely related to favorable adjustments made in connection with the filing of the 2017 tax return which was partially offset by the difference between the reduction to revenue requirement to return expected tax reform benefits to customers which exceeded the actual 2018 savings realized turning to slide 9 american had record earnings for 2018 with a 23 increase in reported net income bank net income for the year was 82 5 million compared to 67 million in the prior year which included a 1 million net positive impact of tax reform excluding the impact of tax reform adjustments 2017 bank net income was 66 million as noted on our third quarter call we expected asp to come in at the high end of guidance which the bank exceeded reporting eps of 0 76 per share 0 02 above our guidance range of 0 68 to 0 74 per share strong management performance and lower tax rates contributed to a very good year the most significant after tax drivers of the increase from 2017 were 14 million higher net interest income driven by growth in as well as higher yields on interest earning assets resulting from an improved interest rate environment 3 million higher provision for loan losses reflecting additional loan loss reserves for the consumer loan portfolio the year over year increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to additional loan loss reserves for the consumer loan portfolio which were partially offset by releases of reserves in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios as a result of improved credit quality and the pay off of a criticized commercial real estate construction loan in the fourth quarter of 2018 4 million lower non interest income primarily due to lower debit card interchange fees due to new accounting standard that reclassified 4 2 million of debit card expenses in 2018 to non interest income and 1 million increase in non interest expense primarily due to higher compensation and benefit expenses due to the bank s decision to increase the entry salary for employees as well as annual merit increases partially offset by the reclassification of the debit card expenses i just described turning to slide 10 american s solid profitability in 2018 showed through with both higher return on assets and increased return on equity we achieved a return on assets of 125 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2018 exceeding our third quarter return on assets of 122 basis points and or 110 basis point threshold for the year our annual average return on assets was 120 basis points for 2018 we manage our capital efficiently to optimize return on average equity while maintaining a well capitalized threshold for the bank fourth quarter of 2018 we achieved a return on average equity of just over 14 compared to 13 8 in the linked quarter for the full year 2018 achieved 13 5 return on equity 2 3 above 2017 and comparing favorably to the 2018 of peer medium of 10 3 on slide 11 american s net interest margin has continued to strengthen and continues to perform well against our high performing peers and hawaii based peers net interest margin grew by 3 83 for the full year 2018 compared to 3 69 in 2017 as well as the high end of our guidance range at 3 7 to 3 8 for the fourth quarter of 2018 net interest margin was 3 95 compared to 3 81 in the linked quarter and 3 68 in the fourth quarter of 2017 with the improvement primarily attributable to higher yields on interest earning assets and continued low cost deposits we continue to effectively grow earning assets within our loan and investments portfolios to improve net interest income net interest margin in the fourth quarter was supported by lower premium amortization within our investment portfolio normalizing our fas 91amortization to the previous quarters in 2018 our margin would ve been 3 87 for the fourth quarter our interest earning asset yields increased over the linked quarter to 4 22 we ve maintained our low cost fund our low funding costs in the rising interest rate environment and continue to benefit from our disciplined approach and focus on relationship banking our cost of funds was 28 basis points in the fourth quarter just two basis points above the linked quarter and well below that of peers on slide 12 total loans were 4 8 billion as of december 31 up 3 7 annualized from december 31 2017 with retail loans up 130 million or 3 9 reflecting americans disciplined approach toward growing the loan portfolio total deposits grew 6 2 billion at december 31 2018 an increase of 268 million or 4 6 from december 31 2017 net interest income increased 8 over the prior year to 242 7 million driven by growth in interest earning assets and the improved interest rate environment fourth quarter 2018 net interest income was also higher at 63 4 million compared to 61 1 million in the linked quarter and 57 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 non interest income for 2018 was 56 1 million compared to 61 6 million in 2017 and fourth quarter 2018 non interest income was 13 5 million compared to 15 3 million in the linked quarter and 15 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the lower non interest income for the year was primarily due to lower debit card interchange fees as a result of a new accounting standard that reclassified 4 2 million of debit card expenses in 2018 from non interest expense to non interest income on slide 13 credit quality remains sound due to prudent risk management and healthy hawaii economy the credit quality of our residential portfolio remains very strong and our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are stable with improving trends provision for loan losses reflected additional reserves for the consumer loan portfolio partially offset by the release of reserves due to improved credit quality in other portfolios in the fourth quarter there was a significant pay off of a criticized commercial real estate construction loan which led to a lower than expected provision allowance for loan losses of 52 million was 1 08 of outstanding loans at year end compared to 1 14 in the linked quarter and 1 15 in the prior year non accrual loans as a percentage of total loans receivable held for investment was 0 056 compared to 0 59 at the end of the linked quarter and 0 51 at the end of the year our net charge off ratio increased to 34 basis points for the full year compared to 27 basis points in 2017 driven by the personal unsecured loan portfolio which remains profitable the net charge off ratio for the fourth quarter was 37 basis points versus 40 basis points for the linked quarter and 26 basis points for the fourth quarter of the prior year the improvement over the linked quarter reflects american s adjustments to the parameters of its personal unsecured loan portfolio as it seasons as well as management s strategy to improve its collections process american s asset and funding mix shown on the left side of slide 14 remains attractive relative to peers a 100 of our loan portfolio was funded with low cost core deposits versus the aggregate of our peer banks at 72 the average cost of funds was 25 basis points for the full year 2018 nearly 60 basis points better than the peer median turning to slide 15 efficiency improvement has been a key focus of management and the bank has delivered consistent results in strengthening its efficiency ratio american achieved an efficiency ratio of 59 5 for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 59 4 for the full year a meaningful improvement about 220 basis points over the prior year and compared to 2015 american s 2018 efficiency ratio was 550 basis points better efficiency remains a key focus moving forward with the bank management targeting about 100 basis points of efficiency ratio improvement per year over the next three years turning now to our expectations for future performance starting with our utility capex forecast utility modestly exceeded its 20 its revised 2018 capex target investing 411 million for the year building on that result in 2019 we forecast 400 million of capex largely driven by two battery storage projects and phase 1 of our grid modernization initiative both of which still require commission approval as well as baseline projects to improve reliability and resilience and help integrate more renewable and distributed energy in 2020 and 2021 we expect to invest between 400 million and 500 million per year capex in any given year can of course vary depending on the timeliness of puc approvals and permitting as well as community and other stakeholder engagement processes importantly with improved financial results the utility is expected to be able to self fund its forecasted capex through our 2021 planning period through retained earnings and its access to the debt capital markets on slide 17 our financing outlook for 2019 reflects our strengthened financial condition the bank which has long been self funding has increased its dividend to hei as its earnings have improved in 2018 asbs dividend to the holding company increased 33 to 50 million and in 2019 we expect the dividend to increase 20 to 60 million utility is able to self fund its investment needs for capital expenditure programs while hei will continue to ensure that the utility has sufficient access to equity capital necessary to meet its capital needs and maintain an investment grade capital structure while the improved cash distributions from the bank and utility we do not anticipate the need to issue any external equity in 2019 outside of other attractive or accretive investment opportunities not currently included in our plan in addition the improved outlook for earnings and cash flow has allowed us to grow the hei dividend while continuing to manage our capital structure and maintain our investment grade ratings turning to slide 18 we are initiating hei s 2019 consolidated earnings guidance of 1 85 to 2 05 per share consisting of 1 40 to 1 47 at the utility and 0 79 to 0 85 at the bank our 2019 utility guidance assumes no change to our major regulatory recovery mechanisms and no material impacts from performance incentive penalty from a performance incentive penalties or rewards it includes an approximately 8 million net income impact from continued customer benefit adjustments from the latest hawaiian electric and maui electric rate case decisions and a schedule detailing those customer benefit adjustments can be found in our in the appendix utility guidance also reflects management s focused on o m efficiency with o m excluding pension and onetime items that impacted 2018 projected to increase 1 or below inflation our 2019 bank guidance range reflects american s ongoing focus on efficiency and a disciplined approach to growth with continued strength in net interest margin and low to mid single digit earning asset growth note the embedded embedded in our guidance for asb is a onetime net positive impact of 0 03 to 0 05 per share in 2019 reflecting the anticipated gain on sale of two facilities the bank is selling as it relocates to its new campus offset by cost the bank will incur this year as it moves into its new space while pacific current remains an important and promising part of our overall strategy we do not expect it to contribute meaningfully to 2019 earnings given the early stage of the company and as manage as the management team further develops the platform plans and pursues new project opportunities i would note that we anticipate no new equity to be issued from hei from 2019 also a comment regarding our dividend increase our policy dividend payout range is 60 to 65 while maintaining investment grade capital structure and rating further dividend growth is subject to the board approval and in consideration with other accretive investment opportunities i ll turn it over to connie for her closing remarks constance lau president and chief executive officer thanks greg we re proud of our accomplishments in 2018 and we re optimistic about our ability to achieve even more going forward the place based strategy we ve pursued at hei continues to provide the financial resources needed to invest in the strategic growth of our company and in a sustainable future for hawaii while also supporting our dividend which the board increased this quarter by 3 2 at the utility we re making strong headway on our transformation initiatives across the company ensuring affordable reliable renewable energy remains a core focus of all of our efforts we re on track to beat the 2020 goal of 30 of electric sales from renewable sources and by 2022 we re targeting significant acceleration to 50 we re focused on delivering o m savings for customers through implementation of our new enterprise resource system which enables our one company initiative and other efficiency efforts and we continue to focus on improving the reliability and resilience of our system and modernizing our grid to enable more renewables more electric vehicles and more value for customers at the bank we start the year in a very strong financial position and are well positioned for further earnings growth american s new campus marks a new stage in its history consolidation of its non branch employees into this innovative space is expected to bring continued efficiency improvement and even more ways to continue making banking easier for customers and building deeper customer relationships at pacific current our new team will build on the foundation created with our first two projects and lead the company forward through strategy development asset optimization relationship building and pursuit of new opportunities across our enterprise we will continue to build long term value for our customers communities employees and shareholders finally before we get to q a in our release you may have seen that we are nominating three new independent directors to our board at our upcoming annual meeting as part of our plan board succession all bring extensive experience and track records of success to add to the strength of our talented board and with that we re happy now to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question today will come from julien dumoulin smith of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst this is eric on for julien constance lau president and chief executive officer hi eric gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hi eric eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good afternoon so first question could you comment on the latest staff proposal from staff on pbr specifically on the five year sale and the list of currently proposed performance metrics and what are you anticipate this proposal might be significantly changed constance lau president and chief executive officer yeah absolutely eric and we actually had anticipated that question and so we ve invited joe viola who is the head of our regulatory department to be with us today and so i ll turn it over to joe joseph viola vice president regulatory affairs hi eric again this is joe viola the staff proposal came out on february 7 continues to be a progression of high quality work product from our commissioned staff we believe it presents a pretty balanced approach to consideration of our regulatory framework currently we still kind of that we re really kind of still in the middle of pbr process this is the staff s proposal at the end of phase i now the parties will be providing briefs to comment on those proposals we ll submit statements of position on march 8 there will be a limited discovery period the parties will present implied statements of position on april 5 and then the commission will issue its decision on phase i after that time so we re still a little bit in the middle of the process a lot of conceptual discussion i think as commissioned recognized early in the process and we agree with the details on that matter but right now very constructive very professional report and we look forward to providing our comments in march eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and do you expect would you read the current proposal as helping on roe challenges joseph viola vice president regulatory affairs there certainly a potential for that again as the details will matter the concepts in there certainly offer an opportunity for that we re encouraged by the discussion of opportunities potentially to reduce some regulatory lag certainly the opportunities to potentially earn on some of the services we ve been traditionally providing really again a bunch of opportunities i think that could be very constructive to the utility but we ll have to see what the actual details are for the development phase ii constance lau president and chief executive officer and eric i would just eric i would just add that i think what s really important about this proposal as joe said it s very professionally done well thought through considers all of the different stakeholders in the process and particularly the customer so that s really really important thing eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and secondly would you going on to the specific trends side could you talk about the earnings contributions from the solar plus storage projects on a stand alone basis and could you further talk about the uptick in holdco drag for 2019 relative to 2018 thanks gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hi eric yeah this is greg hazelton so yes as we noted the pacific current was did have contribute earnings to the year it s modest relative overall and as you know we ve been investing in the platform through new talent establishing the office and other ongoing work that they have currently so it s moving forward it did contribute to net earnings on a pacific current basis over 0 01 per share but again that s all after investments within made internally as well as bringing as well as brining making the investments to grow the platform of bringing the management team online the other increases at the holding company were primarily interest expenses and after tax after tax the holding company realizes a loss and based on tax reform that loss falls to the bottom line at a higher level so as you noticed in the fourth quarter we did term out about 100 million of commercial paper and refunded some term debt at a higher interest rate in the current interest rate environment which contributed to our higher interest costs at the holding company eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes just to clarify i m referring to the five solar plus storage project announcement to second acquisition for 2019 the expectations around the earnings contribution stand alone for those if you would be able to provide any further color there gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so those are in the process of being completed and i know scott and his team have been actively managing that on a day to day basis so i think we have expectations about those the timing of bringing those online so while they re under construction most of the costs are being capitalized and you will see earnings contribution as those are brought online scott do you have anything to add scott seu senior vice president public affairs yes those projects will come online starting sometime late spring early summer though the remainder of the year the relative contribution for 2019 will be very small if not nil on a relative basis just due to the timing all five projects come online sort of sequentially with the first one targeting probably early summer eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it that s helpful and then one last question before i see to the queue would you be able to discuss potential for a tax free spin of the bank and any openness to potential sale of telco and could a forthcoming lei report change any variables around the co op effort thanks constance lau president and chief executive officer so eric we really don t comment on speculative proposals but i think as we ve always told investors this management team has always been open to evaluating all proposals that might have the potential to increase shareholder value so we ve never shied away from those kinds of analysis but i can t really comment on anything that is speculative eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it understood i ll see to the queue thank you operator the next question will come from paul patterson of glenrock associates please go ahead paul patterson glenrock associates analyst hey how s it going constance lau president and chief executive officer hi paul gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hi paul paul patterson glenrock associates analyst so potentially you said which i think was 5 million what is the impact on 2019 and beyond of the reset gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you mean the reset so under the rate cases we have recovery now at the current net periodic pension costs that we re incurring as you know we ve been out for a number of years and actually in the interest rate environment we were with our old rate cases we were not fully collecting on a cash basis the actual cost cash costs of those programs and the requirement to contribute to the external trust on a cash basis so we see that as so that has been cured relative to go forward basis our costs are being collected relative and on an earnings basis we really don t see an impact because the rate cases have aligned the costs of those programs with what we re reporting is does that address your question paul patterson glenrock associates analyst i think it does so i mean so you ok so and then on the slide 23 which seems like a new slide for you guys maybe not maybe i missed it before is that what you re what exactly does that represent gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer okay those are what we ve talked about in terms of the customer benefit adjustments and maybe i ll look those were concessions that were made to settle the recent rate cases that we ve been through that had now a scheduled reduction over time but i ll have tayne to speak to that directly tayne sekimura senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so paul this is tayne on the line as greg mentioned as part of our revenue requirements and what we agreed to in the rate cases as they were being worked on for hawaiian electric and maui electric these are the customer benefit adjustments and on this particular slide we did schedule it out you will notice that over time it s reduced and what we will do as the management team is we re going to manage through these amounts and attempt to find offsets to cope with these lower revenues that we got to the rate case paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay great gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer we wanted to provide clarity around these challenges as you think about 2019 and our ability to improve our achieved roe recognizing that we do have this that we will have to find ways to offset this to capture those but i think as importantly as you look out over time you see that these are reduced over time and will naturally then allow us to achieve better results all things being equal paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then following up on eric s pbr questions it seemed to me that there were two things that sort of caught my eye it is to what eric brought up which is the idea of having day one savings could you elaborate a little bit more on what the thought process is with that or what that actually might entail with day one savings and the second term that comes up is financial integrity of the utility do they have you gotten a sense when you speak with them what that actually stands for joseph viola vice president regulatory affairs hi this is joe viola first question the day one savings in the commission staff report that s where that term exists several parties in the proceeding had proposed some type of adjustment to the multiyear rate plan and the consumer advocate and i believe maybe blue planet in addition proposed a kind of immediate dividend they call it a customer dividend really what that would represent is a revenue requirement reduction from the start of any new pbr plan to represent immediate savings to customers the question earlier was on the customer benefit it s similar to that i think the commission staff report describes that as essentially a stretch goal to ensure productivity improvements above what might be represented otherwise by our productivity factor in the multiyear rate case revenue plan requirement so that s a proposal that s in the staff report and the parties including the utilities will be commenting on that in a briefing as far as the second question on the financial integrity we were certainly appreciative of the commission stands recognition of the importance of utility s financial integrity that s been the discussion in the docket since the beginning and i think what that represents is acknowledgment that actually not only did we continue to financial integrity and the help of utility is very important to achieving the state energy goals it s important to a lot of our third party power providers they rely on our financial integrity our credit rating to finance their projects so it s an express recognition of that we re certainly very appreciative of the fact that that is a recognition and has been defined as one of the guiding one of the many guiding principles to development of pbr in phase ii paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay but i guess when we re looking at these two items it seems that one i guess when we re talking about the day one savings it sounds like there could be a situation where do you think there is potential risk of how that sort of might actually impact earnings at such a if that was sort of the plan do you follow what i am saying joseph viola vice president regulatory affairs there is well to give a simple answer that there s always risk but that s just one factor that commission staff there are other factors so we will have to see how this plays out we mentioned before the details will matter is it day one savings that customer dividend proposal on the table but what s also in the commission staff report are some elements of change the regulatory mechanisms that could reduce regulatory lag from us could also provide other opportunities for us to increase revenue opportunities so it s a package proposal as we considered in context and we will be briefing that paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then just on the premium amortization that you guys mentioned for at the bank if i heard that correctly that would ve gotten you that would have lowered the net interest margin to 3 87 did i hear that correctly richard wacker president and chief executive officer yes this is rich that s correct paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and going forward what should we think about that richard wacker president and chief executive officer we think that quarter was lower than it would be on a run rate basis we think it ll the amortization will bounce back up and we don t know how much quarter to quarter but on average for the year it would be comparable to what we saw in 2018 paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then just finally on the earning guidance slide you called out the onetime 0 03 to 0 05 associated with the bank with the moving to the campus sale but is that the only one time we should be thinking about in new guidance gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes there s we have no other we ve scheduled out the customer benefit adjustments and the headwinds that are there that we ve provided full detail no other known onetime adjustments included in our forecast at this time paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay well thanks so much enjoy i hear you guys had some snow that was sounds pretty amazing but good talking to you and have a great weekend constance lau president and chief executive officer thanks paul operator our next question will come from charles fishman of morningstar research please go ahead charles fishman morningstar research analyst and i don t thank you guys i know what snow is its snowing where i am right now constance lau president and chief executive officer that s true charles charles fishman morningstar research analyst there is a footnote on your capex slide 16 those projects grid mod plus the two big battery projects are waiting for commission approval when do you think that will occur what s the meeting date or what exactly was pending gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes so on the grid modernization i think the procedural steps of the docket have been completed and now it s under commission review we expect we d anticipate something pretty fairly relatively soon on the battery storage applications there have been i think we re relatively close to completing a procedural process in that case as well filing our current reply statements of position so those will soon be ready for commission decision making charles fishman morningstar research analyst okay so in the third quarter you had a slide and that slide has changed a little bit you were showing capex for 2019 of 400 million to 500 million and now you re at 400 million is that the timing of those two battery projects joseph viola vice president regulatory affairs yes we progressed our capex planning on a and it gets more granular it gets down to approvals scheduling permits and pretty detailed as well as prioritization i think you will see some movement in between years and periods the way we ve been thinking about it is the 400 million on a the 400 million level at a baseline is consistent with our grid mod power supply and our long term planning in which you see that kind of in the green level and we have potential upside to that based upon certain major projects and how those are scheduled and sequenced you may see at times that if a project gets delayed and pushed into a different period or year as it crosses a year or so forth but our we have a pretty consistent to achieve the requirements that we need to transform our grid to make the investments needed to integrate all of the new renewable there is a lot of base there is a lot of consistent expenditures that needs to be put through that of course all of those expenditures are subject to commission approval prior to our initiation of any other major projects included in the forecast so again over time you may see projects shift slightly new project added as they become ready for filing and approval but generally we re comfortable with our level and level of capex spend and the potential for upside to that to the 400 million level over time charles fishman morningstar research analyst okay on the dividend guidance since this is a new thing leverage guide just to make sure i understand how the board will look at it connie or greg do you think like next year at this time let s say the end of the year beginning of 2020 the board will look at what your projected core net income is or core eps is for 2020 and use a payout ratio of 60 to 65 is that the process that you envision constance lau president and chief executive officer yes charles and also of course they ll look at the results for the year for this 2019 year and they ll also be looking at in the forecast of course will be views on what potential investments we might be making including like in pacific current going forward so all of that will be the factors that they will consider at the time gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer we do as management we do view a dividend as a core part of our value proposition to our shareholders to ensure competitive access to capital overtime so we take it very seriously and as connie said we evaluated as we achieve performance fortunately we have the strength of the bank dividend and cash flow and strong performance as well as the improving profile of the utility that can underwrite a stable dividend over time charles fishman morningstar research analyst okay thank you that s it gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks charles operator our next question will come from jonathan reeder of wells fargo please go ahead jonathan garrett wells fargo analyst so just following quickly on charles capex question if the battery storage approvals are delayed or even denied do you have the opportunity greg to backfill that spend such that capex doesn t dip below the 400 million in 2019 gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer we have we do have abilities to shift and reprioritize and increase levels modestly over time but let me hand that over to tayne because she s very close to the capital planning process tayne sekimura senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so other things we re looking at we can look at is to look at our baseline capex and these are the types of projects we have in there that will contribute to our reliability and resilience of our system so we have that ability to look at spend there and what can be done so other levers to fill that void if we have changes in our capex from those major projects jonathan garrett wells fargo analyst okay so tayne it sounds like we should kind of think of the 400 million as really the floor then or pretty close to it tayne sekimura senior vice president and chief financial officer it s pretty close to roughly the 400 million range gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer there s a lot of planning in projects that are in queue that may not have been ready relative to 2019 as they manage to prioritization and the ability to manage things if something is pushed they certainly have other projects that can be looked at again it s also relative to demands for the system increasing reliability and doing the right things so we re comfortable with the 400 million level if something happened late in the process we may not be able to shift gears and bring in a new project or and accelerate things late in the year if something unexpected were to happen that delayed one of our key major projects but generally we re comfortable at the 400 million level jonathan garrett wells fargo analyst okay great and greg i wasn t entirely clear on i think it was maybe the first question about the holdco drag increasing like 0 07 in 2019 versus 2018 is that exclusively to some financing some higher interest expense that you did at the end of this year or at the end of 2018 i m sorry gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah we did as you saw we issued another we issued 100 million of debt in the fourth quarter which is incremental which also was repriced at higher levels versus our commercial paper facility so we see and we see some natural growth in our overall balance sheet year over year as the balance sheet of the consolidated company increases as well and so and then the after tax expense now we don t see the benefit of higher tax rate relative to losses so you see that increase there as well so it s a combination and then it s a combination of some natural growth in compensation and other elements at the holding company but nothing significantly above the trend or above inflation in and of itself jonathan garrett wells fargo analyst okay great thanks operator our next question will come from andrew levi of exoduspoint please go ahead gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer andy are you there operator mr levi your line is open andrew levi exoduspoint analyst sorry sorry i was muted gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer that s unusual andrew levi exoduspoint analyst very good touche how you guys doing i didn t realize it snowed there oh my god it snowed in the mountains or like constance lau president and chief executive officer yes yes up in the tops of the volcano andrew levi exoduspoint analyst that happens does that happen every year constance lau president and chief executive officer no not every year andrew levi exoduspoint analyst okay well anyway paul asked all my questions but i do actually have one last so just and someone else had brought it up just on the bank and i know we ve discussed this before but can we just talk about the tax implications of either spinning or selling the bank and also the cash implications of the company as well if you don t mind if you can t but if you can that will be great gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so andy we do as we ve discussed previously this is analysis we do regularly we talk with our board we look at all potential alternatives and how to increase shareholder value on a sustained basis overtime obviously the you have a view of the value of the bank but if you put a current multiple to its earnings it s over 1 billion or 1 2 billion area our tax basis in the bank is relatively our tax basis in the bank is relatively low i don t know that we provided that number publicly but it would be significantly inefficient from a tax perspective to do an outright sale of the bank and so we don t see as you do that and you know a separation of the bank from the consolidated company we would lose the benefits of an investment grade and high performing bank with a growing dividend on a consolidated basis which adds materially to the value of the overall consolidated company and the lack of the need to go for external equity on a regular basis as you see with many of our peers so it helps drive earnings growth material part of our credit quality and strength and the cash flow of hei so we see meaningful value there and as you separate there are other implications outside of tax consequences as we separate and have to now look at a recapitalization of the remaining company and our ability to fund ourselves as efficiently as we do on a consolidated basis so it s also the consolidated enterprise has also helped and the strength of that enterprise has also helped us pursue new investment opportunities including the creation of pacific current so there s a lot of we view it as significant and adds to our ability to execute and capture strategic value as well there s not been a point in time since i ve been in this seat and as we ve look backed overtime where separation makes sense or would increase shareholder value meaningfully on a sustained basis outside of what we considered during the merger process andrew levi exoduspoint analyst got it that was really said greg have a great weekend gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks andy constance lau president and chief executive officer thanks andy operator operator instructions the next question is a follow up from julien dumoulin smith from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi this is eric on again i just have two short follow up questions one could you discuss the drivers behind three new board appointments and specifically could you confirm if this is a replacement or an expansion of the current board constance lau president and chief executive officer so eric our nominating and corporate governance committee has actually been focusing on both board and management succession since coming out of the nextera merger and so we have been on a continual basis been sourcing and interviewing potential directors and so we have now settled on the three whose names have been in our release we re really excited about the kinds of talent and knowledge and skill sets that each one of them bring to the mix of the directors on our board and so i m happy to go through each one of them but i think if you look at the folks that we ve selected it s a wonderful combination of people who have policy experience in the whole energy area looking forward toward how does this entire industry prepare for things like climate change also in the area of sustainability which as you know with the start of our new pacific current strategy we ve been focused on that as well particularly here in hawaii it isn t only about greening the electric sector we ve been highlighted as one of the states that actually has the opportunity to help green another sector and of course that s transportation and there are very interesting nexuses between energy and ag and water and a number of areas that could be really important to helping our overall state achieve its goals and then finally we always and i think almost all companies look for great financial expertise and so that s included in this round of directors and we have not yet we ll be seeing more of that as we get closer to actually issuing our proxy but we did want to signal that these three will be joining us and as well as the fact that admiral tom fargo will also be also appointed as the vice chair of our board and finally the changeover as a part of the normal board succession to a new non gov chair eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just to confirm this is an expansion of the board right from nine to 12 directors constance lau president and chief executive officer we have not actually disclosed what the specific number will be on the board as of yet eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay got it and as a final question on my end are you still expecting to file heco rate case with the triennial cycle in june 2019 constance lau president and chief executive officer yes we are eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you have a good weekend constance lau president and chief executive officer eric that will actually be july 1 eric

financial officer and treasurer no we ve actually brought on two additional employees so now pacific current is a team of three and the one is more focused on strategy and business development and the other is more asset management and business development charles fishman morningstar research analyst i read that as a positive sign gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer

act proposed by rep kelly cassidy d chicago would protect individual decision making under the proposed legislation private health insurance companies operating in illinois would need to cover abortion procedures without implementing any restrictions or delays on the coverage this would expand a law signed by former gov bruce rauner which allowed tax dollars to be spent on abortion

should be given equal parenting time with any children of that marriage it would also require that when judges in divorce cases deviate from the standard they explain in writing why they decided one parent should have more time with the children than the other that would be a sharp departure from the current legal standard in illinois which allows judges wide discretion to assign custody and parenting time in a way that reflects the best interests of the child identity theft thirty one state attorneys general including illinois kwame raoul are advocating for tougher safeguards against identity theft in the federal trade commission s rulebook in 2017 16 7 million u s consumers were victims of identity fraud and theft totaling 16 8 billion according to a letter sent to the ftc by the

organization made up of prominent business civic and government leaders in the chicago area in addition to issuing bonds and selling assets hynes said the administration hopes to earmark a portion of

eurusd holds lows at key support as usd strength takes a pause us dollar strength has continued into another week as a strong day of price action on monday led to a push up to fresh 2019 highs pullbacks showed in the dollar on both tuesday and thursday but up to this point buyers have remained very motivated offering higher low support at prior resistance intervals on the chart around 96 68 and 97 00 next week brings a monday holiday in the united states in observance of president s day and the economic calendar is relatively light the high notes for next week s calendar are fomc meeting

how retail traders are currently trading the us dollar check out our ig client sentiment indicator next week brings a monday holiday in the us as both stock and bond markets will be closed in observance of president s day but after that the economic calendar brings fed speak for every day next week combined with the wednesday release of fomc meeting minutes from the january rate decision outside of that next week s economic calendar is rather shallow with just a handful of high impact prints the highlight of which is in the latter portion of the week when central bank heads from canada and australia offer commentary going along with japanese cpi numbers for the month of january dailyfx economic calendar high impact events for the week of february 18 2019 and on the fed speak front the below table shows the fed speakers on next week s economic calendar along with time of commentary and the targeted topic fomc speakers on the economic calendar for next week us dollar bulls face turbulence at 97 20 hold support at 97 00 all in all it s been another strong week of price action in the us dollar with the bulk of the upward advance showing in the first half of this week on monday the currency broke out to a fresh 2019 high after which a quick pullback to find support at the 96 68 level showed up but the response at that support was rather strong as dollar bulls posed another top side drive on wednesday to push up to another fresh high but since then prices have oscillated with support continuing to hold around that prior swing high and the support area around 97 00 us dollar four hour price chart for next week the big question is for how much longer might usd bulls be able to continue pushing higher before a deeper pullback shows up ahead on the charts is the 97 71 level that helped to build a double top formation in the currency in november and december a break above that level would bring the highest print in the us dollar since june of 2017 as the currency found a bit of resistance there before continuing its downward descent us dollar daily price chart eurusd holding lows in key support zone contributing to that us dollar strength has been continued weakness in the euro as political risks continue to show in the bloc spain has now become of concern and european elections coming this may have many on their seat as anti establishment parties may make a dent in the status quo of european parliament this goes along with continued slowdown in european economic data illustrated again on wednesday with the 4 2 print for euro zone industrial production in eurusd price action the pair is posing another bounce in the longer term support zone that came into play earlier this week this support zone has held the lows in the pair since november when fear was running high around the italian budget but since that swing low was set on november 8th at 1 1215 prices have been unable to break lower seeing multiple support inflections when this zone of prices had come into play eurusd eight hour price chart dow tests above confluent resistance can buyers hold the move also of note us equity indices ran into some key resistance levels this week after a firm push higher on monday a confluent resistance zone came into play on the dow jones industrial average and since then prices have spent the past few days in a range like state this resistance in the dow comes from a couple of different areas as the 88 6 retracement of the december sell off remains very near the 14 4 retracement of the post election run in the index in early friday trade buyers have made a stern topside advance above this zone bringing up the question of whether or not they can hold the line dow jones price chart usdjpy recovery continues support holds above 110 00 on the long side of the us dollar the backdrop around usdjpy remains of interest the pair came into the year screaming lower on the back of significant yen strength that appeared to be largely driven by a safe haven run but since the second day of the new year prices in the pair have largely remained in varying states of recovery last week price action in the pair had begun to build in a short term range atop intermediate term resistance focusing in on the zone from 109 67 110 00 and coming into this week bulls pushed through helping to set a fresh 2019 high in the pair as prices ran up above the 111 00 level but as discussed yesterday that theme appeared rip for a pullback and prices pushed down to the 110 30 level of support that was noted after which bulls began to make another forward push the big question at this point is whether the yesterday s retracement was enough or whether prices will need to take a deeper pause to re test support at that prior area of resistance that held for almost a full month at 109 67 110 00 usdjpy four hour price chart usd reversal strategies given the length of the current us dollar rally the prospect of a pullback can remain of interest even if just a temporary pullback in a longer term scenario of strength but given the manner with which that dollar strength has shown of recent it can be difficult to prognosticate reversal scenarios in an area like the euro or the british pound each which could continue to be beset by political woes as discussed in yesterday s webinar there could be interest around usd weakness in pairs like usd cad or usd chf in usd cad prices have held below the 1 3361 1 3385 resistance zone and a bearish trend line as taken from earlier january and february swing highs continues to show some element of resistance on intra day charts usdcad four hour price chart usdchf spends a week at resistance the week opened with a bang in the swiss franc as the currency posed a quick move of weakness that could be described as a mini flash crash but usdchf buyers were unable to test above the 1 0100 level and after pulling back to parity buyers drove right back up to resistance around the 1 0096 level which is the 78 6 retracement of the december 2016 february 2018 major move if sellers can hold this resistance through the early portion of next week this could become a scenario of interest for a deeper pullback in the recent theme of us dollar strength usdchf daily price chart chart prepared by james stanley to read more are you looking for

seven new solar plus storage projects that will deliver 262 megawatts of solar and over one gigawatt hour of storage six of them have what have been called mind blowing very low prices that make us eligible for an award under the renewable rfp pim the commission established last year these prices are lower than the cost of fossil fuel generation and reflect our innovative new purchase power agreement which gives us flexibility to dispatch energy to meet grid needs and helps reduce uncertainty for independent power producers if approved and completed on schedule by 2022 these projects

efficiency ratio to 59 4 a 220 basis point improvement over 2017 and a 550 basis point improvement since 2015 american has done this through its consistent focus on making banking easier for customers which permits the bank s culture and drives efforts to simplify and automate processes and increase the use of lower cost ways to deliver high levels of customer service american has also worked hard to lower its occupancy cost and has already reduced its non branch footprint by 52 looking ahead american is targeting annual improvement in its efficiency ratio by 100 basis points over the next

visitor arrivals were up 5 9 and expenditures were up 6 8 we did see a slight dip in the expenditures at the end of the year with a monthly 3 5 decline in december compared to the december in 2017 hawaii still maintains one of the nation s lowest unemployment rates unemployment in december was 2 5 significantly below the national rate of 3 9 hawaii real estate fundamentals remain strong while sales volumes declined from the prior year by 7 7 for single family homes and 2 5 for condos median prices continued to rise with increases on oahu of 4 6 for single family homes and 3 7 for condos while the economies rate of expansion has slowed as the business cycle has matured continued growth is still expected turning to our financial results slide six shows hei s net income for the full year and fourth quarter as connie noted earlier in 2018 we had strong consolidated financial performance with both operating companies contributing to our reported results going from left to right on this slide consolidated gaap net income for the full year was 201 8 million in 2018 relative to 165 3 million for 2017 a 22 increase as you may remember in the fourth quarter of 2017 we had 14 2 million of adjustments across the consolidated companies due to certain onetime impacts from federal tax reform after adjusting for these non core impacts 2017 core net income was 175 179 5 million there were no non core adjustments to our 2018 net income full year earnings normalized for onetime from 2017 tax reform impacts grew by 22 3 million or 12 net income grew at both the utility and bank combined with a higher holding company and other segment net loss that was primarily driven by lower tax benefits on holding company expenses due to tax reform as well as higher interest in compensation expenses partially offset by earnings contributions by pacific current fourth quarter net income was up 7 over the same quarter of last year reflecting headwinds at the utility experienced late in the year partially offset by strong q4 performance at american savings bank pacific current which is included in the holding company and other segment contributed positively to net income and operating cash flow modestly offsetting some of the holding company expenses and or investment in the new enterprise for 2018 gaap earnings per share were 1 85 compared to 1 52 in 2017 excluding one time federal tax reform impact of 0 13 per share in 2017 core earnings per share were 1 65 as core net income grew by 0 20 per share through our holding company structures and stable earnings we are able to grow a bank dividend excuse me because of growing bank dividend and practically no dilution in 2018 net income growth of 22 translated into eps growth of 22 on a gaap basis and 12 for each on a core business as shown on the right side of the slide hei s consolidated roe for 2018 was 9 5 compared to 2017 gaap roe of 7 9 and core 2017 roe of 8 6 the higher 2018 roe reflects strong earnings growth at the bank and improved earnings at the utility notably management achieved utility roe improvement despite a lower utility allowed roe after our latest rate case increases of 9 5 compared to the prior 9 8 allowed on a core basis the 50 basis point increase despite with despite a loss of 30 basis points in allowed reflects an 80 basis point net improvement turning to slide 8 utility net income was 144 million in 2018 compared to 2017 gaap net income of 120 million and core net income which excludes the one time impact of tax reform of 129 million our utility 2018 net income contributed to eps of 1 32 per share 0 01 below our utility guidance range of 1 33 to 1 46 as connie mentioned one time events in the fourth quarter including penalties on our reliability pim impacted net income late in the year and as a result utility income was lower than expected on an after tax basis the most significant net income drivers were 57 million higher net revenues from the resetting of base rates through the rate case cycle and ram and npi recovery mechanisms 5 million from our pool licensing and operating agreements with hawaii telcom resulting in attachment fees including interest and the release of reserves after the settlement of receivables from hawaii telcom 37 million of higher o m expenses compared to 2017 primarily due to the reset of pension costs for the first time in six years as part of our rate case decisions the write off of project cost incurred during the merger period related to smart grid planning and the evaluating lng imports higher cost for preventative maintenance on underground circuits to ensure reliability generating station operation and maintenance and workers compensation claims and 2 million higher net income from net tax adjustments largely related to favorable adjustments made in connection with the filing of the 2017 tax return which was partially offset by the difference between the reduction to revenue requirement to return expected tax reform benefits to customers which exceeded the actual 2018 savings realized turning to slide 9 american had record earnings for 2018 with a 23 increase in reported net income bank net income for the year was 82 5 million compared to 67 million in the prior year which included a 1 million net positive impact of tax reform excluding the impact of tax reform adjustments 2017 bank net income was 66 million as noted on our third quarter call we expected asp to come in at the high end of guidance which the bank exceeded reporting eps of 0 76 per share 0 02 above our guidance range of 0 68 to 0 74 per share strong management performance and lower tax rates contributed to a very good year the most significant after tax drivers of the increase from 2017 were 14 million higher net interest income driven by growth in as well as higher yields on interest earning assets resulting from an improved interest rate environment 3 million higher provision for loan losses reflecting additional loan loss reserves for the consumer loan portfolio the year over year increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily due to additional loan loss reserves for the consumer loan portfolio which were partially offset by releases of reserves in the commercial and commercial real estate portfolios as a result of improved credit quality and the pay off of a criticized commercial real estate construction loan in the fourth quarter of 2018 4 million lower non interest income primarily due to lower debit card interchange fees due to new accounting standard that reclassified 4 2 million of debit card expenses in 2018 to non interest income and 1 million increase in non interest expense primarily due to higher compensation and benefit expenses due to the bank s decision to increase the entry salary for employees as well as annual merit increases partially offset by the reclassification of the debit card expenses i just described turning to slide 10 american s solid profitability in 2018 showed through with both higher return on assets and increased return on equity we achieved a return on assets of 125 basis points for the fourth quarter of 2018 exceeding our third quarter return on assets of 122 basis points and or 110 basis point threshold for the year our annual average return on assets was 120 basis points for 2018 we manage our capital efficiently to optimize return on average equity while maintaining a well capitalized threshold for the bank fourth quarter of 2018 we achieved a return on average equity of just over 14 compared to 13 8 in the linked quarter for the full year 2018 achieved 13 5 return on equity 2 3 above 2017 and comparing favorably to the 2018 of peer medium of 10 3 on slide 11 american s net interest margin has continued to strengthen and continues to perform well against our high performing peers and hawaii based peers net interest margin grew by 3 83 for the full year 2018 compared to 3 69 in 2017 as well as the high end of our guidance range at 3 7 to 3 8 for the fourth quarter of 2018 net interest margin was 3 95 compared to 3 81 in the linked quarter and 3 68 in the fourth quarter of 2017 with the improvement primarily attributable to higher yields on interest earning assets and continued low cost deposits we continue to effectively grow earning assets within our loan and investments portfolios to improve net interest income net interest margin in the fourth quarter was supported by lower premium amortization within our investment portfolio normalizing our fas 91amortization to the previous quarters in 2018 our margin would ve been 3 87 for the fourth quarter our interest earning asset yields increased over the linked quarter to 4 22 we ve maintained our low cost fund our low funding costs in the rising interest rate environment and continue to benefit from our disciplined approach and focus on relationship banking our cost of funds was 28 basis points in the fourth quarter just two basis points above the linked quarter and well below that of peers on slide 12 total loans were 4 8 billion as of december 31 up 3 7 annualized from december 31 2017 with retail loans up 130 million or 3 9 reflecting americans disciplined approach toward growing the loan portfolio total deposits grew 6 2 billion at december 31 2018 an increase of 268 million or 4 6 from december 31 2017 net interest income increased 8 over the prior year to 242 7 million driven by growth in interest earning assets and the improved interest rate environment fourth quarter 2018 net interest income was also higher at 63 4 million compared to 61 1 million in the linked quarter and 57 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 non interest income for 2018 was 56 1 million compared to 61 6 million in 2017 and fourth quarter 2018 non interest income was 13 5 million compared to 15 3 million in the linked quarter and 15 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the lower non interest income for the year was primarily due to lower debit card interchange fees as a result of a new accounting standard that reclassified 4 2 million of debit card expenses in 2018 from non interest expense to non interest income on slide 13 credit quality remains sound due to prudent risk management and healthy hawaii economy the credit quality of our residential portfolio remains very strong and our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios are stable with improving trends provision for loan losses reflected additional reserves for the consumer loan portfolio partially offset by the release of reserves due to improved credit quality in other portfolios in the fourth quarter there was a significant pay off of a criticized commercial real estate construction loan which led to a lower than expected provision allowance for loan losses of 52 million was 1 08 of outstanding loans at year end compared to 1 14 in the linked quarter and 1 15 in the prior year non accrual loans as a percentage of total loans receivable held for investment was 0 056 compared to 0 59 at the end of the linked quarter and 0 51 at the end of the year our net charge off ratio increased to 34 basis points for the full year compared to 27 basis points in 2017 driven by the personal unsecured loan portfolio which remains profitable the net charge off ratio for the fourth quarter was 37 basis points versus 40 basis points for the linked quarter and 26 basis points for the fourth quarter of the prior year the improvement over the linked quarter reflects american s adjustments to the parameters of its personal unsecured loan portfolio as it seasons as well as management s strategy to improve its collections process american s asset and funding mix shown on the left side of slide 14 remains attractive relative to peers a 100 of our loan portfolio was funded with low cost core deposits versus the aggregate of our peer banks at 72 the average cost of funds was 25 basis points for the full year 2018 nearly 60 basis points better than the peer median turning to slide 15 efficiency improvement has been a key focus of management and the bank has delivered consistent results in strengthening its efficiency ratio american achieved an efficiency ratio of 59 5 for the fourth quarter of 2018 and 59 4 for the full year a meaningful improvement about 220 basis points over the prior year and compared to 2015 american s 2018 efficiency ratio was 550 basis points better efficiency remains a key focus moving forward with the bank management targeting about 100 basis points of efficiency ratio improvement per year over the next three years turning now to our expectations for future performance starting with our utility capex forecast utility modestly exceeded its 20 its revised 2018 capex target investing 411 million for the year building on that result in 2019 we forecast 400 million of capex largely driven by two battery storage projects and phase 1 of our grid modernization initiative both of which still require commission approval as well as baseline projects to improve reliability and resilience and help integrate more renewable and distributed energy in 2020 and 2021 we expect to invest between 400 million and 500 million per year capex in any given year can of course vary depending on the timeliness of puc approvals and permitting as well as community and other stakeholder engagement processes importantly with improved financial results the utility is expected to be able to self fund its forecasted capex through our 2021 planning period through retained earnings and its access to the debt capital markets on slide 17 our financing outlook for 2019 reflects our strengthened financial condition the bank which has long been self funding has increased its dividend to hei as its earnings have improved in 2018 asbs dividend to the holding company increased 33 to 50 million and in 2019 we expect the dividend to increase 20 to 60 million utility is able to self fund its investment needs for capital expenditure programs while hei will continue to ensure that the utility has sufficient access to equity capital necessary to meet its capital needs and maintain an investment grade capital structure while the improved cash distributions from the bank and utility we do not anticipate the need to issue any external equity in 2019 outside of other attractive or accretive investment opportunities not currently included in our plan in addition the improved outlook for earnings and cash flow has allowed us to grow the hei dividend while continuing to manage our capital structure and maintain our investment grade ratings turning to slide 18 we are initiating hei s 2019 consolidated earnings guidance of 1 85 to 2 05 per share consisting of 1 40 to 1 47 at the utility and 0 79 to 0 85 at the bank our 2019 utility guidance assumes no change to our major regulatory recovery mechanisms and no material impacts from performance incentive penalty from a performance incentive penalties or rewards it includes an approximately 8 million net income impact from continued customer benefit adjustments from the latest hawaiian electric and maui electric rate case decisions and a schedule detailing those customer benefit adjustments can be found in our in the appendix utility guidance also reflects management s focused on o m efficiency with o m excluding pension and onetime items that impacted 2018 projected to increase 1 or below inflation our 2019 bank guidance range reflects american s ongoing focus on efficiency and a disciplined approach to growth with continued strength in net interest margin and low to mid single digit earning asset growth note the embedded embedded in our guidance for asb is a onetime net positive impact of 0 03 to 0 05 per share in 2019 reflecting the anticipated gain on sale of two facilities the bank is selling as it relocates to its new campus offset by cost the bank will incur this year as it moves into its new space while pacific current remains an important and promising part of our overall strategy we do not expect it to contribute meaningfully to 2019 earnings given the early stage of the company and as manage as the management team further develops the platform plans and pursues new project opportunities i would note that we anticipate no new equity to be issued from hei from 2019 also a comment regarding our dividend increase our policy dividend payout range is 60 to 65 while maintaining investment grade capital structure and rating further dividend growth is subject to the board approval and in consideration with other accretive investment opportunities i ll turn it over to connie for her closing remarks constance lau president and chief executive officer thanks greg we re proud of our accomplishments in 2018 and we re optimistic about our ability to achieve even more going forward the place based strategy we ve pursued at hei continues to provide the financial resources needed to invest in the strategic growth of our company and in a sustainable future for hawaii while also supporting our dividend which the board increased this quarter by 3 2 at the utility we re making strong headway on our transformation initiatives across the company ensuring affordable reliable renewable energy remains a core focus of all of our efforts we re on track to beat the 2020 goal of 30 of electric sales from renewable sources and by 2022 we re targeting significant acceleration to 50 we re focused on delivering o m savings for customers through implementation of our new enterprise resource system which enables our one company initiative and other efficiency efforts and we continue to focus on improving the reliability and resilience of our system and modernizing our grid to enable more renewables more electric vehicles and more value for customers at the bank we start the year in a very strong financial position and are well positioned for further earnings growth american s new campus marks a new stage in its history consolidation of its non branch employees into this innovative space is expected to bring continued efficiency improvement and even more ways to continue making banking easier for customers and building deeper customer relationships at pacific current our new team will build on the foundation created with our first two projects and lead the company forward through strategy development asset optimization relationship building and pursuit of new opportunities across our enterprise we will continue to build long term value for our customers communities employees and shareholders finally before we get to q a in our release you may have seen that we are nominating three new independent directors to our board at our upcoming annual meeting as part of our plan board succession all bring extensive experience and track records of success to add to the strength of our talented board and with that we re happy now to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session operator instructions our first question today will come from julien dumoulin smith of bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst this is eric on for julien constance lau president and chief executive officer hi eric gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hi eric eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi good afternoon so first question could you comment on the latest staff proposal from staff on pbr specifically on the five year sale and the list of currently proposed performance metrics and what are you anticipate this proposal might be significantly changed constance lau president and chief executive officer yeah absolutely eric and we actually had anticipated that question and so we ve invited joe viola who is the head of our regulatory department to be with us today and so i ll turn it over to joe joseph viola vice president regulatory affairs hi eric again this is joe viola the staff proposal came out on february 7 continues to be a progression of high quality work product from our commissioned staff we believe it presents a pretty balanced approach to consideration of our regulatory framework currently we still kind of that we re really kind of still in the middle of pbr process this is the staff s proposal at the end of phase i now the parties will be providing briefs to comment on those proposals we ll submit statements of position on march 8 there will be a limited discovery period the parties will present implied statements of position on april 5 and then the commission will issue its decision on phase i after that time so we re still a little bit in the middle of the process a lot of conceptual discussion i think as commissioned recognized early in the process and we agree with the details on that matter but right now very constructive very professional report and we look forward to providing our comments in march eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and do you expect would you read the current proposal as helping on roe challenges joseph viola vice president regulatory affairs there certainly a potential for that again as the details will matter the concepts in there certainly offer an opportunity for that we re encouraged by the discussion of opportunities potentially to reduce some regulatory lag certainly the opportunities to potentially earn on some of the services we ve been traditionally providing really again a bunch of opportunities i think that could be very constructive to the utility but we ll have to see what the actual details are for the development phase ii constance lau president and chief executive officer and eric i would just eric i would just add that i think what s really important about this proposal as joe said it s very professionally done well thought through considers all of the different stakeholders in the process and particularly the customer so that s really really important thing eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and secondly would you going on to the specific trends side could you talk about the earnings contributions from the solar plus storage projects on a stand alone basis and could you further talk about the uptick in holdco drag for 2019 relative to 2018 thanks gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hi eric yeah this is greg hazelton so yes as we noted the pacific current was did have contribute earnings to the year it s modest relative overall and as you know we ve been investing in the platform through new talent establishing the office and other ongoing work that they have currently so it s moving forward it did contribute to net earnings on a pacific current basis over 0 01 per share but again that s all after investments within made internally as well as bringing as well as brining making the investments to grow the platform of bringing the management team online the other increases at the holding company were primarily interest expenses and after tax after tax the holding company realizes a loss and based on tax reform that loss falls to the bottom line at a higher level so as you noticed in the fourth quarter we did term out about 100 million of commercial paper and refunded some term debt at a higher interest rate in the current interest rate environment which contributed to our higher interest costs at the holding company eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst yes just to clarify i m referring to the five solar plus storage project announcement to second acquisition for 2019 the expectations around the earnings contribution stand alone for those if you would be able to provide any further color there gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so those are in the process of being completed and i know scott and his team have been actively managing that on a day to day basis so i think we have expectations about those the timing of bringing those online so while they re under construction most of the costs are being capitalized and you will see earnings contribution as those are brought online scott do you have anything to add scott seu senior vice president public affairs yes those projects will come online starting sometime late spring early summer though the remainder of the year the relative contribution for 2019 will be very small if not nil on a relative basis just due to the timing all five projects come online sort of sequentially with the first one targeting probably early summer eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it that s helpful and then one last question before i see to the queue would you be able to discuss potential for a tax free spin of the bank and any openness to potential sale of telco and could a forthcoming lei report change any variables around the co op effort thanks constance lau president and chief executive officer so eric we really don t comment on speculative proposals but i think as we ve always told investors this management team has always been open to evaluating all proposals that might have the potential to increase shareholder value so we ve never shied away from those kinds of analysis but i can t really comment on anything that is speculative eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it understood i ll see to the queue thank you operator the next question will come from paul patterson of glenrock associates please go ahead paul patterson glenrock associates analyst hey how s it going constance lau president and chief executive officer hi paul gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer hi paul paul patterson glenrock associates analyst so potentially you said which i think was 5 million what is the impact on 2019 and beyond of the reset gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer you mean the reset so under the rate cases we have recovery now at the current net periodic pension costs that we re incurring as you know we ve been out for a number of years and actually in the interest rate environment we were with our old rate cases we were not fully collecting on a cash basis the actual cost cash costs of those programs and the requirement to contribute to the external trust on a cash basis so we see that as so that has been cured relative to go forward basis our costs are being collected relative and on an earnings basis we really don t see an impact because the rate cases have aligned the costs of those programs with what we re reporting is does that address your question paul patterson glenrock associates analyst i think it does so i mean so you ok so and then on the slide 23 which seems like a new slide for you guys maybe not maybe i missed it before is that what you re what exactly does that represent gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer okay those are what we ve talked about in terms of the customer benefit adjustments and maybe i ll look those were concessions that were made to settle the recent rate cases that we ve been through that had now a scheduled reduction over time but i ll have tayne to speak to that directly tayne sekimura senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so paul this is tayne on the line as greg mentioned as part of our revenue requirements and what we agreed to in the rate cases as they were being worked on for hawaiian electric and maui electric these are the customer benefit adjustments and on this particular slide we did schedule it out you will notice that over time it s reduced and what we will do as the management team is we re going to manage through these amounts and attempt to find offsets to cope with these lower revenues that we got to the rate case paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay great gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer we wanted to provide clarity around these challenges as you think about 2019 and our ability to improve our achieved roe recognizing that we do have this that we will have to find ways to offset this to capture those but i think as importantly as you look out over time you see that these are reduced over time and will naturally then allow us to achieve better results all things being equal paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then following up on eric s pbr questions it seemed to me that there were two things that sort of caught my eye it is to what eric brought up which is the idea of having day one savings could you elaborate a little bit more on what the thought process is with that or what that actually might entail with day one savings and the second term that comes up is financial integrity of the utility do they have you gotten a sense when you speak with them what that actually stands for joseph viola vice president regulatory affairs hi this is joe viola first question the day one savings in the commission staff report that s where that term exists several parties in the proceeding had proposed some type of adjustment to the multiyear rate plan and the consumer advocate and i believe maybe blue planet in addition proposed a kind of immediate dividend they call it a customer dividend really what that would represent is a revenue requirement reduction from the start of any new pbr plan to represent immediate savings to customers the question earlier was on the customer benefit it s similar to that i think the commission staff report describes that as essentially a stretch goal to ensure productivity improvements above what might be represented otherwise by our productivity factor in the multiyear rate case revenue plan requirement so that s a proposal that s in the staff report and the parties including the utilities will be commenting on that in a briefing as far as the second question on the financial integrity we were certainly appreciative of the commission stands recognition of the importance of utility s financial integrity that s been the discussion in the docket since the beginning and i think what that represents is acknowledgment that actually not only did we continue to financial integrity and the help of utility is very important to achieving the state energy goals it s important to a lot of our third party power providers they rely on our financial integrity our credit rating to finance their projects so it s an express recognition of that we re certainly very appreciative of the fact that that is a recognition and has been defined as one of the guiding one of the many guiding principles to development of pbr in phase ii paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay but i guess when we re looking at these two items it seems that one i guess when we re talking about the day one savings it sounds like there could be a situation where do you think there is potential risk of how that sort of might actually impact earnings at such a if that was sort of the plan do you follow what i am saying joseph viola vice president regulatory affairs there is well to give a simple answer that there s always risk but that s just one factor that commission staff there are other factors so we will have to see how this plays out we mentioned before the details will matter is it day one savings that customer dividend proposal on the table but what s also in the commission staff report are some elements of change the regulatory mechanisms that could reduce regulatory lag from us could also provide other opportunities for us to increase revenue opportunities so it s a package proposal as we considered in context and we will be briefing that paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then just on the premium amortization that you guys mentioned for at the bank if i heard that correctly that would ve gotten you that would have lowered the net interest margin to 3 87 did i hear that correctly richard wacker president and chief executive officer yes this is rich that s correct paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and going forward what should we think about that richard wacker president and chief executive officer we think that quarter was lower than it would be on a run rate basis we think it ll the amortization will bounce back up and we don t know how much quarter to quarter but on average for the year it would be comparable to what we saw in 2018 paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then just finally on the earning guidance slide you called out the onetime 0 03 to 0 05 associated with the bank with the moving to the campus sale but is that the only one time we should be thinking about in new guidance gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes there s we have no other we ve scheduled out the customer benefit adjustments and the headwinds that are there that we ve provided full detail no other known onetime adjustments included in our forecast at this time paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay well thanks so much enjoy i hear you guys had some snow that was sounds pretty amazing but good talking to you and have a great weekend constance lau president and chief executive officer thanks paul operator our next question will come from charles fishman of morningstar research please go ahead charles fishman morningstar research analyst and i don t thank you guys i know what snow is its snowing where i am right now constance lau president and chief executive officer that s true charles charles fishman morningstar research analyst there is a footnote on your capex slide 16 those projects grid mod plus the two big battery projects are waiting for commission approval when do you think that will occur what s the meeting date or what exactly was pending gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yes so on the grid modernization i think the procedural steps of the docket have been completed and now it s under commission review we expect we d anticipate something pretty fairly relatively soon on the battery storage applications there have been i think we re relatively close to completing a procedural process in that case as well filing our current reply statements of position so those will soon be ready for commission decision making charles fishman morningstar research analyst okay so in the third quarter you had a slide and that slide has changed a little bit you were showing capex for 2019 of 400 million to 500 million and now you re at 400 million is that the timing of those two battery projects joseph viola vice president regulatory affairs yes we progressed our capex planning on a and it gets more granular it gets down to approvals scheduling permits and pretty detailed as well as prioritization i think you will see some movement in between years and periods the way we ve been thinking about it is the 400 million on a the 400 million level at a baseline is consistent with our grid mod power supply and our long term planning in which you see that kind of in the green level and we have potential upside to that based upon certain major projects and how those are scheduled and sequenced you may see at times that if a project gets delayed and pushed into a different period or year as it crosses a year or so forth but our we have a pretty consistent to achieve the requirements that we need to transform our grid to make the investments needed to integrate all of the new renewable there is a lot of base there is a lot of consistent expenditures that needs to be put through that of course all of those expenditures are subject to commission approval prior to our initiation of any other major projects included in the forecast so again over time you may see projects shift slightly new project added as they become ready for filing and approval but generally we re comfortable with our level and level of capex spend and the potential for upside to that to the 400 million level over time charles fishman morningstar research analyst okay on the dividend guidance since this is a new thing leverage guide just to make sure i understand how the board will look at it connie or greg do you think like next year at this time let s say the end of the year beginning of 2020 the board will look at what your projected core net income is or core eps is for 2020 and use a payout ratio of 60 to 65 is that the process that you envision constance lau president and chief executive officer yes charles and also of course they ll look at the results for the year for this 2019 year and they ll also be looking at in the forecast of course will be views on what potential investments we might be making including like in pacific current going forward so all of that will be the factors that they will consider at the time gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer we do as management we do view a dividend as a core part of our value proposition to our shareholders to ensure competitive access to capital overtime so we take it very seriously and as connie said we evaluated as we achieve performance fortunately we have the strength of the bank dividend and cash flow and strong performance as well as the improving profile of the utility that can underwrite a stable dividend over time charles fishman morningstar research analyst okay thank you that s it gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks charles operator our next question will come from jonathan reeder of wells fargo please go ahead jonathan garrett wells fargo analyst so just following quickly on charles capex question if the battery storage approvals are delayed or even denied do you have the opportunity greg to backfill that spend such that capex doesn t dip below the 400 million in 2019 gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer we have we do have abilities to shift and reprioritize and increase levels modestly over time but let me hand that over to tayne because she s very close to the capital planning process tayne sekimura senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah so other things we re looking at we can look at is to look at our baseline capex and these are the types of projects we have in there that will contribute to our reliability and resilience of our system so we have that ability to look at spend there and what can be done so other levers to fill that void if we have changes in our capex from those major projects jonathan garrett wells fargo analyst okay so tayne it sounds like we should kind of think of the 400 million as really the floor then or pretty close to it tayne sekimura senior vice president and chief financial officer it s pretty close to roughly the 400 million range gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer there s a lot of planning in projects that are in queue that may not have been ready relative to 2019 as they manage to prioritization and the ability to manage things if something is pushed they certainly have other projects that can be looked at again it s also relative to demands for the system increasing reliability and doing the right things so we re comfortable with the 400 million level if something happened late in the process we may not be able to shift gears and bring in a new project or and accelerate things late in the year if something unexpected were to happen that delayed one of our key major projects but generally we re comfortable at the 400 million level jonathan garrett wells fargo analyst okay great and greg i wasn t entirely clear on i think it was maybe the first question about the holdco drag increasing like 0 07 in 2019 versus 2018 is that exclusively to some financing some higher interest expense that you did at the end of this year or at the end of 2018 i m sorry gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah we did as you saw we issued another we issued 100 million of debt in the fourth quarter which is incremental which also was repriced at higher levels versus our commercial paper facility so we see and we see some natural growth in our overall balance sheet year over year as the balance sheet of the consolidated company increases as well and so and then the after tax expense now we don t see the benefit of higher tax rate relative to losses so you see that increase there as well so it s a combination and then it s a combination of some natural growth in compensation and other elements at the holding company but nothing significantly above the trend or above inflation in and of itself jonathan garrett wells fargo analyst okay great thanks operator our next question will come from andrew levi of exoduspoint please go ahead gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer andy are you there operator mr levi your line is open andrew levi exoduspoint analyst sorry sorry i was muted gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer that s unusual andrew levi exoduspoint analyst very good touche how you guys doing i didn t realize it snowed there oh my god it snowed in the mountains or like constance lau president and chief executive officer yes yes up in the tops of the volcano andrew levi exoduspoint analyst that happens does that happen every year constance lau president and chief executive officer no not every year andrew levi exoduspoint analyst okay well anyway paul asked all my questions but i do actually have one last so just and someone else had brought it up just on the bank and i know we ve discussed this before but can we just talk about the tax implications of either spinning or selling the bank and also the cash implications of the company as well if you don t mind if you can t but if you can that will be great gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer so andy we do as we ve discussed previously this is analysis we do regularly we talk with our board we look at all potential alternatives and how to increase shareholder value on a sustained basis overtime obviously the you have a view of the value of the bank but if you put a current multiple to its earnings it s over 1 billion or 1 2 billion area our tax basis in the bank is relatively our tax basis in the bank is relatively low i don t know that we provided that number publicly but it would be significantly inefficient from a tax perspective to do an outright sale of the bank and so we don t see as you do that and you know a separation of the bank from the consolidated company we would lose the benefits of an investment grade and high performing bank with a growing dividend on a consolidated basis which adds materially to the value of the overall consolidated company and the lack of the need to go for external equity on a regular basis as you see with many of our peers so it helps drive earnings growth material part of our credit quality and strength and the cash flow of hei so we see meaningful value there and as you separate there are other implications outside of tax consequences as we separate and have to now look at a recapitalization of the remaining company and our ability to fund ourselves as efficiently as we do on a consolidated basis so it s also the consolidated enterprise has also helped and the strength of that enterprise has also helped us pursue new investment opportunities including the creation of pacific current so there s a lot of we view it as significant and adds to our ability to execute and capture strategic value as well there s not been a point in time since i ve been in this seat and as we ve look backed overtime where separation makes sense or would increase shareholder value meaningfully on a sustained basis outside of what we considered during the merger process andrew levi exoduspoint analyst got it that was really said greg have a great weekend gregory hazelton executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks andy constance lau president and chief executive officer thanks andy operator operator instructions the next question is a follow up from julien dumoulin smith from bank of america merrill lynch please go ahead eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst hi this is eric on again i just have two short follow up questions one could you discuss the drivers behind three new board appointments and specifically could you confirm if this is a replacement or an expansion of the current board constance lau president and chief executive officer so eric our nominating and corporate governance committee has actually been focusing on both board and management succession since coming out of the nextera merger and so we have been on a continual basis been sourcing and interviewing potential directors and so we have now settled on the three whose names have been in our release we re really excited about the kinds of talent and knowledge and skill sets that each one of them bring to the mix of the directors on our board and so i m happy to go through each one of them but i think if you look at the folks that we ve selected it s a wonderful combination of people who have policy experience in the whole energy area looking forward toward how does this entire industry prepare for things like climate change also in the area of sustainability which as you know with the start of our new pacific current strategy we ve been focused on that as well particularly here in hawaii it isn t only about greening the electric sector we ve been highlighted as one of the states that actually has the opportunity to help green another sector and of course that s transportation and there are very interesting nexuses between energy and ag and water and a number of areas that could be really important to helping our overall state achieve its goals and then finally we always and i think almost all companies look for great financial expertise and so that s included in this round of directors and we have not yet we ll be seeing more of that as we get closer to actually issuing our proxy but we did want to signal that these three will be joining us and as well as the fact that admiral tom fargo will also be also appointed as the vice chair of our board and finally the changeover as a part of the normal board succession to a new non gov chair eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it and just to confirm this is an expansion of the board right from nine to 12 directors constance lau president and chief executive officer we have not actually disclosed what the specific number will be on the board as of yet eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay got it and as a final question on my end are you still expecting to file heco rate case with the triennial cycle in june 2019 constance lau president and chief executive officer yes we are eric bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it thank you have a good weekend constance lau president and chief executive officer eric that will actually be july 1 eric

act proposed by rep kelly cassidy d chicago would protect individual decision making under the proposed legislation private health insurance companies operating in illinois would need to cover

controversy in 2018 equal parenting time legislation state rep la shawn ford d chicago is the lead sponsor of a bill that would create a rebuttable presumption in divorce cases that both parties should be given equal parenting time with any children of that marriage it would also require that when judges in divorce cases deviate from the standard they explain in writing why they decided one parent should have more time with the children than the other that would be a sharp departure from the current legal standard in illinois which allows judges wide discretion to assign custody and parenting time in a way that reflects the best interests of the child identity theft thirty one state attorneys general including illinois kwame raoul are advocating for tougher safeguards against identity theft in the federal trade commission s rulebook in 2017 16 7 million u s consumers were victims of identity fraud and theft totaling 16 8 billion according to a letter sent to the ftc by the

by manjul paul and indradip ghosh bengaluru reuters there is a one in four chance of a u s recession in the next 12 months a scenario that should keep the federal reserve from raising interest rates next month according to a reuters poll of economists who now expect only one rate hike this year given a global economic slowdown and a dimming outlook for u s growth economists said the fed s tightening cycle will likely draw to a halt before july while financial markets have recovered from a deep sell off late last year the feb 8 14 poll of over 110 economists showed a cut to the outlook for u s economic growth and the number of fed rate hikes this year and next to get more stories like this subscribe to our newsletter the daily there is a lot of uncertainty and there are some good reasons to forecast a slowdown in 2019 as compared to in 2018 said jim o sullivan chief u s economist at high frequency economics it certainly does makes sense for the fed to take a pause on policy to see how things play out because it is not impossible for the economy to slow down in 2019 between weakening global growth tighter financial conditions and fading fiscal stimulus u s economic growth was forecast to slow and average 2 4 percent this year a downgrade from january and the lowest since april last year on wednesday u s president donald trump said trade talks with china were going along very well as the world s two biggest economies try to resolve their tariff war ahead of a march 1 deadline reuters polls in recent months have repeatedly highlighted the u s china trade war as the prominent downside risk for the american economy over half the economists who answered an extra question warned any further escalation in the trade war would bring the next u s recession that compared to about 60 percent of economists in a july 2018 poll who said the trade war did not pose a significant risk graphic reuters poll impact of u s china trade war the median probability of a recession in the next year rose to 25 percent from 20 percent in january it held at 40 percent over the next two years although the most pessimistic call was 75 percent expectations for fed s preferred inflation gauge were also slightly lowered from last month all but a couple of economists polled forecast the fed to keep rates on hold at 2 25 2 50 percent when it meets march 19 20 echoing chairman jerome powell s dovish tone however 51 of 101 economists said the bank would take the fed funds rate to 2 50 2 75 percent next quarter something over 75 percent of economists who answered an additional question said would not be a mistake the fed is very focused on slowing growth if anything the bigger risk is if the fed goes too late rather than too early said ethan harris head of global economics at bank of america merrill lynch only one hike is expected from the u s central bank this year compared with 2 hikes suggested by the u s central bank s own dot plot projections and in january s poll after next quarter s hike the fed is expected to stay on the sidelines through to the end of 2021 at least the outlook in reuters polls for u s monetary policy tightening has been gradually cut since november when the fed was expected to raise rates three times in 2019 twelve economists now expect the fed will not hike at all this year compared to just four respondents in the previous poll which lines up with the views of u s short term interest rate future traders in light of some weaker economic data and comments from fed chair powell we did see the need to scale back our forecast on fed tightening said sal guatieri senior economist at bmo capital markets inflation pressures remain very subdued a number of so called cross currents and headwinds are still important risks and until a lot of these issues are resolved it is unlikely the fed will raise interest rates we see a lengthy delay right up to december and just one final rate increase this cycle analysis by mumal rathore and nagamani lingappa polling by sujith pai and tushar goenka editing by jonathan cable and david gregorio

as wall street braces for the first quarterly decline in earnings in nearly three years some investors are wondering if the market is factoring in a bigger erosion in profit margins than will actually come to pass forecasts for us earnings after a big boost from corporate tax cuts in 2018 are falling sharply in 2019 but revenue forecasts remain relatively robust leaving an expected spike in costs as the main reason for profitability to weaken but some strategists say there is little evidence yet of such cost pressures and that margins may hold up better than expected companies since the 2008 trauma have made it a top priority to maintain and increase if possible their profit margins said ed yardeni president and chief investment strategist of yardeni research we don t expect that labour compensation and other costs will squeeze margins nor do we expect that an increase in those costs will boost prices he added rather we are betting on improving productivity besides the tightening labour market the trade war between the united states and china and the stronger us dollar are among the biggest potential risks to corporate margins this year for the first quarter analysts are forecasting a year over year s p 500 earnings decline of 0 5 per cent according to ibes data from refinitiv second quarter earnings are still expected to grow 3 5 per cent though that estimate also is down sharply from the start of the year the drop in forecasts has led to talk of a profit recession defined as at least two consecutive quarters of year over year earnings declines the last us profit recession ran from july 2015 through june of 2016 projected revenue for s p 500 companies has been more resilient with first quarter revenue growth estimated at 5 3 per cent based on refinitiv s data credit suisse strategists said profit margins are holding up better than the estimates suggest at least for the majority of s p 500 companies they said profit margins are eroding sharply for several heavily weighted companies including apple exxon mobil and chipmakers like micron technology which are skewing data for the entire s p benchmark index a recent drop in oil prices has hurt margins for energy companies a slowdown in the semiconductor business cycle has hit companies in that space and other firms have boosted investment expenses said patrick palfrey senior equity strategist at credit suisse securities in new york it s not a broad based macro issue he said when you look at the median company we see margins quite stable moreover worries that a tight labour market will drive up wages have been limited in earnings calls for the fourth quarter reporting period which is nearing an end goldman sachs strategists wrote in a note on wednesday that while some companies are feeling the pressures of rising wages more consumer facing companies including discover financial services viewed the trend as a positive for consumer spending also they wrote most management teams expected growth in the us economy to moderate but remain positive while the labour market has been tightening other measures of inflation have not moved much in the 12 months through january the us consumer price index rose 1 6 per cent the smallest gain since june 2017 according to us data released on wednesday though slower than 2018 us economic growth was forecast to average 2 4 per cent this year according to a reuters poll of economists
why joblessness is such a huge problem in africa s most populous nation africa s most populous nation and largest economy has a youth unemployment problem in nigeria nearly a quarter of the population is out of work and 20 percent is underemployed for young people aged 15 to 35 the figures are grim 55 4 percent of them are without work creating jobs has been one of the key issues discussed throughout this year s election campaign being young in nigeria is very challenging explains andrew nevin advisory partner and chief economist at pwc nigeria graduates from university have a great deal of difficulty in getting established people that didn t go to university who should be getting vocational training are not getting it they re not getting into formal employment given the scale of nigeria it s a challenge not just for nigeria but for africa and the whole world there are systemic problems behind unemployment nevin points out oil over the last 30 years in this country has meant people have taken their eye off other industries there s a lack of diversification that we have the good news is that everyone recognises it and they recognise it s a crisis people are discussing youth unemployment the need for youth to be employed to have something gainful to do unless africa trades with africa and unless africa invests in africa we re going to continue to be poor by andrew nevin advisory partner chief economist pwc nigeria structural problems remain here the government hasn t tackled issues around the exchange rate policy or the oil subsidy so all of these issues are holding back investment and growth in nigeria in order for nigeria to grow faster the country needs more investment according to nevin the most important thing is we need the private sector to grow in the next decade 10 15 times larger to really make a dent in unemployment and poverty in nigeria and that means every sector the biggest sector that needs to grow in nigeria is real estate everyone needs a place to live and we have a deficit of 17 million homes and the great thing about real estate is that it employs a lot of people particularly carpenters plumbers labourers so it really absorbs that young population africans are going to continue to be poor unless africans trade with africans and increase the value added we re very strong proponents of the african continental free trade agreement afcfta it s obvious that if we re just exporting raw materials to europe or asia that we re going to continue to be in poverty in africa so i think people have recognised that and i think the speed at which the afcfta agreement has come together is really astonishing it illustrates there s a sense of a pan africanism that s coming and the leaders of that recognise that unless africa trades with africa and unless africa invests in africa we re going to continue to be poor also on this episode of counting the cost airbus a380 production of the world s largest passenger jet is to end as a result of falling orders aircraft manufacturer airbus has announced plans to stop making the a380 in two years time threatening thousands of jobs as natacha butler reports from toulouse the a380 is a superb plane it s technologically brilliant but it s an expensive plane both to build and also to fly because it uses a lot of fuel according to david bailey professor of industrial strategy at aston university in birmingham we ve seen a growth in mid range planes which are much cheaper to fly so airlines have tended to prefer those instead the a380 isn t selling as much and it s not profitable the plane will be in service for many years to come on big trunk routes like major hubs in the middle east but going forward they re not looking to expand their fleets and they won t be looking to replace them so we ll still see them for many years but simply not on the scale that airbus had imagined when they invested very very heavily in developing this enormous aeroplane says bailey turkey s ghost estates unfinished houses empty high rises and row upon row of homes fit for royalty have all become symbols of turkey s struggling economy construction has been the turbine behind the country s growth but high inflation and a devalued currency are threatening to make the industry go from boom to bust as stefanie dekker reports from mudurnu thailand fishing thailand is one of the world s largest exporters of fish but its industry has faced accusations of human trafficking and abuse two very different movies at berlin s film festival are highlighting the problem in an attempt to make us think more about the food we eat as nadim baba reports from berlin venezuela oil the united states s decision to sanction venezuela s oil assets two weeks ago was a move designed to keep oil revenues out of president nicolas maduro s hands but he s been fighting back by stepping up efforts to keep state run oil company pdvsa and its subsidiaries out of his rivals hands as lucia newman reports from caracas

useful information for investors it should not be considered a substitute for gaap nor should they be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of non gaap to gaap results is included in todayâ s financial results press release with that said iâ d like to turn the call over to joe sardano joe joe sardano thank you kim and happy valentineâ s day to everyone since the beginning of sensus weâ ve had a track record of double digit growth we are thrilled that sensus continues to keep up the momentum since our ipo in june of 2016 with our 11th consecutive quarter of double digit year over year revenue growth more specifically our fourth quarter revenues increased by 25 and reached an all time high of 8 1 million in addition we are very pleased that sensus consistently achieves our short and long term business product goals we expect to continue to build on these achievements throughout 2019 we shipped 27 systems during the quarter 15 of them were our premium excuse me premium srt 100 visions recall that these systems have enhanced capabilities such as image guidance treatment planning software and comprehensive enterprise integration as a point of pride we shipped our 100th vision system during q4 and our global installed base is now approaching 400 units in august of 2018 sensus received fda 510 k clearance to market our new srt 100 which adds several innovative features to our srt 100 product for the treatment of non melanoma skin cancer and keloids including an expanded energy range for customized more precise treatment we shipped three of these systems during the quarter including two to plastic surgeons who installed the unit specifically for use in treating keloid scars i pointed out in the past that the keloid market is a very important one for us and one where we can have an enormous impact on patientsâ lives we expect continued interest in our srt systems for the treatment of keloids on the heels of a peer reviewed paper published in the november issue of skin journal of cutaneous medicine the paper noted a recurrence rate of only 3 among keloidectomy patients treated post operatively with srt compared with a reported recurrence rate of approximately 71 following keloidectomy without use of srt this is a major breakthrough for patients worldwide who have keloids we have now trained over 100 facilities who have srt technology on how to treat keloids during the fourth quarter we also shipped two srt 100 units to a two site physician practice in china clearly this reflects demand for our products despite the current geopolitical uncertainty between the us and china and chinaâ s economic environment china has the worldâ s highest incidence of post surgical keloid scar formation and we are pleased to be furthering our efforts to eliminate the suffering of millions of people with this condition in that country while tariffs may have an impact on product demand i believe the srt 100 largely transcends that issue as it provides such an important medical solution still the bulk of our customers are using srt for the treatment of non melanoma skin cancer and we continue to build supportive evidence for its success just this week a few retrospective studies were published in the february issue of the journal of drugs in dermatology that study showed a high cure rates exceeding 97 among patients with a mean age of 82 5 and treated with srt 100 for basal and squamous cell carcinomas on the lower extremities surgery in this area presents many challenges relating to the healing process and srt is a wonderful option for those patients in that situation we continue to support our sales organization with a full range of marketing activities and the first quarter is actually quite robust for us in this regard just last week we were at the 17th annual south beach symposium in miami where we generated many new sales leads and we have already begun to follow up with them our presence there extended from our booth beyond to the trade show floor to include sponsorship to the keynote address of the president of the american medical association dr barbara mcaneny who by the way is a customer of ours with an srt 100 vision product we delivered a state of healthcare presentation in addition dr mark nestor ensured the symposium delivered an introductory presentation on superficial radiation therapy while dr clay cockerell dr michael gold dr william roth and dr david goldberg each delivered talks related to treatment of non melanoma skin cancer with srt these physicians are some of the top kols in the industry and are internationally recognized i also participated in the ceo panel that dealt with industry partnerships between manufacturers and physicians weâ re looking forward to reinforcing our presence in the dermatology field with our attendance at the american academy of dermatology annual meeting next month in washington dc as well as the annual meeting of the american college of radiation oncology later in the year during which we will feature our intraoperative radiation therapy product sculptura turning to sculptura we continue to spend significantly on r d in the fourth quarter however less than the prior year following a months long process of addressing all fda questions we are hopeful this system will be cleared for sale in the coming weeks in preparation for launch we manufactured several units to be used in key research institutions with whom we are in discussion we also completed an expansion of our oncology sales force by hiring four experienced territory managers that have already started january 1 we shipped the unit in december to the perelman center for advanced medicine at the university of pennsylvania and expect this prestigious medical center will provide us with additional supportive data for the market we expect our sculptura system which features key technological advances and carries a list price of 1 5 million will play an important role in the growth of sensus in the coming years weâ ve also begun research studies for psoriasis and eczema which are ongoing and the results are expected to form the basis for marketing to physicians for both the srt 100 vision and the srt 100 as a reminder these studies are being conducted at sites in austin and tallahassee and results are expected to be published towards the end of 2019 i want to briefly address the topic of reimbursement as most of you know the centers for medicare medicaid services or cms has stated that the main srt cpt code 77401 is mostly undervalued unfortunately cms took no action in december â november with respect to the main code cms did however issue a clarification that permits evaluation and management codes or e m codes to be reimbursed previously some of the administrative contractors were erroneously not allowing e m reimbursement we estimate that the effect of assuring this reimbursement is providing physicians access to approximately 1 000 per patient for the episode of care with srt treatment cms has indicated it will review our cpt code 77401 as early as 2020 but no later than 2021 why we would like this code to have been revalued for the benefit of our physician customers we note that srt is still a very lucrative procedure for our physicians before i turn the call over to arthur levine our cfo for more detailed discussion of our financial results iâ d like to touch on our multiple achievements during 2019 the fourth quarter capped an excellent and active year during which we increased revenues by 28 to 26 4 million we raised almost 16 million in net proceeds in an underwritten offering of common stock we opened a new subsidiary in israel for r d and to serve as the sales base for europe and the middle east and received multiple of us and overseas regulatory clearances for our products we strengthened our management team with new hires in sales marketing and clinical development and engaged additional international distributors we have an active plan for 2019 including the commercial launch of our sculptura system increasing awareness for the use of srt in keloid treatment and prevention and signing additional distributors outside the us and introducing cutting edge lasers now iâ d like to turn the call over to arthur arthur levine thank you arthur levine thanks joe itâ s a pleasure to be speaking with all of you today as joe mentioned revenues for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased 25 versus the prior year to 8 1 million the increase is attributable to a greater number of units being sold in particular the srt 100 vision which has an average â a higher average selling price than the srt 100 we expect continued double digit revenue growth in 2019 gross profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 4 9 million or 60 2 of revenues and this compares with 4 3 million or 66 7 of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease in gross margin was mainly due to product mix we expect that our margins in 2019 will be in the low to mid 60â s and they could vary from quarter to quarter from changes in the mix selling and marketing expense was 2 4 million compared to 2 1 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 the increase was primarily due to higher commission expense directly related to the increase in sales selling and marketing expense will continue to increase in 2019 from additional hiring of sales reps higher commissions as our sales increased and marketing activities in support of our sculptura launch our sales and marketing expense for the first quarter of 2019 will be somewhat higher than in the subsequent quarters due to the timing of two large trade shows in february and march general and administrative expense was 1 million modestly higher than the 0 9 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 our research and development expenses were lower in the fourth quarter of 2018 at 1 5 million compared with 1 7 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 the decrease was due to higher expenses in the 2017 fourth quarter associated with the initial submission of our 510 k application to the fda for the sculptura product we expect research and development expenses to be slightly lower although still significant in 2019 as we complete the ramp up to production and add more features to the sculptura based on feedback from luminary sites we will also be developing new lasers net income for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 1 million or 0 01 per diluted share and this compares favorably with a net loss of 0 4 million or a loss of 0 03 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2018 was a positive 0 4 million compared with a negative 0 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and stock compensation expense the positive adjusted ebitda and net income for the quarter reflect attention to expense control at the same time that our revenues have been growing iâ ll turn briefly to the financial results for the year ended december 31 2018 revenues for 2018 increased 28 to 26 4 million compared with 20 6 million for 2017 gross profit for the year was 16 9 million or 64 of revenue compared with 13 8 million or 67 of revenue for 2017 selling and marketing expense was 8 5 million for 2018 compared with 8 3 million for 2017 general administrative expense was 4 1 million for 2018 compared with 3 7 million for 2017 g a expense for 2018 includes 0 4 million and stock compensation expense related to grants made during the first quarter research and development expense for 2018 was 6 3 million compared with 5 5 million for 2017 the net loss for 2018 was 2 0 million or a loss of 0 14 per share compared with a net loss of 3 7 million or 0 28 per share for 2017 adjusted ebitda for 2018 was negative 0 4 million compared with a negative 2 9 million for 2017 our balance sheet continues to be healthy with cash and investments of 15 4 million as of the end of 2018 this compares with 11 2 million as of the end of 2017 recall that during the third quarter of 2018 we raised 15 9 million in net proceeds from an underwritten public offering of common stock and we repay outstanding borrowings on our revolving line of credit we continue to have no long term debt the 5 million credit facility is still unused and available to us with that iâ ll turn the call back over to joe joe sardano thanks arthur looking ahead to 2019 we continue to be excited about our prospects and the growing awareness for srt in the treatment of non melanoma skin cancer and keloids and as you know this is a large market with some 14 000 dermatology practices and 1 000 more surgery practices in the us not to mention the further 6 500 plastic surgeons 5 500 radiation oncologists and despite our steady growth we still have a ways to go to penetrate this large market we expect 2019 to be another exciting year as we develop cutting edge lasers at our facility in israel and weâ re hopeful that sculptura will receive fda 510 k shortly and awareness for our srt systems and their value proposition continues to grow so with those comments operator weâ re ready to take questions question and answer session operator the first question comes from alex nowak with craig hallum capital group please go ahead alex nowak hey joe hey arthur good afternoon everyone i understand you are not giving â hey i understand youâ re not giving official guidance to date but when you look at the funnels and the sales potential is going into 2019 where do you want to end 2019 up for srt 100 placements and then same question for sculptura although we know itâ s not yet approved there so you probably donâ t have as much visibility as it might joe sardano well thanks for the question and thanks for being on the call today we want to continue in the same path that we have in the last four five years actually since the inception of the company weâ ve continued to grow at a 25 to 40 rate we think that we can continue to grow at that 25 rate so i would have to say that looking to the future and where we want to be in 2019 ultimately we want to continue to grow in the same way that weâ ve grown in the history and we certainly want to have a profitable year in 2019 alex nowak yes understood and then regarding sculptura joe sardano regarding sculptura â yes regarding sculptura as we â until we are able to get fda clearance we canâ t commercialize the product but as iâ ve said before we are working with four to five centers of excellence that are â that we have exchange paperwork with that are looking to acquire the system and weâ re very anxious to get those running now the first that we shipped before the end of 2018 was upenn at their perelman cancer institute itâ s in the top 10 in the country weâ re very very excited to be able to have the opportunity to work with them i can also tell you that theyâ re very excited to have the opportunity to work with us and with this phenomenal device so we expect this to turn into a very long term relationship that will continue to develop dividends for the company for long time to come and we expect to add to that that stable if you will of expertise and luminaries that are going to continue to deliver for us on a regular basis and more importantly for the patients who are going to require this kind of treatment alex nowak thatâ s great and again congrats on the placement to upenn great staying on sculptura real quick you mentioned the fda did had some questions on sculptura could you provide some more color on the general focus of those questions what were they requesting what additional data do they want to see et cetera joe sardano iâ m not going to get into the details but iâ ll say this i think weâ re all aware that the fda and the 510 k process is going through a change theyâ re going through a conversion and how theyâ re looking at these things versus how they did it in the past and weâ ve worked very very well and very closely with the people at the fda as they are beginning to discover what those new routines and processes are from within and as they explained with us weâ ve been very very good and working with them in collaboration with them in providing the data i can safely say that they have all of the data that theyâ ve asked for and require at this time they have not required any other data they say that this is all they need so now itâ s just a matter of time and weâ re waiting for them to provide us with the approvals which we believe will come within the coming weeks alex nowak okay understood and then just last question from me you mentioned that cms in the 2019 physician fee schedule said that some of the max were not correctly paying for 77401 in addition to those e m codes and now in 2019 all the max should be correctly paying for both codes at once so i guess really two questions about that one how many of the seven max were not paying for both the srt procedures and then the e m code at the same time and then second question is itâ s only really two months since the change but are you starting to see increased interest from physicians within those geographies that the max worth paying the extra 1 000 joe sardano yes let me just clarify a little bit of it the issue between e m codes and 77401 are totally separate and totally different so first letâ s address the e m codes the e m codes were not being reimbursed by i would say six out of the seven max the one in florida was reimbursing for the rest of the country pretty much was in denial we feel that thatâ s going to make a difference because especially after going through the south beach symposium and again through the american academy of dermatology meetings those things are going to be made very very clear to the physicians and as far as we know cms has handed down those mandates to the various max so that they can begin to reimburse e m codes so the doctors are very aggressive making sure that theyâ re doing all the documentation properly so that they can get reimbursement so as far as we know with there being reimbursed as we speak but iâ m sure over time weâ re going to hear various incidences here and there where there might be some glitches in their computers because it does take some time before that stuff flows downhill but we expect it to go smoothly and everything should be fine there regarding 77401 again we have to repeat that it has been recognized by cms that it is an undervalued code that it needs to be revalued and we continue to pursue cms we continue to pursue the agencies the societies so that they can revalue these codes at the appropriate levels and we try to make that as efficient and as quickly as we possibly can weâ ve been working at this since 2014 i donâ t expect that itâ s going to be overnight but they didnâ t make the incident â they did make it very very clear that they are hoping to do it by 2020 but worst case it will be 2021 either case we should exercise and we should see an increase in that code sometime between now and 2021 hoping 2020 is the number alex nowak understood thatâ s great to hear congrats on the good quarter and a great year joe sardano thank you very much appreciate it alex operator the next question comes from andrew dâ silva with b riley fbr please go ahead andrew dâ silva good afternoon thanks for taking my questions good job this quarter just a couple of quick bookkeeping ones first if you could just let me know what cash flow from operations and capex was for the quarter or the year that â year is actually fine and while youâ re pulling that were you able to ship any lasers during the quarter and then maybe just discuss how you see laser market evolving in 2019 versus 2018 joe sardano while arthur is pulling those numbers let me go over the lasers i think that our strategy for the lasers continues to evolve and i think one of the exciting things for us is the fact that the development of the new lasers for what i would call sensus labeled lasers is moving a lot faster with the development and with the office that we have in israel that we first anticipated so we feel that prior to the end of this year we will be able to submit units a brand new family of laser units to the fda and receive fda clearance hopefully before the end of the year in order to bring those products to market so i think that weâ re really encouraged and weâ re very very excited for the development thatâ s happened over there again much faster than we anticipated and we think that thatâ s going to allow us to come to market with our own lasers right off the bat and with what we call premium lasers that will hopefully impact the market a lot better than a lot of people have anticipated arthur levine okay and our cash used in operations for the q4 was approximately 1 6 million and our capex for the quarter was around 150 000 thatâ s much less of a cash burn in the fourth quarter compared to a year to date q3 for the average for the first three quarters and the capex in q4 was also lower than in q3 andrew dâ silva great great perfect yes that just helps with my modeling process thank you and then just a couple expansion questions congrats on getting those two systems placed in china but could you give a little bit color on how mexico and china are developing this year last year you somewhat impacted probably by the trade issues in both countries and iâ m figuring that starting to work this stuff out a little bit at this point so maybe just what are you hearing from your partners and maybe some expectations from the regions if you could joe sardano well weâ re seeing still a lot of interest in china for the products i think that the trade situations have slowed the process down but i think that weâ re there to help our distributor find a way to get these products to their markets and i think weâ re going to see â i think weâ re going to see better results in 2019 versus 2018 and weâ re excited for those opportunities because thereâ s been kind of a road block if you will but weâ re working very very closely with our partners to clear that road block regardless and get the units to the public because itâ s in dire need over there these keloids are tragic theyâ re terrible and they grow every day and theyâ re creating more keloids so weâ re trying to help them get this product to market to slow that growth down over there and weâ re working on all kinds of ways to make that happen and i think thatâ s the reason why it was the first flush if you will of getting those two units sent over there in december they were absolutely desperate and i think weâ re seeing the same thing in q1 and q2 for this year so i think thatâ ll continue to grow as far as mexico goes weâ re being very very cautious with mexico we want to make sure that we have the right distribution partner and so weâ re slowly working on developing a list of major distributors who can help us in various parts of the country and weâ re also trying to build the markets to create awareness so that weâ re involved in a lot of meetings there were quite a few people from mexico at the meeting in the south beach and we know that thereâ s going to be hundreds more at the american academy of dermatology and we have meeting set up to see what we can do to penetrate that market but we want to do it right and i think that weâ ll see some breakthroughs in 2019 as well andrew dâ silva okay perfect and this iâ m not sure if youâ ve got this cms i guess inadvertently posted in internal memo related to bundled payments for just radiation therapy in general it seems to be going more and more to that value based episode based model how do you think that kind of bodes for sculptura in the marketplace and if you havenâ t seen that thatâ s fine you donâ t need to dealt too deeply into it joe sardano no listen i think weâ ve known of the potential for bundling for payments over the last several years and the lean away from volume based healthcare to quality based healthcare weâ ve known this for the last 10 years it was a program that quite frankly was put into effect in the law that was disguised under drugs if you will back in 2003 and the maturities by 2024 so the technology that we have is right on target with the quality healthcare when you think of its cost effectiveness and the quality to the patients without having any of the collateral damage of the existing technologies that weâ re up against have today our technology is phenomenal for all of these â meeting these metrics is that the government is trying to achieve and that healthcare is trying to achieve so weâ re very excited for what our technology provides andrew dâ silva okay perfect and last question just related to the srt 100 maybe just a little bit of color on how the market is viewing that now that you started to sell in and then how do you see the niches evolving over time between the 100 and the 100 in your p l joe sardano yes the 100 is always going to be a standard for us because thereâ s a lot of doctors that just like that technology itâ s excellent technology and it provides great service to our customers at the low end of the spectrum â of the pricing spectrum the srt 100 out of the three systems that we shipped two where shipped directly to surgeons plastic surgeons who are going to use it specifically to treat keloids so i think that this is a great sign to see an adaption from plastic surgeons who want to treat keloids and just as an anecdote although i mentioned in our text we have over 100 facilities now that are train to treat keloids you have to remember that from three years ago after we got fda clearance when there was none this is a very very positive outcome for us with over 100 facilities now wanting to treat keloids and are actively pursuing keloid patients and treating them and the paper that was just produced that was headed up by dr berman university of miami of the 297 patients with a 3 recurrence rate following three years of follow up with these patients i mean this is remarkable this is a cure for these patients where they had no hope whatsoever before because the best numbers of all showed best case 71 recurrence rates now weâ re showing 3 recurrence rates thatâ s a major in this department so we get more and more emails every day from people who suffer from keloids and you can literally cry when you read these notes from these folks and how desperate they are to find a way and how debilitating keloids are in their lives as far as their personality their characteristic their confidence all of these things that impact and so this is a wonderful story that weâ re developing and i think itâ s going to develop for a long time to come andrew dâ silva joe arthur thank you so much for the time and good luck going forward this year joe sardano thank you appreciate it andy operator the next question comes from anthony vendetti with maxim group please go ahead anthony vendetti thanks good afternoon guys hi guys just on the sculptura product the iort product the shut down by the government did that push things out a little bit or was it just the questions and like you said the changes that the fda is undergoing regarding the 510 k process joe sardano you know what anthony i donâ t think there was any question that there was a slowdown we saw the response of this wasnâ t as it was in the previous couple of months so i think that there was an impact but we canâ t complain because where weâ re at right now required a lot of work and put us exactly where we need to be and i think the fda has everything that they need they have everything that theyâ ve asked us for and i think that weâ re going to continue to develop great relationships and i expect approval and clearance at some point in the very near future within weeks anthony vendetti okay and then on the cfda clearance you said you sold two srt 100â s into china so is that officially cleared in there in china right now joe sardano yes no we had clearance for srt 100 for three indications quite frankly we have the product has the cfda clearance which is the srt 100 we have clearance for skin cancer and we have clearance for keloids anthony vendetti okay great and then on the system so 15 and 27 were vision one was the sculptura were the others the srt 100 or were there some aesthetic lasers joe sardano iâ ll let arthur talk the mix of products that were shipped arthur levine yes 15 were visions one was the sculptura as you mentioned and 11 srt 100â s and pluses anthony vendetti okay and then on the sales force update the number of reps that you ended 2018 with is that pretty much what you need and then you mentioned you hired four for the iort is that where the additions are coming and are you okay with the number of reps that you entered 2018 with for the record of the business joe sardano i think yes no i think that we have the total now of six people on the oncology area we have the total of 20 on the dermatology side and i think weâ re going to add four to six new people on the dermatology side we think that we got what we need for the oncology space which is six and then if we add four more people on the dermatology side that will give us 24 there for a total of 30 anthony vendetti okay great and then i thought i heard you say joe that youâ re expecting some new lasers to come out and you expect to apply for 510 k approval on the aesthetic side so by the end of the year from israel is that correct joe sardano thatâ s correct anthony vendetti okay and then just lastly arthur i just wanted to verify that you said r d even though you still have some projects in there should be down slightly overall in 2019 in terms of dollar amount versus what you finished 2018 with is that right arthur levine correct anthony vendetti okay good all right iâ ll hop back in the queue thanks guys joe sardano thank you operator the next question comes from ben haynor with alliance global partners please go ahead joe sardano hey ben ben haynor hey good afternoon guys just one quick one from me was wondering about the feedback that youâ ve received on sculptura so far for example there is the one you shipped to upenn i guess whatâ s your sense of what was the key selling point there any color you could provide will be good joe sardano i think we â i was present for the first presentation that we made on the product and i think that the feedback from the department was very quick and precise in that at the end of the meeting they said they wanted to go through this not only did they want to go through it but they wanted to be the first ones in the world to have it and they said their motion is in place from there administration to try to get this done as quickly as possible so negotiations went very very quickly we were very happy to have such a prestigious facility wanting to work with us in developing the product we have key features in the product that weâ re extremely important to them in treating patients and they feel that they can help us expand the indications that we originally thought we had into three or four other indications which they feel is very very important now itâ s difficult without fda clearance to be talking commercially about the product and since weâ re a short period away from having that and before we can get into that i would prefer to wait until after that happen so that weâ re not in any violation of talking about the product commercially but i can assure you that not only are they seeing it but hopefully within the coming weeks weâ ll be able to announce some other deliveries and installations with other luminary accounts that are going to be big names for us and big names for the market as well but clearly robotics is something thatâ s extremely helpful the type of radiation that we deliver is extremely helpful the precision with which we can sculpt the beams are very very helpful these are all key new features that have not existed in the market before that is getting everybody excited ben haynor great thanks for the color guys joe sardano hey thank you ben operator the next question comes from scott henry with roth capital please go ahead scott henry thank you good afternoon and joe sardano hey scott how are you scott henry iâ m doing well just a couple of questions first with regards to sculptura did you book any revenues in 4q or will that be deferred out how should we think about that line item in the revenue model arthur levine okay hi scott yes we booked in revenue in q4 and we were able to do that because university of pennsylvania is using the sculptura for research purposes and unlike a commercial entity there will be no issue related to the revenue recognition itâ s delivered we have all the paperwork in place and this has been discussed with our auditors so we are â yes we included in revenue for q4 scott henry and how should we think about the net price on that given that it was a research does that typically carry a higher discount just trying to think about how we should think about pricing as far as how much color you want to give at this point in time operator pardon me this is the conference operator it appears our speakerâ s line has disconnected iâ m going to put you back on hold yes can you hear me scott henry i can hear you operator yes the speakerâ s lines is disconnect yes the speakers line its appear to have disconnected iâ m going to put you on hold until we can get them reconnected one moment please joe sardano hello operator okay our speakers have rejoined the call scott henry okay joe sardano sorry guys we had some kind of a power surge here and we got cut off sorry about that scott henry no problem joe what i was asking was with regards to the amount of revenue that you booked in q4 should we think of that as a higher discount because it was more of a research placement or any color that you could provide for that revenue line would be great joe sardano yes and as i mentioned in previous conference calls that we were building four to five units before the end of the year because we had started communication and negotiation with four to five centers that wanted the system they were going to be booked at a much lower rate because of the relationship that we were developing with them and since it was the initial installations of these units itâ s just the way it goes in most areas when introduce product like this so they are probably half of what the average selling price is we were looking at a list price of 1 5 million on these products weâ re looking at an average selling price that should be with about a 20 discount which puts us at about 1 150 million and so youâ re looking at maybe half of that number is what we are booking for these products to go in on the initial stages with these four to five accounts after that all the phases will be in the 1 million plus number range scott henry great i appreciate that color and then joe sardano also to let you know scott all of these facilities are luminary teaching facilities they are installing these units under an irb investigational review board they will be able to charge patients who are treated on these systems by having the patient sign off on these units under the irb and they are covered for reimbursement under the irb so theyâ re looking at getting this paid for as well scott henry okay great and then when looking at the srt how we â was pricing relatively stable from q3 to q4 as we model that in joe sardano the pricing on all of the new â the systems were all in the 64 to 65 margin range so we were consistent on that where we lost some margin is number one i will tell you that we cooperated very strongly with the people in china to help them overcome some of the deficit of a 25 charge on tariffs in order to get product to the patients that needed it we also since weâ ve upgraded some of our products srt 100 to srt 100 visions we do have some upgrade products that weâ ve been able to hold the margins on as well but as you can imagine a used system that is being resold is not going to be at the same margin as a brand new system and then of course the margins on the sculptura units and the once sculptura unit impacted the margin as well but overall in all of the brand new products that we sell out the door that still have that 64 65 66 margin range but the used the units from to china and sculptura lowered our margins a little bit during the fourth quarter scott henry okay great final question just did you give service contract revenue for the quarter joe sardano service contract revenue has been consistent throughout anywhere between 10 and 12 i would say letâ s go to the lower side of about 10 because we did install quite a few units in the third and fourth quarter they usually have a one year warranty on it so the service contracts donâ t kick in until next year scott henry okay great thank you for taking the question joe sardano no thank you operator the next question comes from yi chen from h c wainwright please go ahead joe sardano yi how are you yi chen good thank you for taking my questions my first question is looking at the number of systems shipped in 2018 it appears that the third quarter has the lowest number and first quarter has the highest number do you expect that pattern to repeat in 2019 and also in terms of product mix between 100 vision and 100 do you think the fourth quarter product mix could represent what we expect to see in 2019 which is led â the most number goes to one vision than 100 and then 100 joe sardano yes i think that youâ re seeing the trends now i will tell you for that for the last ever since weâ ve been in business the third quarter has always been less the least amount of production out of all the four quarters and the fourth quarter has always been the highest production out of all the four quarters and if youâ re involved in healthcare youâ ll see that thatâ s pretty much dominant throughout the healthcare space especially in medical devices now in our case weâ ve experienced a lower trend in the third quarter because many of our doctors who are single practitioners many of them run practices even though might be multiple physician practices they all have families their kids are out of school and a lot of them take vacations from july all the way through until they come back on labor day weekend and then two or three weeks left in the quarter not much of a left in the quarter for them to make a lot of decision so thatâ s pretty much most of these decision makers are not available because theyâ re usually on vacation with their families during that time and then the fourth quarter seems to be picking up a lot because a lot of the doctors want to take advantage of perhaps some tax advantages by spending some money at that time and they find as a great time to make a decision so a lot of them do so q4 is always going to be our best number and q3 is always going to probably be our worst so this past quarter however this past third quarter the third quarter was a pretty good quarter we were surprised with how effective our sales organization was we addressed that at the beginning of the year and i think that we were able to manage our way through it where we saw good results in every one of the quarters that we had including the fourth quarter and then i think that we will see that continue in 2019 i think itâ ll be the same in 2020 just as it was in â 14 2015 â 16 and â 17 yi chen in terms of product mix do you think the fourth quarter number is representative of what we can expect to see going forward joe sardano weâ re hoping that it is because we want to lead with our lead product all the time itâ s our â when we comes to srt the vision product clearly has all of the features all of the benefits that have tremendous opportunities for the physicians and in providing better treatments for their patients as well as opportunities for additional income and so weâ ll see more iort products hopefully in 2019 as well which will also have the major impact on our revenue as well so as we start talking to hospitals as we start becoming commercially available after fda clearance we hope to see a lot more hospitals being able to put this device in their budgets and hopefully theyâ ll be able to get approval within their own organizations to buy these products yi chen got it my second question is related to the sculptura assistant so just to clarify this is the same system as original system called salu app right itâ s the same one joe sardano correct yi chen once itâ s commercially launched how much impact we can expect to see on the sales and marketing line joe sardano well that is hard to predict in the first couple of years but i think that if youâ re looking at our growth as weâ ve been growing letâ s say like this year 25 year over year if we continue to do that with our srt you can imagine where we could be with that kind of revenue in 2019 and if you added four or five or six sculptura units and hopefully most of them being at 1 million plus at our targeted average selling price it could impacted quite a bit and i think that as we continue to grow with that product i think weâ re going to see increased revenues because i think thereâ s going to be a lot more people who want to buy the sculptura so hopefully we get to a volume of 10 of these systems at some point in the future and of course thatâ s going to be 10 million and if we do 15 itâ s going to be 15 million and 20 units is 20 million so itâ s going to keep growing accordingly yi chen okay got it thank you joe sardano thank you operator we have time for just one more question and that question comes from marcel herbst with herbst capital management please go ahead joe sardano hey marcel marcel herbst good afternoon joe thank you so much for taking my question a quick follow up on sculptura you have four five units to play specifically for investigational review board purpose would you expect the remaining units to be placed pretty shortly here in the first quarter or whatâ s your expectation there joe sardano yes i think that it all depends on the institution because they take a lot longer to get those decisions and to get those approvals traditionally even when i was back with general electric selling positron emission tomography you can expect anything from six months to 24 months before you got a purchase order now i donâ t think that these institutions are going to take that long iâ m expecting to get all of these institutions installed in 2019 my preference would be the first quarter but iâ m not going to be surprised if it takes us all up to the third quarter as well because you just canâ t predict what kind of paperwork theyâ re going to have to go through internally in order to get these approvals as you can imagine theyâ re going to have to adjust existing budgets that they have in order to accommodate this so theyâ re going to have to give up something within an existing budget in order to accept this so theyâ ve got some work to do but i expect a couple of units that should happen very very quickly hopefully in the first quarter and then of course we canâ t take anything to revenue until we deliver and install so again depending on their readiness it could take anywhere from three to six months before we deliver anything but iâ m expecting to get those units done marcel herbst okay good thatâ s good to hear and also and speaking of the international expansion beginning of last year also signed distribution agreements with korea thailand and i think germany can you talk a little bit about how your effort there is going in terms of how is the demand and the pipelines shaping up for your distributors and maybe comment on any lessons youâ ve learned and what your expectations are going forward joe sardano i expect better output in 2019 than we had in 2018 and i think that â 18 was very very moderate it seems like the european markets were very very slow thereâ s not a lot of money there the economy is going very very bad same thing with latin america even though we opened up some countries there i think that the economies are very very slow but i think weâ re developing some good relationships and weâ re going through the beginning of selling cycles there now asia is going to definitely going to provide us with the biggest opportunity and i fully expect china to be healthy at some point in the very near future and that will open up the markets to the chinese markets as well but because theyâ ve been on hold korea vietnam thailand all of those countries are countries that quite frankly weâ re expecting business from how much i donâ t know the governments are going to determine how much business theyâ ll give us but i expect business from those countries marcel herbst okay great thatâ s helpful and a quick question on the new advanced lasers that youâ re developing and you say that you might be able to start commercialization this year are these for brands new indications or are these â is the research focused on improving the current lasers that youâ re having with new indications what indications would that be joe sardano well i â when i â first of all laser the laser market is a very well established and mature market thereâ s a lot of different laser companies out there and they all have multiple lasers we have a target market that we feel we can address with customers who prefer the type of business that weâ re offering today in other words doctors seemed to be reluctant to continue to have or allow companies to have their hands in their pockets so something that is that theyâ re not happy with is having to sell consumables they would prefer to be able to buy products that donâ t have a consumable much like with the srt products are we have a service element to it thatâ s a consumable for us but thatâ s the same type of a model that general electric siemens philips varian all the bigger medical devices companies have and our doctors are seeing are getting frustrate and part of that reason is if you look at the market that they serve the services that they provide whether itâ s tattoo removal hair removal taking away fat adding fat removing wrinkles or chins and things like that all of those pretty much been commoditized in all of the various communities around the country so if you call up 10 dermatologists in your area they pretty much have the same pricing so youâ re looking at between 2 500 to feature hair removal or tattoo removal over the course of two or three various treatments within a few week period with all that being said if somebody spend 100 000 on a laser and then has to pay 680 for consumable to treat with that laser and they do 100 treatments a year that 68 000 that 68 000 out of the physicians pocket i think that weâ re trying to put together a product that will allow those doctors to keep that 68 000 and therefore i think we understand their business model a whole lot better and i think that they prefer to want to work with us on that basis versus having to come up with the money for the consumable all the time so thatâ s the target that weâ re looking at and thatâ s something that we think is special and will be unique to our lasers marcel herbst okay good thank you maybe one last question when you look two three years out actually scale revenues whatâ s your long term model on gross margins and operating margins joe sardano well we have been managing very very well over the last several years to the 65 to 67 margin number weâ ve been consistent in that and thatâ s what we target most of our products i would tell you that i donâ t think those margins will be sustainable with the laser products so thatâ s going to be separate and as we continue to grow srt i think weâ re able to continue to maintain those margins but some of those margins will be impacted by trade ins a lot of doctors might be trading up from the srt 100 to the srt 100 vision so thereâ s going to be a handful of those on every quarter and then i think that sculptura on the other hand will help us with a lot of those margins as it gains notoriety and we start to promote that product as well so i think overall weâ re going to have a various product mix that are going to continue to keep our margins at very very high levels and very productive levels and i think that from a profitability standpoint all of the products that weâ re looking at are going to lend itself to providing some big numbers to our bottom line marcel herbst thanks joe joe sardano thank you appreciate it operator this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to joe sardano for any closing remarks joe sardano thank you everyone i think that they were all great questions we appreciate everybody who asked them in closing i want to thank you all for your time this afternoon and for your interest in sensus healthcare iâ d like to mention that weâ ll be participating in the 30th annual roth conference in southern california on march 18th and the 19th weâ ll be conducting some other non res road shows in the future throughout new york boston dallas and other parts of the country as well with the help of our investor relations group at lha so we hope to see you in some of those meetings and we look forward to a fantastic 2018 so thanks again everybody have a great day and happy valentineâ s day to everyone operator the conference is now concluded thank you for attending todayâ s presentation you may now disconnect

support for this proposal demonstrates a profound ignorance of even basic economic concepts in what its supporters have claimed is visionary congressional media darling alexandria occasio cortez aoc has released her short awaited green new deal and she has called for nothing short of the destruction of life as we have known it rep alexandria ocasio cortez said she has no qualms about acknowledging a so called green new deal will mean unprecedented governmental intrusion into the private sector appearing on npr she was asked if she s prepared to tell americans outright that her plans involve massive government intervention on one level aoc is being honest such a plan would be unprecedented at least in the united states but it would hardly be the first government led massive intrusion into a nation s economy the 20th century was full of such intervention beginning with world war i and continuing through the years of communist governments the century was full of intervention and the earth was full of the dead bodies to prove it what aoc and her political allies including most democrats that have declared they will run for the u s presidency are demanding is the u s version of mao s utterly disastrous great leap forward substance without specifics for all of the so called specifics the green new deal gnd reads like a socialist website that is full of rhetoric promises and statements that assume a bunch of planners sitting around tables can replicate a complex economy that feeds transports and houses hundreds of millions of people the new york times declares the plan to give substance to an idea that had been a mostly vague rallying cry for a stimulus package around climate change but its prospects are uncertain actually there is nothing we can call substance in this proposal if we mean substance to be a realistic understanding that it would be impossible to redirect via central planning nearly every factor of production in the u s economy from one set of uses to another since that is what the proposed legislation actually requires for example the following is what aoc and others call the scope of the proposed law a the plan for a green new deal and the draft legislation shall be developed with the objective of reaching the following outcomes within the target window of 10 years from the start of execution of the plan dramatically expand existing renewable power sources and deploy new production capacity with the goal of meeting 100 of national power demand through renewable sources building a national energy efficient smart grid upgrading every residential and industrial building for state of the art energy efficiency comfort and safety eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from the manufacturing agricultural and other industries including by investing in local scale agriculture in communities across the country eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from repairing and improving transportation and other infrastructure and upgrading water infrastructure to ensure universal access to clean water funding massive investment in the drawdown of greenhouse gases making green technology industry expertise products and services a major export of the united states with the aim of becoming the undisputed international leader in helping other countries transition to completely greenhouse gas neutral economies and bringing about a global green new deal it is hard to know where to begin in analyzing such an ambitious plan especially when one understands the ramifications of what is in this bill no doubt many will believe it to be bold and long overdue the cnn website breathlessly declares public investments should prioritize what the resolution calls frontline and vulnerable communities which include people in rural and de industrialized areas as well as those that depend on carbon intensive industries like oil and gas extraction and in a move that may draw support from a broad range of advocacy groups the resolution sweeps in the full range of progressive policy priorities providing universal healthcare and affordable housing ensuring that all jobs have union protections and family sustaining wages and keeping the business environment free of monopolistic competition however cnn adds that the specifics paying for the whole thing are not included at least not yet in addition the news organization adds the following for those worried that the entire operation might prove to be prohibitively costly the new dealers argue that a federally funded energy transition would stimulate growth by providing jobs improving public health and reducing waste in addition they argue that the government could capture more return on investment by retaining equity stakes in the projects they build in other words this whole operation allegedly will generate so much new wealth that it will pay for itself lift millions from poverty and transform the entire u s economy the plan is so generous that it promises according to the democrat s press release that even people who refuse to work will still be provided a living wage income unprecedented intervention the plan also is famous not only for what it purports to create outright utopia but also what it calls to ban cows and airlines the plan calls for phasing out air travel within a decade to be replaced by a network of high speed rails as though this were even feasible cows as the released document acknowledges have flatulence so they must be totally eliminated from the earth and meat from the u s diet but there is nothing to address the massive disruption to life as we know it in order to implement such a plan not surprisingly the atlantic is nearly breathless with praise for this monstrosity but even that publication admits that the scale of aoc s vision is beyond anything we have ever seen before yet even in broad language the resolution clearly describes a transformation that would leave virtually no sector of the economy untouched a green new deal would direct new solar farms to bloom in the desert new high speed rail lines to crisscross the plains and squadrons of construction workers to insulate and weatherize buildings from florida to alaska it would guarantee every american a job that pays a family sustaining wage codify paid family leave and strengthen union law nationwide to be honest untouched is not the appropriate term here as smashed or destroyed is much more accurate and descriptive we are not speaking of ordinary government intervention that marks most of the u s economy but does allow for something of a price system to continue to exist instead something of this magnitude would require a complete government takeover with central planning on a scale so huge that it would have to surpass the grandest dreams of the old soviet gosplan one of the most asked questions of course is how do we pay for this perhaps it is natural to ask such things but we are not speaking of a particular project for which we have to purchase materials and pay those who create it instead this plan would simply redirect nearly every resource almost all labor and every other factor of production away from current uses to something as determined by government planners and overlords there is no other accurate way to describe what we are seeing economic ignorance the resolution naively assumes that all that needs to be done is for government to finance these projects through huge increases in taxes borrowing and of course printing money and that such infusions of money will enable the government to pay for all of these new projects as though one were building a new skyscraper in manhattan many will say massive government investment how in the world can we pay for this the answer is in the same ways we paid for the 2008 bank bailout and extended quantitative easing programs the same ways we paid for world war ii and many other wars the federal reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments new public banks can be created as in wwii to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes can be employed in addition to traditional debt tools there is also a space for the government to take an equity role in projects as several government and government affiliated institutions already do such statements demonstrate a profound ignorance of even basic economic concepts the authors and supporters of this document believe that all it will take is for the government to direct massive amounts of money toward these new projects and everything else will fall into line but that is not even close to reality as the only way to redirect such massive amounts of money would be to use force and deadly force at that first and most important much of the present capital in the usa is geared toward the kind of economy that aoc and the democrats demand be made illegal so huge swaths of the capital stock would have to be abandoned as little of it could be redirected elsewhere one cannot overestimate the kind of financial damage that would cause and it would impoverish much of the country almost overnight second the entire economy would be required to pivot toward capital development that would not be possible given current technologies and opportunity costs to create especially in the 10 year time frame the democrats are demanding diverting new streams of finance toward such projects would be useless and even counterproductive as the system simply would be overwhelmed it would not be long before scarcity itself would mean that entire projects either would be stalled like what we see with the infamous bullet train in california or even abandoned the human cost alone would be staggering as pointed out at the beginning of this article for all of the grand vision rhetoric that accompanies the rollout of the aoc plan this is nothing less than an attempt to re implement mao s great leap forward albeit with high speed rails instead of backyard steel mills one cannot overestimate the disaster that would follow if this were forced upon the american economy so called political visionaries rarely are willing to be truthful about the destruction that follows their schemes when baby boomers were in college a half century ago many saw mao as their political hero a man with great vision who had the political will to do what was necessary to advance the fortunes of his own people that he was a murderous tyrant who presided over mass death that exceeded even the killings of world war ii was irrelevant or even ignored today we are told by her adoring press that alexandria ocasio cortez is the new visionary a person who is far seeing and knows what we have to do in order to survive the coming consequences of climate change that her grand vision is little more than a mass depopulation scheme is ignored and we ignore it

candidates seeking georgia s top offices don t just open their policies and personal lives to the public but also their balance sheets and the financial documents released this week have generated a stir in the race for governor several contenders from both parties revealed they are pumping an enormous share of their personal fortunes into the race to succeed gov nathan deal and one democratic candidate s documents detail her struggles to pay off debts to the federal government stacey abrams a former state house minority leader disclosed that she owed the internal revenue service more than 50 000 over the past two years and is on a plan to repay the money she said she deferred her tax payments in 2015 and 2016 because she was helping to pay her family s expenses abrams a tax lawyer who often talks about the difficulties she faces in supporting her parents said her struggles will help inform her decisions if elected the state s first democratic governor since 2002 they re also sure to fuel campaign attacks by opponents who will question whether she can run the state s massive financial machinery if she has problems managing her household debt it s definitely fodder for the republicans to go after said michael owens the cobb county democratic chairman who added that abrams financial woes could also help her connect to voters who face similar problems seven figure fortunes the documents outline each candidate s finances down to retirement investments personal bank accounts and even the values of their cars they provide clues about how much each candidate for governor can dig into his or her own wallet to fund a campaign former state rep stacey evans abrams democratic rival reported a net worth of roughly 5 2 million thanks partly to a victory in a medicaid fraud lawsuit the 1 25 million she s already pumped into the contest is roughly one quarter of her wealth and it shows she likely can t substantially finance her campaign that also applies to republican clay tippins a first time candidate who has already loaned himself 450 000 to jump start his campaign the tech executive reported a net worth of about 750 000 and former state sen hunter hill who heads an executive coaching firm has a net worth of roughly 450 000 and stakes in consulting firms and a real estate investing company state sen michael williams who has pumped more than 1 million into his campaign said he was worth about 9 million other leading republicans in the race have amassed seven figure fortunes but not enough to rely on to fuel their own campaigns secretary of state brian kemp listed millions of dollars in assets with 16 businesses including a struggling sunflower oil processor that has been targeted by lawsuits from investors who claim more than 700 000 in unpaid loans lt gov casey cagle the gop front runner listed a net worth of about 1 6 million mostly in real estate holdings a familiar issue abrams is far from the first high profile georgia candidate to face concerns about her finances and others have used their balance sheets to try to relate to voters who also face financial difficulties in his 2010 campaign for governor deal revealed he had 2 4 million in debts in 2009 2010 largely due to a loan he guaranteed for his daughter and son in law to open a sporting goods store the store failed in 2009 costing deal an additional 2 million in direct investment losses when the debt transferred to him on the campaign trail during his run for governor the republican talked about making painful decisions to help his family just like other families would do he later sold the store and settled the debts and his latest disclosure shows most of his assets tied up in north georgia real estate atlanta mayor keisha lance bottoms too faced criticism over her finances in last year s race for the city s top job she was peppered with questions about her 1 2 million second home on martha s vineyard she and her supporters pointed out her husband is a well paid executive with home depot and she was slammed over tax liens totaling more than 38 000 filed in 2006 in a deeply personal response in a televised debate bottoms said those charges were incurred as she and her husband racked up an enormous amount of medical expenses when they were struggling to get pregnant and that the debt was now paid and satisfied stretching pennies abrams 44 has talked publicly about her struggles with mounting credit card debt dating to when she was a student at spelman college and she said she stretched every penny i had to help her parents after hurricane katrina devastated the gulf coast in 2005 she cited those expenses in her decision to work out a payment plan for the 54 000 she owes the irs she s also said a previous federal income tax lien of nearly 30 000 was filed erroneously in 2010 when she was trying to claim her parents as dependents as they faced mounting medical issues while delaying tax payments wasn t my smartest move it allowed me to take care of the parents who d sacrificed so much for me and my siblings she wrote i remain committed to their financial stability to this day and i continue to work hard to meet all of my obligations abrams has highlighted the string of small businesses she s started though most of the roughly 520 000 in assets she reported involved her atlanta townhouse and an advance for an upcoming book on leadership her liabilities include 96 000 owed for student loans for spelman and yale law school and about 76 000 in credit card debt abrams raised roughly 2 3 million through january for her campaign for governor and she has spent about 80 percent of that sum to hire staff and security lease and outfit her campaign headquarters and cover travel costs she has also loaned her campaign 50 000 the five leading republicans in the governor s race have not criticized abrams over her irs debt and evans declined to comment but veteran strategists say it s likely to surface in gop attack ads that will try to paint her as a tax hiking democrat who doesn t pay her own it s a management and competence issue the republicans won t hesitate to exploit said david worley a former chairman of the democratic party of georgia who backs evans abrams supporters hope this line of attack will backfire her campaign said she will be a governor who understands the struggles everyday families are facing and shaped her economic platform to include a tax credit for working class families and a financial literacy program hillary holley an atlanta teacher said she has also chipped in to help her parents pay utility bills while working her way through college learning about abrams debt holley said assured her that the democrat is the only candidate who has been through the kinds of things my family and friends have gone through me and everyone i know struggle with debt and are trying to be a part of the middle class holley added being poor is expensive and i see that she gets where i m coming from and her policies and plans reflect that
in this regular biweekly column les nemethy of central european corporate finance firm euro phoenix questions whether the world really has learned from the last financial crisis total global debt levels have reached a whopping usd 247 trillion as of 2018 up from usd 164 tln in january 2009 the time of the last financial crisis that s up from 213 to 318 of global gdp according to the institute of international finance one of the most basic principles of finance is that leverage is always correlated to risk hence systemic risk in the global financial system is considerably higher today than it was in 2008 that s not to say that a recession or depression will happen tomorrow but it does mean that the global economy is less able to withstand shock should one arise financial shocks can come from unexpected places in 2008 the financial shock came from subprime debt it was like the spark that set off the tinder keg before 2008 most people hadn t heard of subprime debt and to the best of my knowledge no economist had predicted that this could trigger a financial crisis it is not possible to predict the origin of the next financial crisis it might be triggered by the current trade war loss of confidence in a particular government a war the failure of a financial institution or a combination of the above or it might come from a totally unexpected area whatever the source of the shock the higher the levels of debt the more likely that there will be conflagration and contagion because there is likelier to be conflagration and contagion at those pressure points of the global economy where debt levels are highest for the remainder of this article i will focus on breaking down global debt to identify places where risk is greatest corporate debt has increased fastest from 79 to 92 of global gdp while government debt has also grown healthily from 62 to 84 from 2008 to 2018 only household debt has been moderate falling from 66 to 59 over the same period according to mckinsey global institute visualizing global debt and yet in 2008 the general conclusion was that debt levels were way too high and should be paid down in order to make the world a more stable place instead governments and corporations have continued to pile on debt they have not learned the lesson of 2008 we ll now examine government corporate and household debt in more detail government debt as the chart below demonstrates it is the japanese and chinese governments that have piled on the most debt although the chinese debt levels started from a much lower base in 2008 you might say that a government can never go bankrupt they can always print more money but a government may default where debt is denominated in foreign currencies the likelier scenario is that in the event of a crisis governments will need to pay significantly higher interest rates to sell bonds the u s government currently pays about 8 of its budget to service debt according to thebalance com and this is with extremely low interest rates what if the u s government had to triple its cost of servicing treasuries during a recession when tax revenues are falling ouch corporate debt here again china has been among the most profligate with the european union also showing healthy increases in debt according to mckinsey global institute it should be borne in mind that the chinese economy has been the fastest growing major economy in the world more than doubling over the 2008 2018 period to become the largest economy in the world on a purchasing power parity basis so the fact that chinese corporate debt has increased by more than 50 relative to gdp points to a truly staggering level of debt growth with chinese corporations this is particularly worrying where state owned banks are lending to state owned corporations as well as lightly regulated non bank financial institutions accounting for so much lending much of corporate bonds are low grade the bbb bond market in the united states has exploded as it represented nearly 50 of the total corporate bond market in september 2018 versus 35 in 2006 says tortoiseadvisors com according to fitch ratings usd 500 billion of u s bonds are just one downgrade away from junk bonds if downgraded this would create major losses for investors potentially creating a vicious circle of them withdrawing funds from the bond market further driving up interest rates etc household debt household debt has generally been decreasing in most economies of the world with the dramatic exception of china which once again started with a relatively low base in 2008 nevertheless there are certain segments of household debt that still provide cause for concern for example according to the federal reserve student loans represent roughly usd 1 5 tln in the states and have more than doubled since 2008 it is now the second largest category of consumer debt outstanding after mortgages according to the u s department of education and studies of judith scott clayton associate professor at columbia university every year more than a million people default on their student loans and approximately 40 of borrowers are expected to default on their student loans by 2023 in conclusion it seems that most governments and corporations have not learned the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis perhaps most households have this creates a virtual certainty that there will be another financial crisis the only questions are when and whether the next recession could be more severe than the one in 2008 les nemethy is ceo of euro phoenix www europhoenix com a central european corporate finance firm author of business exit planning www businessexitplanningbook com and a former president of the american chamber of commerce in hungary

the nation s best bankruptcy attorneys and financial experts from across the energy sector to develop a comprehensive pg e strategy to unveil within the next 60 days many utility industry analysts believe that newsom is scheming to have the state of california nationalize pg e by engineering a wipeout of public shareholders and forcing holders of pg e s 18 billion debt to take a big principal haircut a webinar featuring karol denniston senior bankruptcy partner in the san francisco office of squire patton boggs highlighted that pg e before filing its second chapter 11 was still burdened from the aftermath of its first bankruptcy in 2001 on criminal probation for its gas line explosion in 2010 liable for 20 billion from 2017 wildfires and liable for another 10 to 20 billion for 2018 wildfires despite california s residential utility rates of 19 53 cents per kilowatt hour almost double the 10 95 cents in oregon and 9 46 cents in washington denniston forecasts that pg e utility rates are going up substantially because california courts have ruled that utilities under the theory of inverse condemnation are liable for damage caused by their equipment even if the utility followed all state regulated safety precautions courts blame pg e for uninsulated overhead power conductor lines being susceptible to sparking ground fires due to trees falling onto them during high wind events pg e does bury some of its 18 466 miles of overhead power lines each year but the cost for a new 69 kv overhead transmission line is 285 000 per mile versus 1 5 million per mile for an underground line while a 138 kv overhead line costs 390 000 per mile versus 2 million per mile underground underground lines also require new terminals and are substantially more expensive to dig up for maintenance purposes gov brown signed sb 901 in september to help pg e avoid bankruptcy by passing through its wildfire liabilities to utility rate payers over the next 20 years at the rate of 5 20 per billion of liability claims thirty billion dollars in wildfire liability would spike california residential electric rate to 22 cents per kilowatt hour hammering the poor and aged newsom and his progressive fellow travelers believe that nationalizing california utilities would be cost advantageous because state and local government entities including public power utilities can sell municipal bonds with tax free interest moody s aaa rated corporate bond interest rate index is 1 2 percent higher than aaa muni bonds but muni bond size averages a puny 7 million versus 210 million for corporate issues newsom has become a pariah to progressives for dumping california s high speed rail boondoggle even though he kept 100 percent of the taxes but if he can nationalize pg e gov newsom could reinvent himself as a top green new deal champion

time wages and jobs wage and unemployment data hold the key to interest rate movements aap dan peled locally the focus of the week will be on wages and jobs in what will be the first big test of the reserve bank s neutral stance on interest rates earlier in the month rba governor philip lowe revealed his recipe for a rate cut up until that point a hike had been baked into the rba s assumptions in the event of a sustained increase in the unemployment rate and a lack of further progress towards the inflation objective lower interest rates might be appropriate at some point dr lowe told a lunchtime gathering of market economists cue sound of dropped cutlery and frantic pencil sharpening the wage price index for the fourth quarter wednesday and labour force figures thursday are the two key ingredients in the data dependent monetary policy mix at the moment the consensus view is wages will rise by 0 6 per cent over the quarter and 2 3 per cent for the year pretty much the same as the previous quarter s reading on the jobs front things are expected to remain solid with a forecast of 15 000 new jobs in january and unemployment holding at 5 per cent the wage price index will give a view on the pressures surrounding the inflation objective while the unemployment rate obviously feeds directly into the first part of lowe s recipe deutsche bank s phil odonaghoe said it stands to reason then that the market will be more sensitive to labour market reports through the opening months of 2019 than it has been for some time mr odonaghoe said particular attention needs to be paid to the wages including bonuses index which in the past has been a helpful leading indicator for wage pressures a weak result tips the balance more to a rate cut job growth slowing capital economics s ben udy s view is wage growth will continue to trudge along without the impetus of higher minimum wages we suspect that annual wage growth stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2018 mr udy said and if the labour market begins to lose momentum then wage growth will struggle to pick up much from here while employment has been one piston that has been firing consistently in a spluttering economic engine mr udy believes that may not continue for much longer we suspect that the unemployment rate is around its trough in the current cycle even a solid increase of 15 000 new jobs in january would see employment growth slow from 2 2 per cent to 2 per cent over the year to be below the average growth rate over 2018 while that should be enough to stave off any rise in the unemployment rate in january

source xinhua 2019 02 16 22 54 16 editor yan video player close beijing feb 16 xinhua the china proposed belt and road initiative bri helps promote win win cooperation worldwide according to research papers and articles by some renowned international think tanks lately put forward by china in 2013 the initiative is aimed at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting asia with europe africa and beyond along the ancient trade routes of the silk road a boost to global trade merchandise trade between china and countries along the bri totaled 1 3 trillion u s dollars in 2018 a year on year growth of 16 3 percent china s ministry of commerce said in january a research report published by trade credit insurer euler hermes late last month says nations involved in the bri will see higher trade volumes even if they are yet to receive any direct investment from china the report estimates that the bri resulted in 460 billion dollars worth of investments in the five years since its inception in 2013 for china this will mean 56 billion dollars in additional exports while it will import an extra 61 billion dollars worth of goods from the 80 countries named in the official manifesto the report says the report estimates that this will add 0 3 percent to global trade and 0 1 percent to global growth at a time when fears are mounting about a slowdown across the world economy the bri aims to build infrastructure in countries accounting for a combined 68 percent of the world s population and 36 percent of its gdp said the center for global development a nonprofit u s think tank mahamoud islam a senior economist at euler hermes in hong kong said this is because of the effect of better connectivity and infrastructure along the belt and road routes as well as better trade relations between china and the target markets given that a huge part of the belt and road routes are domestic international companies could expect to benefit from infrastructural improvements in china too he said it improves competitiveness that s not surprising you re building railroads ports and airports connecting countries islam said adding that for china the bri is a way to push out excess capacity in industries such as coal and steel internationalize its companies and help liberalize the yuan by lending in chinese currency the bri investment has continued this year from jan 2 to jan 15 the value of new bri projects was 4 5 billion dollars according to the rwr advisory group a washington based research house with the highest proportion of this going to sub saharan africa connectivity becomes trendy at a roundtable held by the russian international affairs council in december assistant professor fabienne bossuyt said central asia is a region that is basically landlocked and is suffering from its geographical location in terms of its trade with the rest of the world by increasing connectivity this region will definitely benefit economically she said the very topic of connectivity became somewhat trendy since china came up with its bri in 2013 bossuyt said china is planning to spend enormously on the initiative other countries that are involved in the initiative have started to take the whole thing very seriously she said greg earl a member of the board of the australia asean council said in a recent piece in the interpreter that a survey by hsbc of global businesses in 34 countries which rely on connectivity to conduct their businesses across borders found they regard the bri as having a huge impact a recent conference held by the cimb asean research institute a prominent institution concluded that the bri is important for asean especially given the significant infrastructure needs in the region it can leverage the existing close china asean economic relationship as a foundation for greater future collaboration in that china has been asean s largest trading partner for close to 10 years earl cited the conclusion of the conference as saying the attitudes of the countries involved in the initiative have also gone through remarkable changes james curran a professor at the university of sydney and non resident fellow at the lowy institute noted that while some politicians played domestic politics on china the government and the opposition have stuck to pragmatism japan s economic relations with china went through a dramatic turn since the country started to call for cooperation with china in third countries in the belt and road infrastructure drive in 2017 the two countries reached a bilateral agreement on cooperation in third countries in october 2018 japan s move is aligned with the japanese ministry of economy trade and industry s view that participating in china s bri offers a significant opportunity for japan wrote aurelia george mulgan a professor at the university of new south wales canberra false accusations a report last year from the center for global development implied that countries are concerned about being stuck in a china debt trap unable to repay loans and forced to cede assets such as commodities or infrastructure the fear was fanned by reports in december that kenya may have to hand over control of its largest port of mombasa paid for by china if it was unable to repay the debt kenyan president uhuru kenyatta denied the claims china is sitting on the largest foreign exchange reserves of any country on earth when that money just sits in the central bank they tend to get about a 3 percent return so they have an incentive to make that excess liquidity work for them through debt and equity investments they are trying to reap better economic returns said bradley parks executive director of aiddata a research center at the college of william mary in virginia u s foreign policy think tank carnegie endowment for international peace said while several recipients of chinese infrastructure and development loans face serious repayment problems often due to reckless and inexperienced practices on both sides there is no conclusive evidence that china is intentionally seeking to drive countries into debt problems to gain control over their assets policies etc proponents of the debt trap diplomacy argument generally base their conclusion on a single case hambantota port in sri lanka while ignoring the other tools china uses to deal with bilateral debt problems and even in that case there is no publicly available information indicating that when the export import bank of china made its first loan to sri lanka to support this project the ultimate purpose was to help china gain a concession to develop and operate the port the think tank said
on tuesday february 5 as the macron government pushed harsh repressive laws against demonstrators through the national assembly the yellow vests joined with france s unions for the first time in a day long nation wide general strike at the very moment when in paris the lower house was voting to implement macron s proposed laws designed to suppress public demonstrations a legal right protected in both the french constitution and the u n human rights declaration tens of thousands of their constituents were out in the streets all over the country demonstrating and striking against macron s

banning the use of flash balls on demonstrators to macron s resignation and the instauration of participatory democracy deaf to the angry people s legitimate grievances unwilling to deal with them macron has given himself no other choice than to legislate new repressive legal restrictions to suppress their continued free expression deaf to the angry people s legitimate grievances unwilling to deal with them macron has given himself no other choice than to legislate new repressive legal restrictions to suppress their continued free expression this resort to open repression can only serve to discredit the government s handling of a crisis largely of his own making treating a spontaneous social movement among the 99 as if it were a terrorist or fascist conspiracy the unpopular president s repressive tactics will inevitably backfire on him the french are extremely jealous of their liberties and macron s monarchical arrogance can only remind them of how their ancestors dealt with louis xvi moreover the yellow vests who have been a painful thorn in macron s side since last november were now demonstrating together with the french labor unions whom he thought he had tamed last spring this convergences came in response to a call for a one day general strike issued by the cgt and solidaires who for the first time invited any yellow vests who felt like it to join in the event quite a few did feel like it despite the cgt s previous hostility to the yellow vests and despite their own fundamental suspicion of all representative structures like established parties and unions whom the yellow vests justifiably fear would attempt to coopt them speak in their name and sell them out a day of action and convergence for a first date the one day strike came off very well somewhat to the surprise of both parties and if this tentative red yellow alliance continues to solidify and there is every indication that it will france will likely become ungovernable and the ruling classes will be up against the wall what might happen next rich in possibility for the french with their long history of popular revolutions have been singularly inventive in coming up with new political arrangements for now let us look more closely at what may in retrospect be an historic day the strike began at exactly midnight when a rowdy crowd of 200 300 demonstrators near paris blocked the giant rungis produce market which replaced les halles the legendary belly of paris cutting off food to the capital with trucks lining up outside you can see the yellow vests among the red flags of the cgt in this video from le parisien they even set up a barricade in the early hours there were also blockages at the airport of nantes and at the university there at a key toll gate near toulouse while in grenoble transport was perturbed all morning all told there were demonstrations in at least 160 different localities all different in size and conduct mostly improvised by people on the spot at the last minute there were big ones in the channel ports le harvre rouen and caen in strassbourg about 1500 in lyon 5000 including 500 yellow vests in marseille the yellow vest march converged with the cgt at the stock exchange a shift of targets for the yellow vests from government to finance capital in paris instead of the usual union march through the popular quarters from the bastille to nation the cgt led strikers invaded the fancy right bank territory violently contested for twelve weeks by the yellow vests marching boldly up the rue de rivoli with its luxurious shop windows and construction sites with bricks lying around they then held an impromptu rally at a major intersection tying up traffic and baffling the police here in montpellier as elsewhere in france the crowd was big but no bigger than some of the previous saturday yellow vest demos as was the case all over france but this tuesday it was largely a union crowd on the other hand after weeks of gassing peaceful protestors the police presence was extremely discrete and one gendarme was filmed explaining to the yellow vests protestors that the gendarmes had nothing against them that his family supported the movement explaining that they were soldiers and sworn to obey orders the gendarmerie is under the military they yellow vests answered that they had nothing against the gendarmes either see amazing video when i arrived at the gathering point the loudspeakers of the cgt sound truck were blaring out a long boring speech complicated stuff concerning the euro no possibility of conversation much less convergence next up the line came a contingent of cgt people quite a number of whom were wearing yellow vests with bright red cgt emblems on them this dual identity underscores the naturalness of the convergence of the two movements of working class people who have nearly identical economic goals and all the same enemies like the red yellow cgt activists nearly every yellow vest has by now personalized her his attire inscribing slogans on them like end of month end of world same combat macron resign down with capitalism and the very popular government of the people by the people and for the people the french haven t a clue they re quoting lincoln an american at the front of the column after the cgt banner were the yellow vests perhaps 200 strong behind our banner and singing aloud i was a little disappointed by the low turnout of yellow vests also that they didn t go back and fraternize and mingle with the union folk as one woman proposed and i attempted in spite of the loud recorded cgt music at the end of the march our montpellier yellow vest had planned to hold an open mike speakout but that didn t come off either but as comrades kept reminding me it was an important first step and we ll be back we make our road by walking who are these yellow vests since nov 17 2018 the popular nation wide self organized yellow vests movement has been keeping up the pressure on the neo liberal macron regime with daily protests at traffic circles and weekly demonstrations in dozens of cities it is made up of average lower middle class french people mostly provincials whose lives have gotten worse under neo liberal policies they are mostly little people who are struggling to make ends meet and are tired of being ignored and humiliated by france s elites last november they began to turn off their tvs come out of their houses join together at traffic circles and toll booths get to know each other grill sausages and feel empowered rather than isolated and helpless they thus humanized these noplaces or non places created by the automobile civilization that had stripped their villages of post offices bakeries and cafés forcing them to spend two hours every workday in their cars the yellow vests represent a demographic cross section of france naturally minus the top 2 or 3 and unfortunately for the moment minus the 10 of france s doubly oppressed discriminated immigrant communities the arabs berbers black africans and other immigrants who do most of the dirty jobs who are rarely seen in civil service jobs and whose youth riots in the banlieues projects seriously challenged president sarkozy in 2005 partly due to my suggestion the montpellier yellow vests are starting to reach out to the immigrant communities coming from many different backgrounds the yellow vests wisely chose to put aside their political differences and party preferences avoid pointless arguments and focus on the struggle that unites them each speaking for her or himself alternating genders to maintain parity as the weekly protests continued the yellow vests were slowly refining their goals and tactics and discovering how to organize themselves while retaining their autonomy after more than two months on jan 25 27 delegates from 75 local yellow vest assemblies came together in the town of commercy lorraine for their first assembly of assemblies and wrote a democratic egalitarian anti racist declaration discussed below which soon achieved a consensus around the country so a functioning federation with common goals is now emerging remarkably the yellow vests rebellion has persisted week after week despite a government campaign of brutal police repression including thousands of injuries some serious several deaths a thousand arrests and routine tear gassing of peaceful groups the yellow vests have persisted despite being constantly vilified by the government and media as fascists violent terrorists a hate filled mob macron etc yet amazingly according to the latest polls 77 of french people at large think their mobilization is justified up from 74 in january most remarkable of all they have wrung some actual concessions from macron who after disdainfully declaring he would never give in to an unruly mob was forced to rescind the tax on diesel fuel that the movement had originally crystalized around and promised a raise in the minimum wage and a cut in taxes on retirement income both of which turned out to be shams on close examination these practical victories won by an autonomous group that refuses to anoint leaders or to negotiate have deeply embarrassed the french labor movement and particularly the militant cgt general confederation of labor historically affiliated with the french communist party which after months of stop and go strikes last spring failed to block the implementation of macron s neo liberal reforms which took away many benefits won by french labor during the great struggles of the past the defeated strikers returned to work last sept with their tails between their legs simmering mad and it was out this void of active opposition to macron s ongoing neo liberal offensive that the yellow vests spontaneously emerged and spread across the country with their spectacular direct action tactics many union members more or less disgusted with their leaders joined the yellow vests from the start the yellow vests organized themselves via facebook pages socialized in traffic circles and parking lots and grew into an autonomous social movement they stood up for themselves and for the rest of france s working poor unemployed single mothers and retired people they spontaneously organized mass civil disobedience successfully opposing macron s economic program of taking from the poor and giving to the rich from whose soft white hands the wealth will theoretically trickle down the cgt the immediate response to the rise of the yellow vests on the part of the cgt and its leader the unsmiling mustachioed martinez picked by central casting for the tough guy part was suspicion petty bourgeois fascists and hostility martinez and the other union bureaucrats could not help seeing the yellow vests as competitors and thus as a threat to their own hegemonic status as official representatives of the workers especially after macron s concessions after shocking reports of police violence unleashed by macron s government against the yellow vests third saturday demonstration and in direct response to an appeal for calm from macron on dec 6 the leaders of the cgt and all the other labor federations except for solidaires signed a déclaration of solidarity not of solidarity with the injured and arrested demonstrators but with the macron government the alleged representative of the peaceful republican order in return for what many described as a betrayal the labor movement s clique of professional negotiators accepted macron s invitation to resume the social dialogue that is to allow them to sit at the table with him and negotiate more give backs of workers rights the union leadership s pledge of allegiance to the neo liberal flag did not go down well in the union ranks and so the very next day martinez and the other union leaders spun in the wind like weathercocks started acting militant and called for a national labor demonstration legal on fri dec 14 the union leaders strike demands covered the same basic economic demands as the yellow vests the event was to be a demonstration of power a public relations leadership challenge and it was pointedly planned for friday not saturday the yellow vests demonstration day the only free day for many of them for example single parents workers in offices and small businesses who don t have strike pay or legal rights to strike the friday dec 14 union demonstrations were hardly imposing compared to saturday s yellow vest evens so the ploy fizzled two months later the cgt s issued another call for a one day general strike on feb 5 a tuesday it seemed like a replay of the same ploy but in a gesture toward the more and more obvious need for convergence martinez opened a crack for yellow vests to join if they wished as he said the day before the strike however the next day blowing with a different wind he changed his tune and actually made some sensible remarks about convergence people have been saying for more than two months that we must talk and find common demands we have them there is no reason we shouldn t march side by side the ones behind the others what is important is to have a successful first day of action together because i find that the bosses have been let off easy and it is time to bring to account the big bosses of this country martinez remark about needing to attack the big bosses was both pointed and to the point the yellow vests given their broad and varied social composition have naturally focused on the consumer issues they have in common as working folk struggling to make ends meet high prices unfair taxes and declining social services directing their anger at the government the media and the political elite their signs often denounce capitalism but as a group they have no direct relationship with big industry and finance in whose interest macron rules yet clearly only with the active participation of france s organized workers can this broad popular movement succeed for example through an unlimited general strike with occupations of workplaces and public spaces as in 1968 the opening of chapter two in the movement more encouraging martinez co organizer of the feb 5 strike cécile gondar lalanne whose union sud solidaires has been supportive of the yellow vests from the start declared if today works out we must look forward doing it again to constructing a common movement to this observer such a convergence of the reds with the yellows if it develops might release a revolutionary power greater than anything we have seen in modern history the yellows composed of a cross section of the common people in the provinces already have the support of the vast majority of french people they have held off the government for thirteen weeks and show no sign of relenting the reds meaning the organized workers have the power to strike and bring a halt to france s major industries transportation energy and all public services as they did in 1936 and 1968 united the reds and the yellows have the potential to change the system and many of the yellows clearly have system change on their agenda system change is definitely not on the agenda of martinez and the other union bureaucrats whose social status like that of the members of the national assembly depends on their role as the official representatives of their constituents within the existing system given the pressure from below martinez has no choice but to play at convergence with the yellow vests today but it is only to outmaneuver them and secure his official status as labor s representatives this is precisely what the yellow vests feared from the start when they founded their movement on autonomy perhaps remembering the dismal role played by the cgt in ending the general strike and popular uprising that shook up the de gaulle regime in 1968 and whose 50th anniversary was being celebrated all over the media all last year so red yellow convergence is taking place in a conflictual context pitting the traditionally hierarchical vertical discipline of the cgt and other french labor organizations against the innovative horizontal self organization of the proudly autonomous yellow vests the presence observed in montpellier and on the videos of the feb 5 event of demonstrators with big red cgt badges on their yellow vests is already significant the fact that these red yellow orange activists dare to openly display their independence within the tightly organized culture of the cgt is a sign of cracks opening in that bureaucratic structure through which imaginative wildcat initiatives may emerge convergence is also developing from below through mutual understanding according to the investigative journalism site médiapart whose coverage of this event was superb a not very militant cgt member who has been out with his yellow vest on the roundabouts and demonstrated every saturday remarked that there are lots of employees who can t strike who work in small shops and whose relations with their bosses are too direct but they understand that the problem is big capital in paris a young man up from lognes with his wife who had never before demonstrated and his yellow vest group held out a cgt flyer showing a red arm and a yellow arm holding each others hand he concluded today may be the beginning of chapter two of our movement we must all converge two railroad workers on the paris east line share his hopes the cgt has always been a fighting union we re on the side of labor not capital before taking a definite position on the yellow vests we needed to wait to see how this movement was going to clarify its outlook now their discussions and demands are interesting indeed attractive rather leftist they judged this movement has evolved on the ideological plane the yellow vests have become conscious through their struggle it s time to converge to join together yellow vests self education in action over time the yellow vests objectives have indeed deepened as evidenced by the evolution of the home made signs at demonstrations by lists of progressive demands from various local groups and finally at the end of jan 2018 by a declaration reproduced below voted by a general assembly of general assemblies attended by yellow vests mandated by some 75 different local groups a second assembly bringing together many more groups is being prepared as the yellow vests structure themselves in a loose federation and learn to represent themselves through delegates selected always one woman and one man with limited mandates and subject to recall the system of the paris commune of 1871 the commercy declaration defines their goals as dignity an end to inequality free public services higher salaries retirements etc taxing the super rich to pay for them and the restructuring of france as a participatory democracy through referendums at the same time in response to charges by macron the media and any number of groups on the far left the yellow vests declaration declares we are neither racist nor sexist nor homophobic we are proud to come together with our differences to build a society of solidarity although this radical declaration is not a binding program it expresses a consensus and has been quickly adopted by many yellow vest groups who are looking forward to a larger nationwide assembly of assemblies in two months the investigative site médiapart sent two reporters up to commercy after the assembly of assemblies and filmed their conversations with a couple of dozen local yellow vests giving us an intimate view of how this diverse group interacts and makes decisions a long process of patience respect tolerance and conscious self education they explain how each individual brings pieces of the truth from her his knowledge and experience from which a consensus is achieved or not achieved on subjects where they are not ready to decide and sweep under the rug until they are the atmosphere is one of trust and comradeship and active listening interventions are short and to the point viewing the video i was struck by the contrast between the locals discourse and that of the two academic sociologists both charming and well intentioned who tended to go on and on and talk over each other adding very little the local yellow vests whatever their education levels have all learned to express themselves in public succinctly and some have become quite eloquent linked by common struggle pooling their knowledge they are tapping into the wisdom of crowds long known to socialists and recently studied by psychologists they also have fun and laugh a lot for example here in montpellier the first report on the agenda of last sunday s general assembly was on the question of how to curse and insult the forces or order cops the rapporteur went through a whole list of insults which like cocksucker are offensive to gays or women or sex itself it was both hilarious and instructive he the proposed a number of really nasty but politically correct insults and his report was approved by the group this saturday we are going to demonstrate wearing masks to mock the government s vicious liberticidal anti demonstration laws which criminalize covering your face macron s throne is shaky as for macron his popularity hovering around 22 thanks to his regal pretentions inflexible neo liberal orthodoxy methodical use of violence to suppress the expression of legitimate citizen grievances and criticism and his contemptuous way of talking down to his angry subjects this figure is slightly above the 18 of the 2017 presidential vote he got on the first round before being elected as the only alternative to the fascist lepen compare this with approval of the yellow vests which stands at 77 the french hate nothing worse than being talked down to and taken for jerks and macron is his own worst enemy for example when he declared that the presumably lazy french had lost the taste for effort when more than half of them are breaking their backs just to survive macron s latest ploy is the great debate a public relations charade designed to counter the notebooks of grievances being circulated by the yellow vests in imitation of the cahiers de doléances of the 1789 revolution the great debate consists of a serious of programmed meetings between macron or one of his ministers and the elected mayors of a region hardly democratic considering how many mayors are the tools of local real estate interests and political mafias nonetheless some mayors are actually honest and sincere and at the very first televised debate the first mayor to take the floor made a searing critique of macron and his handling of the crisis now questions are filtered in advance whom does macron think he s fooling curiously the french public intellectuals and philosophers who occupy a much larger space in the media than their american counterparts have mostly turned a cold shoulder to the yellow vests if i m not mistaken only two have seriously take up their defense the popular libertarian philosopher michel onfray author of 100 books and the historian anthopologist essayist emmanuel todd they alone carry on the contrarian tradition of voltaire zola and sartre into the 21st century our epoch in which the mediatized intellectuals like the media personalities the media owners the politicians and the labor leaders have all become integral parts of what the french call the political class meanwhile macron is traveling outside of france and playing a role in international affairs to deflect from the intractable crisis at home while the media keep up a business as usual façade respectfully reporting the great debate and reducing the yellow vest insurrection to a weekly tally of the number of demonstrators aren t they declining yet the number of arrests and of cars burnt i suppose that like frightened little kids the french elites think that if they hide their eyes all these angry little people will go away but they won t what will act xiii or chapter two reveal appendix call from the first assembly of assemblies of the yellow vests we the yellow vests of the roundabouts of the parking lots of the squares of the assemblies rallies and demonstrations have gathered on january 26 and 27 2019 as an assembly of assemblies bringing together a hundred delegations in response to a call by the yellow vests of commercy since november 17 from the smallest village from the rural world to the largest city we have risen up against this deeply violent unjust and unbearable society we will no longer let ourselves be pushed around we are rebelling against the high cost of living precariousness and poverty for our loved ones our families and our children we want only to live in dignity it s unacceptable that 26 billionaires own as much as half of humanity let s share the wealth and not the poverty let s put an end to social inequality we demand an immediate increase in wages social minima allowances and pensions the unconditional right to housing and health to education and free public services for all it is for all these rights that we are occupying roundabouts on a daily basis that we organize actions and demonstrations that we discuss everywhere with our yellow vests we retake the floor we who have never had it and how has the government responded with repression contempt denigration many dead and thousands wounded massive use of firearms that mutilate blind injure and traumatize more than 1 000 individuals have been arbitrarily detained and sentenced and now the new anti wrecker law is applied to stop us from demonstrating we condemn all such violence against protesters whether from the police or violent gangs none of this will stop us to demonstrate is a fundamental right end impunity for the police amnesty for all the victims of repression and what a dirty trick is the so called great national debate in fact it s just a government propaganda campaign that manipulates our desire to debate and decide true democracy as we practice it in our assemblies in our roundabouts is neither on television nor in the fake roundtables organized by macron after having insulted us and treated us as less than nothing now he points to us as a hateful fascistic and xenophobic mob but we are quite the opposite neither racist nor sexist nor homophobic we are proud to come together with our differences to build a society of solidarity we are strengthened by the diversity of our discussions at this very moment hundreds of assemblies are developing and proposing their own demands these concern real democracy social and tax justice working conditions ecological and climatic justice and the end of discrimination among the claims and strategic proposals that are the most debated we find the eradication of poverty in all its forms the transformation of institutions citizen s initiative referenda constituent assembly abolition of the privileges of elected officials the ecological transition energy injustice industrial pollution the equality and the taking into account of all regardless of their nationality people with disabilities male female equality an end to the neglect of popular neighborhoods the rural world and the dom tom we the yellow vests invite everyone to join us with their own means and abilities we call for continuation of the acts of protest act 12 against police violence at the police stations acts 13 14 to continue the occupations of the roundabouts and the economic blockades to build a massive strike starting on february 5th we call for committees to be formed at workplaces at schools and everywhere else so that this strike can be built from the bottom up by the strikers themselves let s take things into our own do not remain alone join us let s organize ourselves in a democratic autonomous and independent way this assembly of assemblies is an important step that enables us to discuss our demands and our means of action let us federate to transform society we urge all yellow vests to circulate this call if as a group of yellow vests you agree add your signature and send it to commercy assembledesassemblees gmail com do not hesitate to discuss and formulate proposals for the next assemblies of the assemblies which we are preparing for right now down with macron power to the people for the people and by the people

time wages and jobs wage and unemployment data hold the key to interest rate movements aap dan peled locally the focus of the week will be on wages and jobs in what will be the first big test of the reserve bank s neutral stance on interest rates earlier in the month rba governor philip lowe revealed his recipe for a rate cut up until that point a hike had been baked into the rba s assumptions in the event of a sustained increase in the unemployment rate and a lack of further progress towards the inflation objective lower interest rates might be appropriate at some point dr lowe told a lunchtime gathering of market economists cue sound of dropped cutlery and frantic pencil sharpening the wage price index for the fourth quarter wednesday and labour force figures thursday are the two key ingredients in the data dependent monetary policy mix at the moment the consensus view is wages will rise by 0 6 per cent over the quarter and 2 3 per cent for the year pretty much the same as the previous quarter s reading on the jobs front things are expected to remain solid with a forecast of 15 000 new jobs in january and unemployment holding at 5 per cent the wage price index will give a view on the pressures surrounding the inflation objective while the unemployment rate obviously feeds directly into the first part of lowe s recipe deutsche bank s phil odonaghoe said it stands to reason then that the market will be more sensitive to labour market reports through the opening months of 2019 than it has been for some time mr odonaghoe said particular attention needs to be paid to the wages including bonuses index which in the past has been a helpful leading indicator for wage pressures a weak result tips the balance more to a rate cut job growth slowing capital economics s ben udy s view is wage growth will continue to trudge along without the impetus of higher minimum wages we suspect that annual wage growth stagnated in the fourth quarter of 2018 mr udy said and if the labour market begins to lose momentum then wage growth will struggle to pick up much from here while employment has been one piston that has been firing consistently in a spluttering economic engine mr udy believes that may not continue for much longer we suspect that the unemployment rate is around its trough in the current cycle even a solid increase of 15 000 new jobs in january would see employment growth slow from 2 2 per cent to 2 per cent over the year to be below the average growth rate over 2018 while that should be enough to stave off any rise in the unemployment rate in january

leadership and the future of agriculture was the topic of steve censky s heuermann lecture at the university of nebraska lincoln s innovation campus earlier this week in conjunction with unl s 150th anniversary the usda deputy secretary talked specifically about the role of research and technology in feeding a rising world population after the lecture censky sat down to discuss another factor affecting the future of u s agriculture trade and the ongoing discussions for trade deals with countries like china japan mexico and canada while president trump signed an executive order withdrawing the u s from the trans pacific partnership in 2017 there have been discussions surrounding a potential bilateral trade agreement with japan which censky noted was the crown jewel of the tpp for u s agriculture toward the end of 2018 u s trade representative robert lighthizer submitted negotiating objectives to congress one of the first steps involved in establishing a trade agreement with japan japan is part of the tpp 11 so tariffs for some of our competitors whether they be australia or canada are starting to come down japan also has some trade agreements with others like the european union and their tariffs are starting to come down censky said what we re going to see unless we move quickly is that u s agriculture products are going to lose the competitive advantage that they have just because of unequal tariff treatment regarding trade the biggest country on everyone s radars right now is china following the recent trade spat involving tariffs on u s products and concerns over china s treatment of intellectual property and practices like forced technology transfer censky noted u s trade representative robert lighthizer treasury secretary steven mnuchin and usda under secretary for trade ted mckinney are in the process of discussing a trade deal with china two primary goals are getting purchase commitments from china to help make up for lost sales over the last year and to establish structural reforms to china s trade policies that have hindered u s exports in the past while achieving a trade agreement and solving these agriculture issues is a necessary part of the agreement it s not sufficient censky said the president has made it very clear that china also needs to reform its intellectual property practices it needs to stop forced transfer of technology from u s companies that want to do business in china or if they want to have a partner in china that it be majority owned by the chinese after president trump and china agreed to withhold any additional tariffs for 90 days back in december with a march 1 deadline for reaching a new trade agreement trump has indicated an extended deadline may be necessary censky said there s still a lot of work to do to reach an agreement but it s not yet certain whether there will be an extension earlier this year china approved the import of five corn and soybean biotech traits and censky noted while that s a positive step forward it highlights the challenges the u s has faced with china s biotechnology approval process some of these products that were just approved were pending in china for 5 6 7 8 years that s not a predicable or science based approval process he said while it s good that we had these approved what we re looking for is to have a science based and predictable process you shouldn t have to have a presidential summit or threats of a trade war in order to have a proper functioning approval process replacing or revamping the north american free trade agreement nafta has been a goal of president trump since before he took office while u s agriculture received some good news last year that trump canada prime minister justin trudeau and mexican president enrique peña nieto had signed the u s mexico canada agreement usmca the agreement now awaits congressional approval and while producers were anxious over withdrawing from nafta censky noted the usmca brings some new benefits for agriculture it is a good agreement it preserves duty free access we ve had for u s agriculture into mexico it cracks open new market access opportunities into canada he said this includes eliminating discriminatory treatment of u s wheat exported to canada which was automatically classed as feed grade wheat and priced accordingly and eliminating canada s class 7 milk ingredient pricing system despite these benefits censky noted we have our work cut out for us in getting congressional approval of usmca i think we in agriculture have a big task ahead of us to make sure we re educating our senators and our congressmen and women on the benefits and to make sure we re selling it he said this underscores what censky said is an ongoing challenge for agriculture raising awareness of the importance of trade the rest of the world is marching on the rest of the world is striking new trade agreements they re bringing down barriers he said i think we have a choice of whether we re going to just sit on the sidelines and see other countries get tariff advantages and preference in markets or whether we re going to join in as well but i think we have to change the conversation on trade in this country
on the agenda was how to stabilise the economy foreign direct investment employment and expectations all issues that have become top priorities for beijing s ruling communist party this year the call came from members of the chinese economist 50 forum which includes government officials and advisers who gathered in beijing for their annual meeting on saturday top chinese economists have called for more action to keep the economy investment and job market steady as the country faces growing risks including from the trade war with washington held a day after the latest round of trade talks with washington concluded the forum s co founder vice premier liu he did not attend the meeting at the diaoyutai state guesthouse liu has been leading china s trade talks team and the negotiations are expected to continue in washington next week as the two sides seek to reach a deal to end the trade war in response to market calls for large scale easing wu jinglian the spiritual leader of china s pro market reform camp said any action would depend on how long term growth potential stacked up against actual growth if the two are compatible in theory economic policies should not be changed the the 89 year old wu said in the past several years we have used demand boosting policies such as monetary injection to increase the actual growth and make it higher than the potential growth while economic stabilisation is set to dominate the government agenda this year many forum speakers believed there was no need for an all out stimulus policy forum co founder and prominent economist fan gang said beijing had a responsibility to carry out short term demand support since long term reforms both systemic changes and the ongoing supply side structural adjustment would take time forum co founder and prominent economist fan gang said beijing had a responsibility to carry out short term demand support photo xinhua when we talk about reforms they can t proceed smoothly without stable development if some structural reforms stall you have to stabilise the economy and prevent it from slowing dramatically he said giving the example of european countries and japan using negative interest rates to counter the global financial crisis he warned that if the economy performed badly the voices opposing reforms could grow louder china the world s second largest economy reported 6 6 per cent growth in gross domestic product last year the slowest pace since 1990 it is expected to slow further this year economists widely expect premier li keqiang to announce a target growth range of 6 to 6 5 per cent for this year at the annual legislative session on march 5 speaking at the forum lu lei deputy head of the state administration of foreign exchange warned that external factors including the trade war and divergent chinese and us interest rate policies could sharpen domestic problems this could have a butterfly effect a small thing could turn out to be an unpredictable risk he said with the 90 day trade war truce due to end on march 1 president xi jinping urged negotiators in beijing on friday to reach a mutually beneficial deal in next week s talks i hope you can make persistent efforts to push forward an agreement that can benefit both sides he was quoted as saying by state broadcaster cctv policymakers are closely watching for potential damage to the economy and the financial system and at the forum lu highlighted domestic risks like the rapid rise of household debt in my study of five economies i found all of them rose rapidly in the five years before the crisis hit he said without naming the economies but efforts to stabilise the economy will just buy more time they will hold off the systemic risks that will continue to be there without structural reforms
by the most straightforward measurements the u s economy is in great shape according to the bureau of labor statistics the unemployment rate has hovered around 4 percent since the start of 2018 and there are now more job openings than there are people looking for work this good news helps explain why a recent piece of bad news is so hard to believe this week the national debt crossed the 22 trillion threshold since that number is utterly impossible to comprehend a better explanation would be a comparison according to the bureau of economic analysis the u s economy produces more than 20 trillion a year this means if we could take every penny that is made by the 328 million americans over the course of 365 days we still couldn t pay off the national debt to put it another way every american s share of the debt is about 67 000 newborns take their first breath and immediately owe an amount comparable to the purchase price for a new luxury car regrettably things only get worse from here the congressional budget office projects that another 12 2 trillion in debt will be added over the next decade an amount that could easily mean 100 000 owed by every man woman and child alive in 2029 how did we get here is both an easy and a complicated question to answer the easy answer politicians love spending money but know that americans hate taxes because of this they borrow hundreds of billions of dollars every year to fill the gap the complicated answer is that hundreds of pieces of legislation passed by both parties have contributed to the debt while fighting about the past by throwing blame around can be fun for some what matters most is figuring out what s wrong now and what we can do about it in the future federal spending in the most recent fiscal year was 4 1 trillion to put that into perspective 4 1 trillion is larger than the combined economies of 16 mid sized states including arizona colorado iowa missouri nevada and wisconsin that is simply too much government for congress to oversee and too much power and control to be concentrated in washington d c left leaning pundits and politicians think the problem is that taxes are too low in reality tax revenue as a share of the economy is expected to be in line with historical averages over the next decade the real reason why annual deficits have increased so rapidly and are projected to increase even more is that federal spending consistently grows faster than the economy a primary cause of the spending growth can be linked to health care programs such as medicare and medicaid and the social security retirement program as the baby boomer generation retires these programs are expected to account for 63 cents of every new federal dollar spent over the next 10 years elected leaders have long avoided reforms to these programs that would make them sustainable for the long term changes focused on controlling the growth of future benefits can seriously improve the nation s bottom line without harming retirees the most important and powerful change that could be done right now would be for lawmakers to implement an overall spending cap that fits within current levels of taxation this approach has done wonders for switzerland which avoided large debts by prioritizing what taxpayer dollars should be spent on one would think that congress already has spending caps in the form of the annual budget however the budget process has completely broken down and they often avoid the responsibility of budgeting perhaps they would act more responsibly if the paychecks for these senators and representatives depended on having to do their job another urgent matter is restoring a real limit on the nation s debt currently the debt limit is suspended through march 1 meaning politicians can add as much debt as they want without immediate consequences a numerical debt limit should be put in place as soon as the suspension ends any subsequent increase to the debt limit must be linked to enforceable spending reforms with a goal of bringing the federal budget to balance within the next decade congress should at a minimum match a dollar of debt limit increase with a dollar of real spending cuts these changes would force republicans and democrats to make politically difficult choices the alternative choice to spend and spend and spend is the easy one today but handing the bill to those yet to be born is a serious injustice click here to get the fox business app the best time to set the stage for a balanced budget is during a roaring economy failing to take advantage of today s prosperity could doom future generations to high taxes and economic stagnation america s children deserve better than that david ditch is a researcher in the grover m hermann center for the federal budget at the heritage foundation heritage org
mexico will inject 3 9 billion into ailing state oil company pemex officials said on friday promising to strengthen its finances and prevent a further credit downgrade although investors saw the plan as only a short term fix trend reports referring to reuters falling oil output corruption and high labor costs have contributed to the decline of the company that was once a symbol of national pride it now holds roughly 106 billion in financial debt the highest of any national oil company in latin america fitch and moody s rate its credit one notch above junk fitch said on friday that the plan which includes additional tax cuts more government spending on the company and debt refinancing would likely not be enough to prevent continued deterioration in pemex s credit quality the agency cited an ongoing significant level of underinvestment for pemex pemex will receive 1 8 billion in pension liability monetization as part of the new plan and finances will be helped by a corruption clampdown officials said in a presentation that was short on details they vowed the mexican government will not take on new debt in 2019 pemex must make more than 27 billion in debt payments over the next three years investors said they had expected stronger measures and while encouraged by government vows of support they said the plan offered only short term relief the measures are not a long term fix and won t be enough to stabilize oil output said edward glossop latin america economist at capital economics if oil prices and output decline further he estimated yields on pemex bonds could rise by around 1 percent this year the price fell after the announcement for pemex s most heavily traded bond on friday maturing in 2047 as its yield rose 14 basis points according to marketaxess data the price on a pemex bond maturing in 2024 also dropped with its yield up 32 basis points reflecting bondholder skepticism of the plan what s more the measures will do little to shore up pemex s standing with the ratings agencies said julie murphy a latin america analyst at jp morgan we are extremely disappointed with the measures she said the mexican peso weakened by more than half a percent against the dollar after the announcement before recovering later on friday
the capitalist economic crisis is increasingly dashing the hopes of many working people and some among middle class layers that their children s lives will be an improvement over their own low wages mounting debts and rising rents and housing prices have made forming one s own family unaffordable for more and more working class youth under the ravages of dog eat dog capitalism our families whatever their problems are ultimately the only institution that working people can turn to for help in dealing with health and housing crises today the number of young adults still living in their parents homes is the highest in 75 years fully a third of all young people 24 million of those aged 18 to 34 lived with their parents in 2015 more youth lived with their parents than with a spouse in 2016 the u s census bureau reports in a number of states the figures are higher in mississippi it s 37 percent massachusetts 38 percent california and florida 39 percent new york 40 percent and almost half in new jersey 46 percent in 2005 the majority of young adults in 35 states lived independently in their own place a decade later the number of states where the majority of young people lived on their own had fallen to just six one big factor affecting this is workers declining income in 1975 one quarter of young men had incomes below 30 000 a year measured in 2015 dollars by 2016 the figure was 41 percent at the same time student debt has ballooned between 1989 and 2013 the amount owed on student loans nearly tripled from a median of 6 000 to 17 300 this has spurred many graduates to move back with their parents putting off plans for marriage or raising children in the 1970s 8 in 10 people married by the time they turned 30 the census report said today not until the age of 45 have 8 in 10 people married the u s birthrate hit a record low in 2017 marking years of steady decline in fact current childbirth statistics are 16 percent below the number needed for the u s population to stay even as older generations die out the only thing that keeps the u s population growing is immigration the carnage being visited on young people by the crisis of capitalism today is having a big impact on their choices about how to live there are more young adults today who live with their parents other family members are packed in with roommates or live alone the census report said over the past 40 years the proportion of young people who were living with a spouse fell by half from 57 percent to 27 percent unaffordable family formation large tech companies like amazon are notorious for hiring new college graduates at crappy wages and pushing them to get places in gaggles describing how this leads to what he calls unaffordable family formation steve sailer says in an unz review blog it helps them squeeze more out of workers the firms like being in places too expensive to raise a family families are distractions at least in the short run and this process lets always greedy landlords push rents in these areas up and up forcing workers looking to raise a family to either give up their plans or move away so young people in their late 20s to early 30s employed at the company s headquarters in seattle end up living with gangs of roommates who face the same squeeze instead of forming a family and settling down the same situation will play out in queens new york and crystal city virginia if amazon moves forward with new satellite headquarters there for decades workers moved to big u s cities for jobs where they would earn more money than in rural areas in steel plants in chicago shipbuilding yards in oakland oil refineries in houston and auto assembly plants in detroit but this is no longer true the bosses have attacked the unions lowered pay and moved all over the country over the past couple of decades jobs like manufacturing and office work equalized between cities and rural areas wrote fortune magazine jan 22 workers in these jobs can no longer get much of a pay bump by moving into town and housing and rental prices make affordable family formation somewhat easier outside the cities
i don t know what beto s going to do hopefully run against john cornyn for senate but i do know the other 3 bs are staffing up for their campaigns bernie biden bloomberg bloomberg and biden are both on the worst democraps who want to be president list and i ve written about why he s unfit to be president a lot so why keep harping on it well he s going to announce soon and andrew cockburn penned a fantastic essay no joe joe biden s disastrous legislative legacy in the march issue ofmagazine this is the cover of the issue biden he wrote has long served as high priest of the doctrine that our legislative problems derive merely from superficial disagreements rather than fundamental differences over matters of principle i believe that we have to end the divisive partisan politics that is ripping this country apart he declared in the rose garden in 2015 renouncing a much anticipated white house run it s mean spirited it s petty and it s gone on for much too long i don t believe like some do that it s naïve to talk to republicans i don t think we should look on republicans as our enemies given his success in early polling it would seem that this message resonates with many voters at least when they are talking to pollsters after all according to orthodox wisdom there is no more commendable virtue in american political custom and practice than bipartisanship politicians on the stump fervently assure voters that they will strive with every sinew to work across the aisle to deliver commonsense solutions and those who express the sentiment eloquently can expect widespread approval barack obama famously launched himself toward the white house with his 2004 speech at the democratic national convention proclaiming that there is not a liberal america and a conservative america only a united states of america by tapping into these popular tropes the system is broken why can t congress just get along the practitioners of bipartisanship conveniently gloss over the more evident reality that it was bipartisan accord after all that brought us the permanent war economy the war on drugs the mass incarceration of black people 1990s welfare reform wall street deregulation and the consequent 16 trillion in bank bailouts the 2001 authorization for use of military force and other atrocities too numerous to mention if the system is indeed broken it is because interested parties are doing their best to break it amen and as i ve been saying for months biden s campaign will be based on a return to normalcy that normalcy rather than admit this biden has long found it more profitable to assert that political divisions can be settled by men endowed with statesmanlike vision and goodwill in other words men such as himself his frequent eulogies for public figures have tended to play heavily on this theme thus his memorial speech for republican standard bearer john mccain dwelled predictably on the cross party nature of their relationship beginning with his opening my name is joe biden i m a democrat and i loved john mccain continuing in that vein he related how he and mccain had once been chided by their respective party leaderships for spending so much time in each other s company on the senate floor and referred fondly to the days when senators teddy kennedy and james eastland the latter a die hard racist and ruthless suppressor of civil rights bills would fight like hell on civil rights and then go have lunch together down in the senate dining room clearly there is merit in the ability to craft compromise between opposing viewpoints in order to produce an effective result john ritch formerly a us ambassador and top aide on the senate foreign relations committee worked closely with biden for two decades and has nothing but praise for his negotiating skills i ve never seen anyone better at presiding over a group of politicians who represent conflicting egos and interests and using a combination of conciliation humor and muscle to cajole them into an agreed way forward ritch told me recently joe biden has learned the skills to get things done in washington and i ve seen him apply it equally with foreign leaders the value of compromise however depends on what result is produced and who benefits thereby mccain s record had at least a few commendable features such as his opposition to torture though never of course war but it is hard to find much admirable in the character of a tireless defender of institutional racism like strom thurmond hence trent lott s words of praise regretting that the old racist had lost when he ran as a dixiecrat in the 1948 presidential election had been deemed terminally unacceptable it fell to biden to highlight some redeeming qualities when called on inevitably to deliver thurmond s eulogy following the latter s death in 2003 at the age of one hundred biden reminisced with affection about the unlikely friendship between the deceased and himself despite having arrived at the senate at age twenty nine emboldened angered and outraged about the treatment of african americans in this country he said he nevertheless found common cause on important issues with the late senator from south carolina who had been wont to describe civil rights activists as red pawns and publicity seekers one such issue as branko marcetic has pitilessly chronicled in jacobin was a shared opposition to federally mandated busing in the effort to integrate schools an opposition biden predicted would be ultimately adopted by liberal holdouts the black community justifiably is jittery biden admitted to the washington post in 1975 with regard to his position i ve made it if not respectable i ve made it reasonable for longstanding liberals to begin to raise the questions i ve been the first to raise in the liberal community here on the floor biden was responding to criticism of legislation he had introduced that effectively barred the department of health education and welfare from compelling communities to bus pupils using federal funds this amendment was meant to be an alternative to a more extreme proposal put forward by a friend of biden s hall of fame racist jesse helms biden had initially supported helms s version nevertheless the washington post described biden s amendment as denying the possibility for equal educational opportunities to minority youngsters trapped in ill equipped inner city schools edward brooke of massachusetts then the sole african american senator called biden s measure the greatest symbolic defeat for civil rights since 1964 by the 1980s biden had begun to see political gold in the harsh anti drug legislation that had been pioneered by drug warriors such as nelson rockefeller and richard nixon and would ultimately lead to the age of mass incarceration for black americans one of his senate staffers at the time recalls him remarking whenever people hear the words drugs and crime i want them to think joe biden insisting on anonymity this former staffer recollected how biden s team had to think up excuses for new hearings on drugs and crime every week any connection no matter how remote he wanted cops at every public meeting you d have thought he was running for chief of police biden huddles with strom thurmond after the judiciary committee voted 7 7 on the nomination of clarence thomas 1991 the ensuing legislation might also have brought to voters minds the name of the venerable thurmond biden s partner in this effort together the pair sponsored the 1984 comprehensive crime control act which among other repressive measures abolished parole for federal prisoners and cut the amount of time by which sentences could be reduced for good behavior the bipartisan duo also joined hands to cheerlead the passage of the 1986 anti drug abuse act and its 1988 follow on which cumulatively introduced mandatory sentences for drug possession biden later took pride in reminding audiences that through the leadership of senator thurmond and myself and others congress had passed a law mandating a five year sentence with no parole for anyone caught with a piece of crack cocaine no bigger than quarter that is they created the infamous disparity in penalties between those caught with powder cocaine white people and those carrying crack black people biden also unblushingly cited his and thurmond s leading role in enacting laws allowing for the execution of drug dealers convicted of homicide and expanding the practice of civil asset forfeiture law enforcement s plunder of property belonging to people suspected of crimes even if they are neither charged nor convicted despite pleas from the naacp and the aclu the 1990s brought no relief from biden s crime crusade he vied with the first bush administration to introduce ever more draconian laws including one proposing to expand the number of offenses for which the death penalty would be permitted to fifty one bill clinton quickly became a reliable ally upon his 1992 election and biden encouraged him to maintain crime as a democratic initiative with suitably tough legislation the ensuing 1994 violent crime control and law enforcement act passed with enthusiastic administration pressure would consign millions of black americans to a life behind bars in subsequent years as his crime legislation particularly on mandatory sentences attracted efforts at reform biden began expressing a certain remorse i am part of the problem that i have been trying to solve since then because i think the disparity is way out of line he declared at a senate hearing in 2008 however there is little indication that his words were matched by actions especially after he moved to the vice presidency the following year the executive director of the criminal justice policy foundation eric sterling who worked on the original legislation in the house as a congressional counsel told me during the eight years he was vice president i never saw him take a leadership role in the area of drug policy never saw him get out in front on the issue like he did on same sex marriage for example biden could have taken a stronger line privately or publicly and he did not while many black americans will neither forgive nor forget how they along with relatives and friends were accorded the lifetime stigma of a felony conviction many other americans are only now beginning to count the costs of these viciously repressive initiatives as a result criminal justice reform has emerged as a popular issue across the political spectrum including among conservatives eager to burnish otherwise illiberal credentials ironically this has led in theory to a modest unraveling of a portion of biden s bipartisan crime fighting legacy last december as donald trump s erratic regime was falling into increasing disarray the political media class briefly united in celebration of an exercise in bipartisanship the first step act billed as a long overdue overhaul of the criminal justice system the legislation received rapturous reviews for its display of cross party cooperation headlined by jared kushner s partnership with liberal talk show host van jones in truth this was a very modest first step it offered the possibility of release to some 2 600 federal inmates whose relief from excessive sentences would require the goodwill of both prosecutors and police as well as forbidding some especially barbaric practices in federal prisons such as the shackling of pregnant inmates overall it amounted to little more than a textbook exercise in aisle bridging a triumph of form over substance in the near term it s unlikely that there will be further bipartisan attempts to chip away at biden s legislative legacy a legacy that includes an inconsistent to put it mildly record on abortion rights roe v wade went too far he told an interviewer in 1974 i don t think that a woman has the sole right to say what should happen to her body for some years his votes were consistent with that view he supported the notorious hyde amendment prohibiting any and all federal funding for abortions and fathered the biden amendment that banned the use of us foreign aid for abortion research as the 1980s wore on however and biden s presidential ambitions started to swell he began to cast fewer antiabortion votes with some exceptions and led the potent opposition to judge robert bork s supreme court nomination as chairman of the senate judiciary committee then came clarence thomas even before anita hill reluctantly surfaced with her convincing recollections of unpleasant encounters with the porn obsessed judge biden was fumbling his momentous responsibility of directing the hearings as jane mayer and jill abramson report in strange justice their book about the thomas nomination battle biden s questions were sometimes so long and convoluted that thomas would forget what the question was biden prided himself on his legal scholarship mayer and abramson suggest and thus his questions were often designed to show off legal acumen rather than to elicit answers more damningly biden not only allowed fellow committee members to mount a sustained barrage of vicious attacks on hill he wrapped up the hearings without calling at least two potential witnesses who could have convincingly corroborated hill s testimony and by extension indicated that the nominee had perjured himself on a sustained basis throughout the hearings as mayer and abramson write hill s reputation was not foremost among the committee s worries the democrats in general and biden in particular appear to have been far more concerned with their own reputations and feared a republican stoked public backlash if they aired more details of thomas s sexual proclivities hill was therefore thrown to the wolves and america was saddled with a supreme court justice of limited legal qualifications and extreme right wing views which he had taken pains to deny while under oath fifteen years later biden would repeat this exercise in hearings on the supreme court nomination of samuel alito yet another grim product of the republican judicial selection machinery true to form in his opening round of questions biden droned on for the better part of half an hour allowing alito barely five minutes to explain his views as the torrent of verbiage washed over the hearing room fellow democratic senator patrick leahy could only glower at biden in impotent frustration biden s record on race and women did him little damage with the voters of delaware who regularly returned him to the senate with comfortable margins on race at least biden affected to believe that delawareans views might be closer to those of his old buddy thurmond than those of the northeast liberal he sometimes claimed to be you don t know my state he told fox as he geared up for his first attempt on the white house in 2006 my state was a slave state my state is a border state my state has the eighth largest black population in the country my state is anything a northeast liberal state months later in front of a largely republican audience in south carolina he joked that the only reason delaware had fought with the north in the civil war was because we couldn t figure out how to get to the south there were a couple of states in the way whether or not most delawareans are proud of their slaveholding history there are some causes that they or at least the dominant power brokers in the state hold especially dear foremost among them is delaware s status as a freewheeling tax haven state laws have made delaware the domicile of choice for corporations especially banks and it competes for business with more notorious entrepôts such as the cayman islands over half of all us public companies are legally headquartered there it s a corporate whore state of course the anonymous former biden staffer remarked to me offhandedly in a recent conversation he stressed that in a small state with thirty five thousand bank employees apart from all the lawyers and others from the financial industry biden was never going to stray too far from the industry s priorities we were discussing bankruptcy an issue that has highlighted biden s fealty to the banks unsurprisingly biden was long a willing foot soldier in the campaign to emasculate laws allowing debtors relief from loans they cannot repay as far back as 1978 he helped negotiate a deal rolling back bankruptcy protections for graduates with federal student loans and in 1984 worked to do the same for borrowers with loans for vocational schools even when the ostensible objective lay elsewhere such as drug related crime biden did not forget his banker friends thus the 1990 crime control act with biden as chief sponsor further limited debtors ability to take advantage of bankruptcy protections these initiatives however were only precursors to the finance lobby s magnum opus the 2005 bankruptcy abuse prevention and consumer protection act this carefully crafted flail of the poor made it almost impossible for borrowers to get traditional clean slate chapter 7 bankruptcy under which debt forgiveness enables people to rebuild their lives and businesses instead the law subjected them to the far harsher provisions of chapter 13 effectively turning borrowers into indentured servants of institutions like the credit card companies headquartered in delaware it made its way onto the statute books after a lopsided 74 25 vote bipartisanship with biden naturally voting in favor it was in fact the second version of the bill an earlier iteration had passed congress in 2000 with biden s support but president clinton refused to sign it at the urging of the first lady who had been briefed on its iniquities by elizabeth warren a harvard law school professor at the time warren witheringly summarized biden s advocacy of the earlier bill in a 2002 paper his energetic work on behalf of the credit card companies has earned him the affection of the banking industry and protected him from any well funded challengers for his senate seat furthermore she added tartly this important part of senator biden s legislative work also appears to be missing from his web site and publicity releases no doubt coincidentally the credit card giant mbna was biden s largest contributor for much of his senate career while also employing his son hunter as an executive and later as a well remunerated consultant it should go without saying then that biden was among the ninety senators on one of the fatal to the rest of us legislative gifts presented to wall street back in the clinton era the gramm leach bliley act of 1999 the act repealed the hallowed depression era glass steagall legislation that severed investment banking from commercial banking thereby permitting the combined operations to gamble with depositors money and ultimately ushering in the 2008 crash the worst vote i ever cast in my entire time in the united states senate admitted biden in december 2016 as he prepared to leave office seventeen years too late he explained that the act had allowed banks with deposits to take on risky investments putting the whole system at risk in the meantime of course he had been vice president of the united states for eight years and thus in a position to address the consequences of his and his fellow senators actions by using his power to press for criminal investigations his longtime faithful aide ted kaufman in fact had taken over his senate seat and was urging such probes yet there is not the slightest sign that biden used his influence to encourage pursuit of the financial fraudsters as he opined in a 2018 talk at the brookings institution i don t think five hundred billionaires are the reason we re in trouble the folks at the top aren t bad guys characteristically he described gross inequalities in wealth mainly as a threat to bipartisanship this gap is yawning and it s having the effect of pulling us apart you see the politics of it biden s rightward bipartisan inclinations are not the only source of his alleged appeal in an imitation of hillary clinton s tactics in the lead up to the 2016 election biden has advertised himself as the candidate of experience indeed in his self estimation he is the most qualified person in the country to be president it s a claim mainly rooted in foreign policy a field where theoretically partisan politics are deposited at the water s edge and biden s negotiating talents and expertise are seen to their best advantage he boasts the same potent acquaintances with world leaders that helped earn clinton a similar most qualified label on her failed presidential job application and like her has been a reliable hawk not least when occupying the high profile chairmanship of the senate foreign relations committee an ardent proponent of nato expansion into eastern europe an ill conceived initiative that has served as an enduring provocation of russian hostility toward the west biden voted enthusiastically to authorize bush s 2003 invasion of iraq was a major proponent of clinton s war in kosovo and pushed for military intervention in sudan biden s claims of experience on the world stage cannot be denied true the experience has been routinely disastrous for those on the receiving end but on the other hand that is a common fate for those subjected under any administration to the operations of our foreign policy apparatus given biden s all too evident shortcomings in the fields of domestic and foreign policy defenders inevitably retreat to the electability argument which contends that he is the only democrat on the horizon capable of beating trump a view that biden naturally endorses specifically this notion rests on the belief that biden has unequaled appeal among the white working class voters that many democrats are eager to court to be fair biden has earned high ratings from the afl cio thanks to his support for matters such as union organizing rights and a higher minimum wage on the other hand he also supported nafta in 1994 and permanent normal trade relations with china in 2000 two votes that sounded the death knell for america s manufacturing economy regardless of how justified his pro labor reputation may be however it s far from clear that the working class holds biden in any special regard his two presidential races imploded before any blue collar workers had a chance to vote for him it is this fact that makes the electability argument so puzzling biden s initial bid for the prize in 1988 famously blew up when rivals unkindly publicized his plagiarism of a stump speech given by neil kinnock a british labour party politician in britain kinnock was known as the welsh windbag which may have encouraged the logorrheic biden to feel a kinship biden partisans pointed out that he had cited kinnock on previous occasions though he didn t always remember to do so either way it was a bizarre snafu it also emerged that biden had been incorporating chunks of speeches from both bobby and jack kennedy along with hubert humphrey in his remarks without attribution although reportedly some of this was the work of speechwriter pat caddell another gaffe helped upend biden s second white house bid in 2007 when he referred to barack obama in patronizing terms as the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy the campaign cratered at the very first hurdle the iowa caucuses where biden came in fifth with less than 1 percent of the votes it was humiliating recalled the ex staffer the gaffes seem to take physical form on occasion he has a bit of a me too problem a leading female democratic activist and fund raiser told me referring to his overly tactile approach to interacting with women we never had a talk when he wasn t stroking my back he has already faced heckling on the topic and videos of this behavior during the course of public events and photo ops have been widely circulated further to the issue of biden s assurances that he is the man to beat trump is the awkward fact that as the former staffer told me he lacks the discipline to build the nuts and bolts of a modern presidential campaign biden hated having to take orders from axelrod and the other obama people as a vice presidential candidate in 2008 campaign aides used to say to him i ve got three words for you air force two my informant stressed that biden sucks at fund raising he never had to try very hard in delaware staff would do it for him certainly biden s current campaign funds would appear to confirm this contention his pac american possibilities had raised only two and a half million dollars by the end of 2018 a surprisingly insignificant amount for a veteran senator and two term vice president furthermore although the pac s stated purpose is to support candidates who believe in american possibilities less than a quarter of the money had found its way to democratic candidates in time for the november midterms encouraging speculation that biden is not really that serious about the essential brass tacks of a presidential campaign which would include building a strong base of support among democratic officeholders other organizations in the biden universe behave similarly expending much of their income on staff salaries and little on their ostensible function according to an exhaustive new york times investigation salaries accounted for 45 percent of spending by the beau biden foundation for the protection of children in 2016 and 2017 similarly three quarters of the money the biden cancer initiative spent in 2017 went toward salaries and other compensation including over half a million dollars for its president greg simon formerly the executive director of biden s cancer moonshot task force during the obama administration outside the inner circle of senior aides there does not appear to be an extended biden network among political professionals standing ready to raise money and perform other tasks necessary to a white house bid in the way that hillary clinton had a network across the political world composed of people who had worked for her and her husband biden doesn t have that his former staffer told me because he s indifferent to staff it s a sentiment that s been expressed to me by many in the election industry including a veteran democratic campaign strategist everyone else is getting everything set up to go once the trigger is pulled this individual told me recently i myself have firm offers from the harris and booker campaigns the biden people talked to me too but they could only say if we run we d love to bring you into the fold at the start of the new year biden must have been living in the best of all possible worlds as he engaged in well publicized ruminations on whether or not to run he was enjoying a high profile with commensurate benefits of sizable book sales and hundred thousand dollar speaking engagements even more importantly biden found himself relevant again you re either on the way up he likes to say or you re on the way down which is why the temptation to reject the lessons of his two hopelessly bungled white house campaigns has been so overwhelming regardless of the current election cycle s endgame though it s safe to assume that his undimmed ego will never permit any reflection on whether voters who have been eagerly voting for change will ever really settle for uncle joe champion of yesterday s sordid compromises
when we were students we hated red tapism we spoke and wrote against it and vowed to change it in the future but after being recruited into government service we forgot our old promise or dared not to talk about it young public servants turned into the most obedient disciples of the mammoth bureaucracy they turn into a group of hypnotised followers of the black magic of bureaucracy which goes on with its ever increasing vigour and dominance it doesn t change although this model is fundamentally flawed and it warrants massive corrections for the sake of business and economic growth in the country bureaucracy is needed to run the administration of the government it is the body of public servants who are authorised to ensure that people follow a set of rules while opening and running their businesses nevertheless in practice bureaucracy impedes businesses rather than streamlining them bureaucracy has more sanding effects than greasing ones a world bank study 2017 found that the higher the level of bureaucracy the higher the level of corruption the case of latin american countries such as argentina brazil venezuela and columbia are testimony to this hypothesis the wb study also vindicates that the level of corruption doesn t necessarily rise with the level of poverty rather a positive association between bureaucracy and corruption is more evident across nations many african countries with acute poverty have lower level of corruption than that in many latin american countries where institutions are often debased in contrast east asian countries such as japan south korea singapore and taiwan enjoyed a booming time of business particularly from 1965 to 1995 when they minimised the intervention of bureaucracy into their rules of business the wb termed the case as the east asian miracle which includes the four asian tigers as mentioned above the emerging economies rapidly streamlined their bureaucracy to make it user friendly even for foreign enterprises as a result foreign direct investment fdi easily flowed into those countries augmenting labour productivity and employment bureaucracy invariably breeds corruption and lowers growth by complicating the normal flow of businesses bureaucracy is anti business by default by design by function and bangladesh can t be an exception in this regard bangladesh s bureaucracy finds fdi as a threat to its existence mainly because foreign experts easily expose the level of inefficiency and disguised unemployment in bureaucracy bureaucrats prefer seeing a big part of the annual development programme adp remain unused rather than inviting foreign involvement that will ensure quality work and better use that s why the construction cost of roads or rails per mile in bangladesh turns out to be one of the highest in the world bureaucracy abhors accepting fixed completion dates for the projects since flexible deadlines are conducive to the continuity of rent seeking all mega projects including the padma bridge or the metro surface train are testimony to this claim the total financing cost reaches to an insane figure for most public projects making the overall rate of return for the country much lower than expected because businesses thrive on the rapid progress of public projects in the late 1970s china began its reform that minimised the bureaucratic rules for enterprises and the country reaped the harvest of double digit growth for three decades in a row since the unprecedented era of growth and development that defines what modern china means right now in the early 1990s india dismantled the license raj the all pervasive regime of bureaucratic permission ism the raj lasted for 40 years when india s average growth couldn t exceed even a number as low as 3 percent which some economists derisively termed as hindu growth a satirical connotation to mean the plain and simple life of a hindu saint the country entered a new era of growth and dynamism since then evidencing more than 6 percent growth for the subsequent decades simply ripping up the red tapes described what modern india is right now in the latest doing business index 2019 constructed by the world bank bangladesh secured the lowest possible position in south asia india tops it ensuring the least bureaucratic business environment in the region not a few years ago was india s ranking more than 120 now it s only 77 out of 190 nations included in the wb study the lower the ranking the lower the bureaucratic tangles of doing businesses in the country if we proceed serially for south asia the ranking for bhutan turns out to be 81 sri lanka 100 nepal 110 pakistan 136 maldives 139 afghanistan 167 and myanmar 171 and the ranking for bangladesh is as low as 176 actually this is not only the poorest ranking in south asia but also one of the lowest positions in the world there are only 14 countries below bangladesh and most of them are torn by civil war terrorism racial discrimination sectarian violence and ethnic cleansing those countries such as syria chad congo libya south sudan eritrea somalia and the like are in no way comparable to a stable country like bangladesh simply within the space of the normal countries bangladesh s position is the lowest in the ease of doing business thanks to its all pervasive bureaucracy and unfriendly business policies it s a shame and it s a threat to all future prospects of business in the country if the nation can still manage the second highest growth figure of the region just close to india s bangladesh wouldn t have been far below the double digit growth had the country removed the stumbling blocks of bureaucracy from the path of doing businesses red tapism is killing the potentials of the economy when internally disturbed countries such as benin zimbabwe sudan ethiopia burundi angola and liberia lie above bangladesh in the ranking the claim that there must have remained some defects in bangladesh s bureaucracy can t be ruled out it s rusty and most of its characteristics are deeply stained and thus hard to remove when retired bureaucrats are placed at the top positions of major institutions bureaucracy is reenergised and revitalised by design deserting any hope of reforms or innovations that practice is at the root of bangladesh s ingrained bureaucracy which remains sluggish and backward looking mainly due to the government s rehabilitation practice of retired bureaucrats this vicious circle must be broken to make institutions more dynamic and innovative the way china india and south korea have carried out their pro market reforms and they succeeded in accelerating business it can t be argued that retired bureaucrats are less meritorious it s not a question of simply merit or talent rather it s a question of professional habits attitudes and outlook a retired bureaucrat is habitually a person of compliance of rules and regulations without asking its effectiveness to economic outcome and business expansion a man with a professional habit of wholesale compliance is subconsciously reluctant to confront existing rules and regulations no matter how outdated they are he or she is less likely to confront existing circulars more likely to ask what the rule is and less likely to ask why and a man who is afraid of asking why or how whether the rule is good or bad for the newer reality of the business world can t be a reformist either designing reforms also require deep rooted academic backgrounds theoretical knowledge and expertise most of which are lacking in bureaucracy because of its grooming process bureaucrats are subject to frequent transfers between various ministries making them jacks of all trades and masters of none that doesn t happen for academics or other professional practitioners who are selectively placed in the leading positions of most institutions in the developed western world this makes a big difference in policymaking and dynamism in those countries the answer to the question of why india was able to make commendable strides forward in the doing business index lies in how the regime placed knowledgeable experts in leading most of its financial institutions instead of deploying unquestioning retired bureaucrats in contrast regimes in bangladesh look for retired public servants with administrative footprints of dutifulness and sometimes partisan loyalty but no track records of innovations or advocacy to crown most top positions of its institutions supportive to businesses and that paid off mercilessly by dumping the country in the lowest segment of the doing business index for ages particularly since the early 1990s a time during which when most of our neighbouring countries stepped up in the same index alarmingly the upper positions of other lower growth nations such as pakistan and afghanistan invariably warn us that our institutional leaderships must be changed private investment is the leading component of business expansion in any country the share of private investment in bangladesh s gdp remained stubbornly stagnant at 22 percent for a decade prior to 2015 recently it has marginally inched up to 23 percent the main reason why bangladesh s investment ratio has edged up from 26 percent to 30 percent is the increment in the government part of investment that rose from 4 percent to 7 percent in the last 10 years but that is not necessarily a good sign because higher public investment is likely to crowd out some segments of private investment so the main point of business expansion is to boost private investment including fdi the government appointed a retired bureaucrat to head the country s board of investment boi which couldn t boost neither private investment nor fdi considerably fdi remained as low as one percent of gdp for years since the late 2000s during its performance boi gradually turned anaemic and eventually succumbed to death quite naturally in the mid 2010s bangladesh investment development authority bida was born from the ashes of boi but again the government chose to appoint a retired bureaucrat to make the leader of bida initially its leader vowed to achieve bangladesh s ranking in the doing business index at 100 or even below but no improvements took place practically rather a country like afghanistan jumped above bangladesh in the index these institutions require massive reforms and retired public servants are not likely to be aggressive reformers for sure this is historically true for the whole subcontinent that still drags the legacy of the outmoded bureaucracy which originated from the dire need of the british rulers to harness benefits from colonial india for centuries the british themselves transformed its bureaucracy to move in tandem with the modern world and so did australia or canada but bangladesh didn t when key institutions covering the tasks of central banking private and public bank management the capital market investment promotion public private partnership strategic development goals insurance marketing and infrastructure financing are headed by mostly retired bureaucrats expecting for a gradually easing business environment turns out to be simply an absurdity bureaucracy believes in replacing one rule by another which may be thornier than before making the overall progress of business almost impossible as a result the growth of a purely professional business community has been discouraged in bangladesh s context rather profitable for businesspersons is the art of achieving political clout before learning the abcs of business now top business magnates occupy more than 60 percent seats in parliament the corresponding figure for legal practitioners is around 10 percent and that for academics is as awfully low as 2 percent telling at least partly why the country does so poorly in the knowledge economy index our institutions hardly see academics at their leading positions simply the businesspersons prefer to earn more political power to circumvent bureaucratic tangles those who fail to do so mainly resort to bribing the government apparatus that says why the level of corruption is so high in a country where red tapism eclipses all walks of business bribes and power feed each other making a healthy growth of business almost impossible a high growth country may experience a high level of corruption if bureaucratic impediments are conserved purposefully by retired bureaucrats who administrate the key financial institutions this mania generates a vicious circle which has three manifestations i parliament is being gradually occupied by businesspersons ii both bank defaults and illicit financial transfers are on the rise without any sign of abating and finally iii growth in the ratio of private investment to gdp moves at a snail s pace the reforms that are intended to improve bangladesh s ranking in the ease of doing business index should include a bunch of non typical and courageous steps such as i appointing knowledgeable and innovative experts at the policymaking positions of all institutions instead of just obedient retired bureaucrats ii appointing a dynamic minister at the helm of bida and make him or her submit annual investment report to parliament iii assign a minister to run the board of revenue since a poor fiscal capacity can t help businesses grow iv select the central bank governor from a pool of renowned economists as is the practice of most developed and emerging nations and empower him or her with reasonable independence in policymaking v make the capital market transparent and powerful so that culprits can be punished in an exemplary way vi encourage small and medium businesses rather than oiling the oily heads and vii the monitoring of the government over all financial institutions must be impartial and communicative to the public in summary red tapism is contributing to concentration of wealth income inequality bank defaults and moral hazards for otherwise honest entrepreneurs slow growth of employment and social frustrations debility in fdi and a growth performance of the economy lower than its potential mark which is close to 10 percent a structural change in the leadership of all financial institutions by engaging expertise and knowledge is the precondition to ensuring massive reforms that can foster faster growth and rapid development for the economy dr biru paksha paul is professor of economics at the state university of new york at cortland his new book is empowering economic growth for

stephen prince was aboard the silver whisper a luxury cruise ship docked in french polynesia sipping his morning coffee from sparkling china as he lamented a tax break that was about to save him millions of dollars the founder of a private company that makes plastic gift cards prince is among the wealthy elite who stand to benefit enormously from the trump tax cuts passed in 2017 he estimates that his tax bill this year will be 3 million less than it would have been absent the changes yet prince a democrat from nashville tennessee is none too pleased about his windfall he believes the trump tax cuts are misguided and ultimately bad for the country even as they pad his already robust bank account i m pissed off about it said prince speaking via facetime during a four month around the world cruise with his wife prince occupies a peculiar spot on today s highly charged ideological spectrum a successful entrepreneur he made a fortune with his company national business products and is now enjoying the fruits of his labor as he approaches retirement yet when prince scrutinizes the laws that govern his payments to the treasury department he sees an inequitable system that asks too little of him and his peers and too much of those with not much to spare people like me are not all greedy he continued turning his phone around to reveal dawn breaking over the south pacific we have to show that we have some concern for the country and that we re willing to pay some taxes the sweeping reorganization of the tax code is affecting americans unevenly corporations benefited tremendously many have reported higher profits and increased payments to shareholders some companies offered workers bonuses but many lower and middle income earners will not see their tax bills fall by much if at all instead the vast majority of individuals who stand to gain from the tax cuts are business owners and those who earn substantial income through pass through entities that is people like prince most of those in line to benefit from the trump tax cuts are not complaining plenty of business owners and investors cheered the changes as good for themselves and the economy but prince has found camaraderie among an ad hoc group of wealthy individuals known as the patriotic millionaires founded in 2010 by morris pearl a former blackrock executive the loose knit group advocates higher taxes on businesses and the wealthy in recent years they have met with legislators in washington and various state capitals testified before congress and endorsed candidates who endorse higher taxes on the rich we re very concerned about this huge inequality thing said pearl and the tax cut was designed to make the rich richer now retired pearl is frustrated that his income from investments is not taxed at a higher rate i don t work at all but i m making more money than most people who do work and i m paying less taxes than they do he said it s a pretty good deal if you can get it but it s not good for the country a monstrosity this is not the first time millionaires have voiced their enthusiasm for higher taxation in 2011 president barack obama introduced the so called buffett rule named after the billionaire investor warren buffett who has spoken out in favor of higher taxes for the rich the tax would have applied a minimum rate of 30 percent on individuals earning more than 1 million a year in an op ed in the times buffett lamented that his tax rate was lower than any of the other 20 people in his office and called for changes to the tax code that would ask more of him and less of middle class wage earners my friends and i have been coddled long enough by a billionaire friendly congress buffett wrote it s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice the buffett rule was never enacted and last year buffett of all people cheered the trump tax cuts calling them a huge tailwind for american companies in recent weeks the prospect of higher taxes on the rich has once again entered the national discourse rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y proposed a tax rate of 70 percent on income earned above 10 million sen elizabeth warren d mass called for a 2 percent annual tax on all assets owned by households with a net worth of 50 million or more and an additional 1 percent billionaire surtax and while the patriotic millionaires broadly cheer such proposals while refraining from endorsing either plan many high profile billionaires even those with left wing leanings swiftly pushed back former new york city mayor michael bloomberg who is considering running for president as a democrat called warren s idea probably unconstitutional former starbucks chief executive howard schultz who is considering running for president as an independent called the policy proposal ridiculous the swift pushback from bloomberg and schultz was a reminder of just how far outside the mainstream the patriotic millionaires views are for the wealthy even the liberal ones eric schoenberg another member of the group estimates that the trump tax cuts will save him tens of thousands of dollars this year and millions in the years to come our tax system is a monstrosity said schoenberg an investor who also teaches at columbia university it s terrible in ways that have been perpetually slanted toward the rich and i say this as some one who has done quite well in life schoenberg has emerged as one of the most outspoken members of the group taking to the internet to break down his tax returns had the trump tax cuts been in effect in 2016 he would have saved some 50 000 on his taxes that year he said i m not happy about this schoenberg said the fact that this is putting money in my pocket is completely secondary the whole thing is legislative malfeasance a traitor to my class for those wealthy enough to be saving tens of thousands of dollars in taxes or even millions the sums are not particularly meaningful from a financial perspective after all they re already awful rich i don t look at it as if there s now this extra pot of money said pearl the pot of money is just now somewhat larger than it might otherwise have been to drive home his point pearl used an analogy schultz might appreciate if the starbucks guy gives you an extra cup of coffee it s not like you think now i have an extra 3 what am i going to do with it he said but others in the group said they would be putting their tax savings to work john driscoll the chief executive of carecentrix a health care company has not done his taxes for 2018 but expects a windfall with the extra money driscoll said he would double his support for progressive causes and politicians my family is going to give more money to fight issues of hunger and we re going to invest more in candidates who don t put the income of wealthy people ahead of people who need help he said the unnecessary and fiscally imprudent reduction in the individual tax rate gives me more income to fight the imbalances roberta kaplan a partner at kaplan hecker fink and a patriotic millionaire recalled that when she was growing up her father talked about being proud to pay his taxes he wasn t looking for any way to lessen his tax burden she said it was his way of contributing to our country at first kaplan dismissed the sentiment as naive i remember thinking he was sort of a sucker she said but i ve come to appreciate how much wisdom there is in that people in our country who have done well and who benefit from all the advantages of living in this economy have an obligation to support that system and make it better and fairer while the millionaires of the resistance may up their charitable giving none said they would be making voluntary contributions to the government which yes is a thing some people do americans donated just 775 654 63 to help reduce the national debt last year down from a high of 7 75 million in 2012 prince speaking from the silver whisper said he had no plans to make voluntary contributions to the treasury i don t want to just give away my money to the government he said instead he plans to continue his quixotic quest to increase his own tax rate even as it places him at odds with so many of his affluent peers the vast majority of my friends are wealthy too and they think i m an idiot prince said i get called a traitor to my class all the time
chasing foreign experts view s many years ago two local university batchmates coincidentally happened to work on a project here with foreign funding while one man had worked and lived in sri lanka all his life the other had migrated was earning a salary several times more abroad than his erstwhile university colleague both however were equally brilliant capable and efficient the locally based worker chose to remain in sri lanka and be in the public sector perhaps to serve the country â while his colleague ventured out to greener pastures in the foreign funded project they happened to share the same work space in the sri lanka office at the end of a hard working day the locally based worker would collect his bag typically used by public servants and make his way to the railway station where he took a train to his hometown about 40 kms away from colombo meanwhile the sri lankan expatriate would make his way to a luxury hotel where he was provided accommodation later to laze by the pool sipping a glass of chilled beer before having dinner and going to bed he was also earning a fat â foreign expertâ fee for the assignment being designated a foreign expert while his locally based colleague was only paid his regular salary far below what the other was earning the contrasting lifestyles of the duo played on the mind of the locally based worker who felt he was cheated from earning a sum equal to that of his sri lankan expatriate colleague although both were equally capable and brilliant he also wondered aloud whether he had made the right decision to work for his country rather than live a high life like his colleague while the moral of this story is that sometimes you can be disappointed for choosing to serve the country if that country relies on foreign aid and foreign experts these thoughts emerged when i received a call from kalabala silva the often agitated academic whom i hadnâ t spoken to for a while â i sayâ â the imf chief seems to have whacked foreign experts and their costly expertise in low income countries â he said â what do you mean â i asked â whyâ â the other day according to newspaper reports she has criticised global consultants for contracts in poor countries which didnâ t have the money to pay such high fees â he said it was then that i recalled managing director of the international monetary fund imf christine lagardeâ s comments at a recent meeting on this issue after a long conversation with kalabala catching up on several past issues i excused myself saying i needed to get back to work what did the imf chief say at a january 28 event on funding of sustainable development goals at the world economic forum wef in davos switzerland this is what she said nâ â â poor countries must not contract global consultancy firms to write development strategies nâ â â poor countries did not have enough money to contract such firms nâ â â poor countries in the world should desist from using global consultancy firms to write development strategies nâ â â lagarde criticised global consultants asking the representatives of â the mckinseys and boston consulting groupsâ and any other consultancy firms in the room of this event to listen to her even as she made the uncomfortable remarks about their work nâ â â â iâ m looking around to see whether there are any of the mckinseys and boston consulting groups and if they are please listen to me â she reportedly said nâ â â many many low income countries and emerging market economies spend millions of dollars commissioning consultants to build their strategic plan when such costs can be cut down sri lanka in recent times has also chosen the path of hiring costly foreign consultants some of whom come via foreign funded projects which also provide for recruiting experts from the country source of the funding while others are recruited independently can we afford such expertise when the country has capable local expertise like the case of the two colleagues who worked on a foreign funded project and need not spend millions on foreign experts our economy is studded with foreign expertise for example we have a japanese solution for garbage disposal a harvard solution for economic management and ideas a singapore solution for mass transportation an indian solution for peace and overcoming the labour shortage a chinese solution also for overcoming a labour shortage and to wipe out debt and even an oxford formula on how to market the country as an attractive destination for foreign investments yes foreign expertise in areas which sri lanka lacks skills is required but are we to be overwhelmed by foreign expertise in areas where there is enough and more local capacity and capability there are also claims that the economy is influenced by a neo liberal ideology and organisations that promote such thinking such as the swiss based mont pelerin society and that sometimes foreign assistance comes with a â liberalâ dose of these ideas in january 2016 with much fanfare a conference was organized with the involvement of controversial billionaire george sores and harvard university academics amidst a lot of media attention and publicity the process continued thereafter with officials and local experts visiting harvard in the us two or three times in a costly adventure to chart a course for sri lankaâ s economic future what have we heard so far about the harvard entry into creating a sustainable economic model very little iâ m afraid when i raised this issue in an earlier kussi amma sera commentary asking what has happened to the harvard discourse an embarrassed local advisor corrected me saying â many things have happened in a positive senseâ when asked why the public was not kept informed through the media of these developments while public money is spent on these foreign junkets and costly adventures he then acknowledged that more public awareness should have been done on this work as of now and several months after raising this issue the public is still not sure whether a harvard supported economic policy discourse is on or not the imf chief has hit the nail on the head in referring to costly foreign funded junkets by high and free spending foreign experts in poor countries it also applies to sri lanka though being in the bracket of a lower middle income country according to a world bank rating particularly when these countries have enough local expertise to handle projects with foreign aid or local resources not unexpectedly today this subject went way over her head there was no input from kussi amma sera who was chatting with her friends under the margosa tree on another subject relevant though â how officials at local councils fleece the public demanding â santhosamâ bribes for work that they are already paid for letâ s leave that discussion for another day
washington ap the government surpassed a dubious milestone this week its debt topped 22 trillion that s trillion with a t for the first time piles of federal debt have been growing ever higher for years fueled by accumulating annual deficits which themselves have been driven by tax cuts government spending increases and the mounting costs of medicare and social security and interest on the debt itself under president donald trump the national debt has topped 20 trillion september 2017 21 trillion march 2018 and now 22 trillion as a presidential candidate trump had assailed the 1 trillion annual deficits under president barack obama and had said that as president he could wipe out all the debt now trump is projecting that his own annual deficits will top 1 trillion for a time so just what is the national debt why does it keep rising and how worried should we be about it here are some questions and answers ___ q what makes up the national debt file this june 8 2017 file photo shows the u s treasury department building in washington the national debt has passed a new milestone topping 22 trillion for the first time the treasury department s daily statement shows that total outstanding public debt stands at 22 01 trillion it stood at 19 95 trillion when president donald trump took office on jan 20 2017 ap photo pablo martinez monsivais file a it s the total the government has borrowed to finance its operations beyond what it s collected over the years in revenue from taxes and other sources the debt has become a perennial source of hand wringing because of among other things concern that it will paralyze the nation s ability to finance its future operations and will hamstring generations to come not since the late 1990s and early 2000s has the u s government run a surplus a luxury that allows it to reduce the debt and finance other needs ___ q how does the debt differ from the deficit a the deficit is the gap between what the government collects in revenue and what it spends in any particular budget year the accumulation of these annual budget deficits combined into one represent the debt because the government typically spends more than it collects it must borrow to make up the difference for the 2018 budget year which ended sept 30 the deficit totaled 779 billion that was the largest gap between spending and revenue since 2012 when the deficit was 1 1 trillion that year during the obama administration the government had increased spending and cut taxes to continue stimulating the economy in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and the great recession ___ q who holds all the debt the government has borrowed a one misperception is that most of the u s debt is held by foreigners in china japan and elsewhere but in fact america s biggest creditor is america sixty two percent of the federal debt is held in the united states by the federal reserve the social security system banks pension plans mutual funds insurance companies and individual investors in fact the largest single chunk 5 9 trillion about one fourth of the total is money the government owes itself in the form of trust funds the biggest is the social security trust fund the government has drawn on this money which is earmarked to pay social security benefits to finance other expenses but once that money is needed to pay social security benefits the government must replenish the amounts it borrowed with interest if it s still running deficits the only way to do this is to take on more debt the debt held by the public 16 2 trillion is about three fourths of the total it s held by investors in both the united states and abroad ranging from individuals and pension funds to foreign central banks china is the largest foreign owner of debt it holds roughly 1 2 trillion in treasury securities followed by japan which holds about 1 trillion according to the latest accounting ___ q with interest rates still so low how much concern is there about the size of the national debt a that depends on whom you ask many economists say they fear that the rising debt represents a time bomb that will eventually explode and derail the economy that is especially true they argue in light of projections that the annual deficits are once again headed above 1 trillion and will be stuck at those levels for years as the government pays the rising costs of social security benefits and medicare health insurance for vast numbers of retiring baby boomers but some economists counter that with interest rates so low the government shouldn t be worried about reducing the deficits at least not now instead they contend the government should focus on making worthwhile public investments in such areas as education infrastructure health care and environmental protections
i assume most listeners have heard of the proposed green new deal the proposal was mentioned by three separate op ed columns in the new york times on february 12 here s brooks on the green new deal i don t know if it is socialism or not socialism but it would definitely represent the greatest centralization of power in the hands of the washington elite in our history he also snidely asserts that the people running the show will be too incompetent to pull it off and it will become sweetheart deals to vested interests inviting widespread corruption rattner argues that proposals like the green new deal he also refers to free college and medicare for all are supported by people who seem not to care about running up giant budget deficits which he warns will leave our grandchildren with an astronomical national debt a subheading of his article states we can t add big programs without finding a way to pay for them he supports increases in taxes and modifications to entitlement spending in order to reduce future budget deficits specifically he supports raising the retirement age and making some entitlements based on need while rejecting the kind of reforms to entitlements that would in effect eviscerate them his point however is that all of the proposals kicking around congress from the progressive wing of the democratic party including the green new deal are out of the question if they are merely to be financed via deficit spending this is where paul krugman comes in he makes the case that fears of deficit spending have been used so often as hypocritical political posturing that it appears the democrats have finally stopped rising to the bait of austerity for years deficit scolds dominated discourse inside the beltway much of the news media treated the urgency of fiscal austerity as an unquestioned fact all the wailing about the debt was hypocritical republicans never actually cared about debt they just pretended to be deficit hawks as a way to hamstring president barack obama s agenda and many centrists have turned out to have a double standard reserving passionate concern about debt for times when democrats held power the facts are obvious under president ronald reagan the ratio of national debt to gdp rose from 36 percent in 1983 at the end of a recession when the economy should have been growing faster than debt to 50 percent in 1989 that ratio peaked at 65 percent of gdp in 1995 and then fell under president bill clinton to 55 percent of gdp in 2001 it rose again under president george w bush reaching 64 percent before the advent of the great recession as a result of the recession and the obama recovery programs the debt to gdp ratio rose dramatically to 103 percent of gdp in early 2017 it has remained close to that actually rising slightly to 104 percent of gdp in 2018 according to vice president dick cheney in a well quoted assertion reagan proved that deficits don t matter trump s chief of staff mick mulvaney echoed cheney when he explained why there was no mention of deficits or the national debt in trump s state of the union speech nobody cares the most pernicious thing that happened as a result of the fixation on budget deficits was that the obama administration s efforts to pull the economy into prosperity after the great recession was short circuited by a move towards austerity in 2011 federal deficit spending the key to stimulating an economy during a recession and subsequent recovery fell from 9 percent of gdp in 2010 to just over 4 percent in 2013 the fact that it took from early 2009 till 2016 for the economy to begin looking normal is in large part due to the failure to maintain federal spending at the high level it achieved in the initial years of the obama administration of course following krugman s point once the trump administration took office all concerns with deficits went out the window with the passage of the tax cut at the end of 2017 the federal deficit had fallen to 3 4 percent of gdp in 2017 and rose a bit in 2018 to 3 9 percent and is projected to reach 4 7 percent for 2019 some supporters of the green new deal are now wise to the hypocrisy described by krugman when asked how to finance it some have asserted the same way we financed world war ii and they are not being flippant they are correct world war ii was fought with massive increases in deficit spending by the end of the war the national debt was 114 percent of gdp by the end of the 1970s even though the absolute size of the national debt had grown dramatically the economy had grown more and the ratio of debt to gdp was at 31 percent the reason so many have supported the concept of the green new deal is that the world faces an even greater existential threat than it did during world war ii even if the nazis and japanese had won the world as we know it would have remained inhabitable with global warming unchecked the entire planet is in danger a rising national debt is a negligible price to pay to counter global warming absent dramatic action we are years decades at most away from condemning our grandchildren to lives if they survive that none of us would want to live the green new deal is a promise to marry the needs for good jobs with good pay for workers in the united states to the necessity of reducing our carbon footprint to zero as fast as possible increased government spending to guarantee jobs decent health care and protect the environment will not just increase employment but raise wages as well the technology to switch to green sources of energy already exists the skilled labor and industries already exist the problem is getting the new technologies to the forefront and reducing and finally eliminating the carbon based technologies that are putting future generations at risk this of course is no easy task the carbon based industries have spent decades using their lobbying strengths to hide the truth about global warming they have successfully confused too many of our fellow citizens that there is scientific disagreement when in fact over 90 of the scientists agree that global warming is accelerating because of our activities and that it poses an existential threat of civilization instead of attacking the green new deal with ridiculous demands that the sponsors explain how they are going to pay for it experts should be working on how to utilize government spending tax policy and regulations to speed the transition away from carbon the faster it happens the less suffering our grandchildren will endure krugman has it right the first and easiest step is to finally once and for all banish the fears of deficit spending and increases to the national debt during world war ii no one argued that government borrowing was dangerous there was a war on instead the government told everyone it was their patriotic duty to buy war bonds well we need that same energy to sell green new deal bonds maybe we should call them save our grandchildren bonds answering brooks argument about inefficiency and incompetence is a bit harder but the us has always dreamed big after world war ii ended there was a short period of cuts in military spending which was reversed with the advent of the cold war a massive military industrial complex was created yes there was waste and profiteering but it did the job the balance of terror with the soviet union meant that there was no nuclear war no world war iii along the way the defense department laid the foundation for the creation of the internet in the 1950s the interstate highway system began construction i am sure there were contractors here and there who did shoddy work and some politicians got kickbacks but the country was connected by ribbons on highway within two decades in the 1960s the government dedicated itself to putting a man on the moon again maybe some contractors were over paid and there were tragedies along the way but a successful set of space flights did occur the point is yes it might be expensive and involved some significant waste but the goal is too important not to try what s wrong with thinking big about ending the poisoning of our atmosphere

amazon announced thursday that it is backing out of plans to open a new headquarters in new york city blaming state and local politicians who had opposed our presence and will not work with us the retail giant announced in november it would build a campus in the long island city neighborhood of queens for 25 000 employees fueled by 3 billion in state and city incentives to amazon after much thought and deliberation we ve decided not to move forward with our plans to build a headquarters for amazon in long island city queens the company statement said many activists said the project would worsen congestion in the area and lead to gentrification and higher housing prices the company put the blame for its decision squarely on the shoulders of politicians who had objected to the development and been critical of city and state leaders for offering amazon huge tax subsidies for amazon the commitment to build a new headquarters requires positive collaborative relationships with state and local elected officials who will be supportive over the long term new york gov andrew cuomo a booster of the amazon deal expressed anger that a small group of politicians put their own narrow interests above their community the amazon decision will prove costly to the state s economic future and the best interests of the people of this state the governor said in a statement but city council speaker corey johnson aimed his ire at amazon saying new york rejects vulture capitalism i look forward to working with companies that understand that if you re willing to engage with new yorkers and work through challenging issues johnson said in a statement i hope this is the start of a conversation about vulture capitalism and where our tax dollars are best spent new york mayor bill de blasio also blasted the retailer and said other businesses will fill any void from its canceled plans instead of working with the community amazon threw away that opportunity we have the best talent in the world and every day we are growing a stronger and fairer economy for everyone the mayor said state sen michael gianaris a democrat who represents the long island city neighborhood where amazon would have been said the company s action speaks for itself today s behavior by amazon shows why they would have been a bad partner for new york in any event according to gianaris rather than seriously engage with the community they proposed to profoundly change amazon continued its effort to shake down governments to get its way and u s rep alexandria ocasio cortez a democrat whose district borders long island city celebrated amazon s withdrawal i think it s incredible she told reporters in washington d c it shows that everyday americans still have the power to organize and fight for their communities she discounted the potential loss of amazon s promised 25 000 jobs saying that taxpayers would have had too subsidize those jobs the city was paying for those jobs in its announcement last year that it was coming to queens amazon said it was also building hubs in northern virginia and nashville now it will apparently focus its growth there and in its other existing locations with no plans to replace the now defunct new york project we do not intend to reopen the hq2 search at this time we will proceed as planned in northern virginia and nashville and we will continue to hire and grow across our 17 corporate offices and tech hubs in the u s and canada the company said nashville mayor david briley quickly assured his constituents thursday that amazon s plans to open an operations center with 5 000 jobs are still in place with no connection to the new york decision similarly in virginia arlington county board chairman christian dorsey said nothing has changed after speaking with an amazon representative earlier today we have confirmed that we are moving forward as planned with amazon s upcoming headquarters in arlington dorsey said earlier this week siena college released findings of a poll that showed that a clear majority of new york state residents approved of the amazon deal 56 percent to 36 percent and residents of the five boroughs were in favor 58 percent to 35 percent there was clear support for this siena college research institute director don levy told nbc news on thursday it s always tough to guess how angry people will be and how it s going to last but i think it s going to last awhile cynthia nixon who ran unsuccessfully against new york gov andrew cuomo in last year s democratic primary hailed amazon s stunning reversal amen the actress turned politician tweeted the fight against amazon laid bare their union busting corporate welfare ice abetting practices and shows why we need to break up monopolies like amazon zephyr teachout who ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general last year and nixon both accused amazon of working with law enforcement to develop facial recognition technology that could gather information from customers without them knowing it now let s get a congressional hearing on amazon labor ice monopsony how and why to break up amazon teachout tweeted just after amazon s announcement i know some people ready to testify amazon s stock price closed at 1 622 65 a share down 1 06 percent correction feb 14 2019 4 17 p m et a previous version of this article misstated the

the process of britain leaving the european union called brexit is producing a major spasm in world capitalism s current crisis what is yet to be decided is how britain will leave the choices are either soft which would involve maintaining some formal links or hard with rigorous checks of people and goods at all border crossings and no agreement as yet on custom duties this may have the biggest impact on the republic of ireland role of eu the european union is a free trade zone that means that goods can go from one member state to another without tariffs it is also a single market this allows both the free flow of capital and the free flow of labor for its members an unelected bureaucracy based in brussels makes economic decisions that affect the entire eu this bureaucracy serves european finance capital especially the banks based in germany france and britain eu rules can impose wage austerity and budget cuts dismantle social protections and insist on deregulation without input from the people these changes would seriously affect this has been most obvious with its treatment of greece over the last five years the british ruling class doesn t need the eu bureaucracy to impose its own austerity rules on the workers inside its territory these have reduced the standard of living for large sectors of the working class in britain on the other hand sectors of the british ruling class undoubtedly resent germany s dominance of the eu but with brexit british capitalists will face a disruption of trade and capital flows after 40 years of integration in the eu it is in the interest of the european bourgeoisie to maintain the eu as a common market for two main purposes so it can compete more effectively with u s imperialism and with china and so it can increase the exploitation of european workers thus the eu bureaucracy has reason to make britain pay for disrupting and weakening the eu and to discourage exits by other countries all the major political parties in the british parliament appear to have three factions contending inside them the hard leavers the soft leavers and the remainers these contending factions have prevented the current tory government from arriving at a position with majority support in addition the government in london rules england scotland wales and the northeast of ireland scotland voted by 62 percent to remain in the eu in ireland s northern six counties the vote to remain was 56 percent the overall vote in the 2016 referendum was just 52 percent for leaving right wing politicians like boris johnson waged a xenophobic and racist campaign against all immigrants as well as blaming the eu for the decline in living standards of british workers which led to the brexit vote there has been some talk about a second referendum but this seems unlikely prime minister theresa may has repeatedly said she will have a plan by the march 29 deadline and britain will indeed leave impact on ireland a hard exit will create a big problem for the republic of ireland which remains in the eu ireland has a land border with the six counties since the belfast agreement of 1998 goods and people have flowed across the border unimpeded according to the jan 15 irish times there are 120 official border crossings on the eastern border of the eu from the most northerly tip of norway to the black sea in the southeast about 3 720 miles an official border crossing is one with immigration and customs control but the irish border which has existed only since the republic of ireland won its freedom in 1922 has 208 official road crossings along 310 miles economists estimate the irish economy will contract by 5 to 10 percent markets will be lost farmers will have trouble selling their products on the other side of the border workers in the irish fishing industry may have to pay duty on fish caught in british waters workers who live in the republic but work in the six counties or vice versa may have to move or lose their jobs if a hard border is put in place with soldiers customs officers and identification checks not only would it anger millions of irish people who vehemently oppose british occupation it could have other repercussions such as the harassment and possible detention of immigrants and refugees at checkpoints and it could pose obstacles to women traveling from the north where abortion is outlawed to the irish republic to obtain the procedure legally impact on workers britain s economy is far more threatened by the consequences of brexit than that in any other eu country if may can t get a deal with the eu projections show that the british gross domestic product would fall by 9 3 percent and housing prices by 30 percent new york times feb 7 some of the 3 million workers in england with passports from other eu member countries especially the most skilled in health care and construction have been leaving though the regulations are yet to be set most non british eu citizens working in england expect hassles since the brexit vote wages in the hospitality restaurant construction and finance sectors of the english economy where foreign workers were frequently hired have been increasing for new hires prime minister may has promised that any worker currently in england will be allowed to stay however members of the hard leavers faction in the conservative party have challenged her on this point a report in the sept 19 guardian claimed that 7 out of 10 non british eu workers would lose their right to work in britain after brexit trade disruptions will have negative consequences in the various european countries that are major partners of great britain a drop in remittances from workers who must leave britain will harm the economies especially of the eastern european countries which have had many citizens working there for example the million polish workers in britain sent home over 1 billion in 2017 eight percent of lithuania s workers live in england workers even from france and germany sent home a bit more than polish workers it is unclear what will happen to the approximately 1 million british workers in continental europe kathy durkin

by ana isabel martinez and david alire garcia mexico city reuters mexico will inject 3 9 billion into ailing state oil company pemex officials said on friday promising to strengthen its finances and prevent a further credit downgrade although investors saw the plan as only a short term fix falling oil output corruption and high labor costs have contributed to the decline of the company that was once a symbol of national pride it now holds roughly 106 billion in financial debt the highest of any national oil company in latin america fitch and moody s rate its credit one notch above junk fitch said on friday that the plan which includes additional tax cuts more government spending on the company and debt refinancing would likely not be enough to prevent continued deterioration in pemex s credit quality the agency cited an ongoing significant level of underinvestment for pemex pemex will receive 1 8 billion in pension liability monetization as part of the new plan and finances will be helped by a corruption clampdown officials said in a presentation that was short on details they vowed the mexican government will not take on new debt in 2019 pemex must make more than 27 billion in debt payments over the next three years investors said they had expected stronger measures and while encouraged by government vows of support they said the plan offered only short term relief the measures are not a long term fix and won t be enough to stabilize oil output said edward glossop latin america economist at capital economics if oil prices and output decline further he estimated yields on pemex bonds could rise by around 1 percent this year the price fell after the announcement for pemex s most heavily traded bond on friday maturing in 2047 as its yield rose 14 basis points according to marketaxess data the price on a pemex bond maturing in 2024 also dropped with its yield up 32 basis points reflecting bondholder skepticism of the plan what s more the measures will do little to shore up pemex s standing with the ratings agencies said julie murphy a latin america analyst at jp morgan we are extremely disappointed with the measures she said the mexican peso weakened by more than half a percent against the dollar after the announcement before recovering later on friday do what it takes over time pemex taxes will go down and the capital injection will allow debt refinancing over the year finance minister carlos urzua told a press conference if pemex requires more help the government will do whatever it takes to keep pemex s finances healthy he added fitch downgraded debt issued by pemex by two steps last month making it the second agency after moody s to put the company just barely within its investment grade category the move stoked fears that further credit downgrades could significantly raise pemex s financing costs and result in dire fiscal consequences for the government president andres manuel lopez obrador who took office in december and ran on a promise of strengthening pemex did not fully detail in his comments at the news conference how the government would finance the company s lower tax bill and capital injection he said efforts since late december to battle rampant fuel theft would result in savings of about 1 6 billion however while a plan to increase production will generate more resources it s injecting resources it s lowering the tax obligation lopez obrador said but above all it s cleaning out corruption from pemex investors had expected a stronger response said luis gonzali a portfolio manager at franklin templeton investments even so he praised the administration s unconditional support to double down on relief measures if necessary wilbur matthews founder of vaquero global investment also saw the announcement as positive it is a good sign that the lopez obrador administration recognizes that pemex needs to change profoundly he said the company is in talks with lenders to potentially raise up to 7 billion this year refinitiv ifr reported on friday the company has previously said it would refinance around 6 6 billion in 2019 reporting by david alire garcia ana isabel martinez lizbeth diaz stefanie eschenbacher and noe torres in mexico city rodrigo campos in new york writing by daina beth solomon editing by tom brown and sandra maler view comments
while historically there has always been debate about the nature of fiscal policy it is now generally accepted that in a modern globalised economy reducing debt and stimulating growth should be the goals of most governments this is important in the bahamas because we are dependent on the international ratings agencies for our sovereign credit rating on which our reputation as a desirable destination for foreign direct investment depends and invariably we are judged on our public sector policies fiscal consolidation measures and economic growth in these columns we have consistently welcomed the fnm government s policy of economic reform to include modernisation deregulation liberalisation and diversity together with its commitment to reduce the national debt limit fiscal deficits and bring transparency to the management of its own financial affairs these reforms have to take account of the need to comply with international anti money laundering and counter terror financing standards but if they can be implemented successfully they could bring about sustainable long term prosperity for our nation it is therefore risible to read recent criticism of the reforms by the plp chairman who either does not grasp what is happening or is simply politicking in a manner no longer tolerated by the new wave of young voters against this background the debate about our nation becoming another singapore has once again come to the fore the bahamas possesses significant advantages like proximity to the world s largest economy a high level of wealth and good existing infrastructure an equable climate and plenty of land spread over some 25 inhabited islands with our main island of new providence only marginally smaller than the landmass of singapore but we should take note of how lee kuan yee singapore s first and longest serving prime minister dramatically transformed his country from a poor island in the 1960s with no natural resources into a powerful and wealthy financial centre and a logistics shipping and aviation regional hub he made it an attractive place for investment through an efficient bureaucracy a low and transparent tax regime a strong regulatory framework an emphasis on growth zero tolerance of corruption and development of state of the art infrastructure and above all he realised that he had to create a top flight educational system and welcome immigrants in order to attract high calibre people with skills and to secure the integration of foreign and home grown talent it is claimed lee kuan yew managed to alter the mindset of his people for his achievements to be emulated in this country a fundamental cultural change would be needed and most people think that is unattainable the dose of authoritarianism imposed in singapore might not work here nonetheless the need for more order and discipline in our society is widely recognised whether it is personal accountability in honouring commitments and obligations and good timekeeping or honesty and a refusal at every level to offer and accept bribes or even driving more responsibly on our overcrowded roads so many bahamians remain inward looking suspicious and resentful of outsiders and foreign involvement in what they regard as their exclusive domain and it is unrealistic to expect a change of attitude among today s older generation but younger people exposed to the internet and social media are more savvy and less inclined to accept entrenched attitudes they regard as out of touch with the modern age to benefit fully from globalisation we need a fresh approach we should for example welcome controlled immigration as a potential boost to our economy and society and we need to improve the work ethic of government officials through a mix of incentives and sanctions for poor performance the government is already committed to greater transparency and is tackling corruption by uncovering the worst excesses of the last plp administration and letting the law take its course however before attempting to achieve meaningful change it must also be seen to be treating all bahamians and visitors fairly and responsibly from meeting its international human rights obligations for example most recently stopping the abuses at the carmichael road detention centre to taking serious steps to tackle the massive gap between the rich and the poor in our country where in some areas people are still forced to make do with outside bathrooms it has required authority and commitment to launch this fnm government s economic reforms could this be extended to bring about a broader fundamental change of attitude and thinking in our country that would be a tall order and it would need visionary and determined political leadership but if as a country we genuinely believe we possess the potential to become the singapore of the americas and we commit ourselves to a peaceful social revolution involving real cultural change such an aspiration should never be entirely ruled out

ll comment on the performance of aam s business units and lastly i ll review our 2019 financial outlook before turning things over to chris after chris covers the details of our financial results we will open up the call for any questions that you may have let me start by stating that aam s full year 2018 financial results reflect record sales gross profit and operating cash flow despite some launch and operating related challenges during the second half of the year advertisement advertisement aam s fourth quarter 2018 sales were 1 69 billion compared to 1 73 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 aam s sales increased to 7 27 billion 1 billion higher than our full year 2017 and a new annual record for aam the primary reasons for this increase are related to operating for a full year as an integrated company a solid new business backlog strong light truck suv and crossover vehicle production volumes and higher customer pass throughs related to metal market from a profitability perspective aam made progress in the fourth quarter on the launch and operational issues that we faced in the third quarter of 2018 and continues to expect resolution of the matters by the second quarter of this year aam s adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 244 million or 14 4 of sales this compared to 295 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 or 17 1 of sales for the full year 2018 aam s adjusted ebitda was 1 184 000 000 this is another record for aam but did not meet the expectations that we set forth for ourselves at the beginning of the year aam s adjusted ebitda margin was 16 3 for the full year of 2018 compared to 17 6 for the full year of 2017 aam s adjusted eps in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 45 per share compared to 0 89 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year of 2018 aam s adjusted eps was 3 28 per share compared to 3 75 per share in the full year of 2017 it is important to highlight and as we noted in our press release this morning that we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment of 485 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to our casting and powertrain business units the impact of which has been excluded from our adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps calculations this impairment is the result of our annual goodwill impairment cap and reflects changing market dynamics and recent underperformance in these business units we ve been very transparent about these matters in recent discussions with the investor community we did not change our overall view of our long term goals and objectives for aam in any way shape or form aam continued to deliver strong free cash flow generation in 2018 advertisement advertisement aam s adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 142 4 million for the full year of 2018 aam s adjusted free cash flow was 322 3 million compared to 341 million for the full year 2017 our net debt leverage ratio at the end of 2018 was 2 8 times and we continued to make prepayments on our gross debt with 100 million payment in the fourth quarter of 2018 chris will provide additional information regarding the details of our financial results in a few minutes let s now turn to our business units and segment performance for the fourth quarter of 2018 the driveline business unit recorded sales of 996 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and delivered 146 5 million of segment adjusted ebitda sales in this business unit were down versus the third quarter due to lower production days as a result of normal seasonality as well as additional downtime due to customer program changeovers aam did see improvement in operating and launch performance in this business unit especially as it relates to the build out of the current ram heavy duty truck and the launch of the next generation vehicle we also made meaningful progress in most of the supplier delivery issues that we faced back in the third quarter as it relates to our current production the only remaining issue we have is with a core product metal supplier that we are in the process of resourcing and insourcing as it relates to our electric driveline supply issues one of the issues had been resolved and we are moving forward with the resource supplier the other issue which relates to an aluminum casting supplier continues to drive excess cost including labor and material at premium price and we are working hard to get this critical issue corrected but do expect to incur premium price at least into the first quarter of 2019 no different than what we told you before the metal forming business unit recorded sales of 339 million and segment adjusted ebitda of 54 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 despite lower sales due to seasonality and program changeovers this unit performed at over 16 ebitda margin level for the quarter on a full year basis this business unit performed very well with an adjusted ebitda margin of nearly 19 the powertrain business unit recorded sales of 263 million and segment adjusted ebitda of 32 3 million advertisement advertisement as you remember from the third quarter we experienced significant excess project and launch related expense expense related costs from this business unit in the third quarter of 2018 we did however make improvements in launch related expenses such as premium labor scrap and indirect materials during the fourth quarter while we are able to increase ebitda margin sequentially by 30 basis points we continue to be negatively impacted by excess launch cost and operating performance issues however the powertrain business unit is on track with its performance improvement plan and we expect to see continued progress in these areas through the first half of 2019 and the casting business unit recorded sales of 218 5 million and segment adjusted ebitda of 10 6 million we continue to be impacted by labor and operational efficiencies and input cost inflation in this business unit as part of our improvement initiatives we ve been able to negotiate some price increase with our commercial industry customers this price impact started in the fourth quarter of 2018 but the majority of these actions will begin to favorably impact the business in the first quarter of 2019 we expect this to help improve the performance of this business unit as we go forward as we announced back in january at the detroit auto show we are consolidating our powertrain business unit into both our driveline and metal forming business units we are moving 12 facilities that make up 600 million in sales focused on highly engineered products into our driveline segment these products include differential assemblies and vibration control systems the remaining 12 facilities representing about 500 million in sales and focused on forming and sintered operations are being integrated into our metal forming business unit this business restructuring will assist us in accelerating and finalizing the integration process which we are working to complete here by the end of 2019 furthermore it will enhance the alignment of aam s product and process technologies and will help us accelerate the implementation of aam s operating system including important program management and launch readiness disciplines which we are lacking we will also achieve greater efficiencies within our corporate and business unit support teams and expect an annual cost savings of 10 million to 20 million advertisement advertisement keep in mind that these savings are in addition to the integration synergies associated with the mpg acquisition as you know our objective was to secure 120 million in annual run rate cost savings by april 1 2019 we achieved this in january of 2019 a few months earlier let me wrap up 2018 with a look back at some of the overall highlights despite the challenges that we faced in the second half of the year it was still a great year for aam in many regards we hit record sales of over 7 billion in revenues for the first time as a company we were also recognized as a fortune 500 company in addition we also hit the highest adjusted ebitda dollar mark and second highest adjusted ebitda margin in our company s history from a technology perspective we were awarded our fifth global ecotrac program won two light weighting awards for our advanced quantum technology and launched our first e aam electric drive system on the jaguar i pace vehicle strategically we sold the aftermarket division of our powertrain bu formed an important joint venture with wuling motors in china and met key integration and synergy attainment milestones we also achieved 14 performance and quality awards from our customers including our second consecutive supplier of the year award from general motors and we continued to generate strong free cash flow and made over 200 million in senior debt payments needless to say 2018 was a pivotal and busy year for aam before i turn over to chris let me provide some quick comments on aam s 2019 full year financial outlook today we are reaffirming the targets we shared with you at the autoshow conference in detroit back in january aam is targeting full year sales between 7 3 billion and 7 4 billion in 2019 advertisement advertisement we are also targeting adjusted ebitda for 2019 in the range of 1 2 billion to 1 25 billion an increase over 2018 and aam is targeting adjusted free cash flow range of 350 million to 400 million which contemplates capital spending of approximately 7 of sales as we look toward 2019 we expect to profitably grow further diversify our business and continue our trend of delivering strong free cash flow metrics make no mistake 2019 will be another setting year for aam especially concerning the strength of light truck suv and crossover vehicles in the marketplace coupled with a strong economy critical to our success in 2019 will be our ability to launch flawlessly and to restore operational excellence and discipline to our production operations especially the legacy mpg facilities we have approximately 50 product and program launches in 2019 including significant ram hd and gm full size truck launches many of these launches as well as our performance improvement plans will be completed by the first half of the year the benefits from our business unit realignment along with further synergy attainment activities should help drive improved performance for the year especially the second half of the year that concludes my prepared remarks let me now turn the call over to our vice president and chief financial officer chris may chris chris may vice president and chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you david and good morning everyone i will cover the financial details of our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results with you today and i will also refer to the earnings slide deck as part of my prepared comments so let s go ahead and get started with sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 aam sales were 1 69 billion compared to 1 73 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 slide 12 shows a walkdown of fourth quarter 2017 sales to the fourth quarter 2018 sales the year over year decrease relates mainly to the impact of the transition to the next generation gm full size truck platform partially offset by continued realization of our new business backlog higher metal market pass throughs also contributed slightly to the higher sales of about 8 million for the full year 2018 aam s sales increased over 15 to 7 27 billion as compared to 6 27 billion in the full year of 2017 having a full year impact of the mpg acquisition added over 700 million to the top line in 2018 as compared to 2017 but aam also grew organically mainly on the strength of our new business backlog this increase also reflected higher customer metal market pass throughs which increased sales but had detrimental impact on our margin in 2018 of about 20 to 30 basis points now let s move on to profitability as david covered earlier we made progress on some of the launch and operational challenges that we faced last quarter gross profit was 225 3 million or 13 3 of sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the full year 2018 aam achieved record gross profit of 1 140 000 000 this equates to 15 7 of sales adjusted ebitda was 244 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 or 14 4 of sales as compared to 295 7 million or 17 1 of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 you can see a year over year walkdown of adjusted ebitda on slide 13 lower volume and mix impacted ebitda by 26 million as we saw lower sales in some of our more profitable programs within the quarter in addition the timing of year over year customer pricing updates also impacted the quarter along with a slight impact from metal market and fx consistent with recent quarters we continued to see inflationary pressures on material and freight on a year over year basis this impacted ebitda in the amount of 14 million of which approximately 3 million related to tariffs while we believe that these inflationary pressures have started to level off some we have factored some additional inflation pressures in our 2019 financial targets mostly to reflect a full year impact of these issues that emerged in 2018 on a year over year basis we also experienced higher launch and project related costs in the fourth quarter of 2018 of about 10 million as you may recall this year over year headwind was 30 million in the third quarter and we ve seen some improvement in areas such as scrap premium labor and outside processing costs we do expect to make continued progress on these costs in the first half of 2019 and anticipate seeing significant year over year decreases in these costs by the second half of 2019 we also continued to experience run rate inflation on labor and utility costs similar to what we experienced in the third quarter as for supply disruptions we are still working on a few key issues to resolve but many of the issues were resolved in the fourth quarter our castings business unit continued with some operational cost increases with indirect input and additional maintenance costs in the fourth quarter of 2018 we continue to provide benefits from our synergy attainment activities with a year over year increase of 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in line with our overall run rate achievement in goals when you look at the sequentially ebitda changes in ebitda from the third quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter which is detailed on page 14 the largest impact we had was related to volume mix and pricing sales were down nearly 125 million which caused a 46 million reduction to ebitda on a quarter to quarter comparison we did see a small benefit related to metal market and fx mainly reflecting an fx remeasurement loss that occurred in the third quarter but did not recur in the fourth quarter and lastly and most importantly we did see an 11 million improvement related to launch and operational improvements from the third quarter to the fourth quarter this is in line with the improvements we expected to achieve a couple of other things to know on the fourth quarter of 2018 as it relates to adjustments to ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred 12 1 million of restructuring and acquisition related costs these costs have been excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps we also recorded a noncash goodwill and timing impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 of 485 5 million 405 million relates to our casting business unit and 80 million to our powertrain business unit as you know we are required by u s gaap to perform an annual goodwill impairment test which we perform in the fourth quarter of every year on a reporting unit basis due in part to recent performance and lower than anticipated passenger car volumes in our casting and powertrain business units as well as the general contraction of market valuation multiples relating to similar businesses the process we used for this accounting impairment test under asc 350 resulting in a fair market valuation lower than the carrying value of these business units accordingly we impaired all of the goodwill that was recorded on the balance sheet of the casting business unit and a small portion of the powertrain goodwill but as david mentioned this gaap accounting charge does not change aam s views on the long term success of the business and you can clearly see the other segments in our business are very strong for the full year of 2018 aam s adjusted ebitda increased to 1 184 000 000 adjusted ebitda margin for the full year 2018 was 16 3 of sales now let me cover sg a sg a expense including r d in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 97 1 million or 5 7 of sales this compares to 101 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 or 5 8 of sales aam s r d spending in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 35 9 million compared to 38 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 sg a expense was 385 7 million or 5 3 of sales this compares to 390 1 million for the full year of 2017 or 6 2 of sales aam s r d spending for the full year of 2018 was 146 million compared to 162 million in the full year of 2017 through all of our year over year sg a comparisons in 2018 you can clearly see the realization of many of aam s synergy benefits now let s move on to interest and taxes net interest expense was 53 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 55 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 net interest expense was 214 million as compared to 193 million in 2017 this increase reflects the full year impact of additional debt required to fund the mpg acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recorded an income tax benefit of 88 5 million compared to a benefit of 13 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the primary reason for this significant benefit in the fourth quarter relates to the tax effect of certain elements of our goodwill impairment for the full year when adjusting for the tax impact on restructuring and acquisition related items goodwill impairment gained on the sale of our business and other recurring items we were running at an effective tax rate of just over 13 this is a little bit lower than we expected to be at the beginning of the year due to the final impact and benefits of the u s tax reform as well as some additional tax synergies we identified as we look toward 2019 we expect our effective tax rate to be around 20 the increase in our effective tax rate year over year relates to higher projected tax expense in certain foreign subsidiaries taking all of these sales and cost drivers into account gaap net loss was 361 8 million or 3 24 per share in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to net income of 106 3 million or 0 93 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year of 2018 aam s gaap net loss was 57 5 million or 0 51 per share compared to 337 1 million or 3 21 per share for the full year of 2017 adjusted earnings per share excludes the impact of the items discussed on this call and noted in our earnings press release adjusted eps for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 45 per share compared to 0 89 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 adjusted eps was 3 28 compared to 3 71 for the full year of 2017 let s now move on to cash flow and the balance sheet net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 258 3 million capital expenditures net of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in the fourth quarter was 131 2 million cash payments for restructuring and acquisition related activity for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 15 3 million reflecting the impact of this activity aam generated adjusted free cash flow of 142 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the full year of 2018 aam generated adjusted free cash flow of 322 million compared to 341 million in the full year of 2017 this represents an adjusted free cash flow yield of approximately 20 from a debt leverage perspective we ended the year with a net debt to ltm adjusted ebitda or net leverage ratio of 2 8x at december 31 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we prepaid 100 million on our 7 75 senior notes that are due in 2019 we are pleased to utilize the free cash flow generating power of aam to do exactly what we said we would do reduce our leverage and future interest expense the balance of these notes 100 million are now current and will be paid no later than november of this year aam ended 2018 with total available liquidity of over 1 4 billion consisting of available cash and borrowing capacity on aam s global credit facilities before i move to the q a let me close my comments with a quick note on our 2019 guidance david reaffirmed our full year financial targets that we previously communicated to you so i m not going to repeat them i do think it s important to note however that customer downtime in q1 relating to the next generation ram hd truck which is then followed by a ramp up of production of this vehicle through the balance of the quarter as well as downtime in general motors full size truck facilities as they prepare for their upcoming launches will have a significant impact on sales and profits in the first quarter of 2019 based upon these factors we expect the first quarter to have the lowest sales per production day of the year we have several of our customers and peers provide very similar commentary while we typically do not provide quarterly guidance we thought it would be helpful to do so during this period of heavy launch activity we included a slide 16 a sequential bridge from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019 we expect that our normal anticipated project expense for 2019 to be frontloaded and have the most impact in the first quarter as compared to the rest of the year as we prepare for the launches in the first half of the year that represent approximately 80 of all of our 2019 launches we will also continue to make progress on reducing and eliminating the excess launch related costs and improving the performance within our operations as we progress through 2019 that being said let me reiterate that all of these factors were contemplated in the full year 2019 guidance we provided in mid january nothing has changed we have reaffirmed this guidance with you today to wrap things up despite the challenges we faced in 2018 we still achieved solid financial performance and continued to generate significant cash flow we ve begun to improve on our launch and operational performance and have gained momentum in the latter part of 2018 and into the first part of this year and not to forget our cash flow generation has been strong we have been disciplined in managing our capital spending and elements of our working capital i expect these trends to continue into 2019 we are looking forward to a great year for aam thank you for your time and participation on the call today i m going to stop here and turn the call back over to jason so we could start the q a jason parsons director of investor relations thank you chris and david we have reserved some time to take questions so at this time please feel free to proceed with any questions you may have questions and answers operator and the first question will come from rod lache with wolfe research rod lache wolfe research analyst i wanted to ask you about the casting side of the business a little bit more obviously the business has been very weak you had a goodwill impairment the business has not been consolidated into the rest of the business so it seems like you re signaling something here that at the very least that that business is really separate and i was wondering if you can just speak to what you really thinking here could this be a candidate for divestiture could this be more valuable to someone else or are there real synergies at some point to holding it david dauch chairman and chief executive officer rod this is david we are not trying to telegraph anything i mean we had four business units when we started the year now we made the decision to consolidate to three business units by consolidating our powertrain business unit into driveline and metal forming as i outlined we just felt that it was the final stage of the integration in the powertrain it was predominantly legacy mpg facilities back to your question on castings our focus right now is fixing the labor issues and the operational stability issues we are making improvement there at the same time as i covered we have addressed some of the price initiatives with the industrial and commercial we don t have anything to announce at this time as we said to you before and others before we are always assessing core and noncore assets and at the appropriate time we will communicate that to everybody rod lache wolfe research analyst ok and just secondly on the performance improvement plan you talked about 11 million of sequential improvement in the fourth quarter was there anything unusual in that number in terms of recovery from a customer can you just talk to that and what are you expecting from q4 to q1 in terms of the magnitude of the improvement and then just also related to that it sounded like one of the more challenging problems was that your bluffton plant your replaced management there is that still a significant drag how does that kind of play out in the numbers chris may vice president and chief financial officer rod this is chris i will cover some of those financial numbers and then we ll proceed to the rest of your questions there as it relates to the 11 million on the sequential loss from q3 into q4 i would tell you that s clearly the net number we saw good performance improvements on our driveline side of the house we did get some customer recoveries that we did talk about in the fourth quarter but we also had some premiums associated with that so net net that is probably neutral in the quarter but offset any incremental costs but our driveline performed well in terms of on its path of improvements we saw improvements in our powertrain business as well from some of the premium costs that we incurred in the third quarter you asked us about castings earlier if you look at the segment information for castings you can actually see they ceded back a little bit so their operational performance was slightly negative in the quarter so if you do that math driveline and powertrain total was greater than 11 million casting was down a little but trending in the areas that we targeted supplier issues getting resolved premium freight outside processing labor issues getting resolved and kind of working through that so holistically on the plan that we described to you you asked about also going into the first quarter of 2019 we did put a bridge in our earnings deck as well we would anticipate on tracking another 5 million to 15 million in terms of improvements again targeting those key areas that we just talked about and improved on in the fourth quarter we will continue to chip away with those and make progress david dauch chairman and chief executive officer rod this is david in regards to your comment on bluffton we did change out part of the management team there we ve got an aam team settled into that facility now we are making marked improvements and starting to address some of the premium costs we have been incurring there but as we indicated some of those challenges will continue into the first half of 2019 but we re highly confident we can put them behind us by then operator the next question will come from brian johnson with barclays brian johnson barclays analyst yes so news of the day is amazon investing in rivian there have been rumors not confirmed one way or the other that gm could be investing at all ford of course made noises about an all electric pickup as is another firm out in silicon valley making noises about it so just kind of want your thinking on the pickup edrive opportunity which you ve talked about and then in particular where your primary customer could be going in that and your involvement if any david dauch chairman and chief executive officer brian this is david clearly we are fine in our future for electrification but we are also a strong believer that the ic engine especially on pickup trucks is going to be around for a longer period of time than planned we recognize and appreciate what rivian is doing and selling a potential niche that is there more from an off road and maybe a fun vehicle type application versus the heavy use of pickups for construction agriculture and other types of needs but clearly gm and amazon have made commitments that they want to get into this business gm from an electrification standpoint would like to see zero emissions over time that needs to improve trucks as well and we re going to be part of that solution we re already developing and testing electric axle applications for truck applications and as you know we already have electric axles in crossover vehicles and then also in the future performance passenger cars so we re prepared we re working with our customers at the same time our customers are going to dictate the integration of electrification along with the market with respect to pickup trucks brian johnson barclays analyst ok and in terms of what percent of the market you think could go electric for pickup and when do you have any so you mentioned off road high torque luxury should we be thinking sort of raptor ish kind of applications versus crew cabs and commercial use david dauch chairman and chief executive officer brian as i said i think it s niche applications you can put whatever percentage you want to put on there but it would be very low compared to what i think ic engines and powertrains will continue to support the product portfolio that s there today brian johnson barclays analyst ok second question there has been some press around labor unrest and strikes and lobbing for higher wage in mexico do you expect any kind of wage and salary inflation in mexico and does your guidance assume that david dauch chairman and chief executive officer we always have labor and wage inflation in mexico each and every year we negotiate those every year benefits every other year and we ve been able to offset that with productivity we re obviously have a couple we obviously keep a watchful eye with respect to the marketplace but we feel we re in solid shape at this time in mexico operator the next question will come from joe spak with rbc capital markets joe spak rbc capital markets analyst just want to turn back to castings for a second i know it s been a difficult year i think way back when i don t know you indicated you thought this could eventually be a 15 of ebitda margin business i mean given what you ve experienced this year is that still the view and do the pricing actions and some of the other operational actions get you there or does something else need to occur and any sort of updated time frame for when you think that might be achievable would be helpful david dauch chairman and chief executive officer joe this is david you re spot on it our initial goal was to get this business back over 10 which we did back in the second quarter of 18 unfortunately we ve slid here in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 18 as i indicated we did take some commercial actions with the industrial and commercial vehicle customers which will help us in regards some of the profitability but the biggest issue that we re still working to resolve right now is we had a labor shortage that creates instability in the operations that labor shortage is getting better for us now and therefore we expect to see improvements in our operations as we go forward so resetting ourselves we re just trying to get ourselves back to a 10 but ultimately getting back to that 12 to 15 our longer term goal we have plans to do that joe spak rbc capital markets analyst ok second just on sg a i think in the middle of this past year you ve sort of talked about that coming in around 6 of sales it came in lower how much of that was sort of maybe some tightening of the belt versus given some of the issues in some of the businesses and how should we think about that going forward chris may vice president and chief financial officer john this is chris certainly that was our thought process early in the year couple of things as we went through the year our sales came in a little bit higher which is on a percentage basis spins that up a little bit not a lot but a little bit we ve been managing very closely very diligently our r d expenditures those were down a little bit still investing where we need to to continue to grow this business but investing in tools to optimize our ability to engineer new products in a more cost efficient manner you re seeing that play out of course our synergies continue to kind of build through that momentum but managing cost on the sg a line is critical one of the key elements to our success and we thought we were very successful in 2018 looking forward i would tell you we would think more closely we re guiding a little bit toward 6 in 18 i think for 19 being closer to 5 5 to 6 so we ll drop down below the 6 closer to where we were in 18 joe spak rbc capital markets analyst ok last one the fifth ecotrac award can you just remind us sort of the size of that ecotrac business today in totality and then how large does it get once all those five awards are launched david dauch chairman and chief executive officer yes that business will grow by 2020 in our backlog to well over 800 million it s actually 550 million to 600 million today at the same time we expect it to grow beyond that 2020 calendar year period of time as well operator the next question will come from john murphy with bank of america john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst if we look at slide 5 and the issues that you ve had with the mpg assets you seem to have gotten a pretty good strangle hold on this pretty quickly but if so i mean from a customer standpoint i got to imagine they re reasonably happy i m just curious as you look at the competitive set out there and everything is going on in casting and metal forming and all sorts of metal launches in the industry it doesn t sound like you re really in a unique position of having some of these launch issues so i m just curious when you think a lot of folks look at this as maybe a potential to dispose of assets and raise cash and fix the balance sheet but as you look at this and the customer receptivity to what you ve done and what you ve identified is there maybe a greater potential for you to kind of consolidate some of these other underperforming assets into this business i mean i guess sort of the first question is really competitive landscape or other folks running into same issues and two maybe is this a more of an opportunity than an issue david dauch chairman and chief executive officer john this is david as you know our company is an engineering and manufacturing based company that s heavily focused on operational excellence we stumbled in the third quarter based on some launch issues and some operational challenges as i ve covered with you on the driveline side we ve for the most part got those operational issues behind us we re still working on one launch issue with the jlr side of things our metal forming group has done an exceptional job in regards to integrating and consolidating the marketplace and the mpg acquisition so that s been very positive for us in both those areas and we would continue to look to be a consolidator there the powertrain business unit clearly we took that over from mpg and we ve announced now that we re going to integrate that into our core driveline and metal forming businesses and then on the castings side that business was really a roll up under american securities and the grede organization and so we ll continue to evaluate what needs to be done in that respect but as we ve said as along we ve got to fix our balance sheet first we ll balance our priorities as it relates to capital usage but at the same time mid term and longer term we want to continue to consolidate roll up our core businesses john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok that s helpful and then just lastly on trade 301 and 232 i m just curious what your thoughts are there are you seeing any sort of customer inventory building in front of any risk around either one of those and how you sort of think about how to manage that as they manage it as well chris may vice president and chief financial officer john this is chris we told you from a dollar perspective for us impact here in 2018 closer to 5 million we are anticipating closer toward 15 million impact from those tariffs in 2019 we ve been working some ways to mitigate that and sort of the crux to you question we re monitoring we re watching behaviors we don t see anything abnormal at this point but as you know there are some announcements coming out here in the next short period of time which we ll pay very close attention to and then we ll act appropriately operator the next question will come from ryan brinkman with jp morgan ryan brinkman j p morgan analyst now that it seems we re about more than halfway through the gm light duty full size pickup truck launch can you give us an update both on this program and your involvement in it specifically and i know ihs hasn t had the best track record forecasting this program but it looks like they materially increased there outlook this morning for the t1 what are you seeing in terms of demand from the customer and then also i think importantly how have your decremental margins tracking relative to your expectations i think on the roughly sort of 35 lower content per vehicle on those trucks david dauch chairman and chief executive officer ryan this is david let me start with the first part of the question and i ll have chris cover the second part but as we communicated earlier from the current k2xx program to the t1 we had 100 of the business on the k2 program and we are maintaining about 65 of that business on the t1 program where gm insourced some work and then some are other activities there in addition to vehicle architecture type items so everything is directionally in line with what we ve communicated to you in regards to what our share of the business was going to be going forward the launches at fort wayne have gone very smooth the launches in silao have gone very smooth we re very pleased with the performance of our team with respect to the launch and production performance and then clearly we ve got the heavy duty and the suvs that we ll do with over the next one and a half year period of time as they work through their launch cadence with respect to volumes we re pretty well aligned with general motors in regards to about 1 25 million vehicles and ihs the last time i had seen i didn t see today s announcement was around 1 24 million i believe we re the no 1 so i think we feel good about that and then chris on the decremental margins i ll let you speak to that chris may vice president and chief financial officer ryan this chris from the detrimental margin standpoint we have historically talked about that platform closer on the 30 contribution margin basis and that is continuing to track both up and down on that platform nothing from that assessment ryan brinkman j p morgan analyst that s helpful and then just the last question for me just wanted to probe a little bit more around this section 232 if i can if these tariffs are extended upon steel and aluminum to also cover autos and auto parts is it your understanding that mexico would be exempt as part of last year s new usmca if so i would think that the core historical american axle business should not really see any impact but i thought to ask about the former metaldyne side whether you import much product into the u s from outside canada or mexico i don t think so but was curious chris may vice president and chief financial officer ryan this is chris again in terms of holistically as a company we do import a little bit outside of the north america in and that s the amounts i mentioned earlier in terms of our impact as you know our philosophy is to try to source historically it s been our philosophy to try and source in the region for which we produce as well as our vertical integration strategies continue to mitigate a little bit of any of these type of actions our operational thought right now is watching this sort of transpire over the last year or so mexico has typically been exempt when there has been some activity in this area we would be hopeful that that continues david dauch chairman and chief executive officer ryan this is david our policy from an aam standpoint from a production and sourcing standpoint is to predominantly produce and source products in the markets that our customers are going to consume those products that s why from a historical aam standpoint we haven t been impacted as much with respect to the tariff side of things some of the legacy mpg side we did get some of the impact which is what chris has outlined and we re in the process as we said of mitigating some of those issues including some resourcing and following the historical aam policy as it relates to flat loading and sourcing operator the next question will come from armintas sinkevicius with morgan stanley armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst can you talk about the landscape of the edrive awards how the fitting is going just an update there that would be helpful david dauch chairman and chief executive officer you understand armintas in regards to the two book programs that we have one being a p4 solution that s on the jaguar i pace and that business continues to ramp up from a volume standpoint so we had a couple of challenges as i mentioned to you in the presentation but we will work our way through that in the first quarter we re on schedule to deliver our p3 solution in that 2020 calendar year period of time and then right now we re working on i d say 8 to 10 electrification initiatives that have global implications nothing to announce at this time but we re coding various levels from components to subassemblies to gearboxes to full assemblies and we re hopeful that we can secure some of that as we move forward armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst ok and to the question around rivian earlier what is your understanding of the architecture does that include an edrive does that include just electric motors how would you fit into a truck architecture david dauch chairman and chief executive officer we ve got to understand a little bit more about that i m not the expert on rivian but i think it s more of skate design that still has a knee axle application not so much of corner module or corner wheel in application but that s what all i really know at this time but clearly we ll investigate that further operator the final question is from james picariello with keybanc capital james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst just to your free cash flow targets you clearly have high confidence in achieving the 1 5 billion through 2020 this does include a material ramp down in capex toward 6 of the sales can you speak to what drives the rationalization in capex what are some of the key examples of the opportunity that you ve identified here because you are reducing the investment run rate by roughly 100 million give or take by next year you ll obviously still be investing for growth so any color here would be helpful chris may vice president and chief financial officer great question and 6 is what we laid out for that time period as we mentioned and you just pointed out but if you think about what was driving some of our elevated capex a little bit in 18 and you saw us achieve a little better than we thought as well in prior years it was not only our new book of business which is very high in 2018 also in 2019 with the launches that we ve been discussing but also significant replacement business general motors full size truck also on the ram hd both of those programs drove significant capital expenditures into those next generation platforms and those really start to from an investment standpoint phase down here through 2019 where we ll see that benefit in 2020 james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst got it and maybe you already quantified this but with respect to the 35 million or so that you identified as addressable inefficiencies as of last quarter could you provide you ve obviously provided the helpful status updates through the quarters in one of those slides but can you quantify what was captured in the fourth quarter and what that cadence looks like through the year chris may vice president and chief financial officer when you said cadence you mean into 2019 james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst yes right you had that status update through 2q 19 you had the 35 million that you ve identified just wondering if you could quantify that cadence in terms of recapturing chris may vice president and chief financial officer correct we ll recapture in the first quarter of 2019 another 5 million to 15 million sequential run rate savings and then 5 million to 10 million in the second quarter and then hopefully these are all put behind us but again it will target areas of premium freight which we ve been reducing sequentially it will target reductions in inefficient labor inefficient scrap output things of those nature as well as some outside premium costs associated with material so those are the areas we re targeting and that sequence of improvement i d expect to be very similar to what we ve dialogued in the last quarter and we re on track to deliver that james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst ok and just lastly on the electrification questions have already been asked but can you just provide context on the regional breakout generally within that 500 million in new business opportunity that is currently being quoted out there just wondering from a regional perspective david dauch chairman and chief executive officer it touches all three of the major regions as it relates to north america europe and china i d say europe and china is weighted more heavily in those areas than it is in north america jason parsons director of investor relations thank you james and we thank all of you who have participated on this call and appreciate your interest in aam we certainly look

by howard schneider and ann saphir birmingham ala san francisco reuters when the federal reserve last month adopted a new patient approach to monetary policy it gave no specific guidance about how long its policy pause would last or how many more interest rate increases if any were in the offing this week as disappointing u s retail sales and industrial production data raised the prospect that the u s economy will slow more quickly than expected three fed policymakers gave an answer one rate hike or perhaps none at all it is not clear how widely those views are shared among all 17 fed policymakers several other policymakers speaking this week were careful not to say how long they expected their own patience on rates to last the first broad read of their views will come in march when the fed next releases forecasts for the economy and rates but the projections delivered this week for one rate hike this year from both atlanta federal reserve bank president raphael bostic and philadelphia fed president patrick harker and for perhaps none at all from san francisco fed president mary daly suggest that several at the u s central bank see little need to brake the economy for some time yet if that view is widely held the fed s march forecasts could show a suddenly flatter path for interest rates that better matches its new patient policy in december when the fed raised interest rates a fourth time that year most fed policymakers penciled in two more rate hikes for this year if the economy evolves as i just said i expect it to 2 percent growth 1 9 percent inflation no sense that price pressures are going up no sense that we have any acceleration then i think the case for a rate increase isn t there this year daly told the wall street journal in an interview though a rate increase could she said be appropriate if the economy or inflation unexpectedly surges i have moved down from having a penciled in number to having a very patient outlook on rates she told the paper bostic for his part repeated on friday that he is in no rush to raise rates so far he said our outlook for 2019 is still above trend at around 2 3 percent to 2 5 percent slower than last year but still above his view of the economy s underlying potential fed officials have for some time said they expect economic growth in 2019 to be less than it was in 2018 when it was propped up by government spending and tax cuts whose impact the central bank expects to wane but in recent months the expectation of how fast and deep that slowdown might become has been clouded by slower than anticipated growth overseas and financial market turbulence in the united states that can to some degree spill over into how consumers spend and businesses invest and hire fed governor lael brainard on thursday flagged those increasing downside risks and said she is comfortable waiting to see how they play out before changing rate policy a weak retail sales report for december released this week was followed on friday by a report showing manufacturing production posted its biggest decline in eight months in january bostic said that has not yet changed his outlook or his expectation that the fed will likely need to raise rates once this year i don t think it represents a fundamental change in my view of the economy bostic said to reporters at a workforce development conference but if the retail weakness continues we have to take that on in economic forecasts reporting by howard schneider editing by andrea ricci and diane craft

joining us today to discuss aam s financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 joining me on the call today are mike simonte aam s president and chris may aam s vice president and chief financial officer to begin my comments today i will review the highlights of our fourth quarter and full year 2018 financial performance next i ll comment on the performance of aam s business units and lastly i ll review our 2019 financial outlook before turning things over to chris after chris covers the details of our financial results we will open up the call for any questions that you may have let me start by stating that aam s full year 2018 financial results reflect record sales gross profit and operating cash flow despite some launch and operating related challenges during the second half of the year aam s fourth quarter 2018 sales were 1 69 billion compared to 1 73 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 aam s sales increased to 7 27 billion 1 billion higher than our full year 2017 and a new annual record for aam the primary reasons for this increase are related to operating for a full year as an integrated company a solid new business backlog strong light truck suv and crossover vehicle production volumes and higher customer pass throughs related to metal market from a profitability perspective aam made progress in the fourth quarter on the launch and operational issues that we faced in the third quarter of 2018 and continues to expect resolution of the matters by the second quarter of this year aam s adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 244 million or 14 4 of sales this compared to 295 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 or 17 1 of sales for the full year 2018 aam s adjusted ebitda was 1 184 000 000 this is another record for aam but did not meet the expectations that we set forth for ourselves at the beginning of the year aam s adjusted ebitda margin was 16 3 for the full year of 2018 compared to 17 6 for the full year of 2017 aam s adjusted eps in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 45 per share compared to 0 89 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year of 2018 aam s adjusted eps was 3 28 per share compared to 3 75 per share in the full year of 2017 it is important to highlight and as we noted in our press release this morning that we recorded a noncash goodwill impairment of 485 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to our casting and powertrain business units the impact of which has been excluded from our adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps calculations this impairment is the result of our annual goodwill impairment cap and reflects changing market dynamics and recent underperformance in these business units we ve been very transparent about these matters in recent discussions with the investor community we did not change our overall view of our long term goals and objectives for aam in any way shape or form aam continued to deliver strong free cash flow generation in 2018 aam s adjusted free cash flow in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 142 4 million for the full year of 2018 aam s adjusted free cash flow was 322 3 million compared to 341 million for the full year 2017 our net debt leverage ratio at the end of 2018 was 2 8 times and we continued to make prepayments on our gross debt with 100 million payment in the fourth quarter of 2018 chris will provide additional information regarding the details of our financial results in a few minutes let s now turn to our business units and segment performance for the fourth quarter of 2018 the driveline business unit recorded sales of 996 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and delivered 146 5 million of segment adjusted ebitda sales in this business unit were down versus the third quarter due to lower production days as a result of normal seasonality as well as additional downtime due to customer program changeovers aam did see improvement in operating and launch performance in this business unit especially as it relates to the build out of the current ram heavy duty truck and the launch of the next generation vehicle we also made meaningful progress in most of the supplier delivery issues that we faced back in the third quarter as it relates to our current production the only remaining issue we have is with a core product metal supplier that we are in the process of resourcing and insourcing as it relates to our electric driveline supply issues one of the issues had been resolved and we are moving forward with the resource supplier the other issue which relates to an aluminum casting supplier continues to drive excess cost including labor and material at premium price and we are working hard to get this critical issue corrected but do expect to incur premium price at least into the first quarter of 2019 no different than what we told you before the metal forming business unit recorded sales of 339 million and segment adjusted ebitda of 54 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 despite lower sales due to seasonality and program changeovers this unit performed at over 16 ebitda margin level for the quarter on a full year basis this business unit performed very well with an adjusted ebitda margin of nearly 19 the powertrain business unit recorded sales of 263 million and segment adjusted ebitda of 32 3 million as you remember from the third quarter we experienced significant excess project and launch related expense expense related costs from this business unit in the third quarter of 2018 we did however make improvements in launch related expenses such as premium labor scrap and indirect materials during the fourth quarter while we are able to increase ebitda margin sequentially by 30 basis points we continue to be negatively impacted by excess launch cost and operating performance issues however the powertrain business unit is on track with its performance improvement plan and we expect to see continued progress in these areas through the first half of 2019 and the casting business unit recorded sales of 218 5 million and segment adjusted ebitda of 10 6 million we continue to be impacted by labor and operational efficiencies and input cost inflation in this business unit as part of our improvement initiatives we ve been able to negotiate some price increase with our commercial industry customers this price impact started in the fourth quarter of 2018 but the majority of these actions will begin to favorably impact the business in the first quarter of 2019 we expect this to help improve the performance of this business unit as we go forward as we announced back in january at the detroit auto show we are consolidating our powertrain business unit into both our driveline and metal forming business units we are moving 12 facilities that make up 600 million in sales focused on highly engineered products into our driveline segment these products include differential assemblies and vibration control systems the remaining 12 facilities representing about 500 million in sales and focused on forming and sintered operations are being integrated into our metal forming business unit this business restructuring will assist us in accelerating and finalizing the integration process which we are working to complete here by the end of 2019 furthermore it will enhance the alignment of aam s product and process technologies and will help us accelerate the implementation of aam s operating system including important program management and launch readiness disciplines which we are lacking we will also achieve greater efficiencies within our corporate and business unit support teams and expect an annual cost savings of 10 million to 20 million keep in mind that these savings are in addition to the integration synergies associated with the mpg acquisition as you know our objective was to secure 120 million in annual run rate cost savings by april 1 2019 we achieved this in january of 2019 a few months earlier let me wrap up 2018 with a look back at some of the overall highlights despite the challenges that we faced in the second half of the year it was still a great year for aam in many regards we hit record sales of over 7 billion in revenues for the first time as a company we were also recognized as a fortune 500 company in addition we also hit the highest adjusted ebitda dollar mark and second highest adjusted ebitda margin in our company s history from a technology perspective we were awarded our fifth global ecotrac program won two light weighting awards for our advanced quantum technology and launched our first e aam electric drive system on the jaguar i pace vehicle strategically we sold the aftermarket division of our powertrain bu formed an important joint venture with wuling motors in china and met key integration and synergy attainment milestones we also achieved 14 performance and quality awards from our customers including our second consecutive supplier of the year award from general motors and we continued to generate strong free cash flow and made over 200 million in senior debt payments needless to say 2018 was a pivotal and busy year for aam before i turn over to chris let me provide some quick comments on aam s 2019 full year financial outlook today we are reaffirming the targets we shared with you at the autoshow conference in detroit back in january aam is targeting full year sales between 7 3 billion and 7 4 billion in 2019 we are also targeting adjusted ebitda for 2019 in the range of 1 2 billion to 1 25 billion an increase over 2018 and aam is targeting adjusted free cash flow range of 350 million to 400 million which contemplates capital spending of approximately 7 of sales as we look toward 2019 we expect to profitably grow further diversify our business and continue our trend of delivering strong free cash flow metrics make no mistake 2019 will be another setting year for aam especially concerning the strength of light truck suv and crossover vehicles in the marketplace coupled with a strong economy critical to our success in 2019 will be our ability to launch flawlessly and to restore operational excellence and discipline to our production operations especially the legacy mpg facilities we have approximately 50 product and program launches in 2019 including significant ram hd and gm full size truck launches many of these launches as well as our performance improvement plans will be completed by the first half of the year the benefits from our business unit realignment along with further synergy attainment activities should help drive improved performance for the year especially the second half of the year that concludes my prepared remarks let me now turn the call over to our vice president and chief financial officer chris may chris chris may vice president and chief financial officer thank you david and good morning everyone i will cover the financial details of our fourth quarter and full year 2018 results with you today and i will also refer to the earnings slide deck as part of my prepared comments so let s go ahead and get started with sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 aam sales were 1 69 billion compared to 1 73 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017 slide 12 shows a walkdown of fourth quarter 2017 sales to the fourth quarter 2018 sales the year over year decrease relates mainly to the impact of the transition to the next generation gm full size truck platform partially offset by continued realization of our new business backlog higher metal market pass throughs also contributed slightly to the higher sales of about 8 million for the full year 2018 aam s sales increased over 15 to 7 27 billion as compared to 6 27 billion in the full year of 2017 having a full year impact of the mpg acquisition added over 700 million to the top line in 2018 as compared to 2017 but aam also grew organically mainly on the strength of our new business backlog this increase also reflected higher customer metal market pass throughs which increased sales but had detrimental impact on our margin in 2018 of about 20 to 30 basis points now let s move on to profitability as david covered earlier we made progress on some of the launch and operational challenges that we faced last quarter gross profit was 225 3 million or 13 3 of sales in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the full year 2018 aam achieved record gross profit of 1 140 000 000 this equates to 15 7 of sales adjusted ebitda was 244 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 or 14 4 of sales as compared to 295 7 million or 17 1 of sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 you can see a year over year walkdown of adjusted ebitda on slide 13 lower volume and mix impacted ebitda by 26 million as we saw lower sales in some of our more profitable programs within the quarter in addition the timing of year over year customer pricing updates also impacted the quarter along with a slight impact from metal market and fx consistent with recent quarters we continued to see inflationary pressures on material and freight on a year over year basis this impacted ebitda in the amount of 14 million of which approximately 3 million related to tariffs while we believe that these inflationary pressures have started to level off some we have factored some additional inflation pressures in our 2019 financial targets mostly to reflect a full year impact of these issues that emerged in 2018 on a year over year basis we also experienced higher launch and project related costs in the fourth quarter of 2018 of about 10 million as you may recall this year over year headwind was 30 million in the third quarter and we ve seen some improvement in areas such as scrap premium labor and outside processing costs we do expect to make continued progress on these costs in the first half of 2019 and anticipate seeing significant year over year decreases in these costs by the second half of 2019 we also continued to experience run rate inflation on labor and utility costs similar to what we experienced in the third quarter as for supply disruptions we are still working on a few key issues to resolve but many of the issues were resolved in the fourth quarter our castings business unit continued with some operational cost increases with indirect input and additional maintenance costs in the fourth quarter of 2018 we continue to provide benefits from our synergy attainment activities with a year over year increase of 10 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and in line with our overall run rate achievement in goals when you look at the sequentially ebitda changes in ebitda from the third quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter which is detailed on page 14 the largest impact we had was related to volume mix and pricing sales were down nearly 125 million which caused a 46 million reduction to ebitda on a quarter to quarter comparison we did see a small benefit related to metal market and fx mainly reflecting an fx remeasurement loss that occurred in the third quarter but did not recur in the fourth quarter and lastly and most importantly we did see an 11 million improvement related to launch and operational improvements from the third quarter to the fourth quarter this is in line with the improvements we expected to achieve a couple of other things to know on the fourth quarter of 2018 as it relates to adjustments to ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2018 we incurred 12 1 million of restructuring and acquisition related costs these costs have been excluded from adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps we also recorded a noncash goodwill and timing impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2018 of 485 5 million 405 million relates to our casting business unit and 80 million to our powertrain business unit as you know we are required by u s gaap to perform an annual goodwill impairment test which we perform in the fourth quarter of every year on a reporting unit basis due in part to recent performance and lower than anticipated passenger car volumes in our casting and powertrain business units as well as the general contraction of market valuation multiples relating to similar businesses the process we used for this accounting impairment test under asc 350 resulting in a fair market valuation lower than the carrying value of these business units accordingly we impaired all of the goodwill that was recorded on the balance sheet of the casting business unit and a small portion of the powertrain goodwill but as david mentioned this gaap accounting charge does not change aam s views on the long term success of the business and you can clearly see the other segments in our business are very strong for the full year of 2018 aam s adjusted ebitda increased to 1 184 000 000 adjusted ebitda margin for the full year 2018 was 16 3 of sales now let me cover sg a sg a expense including r d in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 97 1 million or 5 7 of sales this compares to 101 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 or 5 8 of sales aam s r d spending in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 35 9 million compared to 38 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 sg a expense was 385 7 million or 5 3 of sales this compares to 390 1 million for the full year of 2017 or 6 2 of sales aam s r d spending for the full year of 2018 was 146 million compared to 162 million in the full year of 2017 through all of our year over year sg a comparisons in 2018 you can clearly see the realization of many of aam s synergy benefits now let s move on to interest and taxes net interest expense was 53 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to 55 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 net interest expense was 214 million as compared to 193 million in 2017 this increase reflects the full year impact of additional debt required to fund the mpg acquisition in the fourth quarter of 2018 we recorded an income tax benefit of 88 5 million compared to a benefit of 13 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 the primary reason for this significant benefit in the fourth quarter relates to the tax effect of certain elements of our goodwill impairment for the full year when adjusting for the tax impact on restructuring and acquisition related items goodwill impairment gained on the sale of our business and other recurring items we were running at an effective tax rate of just over 13 this is a little bit lower than we expected to be at the beginning of the year due to the final impact and benefits of the u s tax reform as well as some additional tax synergies we identified as we look toward 2019 we expect our effective tax rate to be around 20 the increase in our effective tax rate year over year relates to higher projected tax expense in certain foreign subsidiaries taking all of these sales and cost drivers into account gaap net loss was 361 8 million or 3 24 per share in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to net income of 106 3 million or 0 93 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year of 2018 aam s gaap net loss was 57 5 million or 0 51 per share compared to 337 1 million or 3 21 per share for the full year of 2017 adjusted earnings per share excludes the impact of the items discussed on this call and noted in our earnings press release adjusted eps for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0 45 per share compared to 0 89 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year 2018 adjusted eps was 3 28 compared to 3 71 for the full year of 2017 let s now move on to cash flow and the balance sheet net cash provided by operating activities in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 258 3 million capital expenditures net of proceeds from the sale of property plant and equipment in the fourth quarter was 131 2 million cash payments for restructuring and acquisition related activity for the fourth quarter of 2018 were 15 3 million reflecting the impact of this activity aam generated adjusted free cash flow of 142 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the full year of 2018 aam generated adjusted free cash flow of 322 million compared to 341 million in the full year of 2017 this represents an adjusted free cash flow yield of approximately 20 from a debt leverage perspective we ended the year with a net debt to ltm adjusted ebitda or net leverage ratio of 2 8x at december 31 in the fourth quarter of 2018 we prepaid 100 million on our 7 75 senior notes that are due in 2019 we are pleased to utilize the free cash flow generating power of aam to do exactly what we said we would do reduce our leverage and future interest expense the balance of these notes 100 million are now current and will be paid no later than november of this year aam ended 2018 with total available liquidity of over 1 4 billion consisting of available cash and borrowing capacity on aam s global credit facilities before i move to the q a let me close my comments with a quick note on our 2019 guidance david reaffirmed our full year financial targets that we previously communicated to you so i m not going to repeat them i do think it s important to note however that customer downtime in q1 relating to the next generation ram hd truck which is then followed by a ramp up of production of this vehicle through the balance of the quarter as well as downtime in general motors full size truck facilities as they prepare for their upcoming launches will have a significant impact on sales and profits in the first quarter of 2019 based upon these factors we expect the first quarter to have the lowest sales per production day of the year we have several of our customers and peers provide very similar commentary while we typically do not provide quarterly guidance we thought it would be helpful to do so during this period of heavy launch activity we included a slide 16 a sequential bridge from the fourth quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019 we expect that our normal anticipated project expense for 2019 to be frontloaded and have the most impact in the first quarter as compared to the rest of the year as we prepare for the launches in the first half of the year that represent approximately 80 of all of our 2019 launches we will also continue to make progress on reducing and eliminating the excess launch related costs and improving the performance within our operations as we progress through 2019 that being said let me reiterate that all of these factors were contemplated in the full year 2019 guidance we provided in mid january nothing has changed we have reaffirmed this guidance with you today to wrap things up despite the challenges we faced in 2018 we still achieved solid financial performance and continued to generate significant cash flow we ve begun to improve on our launch and operational performance and have gained momentum in the latter part of 2018 and into the first part of this year and not to forget our cash flow generation has been strong we have been disciplined in managing our capital spending and elements of our working capital i expect these trends to continue into 2019 we are looking forward to a great year for aam thank you for your time and participation on the call today i m going to stop here and turn the call back over to jason so we could start the q a jason parsons director of investor relations thank you chris and david we have reserved some time to take questions so at this time please feel free to proceed with any questions you may have questions and answers operator and the first question will come from rod lache with wolfe research rod lache wolfe research analyst i wanted to ask you about the casting side of the business a little bit more obviously the business has been very weak you had a goodwill impairment the business has not been consolidated into the rest of the business so it seems like you re signaling something here that at the very least that that business is really separate and i was wondering if you can just speak to what you really thinking here could this be a candidate for divestiture could this be more valuable to someone else or are there real synergies at some point to holding it david dauch chairman and chief executive officer rod this is david we are not trying to telegraph anything i mean we had four business units when we started the year now we made the decision to consolidate to three business units by consolidating our powertrain business unit into driveline and metal forming as i outlined we just felt that it was the final stage of the integration in the powertrain it was predominantly legacy mpg facilities back to your question on castings our focus right now is fixing the labor issues and the operational stability issues we are making improvement there at the same time as i covered we have addressed some of the price initiatives with the industrial and commercial we don t have anything to announce at this time as we said to you before and others before we are always assessing core and noncore assets and at the appropriate time we will communicate that to everybody rod lache wolfe research analyst ok and just secondly on the performance improvement plan you talked about 11 million of sequential improvement in the fourth quarter was there anything unusual in that number in terms of recovery from a customer can you just talk to that and what are you expecting from q4 to q1 in terms of the magnitude of the improvement and then just also related to that it sounded like one of the more challenging problems was that your bluffton plant your replaced management there is that still a significant drag how does that kind of play out in the numbers chris may vice president and chief financial officer rod this is chris i will cover some of those financial numbers and then we ll proceed to the rest of your questions there as it relates to the 11 million on the sequential loss from q3 into q4 i would tell you that s clearly the net number we saw good performance improvements on our driveline side of the house we did get some customer recoveries that we did talk about in the fourth quarter but we also had some premiums associated with that so net net that is probably neutral in the quarter but offset any incremental costs but our driveline performed well in terms of on its path of improvements we saw improvements in our powertrain business as well from some of the premium costs that we incurred in the third quarter you asked us about castings earlier if you look at the segment information for castings you can actually see they ceded back a little bit so their operational performance was slightly negative in the quarter so if you do that math driveline and powertrain total was greater than 11 million casting was down a little but trending in the areas that we targeted supplier issues getting resolved premium freight outside processing labor issues getting resolved and kind of working through that so holistically on the plan that we described to you you asked about also going into the first quarter of 2019 we did put a bridge in our earnings deck as well we would anticipate on tracking another 5 million to 15 million in terms of improvements again targeting those key areas that we just talked about and improved on in the fourth quarter we will continue to chip away with those and make progress david dauch chairman and chief executive officer rod this is david in regards to your comment on bluffton we did change out part of the management team there we ve got an aam team settled into that facility now we are making marked improvements and starting to address some of the premium costs we have been incurring there but as we indicated some of those challenges will continue into the first half of 2019 but we re highly confident we can put them behind us by then operator the next question will come from brian johnson with barclays brian johnson barclays analyst yes so news of the day is amazon investing in rivian there have been rumors not confirmed one way or the other that gm could be investing at all ford of course made noises about an all electric pickup as is another firm out in silicon valley making noises about it so just kind of want your thinking on the pickup edrive opportunity which you ve talked about and then in particular where your primary customer could be going in that and your involvement if any david dauch chairman and chief executive officer brian this is david clearly we are fine in our future for electrification but we are also a strong believer that the ic engine especially on pickup trucks is going to be around for a longer period of time than planned we recognize and appreciate what rivian is doing and selling a potential niche that is there more from an off road and maybe a fun vehicle type application versus the heavy use of pickups for construction agriculture and other types of needs but clearly gm and amazon have made commitments that they want to get into this business gm from an electrification standpoint would like to see zero emissions over time that needs to improve trucks as well and we re going to be part of that solution we re already developing and testing electric axle applications for truck applications and as you know we already have electric axles in crossover vehicles and then also in the future performance passenger cars so we re prepared we re working with our customers at the same time our customers are going to dictate the integration of electrification along with the market with respect to pickup trucks brian johnson barclays analyst ok and in terms of what percent of the market you think could go electric for pickup and when do you have any so you mentioned off road high torque luxury should we be thinking sort of raptor ish kind of applications versus crew cabs and commercial use david dauch chairman and chief executive officer brian as i said i think it s niche applications you can put whatever percentage you want to put on there but it would be very low compared to what i think ic engines and powertrains will continue to support the product portfolio that s there today brian johnson barclays analyst ok second question there has been some press around labor unrest and strikes and lobbing for higher wage in mexico do you expect any kind of wage and salary inflation in mexico and does your guidance assume that david dauch chairman and chief executive officer we always have labor and wage inflation in mexico each and every year we negotiate those every year benefits every other year and we ve been able to offset that with productivity we re obviously have a couple we obviously keep a watchful eye with respect to the marketplace but we feel we re in solid shape at this time in mexico operator the next question will come from joe spak with rbc capital markets joe spak rbc capital markets analyst just want to turn back to castings for a second i know it s been a difficult year i think way back when i don t know you indicated you thought this could eventually be a 15 of ebitda margin business i mean given what you ve experienced this year is that still the view and do the pricing actions and some of the other operational actions get you there or does something else need to occur and any sort of updated time frame for when you think that might be achievable would be helpful david dauch chairman and chief executive officer joe this is david you re spot on it our initial goal was to get this business back over 10 which we did back in the second quarter of 18 unfortunately we ve slid here in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 18 as i indicated we did take some commercial actions with the industrial and commercial vehicle customers which will help us in regards some of the profitability but the biggest issue that we re still working to resolve right now is we had a labor shortage that creates instability in the operations that labor shortage is getting better for us now and therefore we expect to see improvements in our operations as we go forward so resetting ourselves we re just trying to get ourselves back to a 10 but ultimately getting back to that 12 to 15 our longer term goal we have plans to do that joe spak rbc capital markets analyst ok second just on sg a i think in the middle of this past year you ve sort of talked about that coming in around 6 of sales it came in lower how much of that was sort of maybe some tightening of the belt versus given some of the issues in some of the businesses and how should we think about that going forward chris may vice president and chief financial officer john this is chris certainly that was our thought process early in the year couple of things as we went through the year our sales came in a little bit higher which is on a percentage basis spins that up a little bit not a lot but a little bit we ve been managing very closely very diligently our r d expenditures those were down a little bit still investing where we need to to continue to grow this business but investing in tools to optimize our ability to engineer new products in a more cost efficient manner you re seeing that play out of course our synergies continue to kind of build through that momentum but managing cost on the sg a line is critical one of the key elements to our success and we thought we were very successful in 2018 looking forward i would tell you we would think more closely we re guiding a little bit toward 6 in 18 i think for 19 being closer to 5 5 to 6 so we ll drop down below the 6 closer to where we were in 18 joe spak rbc capital markets analyst ok last one the fifth ecotrac award can you just remind us sort of the size of that ecotrac business today in totality and then how large does it get once all those five awards are launched david dauch chairman and chief executive officer yes that business will grow by 2020 in our backlog to well over 800 million it s actually 550 million to 600 million today at the same time we expect it to grow beyond that 2020 calendar year period of time as well operator the next question will come from john murphy with bank of america john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst if we look at slide 5 and the issues that you ve had with the mpg assets you seem to have gotten a pretty good strangle hold on this pretty quickly but if so i mean from a customer standpoint i got to imagine they re reasonably happy i m just curious as you look at the competitive set out there and everything is going on in casting and metal forming and all sorts of metal launches in the industry it doesn t sound like you re really in a unique position of having some of these launch issues so i m just curious when you think a lot of folks look at this as maybe a potential to dispose of assets and raise cash and fix the balance sheet but as you look at this and the customer receptivity to what you ve done and what you ve identified is there maybe a greater potential for you to kind of consolidate some of these other underperforming assets into this business i mean i guess sort of the first question is really competitive landscape or other folks running into same issues and two maybe is this a more of an opportunity than an issue david dauch chairman and chief executive officer john this is david as you know our company is an engineering and manufacturing based company that s heavily focused on operational excellence we stumbled in the third quarter based on some launch issues and some operational challenges as i ve covered with you on the driveline side we ve for the most part got those operational issues behind us we re still working on one launch issue with the jlr side of things our metal forming group has done an exceptional job in regards to integrating and consolidating the marketplace and the mpg acquisition so that s been very positive for us in both those areas and we would continue to look to be a consolidator there the powertrain business unit clearly we took that over from mpg and we ve announced now that we re going to integrate that into our core driveline and metal forming businesses and then on the castings side that business was really a roll up under american securities and the grede organization and so we ll continue to evaluate what needs to be done in that respect but as we ve said as along we ve got to fix our balance sheet first we ll balance our priorities as it relates to capital usage but at the same time mid term and longer term we want to continue to consolidate roll up our core businesses john murphy bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok that s helpful and then just lastly on trade 301 and 232 i m just curious what your thoughts are there are you seeing any sort of customer inventory building in front of any risk around either one of those and how you sort of think about how to manage that as they manage it as well chris may vice president and chief financial officer john this is chris we told you from a dollar perspective for us impact here in 2018 closer to 5 million we are anticipating closer toward 15 million impact from those tariffs in 2019 we ve been working some ways to mitigate that and sort of the crux to you question we re monitoring we re watching behaviors we don t see anything abnormal at this point but as you know there are some announcements coming out here in the next short period of time which we ll pay very close attention to and then we ll act appropriately operator the next question will come from ryan brinkman with jp morgan ryan brinkman j p morgan analyst now that it seems we re about more than halfway through the gm light duty full size pickup truck launch can you give us an update both on this program and your involvement in it specifically and i know ihs hasn t had the best track record forecasting this program but it looks like they materially increased there outlook this morning for the t1 what are you seeing in terms of demand from the customer and then also i think importantly how have your decremental margins tracking relative to your expectations i think on the roughly sort of 35 lower content per vehicle on those trucks david dauch chairman and chief executive officer ryan this is david let me start with the first part of the question and i ll have chris cover the second part but as we communicated earlier from the current k2xx program to the t1 we had 100 of the business on the k2 program and we are maintaining about 65 of that business on the t1 program where gm insourced some work and then some are other activities there in addition to vehicle architecture type items so everything is directionally in line with what we ve communicated to you in regards to what our share of the business was going to be going forward the launches at fort wayne have gone very smooth the launches in silao have gone very smooth we re very pleased with the performance of our team with respect to the launch and production performance and then clearly we ve got the heavy duty and the suvs that we ll do with over the next one and a half year period of time as they work through their launch cadence with respect to volumes we re pretty well aligned with general motors in regards to about 1 25 million vehicles and ihs the last time i had seen i didn t see today s announcement was around 1 24 million i believe we re the no 1 so i think we feel good about that and then chris on the decremental margins i ll let you speak to that chris may vice president and chief financial officer ryan this chris from the detrimental margin standpoint we have historically talked about that platform closer on the 30 contribution margin basis and that is continuing to track both up and down on that platform nothing from that assessment ryan brinkman j p morgan analyst that s helpful and then just the last question for me just wanted to probe a little bit more around this section 232 if i can if these tariffs are extended upon steel and aluminum to also cover autos and auto parts is it your understanding that mexico would be exempt as part of last year s new usmca if so i would think that the core historical american axle business should not really see any impact but i thought to ask about the former metaldyne side whether you import much product into the u s from outside canada or mexico i don t think so but was curious chris may vice president and chief financial officer ryan this is chris again in terms of holistically as a company we do import a little bit outside of the north america in and that s the amounts i mentioned earlier in terms of our impact as you know our philosophy is to try to source historically it s been our philosophy to try and source in the region for which we produce as well as our vertical integration strategies continue to mitigate a little bit of any of these type of actions our operational thought right now is watching this sort of transpire over the last year or so mexico has typically been exempt when there has been some activity in this area we would be hopeful that that continues david dauch chairman and chief executive officer ryan this is david our policy from an aam standpoint from a production and sourcing standpoint is to predominantly produce and source products in the markets that our customers are going to consume those products that s why from a historical aam standpoint we haven t been impacted as much with respect to the tariff side of things some of the legacy mpg side we did get some of the impact which is what chris has outlined and we re in the process as we said of mitigating some of those issues including some resourcing and following the historical aam policy as it relates to flat loading and sourcing operator the next question will come from armintas sinkevicius with morgan stanley armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst can you talk about the landscape of the edrive awards how the fitting is going just an update there that would be helpful david dauch chairman and chief executive officer you understand armintas in regards to the two book programs that we have one being a p4 solution that s on the jaguar i pace and that business continues to ramp up from a volume standpoint so we had a couple of challenges as i mentioned to you in the presentation but we will work our way through that in the first quarter we re on schedule to deliver our p3 solution in that 2020 calendar year period of time and then right now we re working on i d say 8 to 10 electrification initiatives that have global implications nothing to announce at this time but we re coding various levels from components to subassemblies to gearboxes to full assemblies and we re hopeful that we can secure some of that as we move forward armintas sinkevicius morgan stanley analyst ok and to the question around rivian earlier what is your understanding of the architecture does that include an edrive does that include just electric motors how would you fit into a truck architecture david dauch chairman and chief executive officer we ve got to understand a little bit more about that i m not the expert on rivian but i think it s more of skate design that still has a knee axle application not so much of corner module or corner wheel in application but that s what all i really know at this time but clearly we ll investigate that further operator the final question is from james picariello with keybanc capital james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst just to your free cash flow targets you clearly have high confidence in achieving the 1 5 billion through 2020 this does include a material ramp down in capex toward 6 of the sales can you speak to what drives the rationalization in capex what are some of the key examples of the opportunity that you ve identified here because you are reducing the investment run rate by roughly 100 million give or take by next year you ll obviously still be investing for growth so any color here would be helpful chris may vice president and chief financial officer great question and 6 is what we laid out for that time period as we mentioned and you just pointed out but if you think about what was driving some of our elevated capex a little bit in 18 and you saw us achieve a little better than we thought as well in prior years it was not only our new book of business which is very high in 2018 also in 2019 with the launches that we ve been discussing but also significant replacement business general motors full size truck also on the ram hd both of those programs drove significant capital expenditures into those next generation platforms and those really start to from an investment standpoint phase down here through 2019 where we ll see that benefit in 2020 james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst got it and maybe you already quantified this but with respect to the 35 million or so that you identified as addressable inefficiencies as of last quarter could you provide you ve obviously provided the helpful status updates through the quarters in one of those slides but can you quantify what was captured in the fourth quarter and what that cadence looks like through the year chris may vice president and chief financial officer when you said cadence you mean into 2019 james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst yes right you had that status update through 2q 19 you had the 35 million that you ve identified just wondering if you could quantify that cadence in terms of recapturing chris may vice president and chief financial officer correct we ll recapture in the first quarter of 2019 another 5 million to 15 million sequential run rate savings and then 5 million to 10 million in the second quarter and then hopefully these are all put behind us but again it will target areas of premium freight which we ve been reducing sequentially it will target reductions in inefficient labor inefficient scrap output things of those nature as well as some outside premium costs associated with material so those are the areas we re targeting and that sequence of improvement i d expect to be very similar to what we ve dialogued in the last quarter and we re on track to deliver that james picariello keybanc capital markets analyst ok and just lastly on the electrification questions have already been asked but can you just provide context on the regional breakout generally within that 500 million in new business opportunity that is currently being quoted out there just wondering from a regional perspective david dauch chairman and chief executive officer it

mexico city reuters the mexican government promised on friday to do what it takes to strengthen the finances of ailing state oil company petroleos mexicanos with an injection of at least 3 6 billion to prevent a further credit downgrade investors were divided over whether the plan which includes previously announced measures as well as tax cuts and refinancing some of the firm s roughly 106 billion in financial debt would be sufficient to compensate for the losses from falling oil output corruption and high labor costs it s injecting resources it s lowering the tax obligation president andres manuel lopez obrador said of the plan to help the company which credit ratings agencies fitch and moody s rate one notch above junk but above all it s cleaning out corruption market reaction the price of pemex s most heavily traded bond on friday fell after the announcement the yield for the 2047 bond rose 14 basis points according to marketaxess data meanwhile the price on a pemex bond maturing in 2024 71654qbh4 also dropped with its yield up 32 basis points reflecting bondholder skepticism of the plan the mexican peso weakened by more than half a percent against the dollar after the announcement but recovered later in the day advertisement advertisement analyst comments wilbur matthews founder of vaquero global investment it is a good sign that the lopez obrador administration recognizes that pemex needs to change profoundly one of the things that people have not noticed in the past is how badly it fell apart under the prior administration you have declining production debt is sky rocketing refining capacity is at all times low mexico needs to make some bold moves to reform the hydrocarbon sector julie murphy latin america corporate research at jp morgan we are extremely disappointed with the measures after two weeks of allusions to extraordinary additional support for the company we think 207 million in additional measures is a stunning disappointment advertisement advertisement importantly we do not think today s measures move the needle at all on the rating agency front for pemex where we think fallen angel risk is relevant over the next 12 months or on the sovereign side where we also see downgrades as likely luis gonzali portfolio manager at franklin templeton investments story continues i believe the market was expecting more even with the capital injection it will only be enough for pemex not to need refinancing this year however the unconditional support they expressed for the oil company is positive edward glossop latin america economist at capital economics unlikely to arrest the alarming decline in oil output and prevent yields on pemex debt from rising this year at the margin the bailout and the apparent pledge of more government support if needed may help to ease fears about pemex s balance sheet over the next year or so but the measures are not a long term fix and won t be enough to stabilize oil output which has halved since 2004 advertisement advertisement edgar cruz global markets credit research bbva we believe the announcement is positive and could be enough to remedy the company s additional financial needs for 2019 however we still believe pemex will need to roll over maturities for more than 6 0 billion in our opinion pemex could face a similar scenario for 2020 as we expect to remain negative due to the construction of a new refinery and as we do not see any drastic increasing in production due to strong under investment in reporting by stefanie eschenbacher and rodrigo campos editing by tom brown
originally posted on haiti liberte chaos reigns in haiti for a seventh straight day as its masses continue to rise up nationwide to drive president jovenel moïse from power for his corruption arrogance false promises and straight faced lies but the crisis won t be solved by moïse s departure which appears imminent today s revolution shows all signs of being as profound and unstoppable as that of 33 years ago against playboy dictator jean claude baby doc duvalier whose feb 7 1986 flight from haiti after two months of rebellion to a golden exile in france on a u s air force c 130 cargo plane was just the beginning of five years of popular tumult despite fierce repression massacres a bogus election and three coups d état that uprising culminated in the remarkable political revolution of dec 16 1990 when anti imperialist liberation theologian jean bertrand aristide was elected president in a land slide and then declaring haiti s second independence inaugurated on feb 7 1991 at a time when nicaragua s sandinistas and the soviet union had just been vanquished the haitian people defeated washington s election engineering for the first time in latin america since salvador allende s victory in chile two decades earlier haiti s example inspired a young venezuelan army officer hugo chavez to adopt the same play book and hence began a pink tide of political revolutions via elections across south america just as washington had fomented a coup against aristide on sep 30 1991 it carried out a similar one against chavez on apr 11 2002 but the latter was thwarted after two days by the venezuelan people and army s rank and file despite this victory chavez understood that venezuela s 1998 political revolution that had brought him to power could not survive alone that washington would use its vast subversion machinery and economic might to wear down his project to build 21st century socialism in venezuela and that his revolution had to build bridges to and set an example for his latin american neighbors who were also under uncle sam s thumb thus using venezuela s vast oil wealth chavez began an unprecedented experiment in solidarity and capital seeding the petrocaribe alliance which was launched in 2005 and eventually spread to 17 nations around the caribbean and central america it provided cheap petroleum products and fabulous credit terms to member nations throwing them an economic life line when oil was selling for 100 per barrel by 2006 washington had punished the haitian people for twice electing aristide 1990 2000 with two coups d état 1991 2004 and two foreign military occupations handled by the united nations the haitian people had managed to win a sort of stalemate by electing rené préval an early aristide ally as president on the day of his may 14 2006 inauguration préval signed up for the petrocaribe deal greatly vexing washington as outlined by haïti liberté in its 2011 reporting using wikileaks obtained u s secret diplomatic cables after two years of struggle préval eventually got venezuelan oil and credit but washington made sure to punish him too following the jan 12 2010 earthquake the pentagon state department and bill clinton with some flunkies from the haitian elite virtually took over the haitian government and in a november 2010 to march 2011 election process they pushed out préval s presidential candidate jude célestin and put in their own michel martelly from 2011 to 2016 the martelly group went on to embezzle misspend and misplace the lion s share of the capital account known as the petrocaribe fund which had basically kept haiti afloat since its creation in 2008 martelly also used the money to help his protégé jovenel moïse come to power on feb 7 2017 unfortunately for moïse having come to power just as donald trump did he was about to become collateral damage in washington s escalating war against venezuela surrounded by a gaggle of anti communist neo cons trump immediately stepped up hostility against the bolivarian republic slapping far ranging economic sanctions on nicolas maduro s government haiti was already in arrears in its payments to venezuela but the u s sanctions now made it impossible to pay their petrocaribe oil bill or gave them a golden excuse and the haiti petrocaribe deal effectively ended in october 2017 life in haiti which was already extremely difficult now became untenable with the venezuelan crude spigot now closed washington s enforcer the international monetary fund imf told jovenel he had to raise gas prices which he tried to do on jul 6 2018 the result was a three day popular explosion which was the precursor to today s revolt at about the same time a mass movement began asking what had happened to the 4 billion in venezuelan oil revenues which haiti had received over the previous decade kote kòb petrocaribe a where s the petrocaribe money growing thousands of demonstrators asked the petrocaribe fund was supposed to pay for hospitals schools roads and other social projects but the people saw virtually nothing accomplished two 2017 senate investigations confirmed that the money had been mostly diverted into other pockets so what was the straw that broke the camel s back it was the treachery of jovenel moïse against the venezuelans after their exemplary solidarity on jan 10 2019 in a vote at the organization of american states oas haiti voted in favor of a washington sponsored motion to say that nicolas maduro was illegitimate after he won over two thirds of the vote in a may 2018 election already haitians were angry about the unbridled corruption hungry from skyrocketing inflation and unemployment and frustrated from years of false promises and foreign military humiliation and violence but this spectacularly cynical betrayal by jovenel and his cronies in an attempt to win washington s help to rescue them from the growing fires beneath them was the last straw surprised and paralyzed by its lack of options and its own internal squabbles washington is now watching with horror the not so sudden collapse of the rotten political and economic edifice it has built in haiti over the past 28 years since its first coup d état against aristide in 1991 until its latest electoral coup d état which brought jovenel to power in 2017 the u s embassy is surely feverishly seeking to cobble together a stop gap solution using the un oas brazil colombia and the haitian elite as their helpers but the results are likely to be no more durable than they were in the late 1980s ironically it was venezuelan solidarity which may have postponed for a decade the political hurricane now engulfing haiti it is also fitting that u s aggression against venezuela s bolivarian revolution has created a cascade of unintended consequences and blowback fed by the haitian people s deep sense of gratitude and recognition for venezuela s contribution to them just as hugo chavez and nicolas maduro often said that petrocaribe was given to repay the historic debt that venezuela owes the haitian people
socialist â green new dealâ points the way to hyperinflation socialist venezuela s economic collapse and hyperinflationary spiral serves as a warning for american investors it s what can happen when a government spends perpetually beyond its means and refuses to face reality despite a u s economy that appears relatively strong and stable on the surface its foundation is beginning to crack under the pressure of a 22 trillion and growing debt load both republicans and democrats are to blame for that but rising pro socialist sentiment within the democrat party could turn our current debt danger into a clear and present disaster we are potentially just one election away from heading down a road to economic ruin one that could bring about a third world style hyperinflation in the united states in his state of the union address last week president donald trump specifically warned americans of the dangers of socialism he noted that it is gaining traction within some quarters of american politics he concluded tonight we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country tellingly many democrats refused to applaud in approval bernie sanders who nearly won the democrat presidential nomination in 2016 as an avowed socialist scowled his senate colleague massachusetts ultra liberal ed markey sat stone faced with arms folded meanwhile rising far left star alexandria ocasio cortez tuned out trump and plotted her next publicity stunt cortez sanders markey and 2020 presidential hopefuls including cory booker are pushing what they call a green new deal this radical proposal would be the biggest expansion of government size and power in history it would impose draconian economically crippling restrictions on industry and transportation while authorizing trillions of dollars in new spending on everything from windmill farms to universal college to universal healthcare to reparations for historically aggrieved groups to economic security handouts to people who are unable or unwilling to work the green new deal would spend the u s into oblivion blared a bloomberg headline the article warned of unrealistic and ruinously expensive economic proposals contained in the green new deal it would take every big spending idea that has emerged on the political left in recent years and combine them into one large package deal with little notion of how to pay for them all the green new deal would plunge the united states into full fledged socialism if a champion of it like cory booker somehow wins the white house in 2020 and republicans lose the senate there may be no stopping america s march toward economic oblivion this political black swan scenario is just one among other potential triggers of hyperinflation a world war or a systemic failure of the fed backed fractional reserve banking system are other potential triggering events a currency crisis of some magnitude which may or may not reach the level of hyperinflation appears to be inevitable even under favorable assumptions about our political and economic future the congressional budget office cbo in its recent report the budget and economic outlook 2019 to 2029 projects an unprecedented surge in the size of the national debt relative to the economy source congressional budget officethis is just the cbo s baseline forecast under more pessimistic assumptions higher spending levels lower tax revenues and or higher interest rates the debt to gdp ratio could rise even more steeply and if a black swan event were to hit on the scale of a world war the debt could hyperinflate requiring a hyperinflation of the currency to service it as the cbo acknowledges in its report high and rising federal debt would reduce national saving and income boost the government s interest payments limit lawmakers ability to respond to unforeseen events and increase the likelihood of a fiscal crisis all previous surges in debt triggered by wars or economic crises were unexpected and temporary in nature the debt surge we now are in the midst of is chronic in nature the result of decades of fiscally irresponsible policies it could have been avoided and would have if politicians had been subject to the constraints of a sound money standard gold and silver all these years gold stands in the way unlimited spending government power larry parks as larry parks of the foundation of the advancement of monetary education said in a recent money metals podcast interview with paper money there is no limit to how much money you can spend and if you have unlimited spending you get unlimited government and if you have unlimited government the people in charge have unlimited power they like that gold stands in the way gold is an essential asset for investors to own as protection against a currency debasement and possible hyperinflation silver though may be more the practical precious metal to have on hand if a wrecked economy degenerates into black market and barter transactions in hyperinflationary venezuela locals treat the official currency the bolivar like toilet paper as it depreciates by the hour they eagerly swap bolivars out for more stable foreign currencies or alternative underground currencies including gold silver and cryptocurrencies surviving hyperinflation requires flexibility and adaptability it will impoverish those who rely on conventional sources of income and savings you won t necessarily get rich by owning precious metals even as their prices shoot up in nominal terms but you will preserve your purchasing power over time

cbs news had a piece warning its audience about the problems of large government debt it noted projections of rising us government debt commenting the only countries with a higher debt load than the us are portugal italy greece and japan the first three have become synonymous with profligate spending and economic woes post great recession while japan s lost decade of economic stagnation is a mainstay of economic textbooks the first three countries are all in the euro zone they do not have their own currency but rather must adhere to rules set by the european central bank and the european commission their situation is comparable to that of a state in the united states no one disputes that it would be a big problem for utah or california to run up very large debts japan is the country most comparable but the textbooks cbs refers to seem not to be very reliable according to the imf japan s per capita gdp has increased by an average rate of 0 9 percent annually between 1990 and 2018 while this is somewhat less than the 1 5 percent rate in the united states it is hardly a disaster in addition average hours per worker fell 15 8 percent in japan over this period compared to a decline of just 2 9 percent in the united states in spite of having a debt to gdp ratio that is more than twice as large as the us japan does not provide evidence to support the warnings cbs gives about large deficits its long term interest rates are near zero meaning the debt is not crowding out investment its interest payments on its debt are roughly 0 5 percent of gdp 100 billion in the united states indicating that they are not crowding out other spending priorities and its inflation rate is just over 1 0 percent indicating that profligate spending has not led to a problem with inflation dean baker is a senior economist at the center for economic and policy research in washington dc a version of this post originally appeared on cepr s blog beat the press 2 14 19 messages to cbs may be sent here or via twitter cbsmoneywatch please remember that respectful communication is the most effective this piece was reprinted by rinf alternative news with permission from fair

in just over a decade short term rental company airbnb has redefined the way americans travel and lease their properties yet the economic policy institute cautions against looking at airbnb s potential for moneymaking without a healthy dose of skepticism a new cost benefit analysis of the impact of airbnb like short term rental services shows the economic costs likely outweigh the benefits according to the washington d c based think tank the institute analyzed housing costs taxes and renter behavior as well as impact on adjacent industries it concluded airbnb style rentals should have to play by the same rules as the rest of the lodging industry in an op ed for the hill the institute s report author josh bivens described short term rental companies as a benefit for a few that essentially amounts to a way around regulations that apply to many housing limitations the biggest and potentially most troubling finding in the economic policy institute s cost benefit analysis is airbnb s effect on long term rental housing availability the analysis found multiple cities in which property owners spurred increases in long term rental prices by moving housing stock into the short term rental market for example the institute said airbnb s introduction drove up average rents by nearly 400 a year in new york it would encourage owners and operators to be a little bit more aggressive on the pricing front simply because the consumer would have fewer choices when looking for long term housing said greg willett chief economist for richardson texas based property management business realpage furthering wealth concentration as property owners shift housing from long term to short term travel lodging with services such as airbnb travelers looking for a place to stay benefit from more choices and potentially lower costs however the report points out that housing wealth is not distributed equally in dallas white residents make up a smaller part of the population but occupy almost all of the upper income housing communities of color are often concentrated in low income neighborhoods which aren t as likely to benefit from the short term rental industry willett said as you get down into lesser quality rental properties you would have fewer units taken out of the marketplace at the same time taking out those lesser quality options would have a bigger impact that s where there are product shortages here and everywhere across the country willett said harming city revenue another detriment described in the institute s report is the effect a lack of taxation can have on cities where airbnb type rentals are expanding cities typically impose fairly steep taxes on hotel lodging the industry being upended by the rise of airbnb those tax dollars serve as a way for cities to generate money from travelers visiting their cities if the apparatus for collecting taxes from airbnb or its hosts is less well developed than the apparatus for collecting taxes from traditional hotels this could harm city revenues the institute said in a statement dallas morning news tns the living room of an airbnb house that was named the most wish listed airbnb in dallas last year

on kabc this morning ann coulter addressed the massive morning drive audience about her former hero donald trump urging them to forget the fact that he s digging his own grave the only national emergency is that our president is an idiot we don t all agree why but i think that a good 70 of the country would agree so much has happened since she wrote in trump we trust e pluribus awesome in 2016 earlier this morning someone asked trump how much influence she s had over his policy decisions ann coulter he babbled i don t know her i hardly know her i haven t spoken to her in way over a year but the press loves saying ann coulter probably if i did speak to her she d be very nice i just don t have the time to speak to her i would speak to her i have nothing against her in fact i like her for one reason when they asked her right at the beginning who s going to win the election she said donald trump and the two people that asked her that question smiled they said you re kidding aren t you nope donald trump so i like her but she s off the reservation but anybody that knows her understands that but i haven t spoken to her i don t follow her i don t talk to her defeating trump is the most important priority for the majority of american voters for 2020 but it shouldn t be thepriority replacing him with some status quo ante corporatist like biden or bloomberg or gillibrand will simply predict what no one thinks is possible another trump down the road let s opt for a great president instead of just someone who can beat trump they can probablybeat trump think about what will happen after they beat trump in the famous words of chris hayes who will they fight for what will they fight for who can be trusted to do what they say i d happily vote for bernie elizabeth warren jeff merkley or marianne williamson yesterday bernie sent a note to his supporters that reminded me why he s on the top of my list and much like we have moved the needle on issues like medicare for all college for all jobs for all and fighting climate change we can do the same on this issue as well but the good news is that the american people are with us on all of these issues and have been for some time they know that at a time of massive wealth and income inequality the very rich must pay their fair share of taxes instead of giving 1 trillion in tax breaks to some of the richest people and corporations in the history of the world congress should be raising the minimum wage to a living wage for working people 15 an hour and nothing less instead of encouraging and rewarding wall street speculators who gamble trillions of dollars of others people s money it s time for congress to pass a financial speculation tax and use the money to ensure kids who study hard and do well in school can go to college regardless of the income of their family instead of companies like amazon that made 16 8 billion in profits over the past two years but have paid zero in federal income taxes and in fact received a 269 million tax refund it s time to demand corporations pay their fair share in taxes so we can rebuild the disappearing middle class instead of repealing the estate tax and giving a massive tax cut to the richest two tenths of one percent as trump wants we must substantially increase this tax on multi millionaires and billionaires to reduce wealth inequality and preserve democracy in america there is a lot of debate in congress on this issue but among the people we represent there is none democrats republicans and independents people of all backgrounds and from all communities believe that it is time for the wealthiest americans to start paying their fair share we need an economy and tax system that benefits all of us not just the few and we can do that by creating a fair and progressive tax system that demands that wealthy individuals and profitable corporations begin paying their fair share of taxes we will no longer tolerate a disastrous trade policy which allows major corporations to shut down here send our jobs overseas and then line up for lucrative government contracts we will no longer tolerate massive tax loopholes which allow profitable corporations to stash billions in profits in the cayman islands and other tax havens while veterans sleep out on the street at a time of massive wealth and income inequality when the three richest people own more wealth than the bottom half of the country and when 46 of all new income goes to the top 1 we need a progressive tax system which demands that the very wealthy and large corporations start paying their fair share of taxes let me be very clear we cannot allow this country to become an oligarchy in which a handful of billionaires control our economic and political life bernie concluded by asking if people agree that instead of cutting taxes for corporations and some of the richest people in the history of the the world it s time for a progressive tax system that benefits all of us not just those at the top maybe he slanted the results by adding the greed of the billionaire class has got to end and if congress won t do it then we must yeah what we must do is present congress with apathy to follow since we first published the list of co sponsors of pramila jayapal s medicare for all act the first week of february tons of more members have rushed to sign on as co sponsors no doubt many of them are true believers like hank johnson d ga and katie porter d ca but pressure from their constituents may have had more than a little to do with some of the new dems like ed perlmutter co and katie hill ca as well as blue dog vicente gonzalez tx there s been at least a new co sponsor per day every day including weekends timothy faust did a definitive guide to medicare for all that should be a must read for everyone who talks or writes about healthcare he agrees that pramila jayapal s new medicare for all bill probably unveiled in another couple of weeks is astonishingly strong and should become the baseline for federal legislation toward single payer healthcare democrats have 8 other healthcare bills floating around some decent some horrible faust s answer the relatively simple problems of health finance have been made very complicated by people who make money off of healthcare so what are all of the issues being discussed and what do they mean what s really medicare for all and what s not how do existing bills stack up and why does this matter on the other hand you have federal single payer often called medicare for all healthcare plans in the single payer mold pool all the money currently spent on healthcare to insure every person in america by pooling this buying power into one giant public insurer the single payer medicare for all has much more leverage to determine prices through negotiation it can say oh we re only going to pay 200 for an mri instead of 1 000 or our data shows that a knee replacement costs 15 000 to perform even though you bill five times that amount take it or leave it and since it s the only insurer in town the hospital has to take it this isn t radical virtually every other country with universal coverage has a form of aggressive rate setting and it lets the hospital spend a lot less money on massive towers of billing staff these pathetic programs which usually revolve around a public option are what happens when politicians understand the need for a massive change but lack the moral imagination to do anything but genuflect to existing structures they are in reality corporate bailout packages which do very little for you but quite a bit for the aetnas and the sacklers and the joe manchins staring down these problems are the corporate dorks and the feckless policy dweebs whose policy prescriptions whose wildest visions continually place corporations in charge of our healthcare and ensure that american public money subsidizes them for failing at it if you hear 2020 candidates talk about the rot of american healthcare look out if they float a pragmatic policy solution or talk about plans named something like medicare extra as a service for you if they re polite perhaps they will at least say they support medicare for all before announcing they d be open to keeping the feet of private insurance companies on our throats this is the way things work now hospitals manufacturers and their various middlemen jack up costs while insurance companies demand massive public subsidies to keep them from jettisoning people who most need insurance if insurers can t get those subsidies they increase your costs of purchasing and using your insurance plan to compensate for the jacked up costs it is not profitable to insure people who are sick or who are likely to become sick it is extremely profitable to charge a sick person as much as possible so long as someone is footing the bill you ll have to read his whole long powerful piece to understand why he believes that jayapal s bill and only jayapal s bill appears to meet all of the criteria for a proper single payer plan it includes long term care with a preference toward home health it sets guidelines for care but lets doctors overrule them it is by all accounts the first actual robust single payer bill of the post aca era if you are looking for a bill to call medicare for all this is the one it must not be permitted to be weakened all that said and i know you won t every day is a new low in trump s white house that s also the name of the piecejust published by former fbi director and trump enemy andrew mccabe when someone told trump about it he started whining on twitter as is his wont the atlantic piece is an adaptation from mccabe s soon to be published book the threat mccabe makes you feel you are there as history is being made on wednesday may 10 2017 my first full day on the job as acting director of the fbi i sat down with senior staff involved in the russia case the investigation into alleged ties between the trump campaign and the russian government as the meeting began my secretary relayed a message that the white house was calling the president himself was on the line i had spoken with him the night before in the oval office when he told me he had fired james comey a call like this was highly unusual presidents do not typically call fbi directors there should be no direct contact between the president and the director except for national security purposes the reason is simple investigations and prosecutions need to be pursued without a hint of suspicion that someone who wields power has put a thumb on the scale the russia team was in my office i took the call on an unclassified line that was another strange thing the president was calling on a phone that was not secure the voice on the other end said it s don trump calling i said hello mr president how are you apart from my surprise that he was calling at all i was surprised that he referred to himself as don the president said i m good you know boy it s incredible it s such a great thing people are really happy about the fact that the director s gone and it s just remarkable what people are saying have you seen that are you seeing that too he went on i received hundreds of messages from fbi people how happy they are that i fired him there are people saying things on the media have you seen that what s it like there in the building this is what it was like you could go to any floor and you would see small groups gathering in hallways some people even crying the overwhelming majority liked and admired director comey his personal style the integrity of his conduct now we were laboring under the same dank gray shadow that had been creeping over washington during the few months donald trump had been in office i didn t feel like i could say any of that to the president on the phone i m not sure i would have wanted to say it to him in person either or that he would have cared i told him that people here were very surprised but that we were trying to get back to work the president said he thought most people in the fbi voted for him he thought 80 percent he asked me again as he had in his office if i knew that comey had told him three times that he was not under investigation then he got to the reason for his call he said i really want to come over there i want to come to the fbi i want to show all my fbi people how much i love them so i think maybe it would be good for me to come over and speak to everybody like tomorrow or the next day that sounded to me like one of the worst possible things that could happen he was the boss and had every right to come but i hoped the idea would dissipate on its own he said why don t you come down here and talk to me about that later after we agreed on a time to meet the president began to talk about how upset he was that comey had flown home on his government plane from los angeles comey had been giving a speech there when he learned he was fired the president wanted to know how that had happened i told him that bureau lawyers had assured me there was no legal issue with comey coming home on the plane i decided that he should do so the existing threat assessment indicated he was still at risk so he needed a protection detail since the members of the protection detail would all be coming home it made sense to bring everybody back on the same plane they had used to fly out there it was coming back anyway the president flew off the handle that s not right i don t approve of that that s wrong he reiterated his point five or seven times i said i m sorry that you disagree sir but it was my decision and that s how i decided the president said i want you to look into that i thought to myself what am i going to look into i just told you i made that decision the ranting against comey spiraled i waited until he had talked himself out toward the end of the conversation the president brought up the subject of my wife jill had run unsuccessfully for the virginia state senate back in 2015 and the president had said false and malicious things about her during his campaign in order to tarnish the fbi he said how is your wife i said she s fine he said when she lost her election that must have been very tough to lose how did she handle losing is it tough to lose i replied i guess it s tough to lose anything but she s rededicated herself to her career and her job and taking care of kids in the emergency room that s what she does he replied in a tone that sounded like a sneer he said yeah that must ve been really tough to lose to be a loser i wrote a memo about this conversation that very day i wrote memos about my interactions with president trump for the same reason that comey did to have a contemporaneous record of conversations with a person who cannot be trusted people do not appreciate how far we have fallen from normal standards of presidential accountability today we have a president who is willing not only to comment prejudicially on criminal prosecutions but to comment on ones that potentially affect him he does both of these things almost daily he is not just sounding a dog whistle he is lobbying for a result the president has stepped over bright ethical and moral lines wherever he has encountered them every day brings a new low with the president exposing himself as a deliberate liar who will say whatever he pleases to get whatever he wants if he were on the box at quantico he would break the machine after comey s firing the core of my concern had to do with what might happen to the russia case if i were to be removed i convened a series of meetings about that investigation including the one interrupted by the call from the president in which i directed an overall review of every aspect was the work on solid ground were there individuals on whom we should consider opening new cases i wanted to protect the russia investigation in such a way that whoever came after me could not just make it go away as requested i went back to the white house that afternoon the scene was almost identical to the one i had walked into the previous night trump was behind the resolute desk he lifted one arm and jutted it out fingers splayed directing me to take a seat in one of the little wooden chairs in front of him reince priebus then the chief of staff and don mcgahn then the white house counsel were in the other chairs the president launched back into his speech about what a great decision it was to fire jim comey how wonderful it was that the director was gone because so many people did not like comey even hated him the president actually used the word hate eventually he changed the subject he said that he wanted to come to fbi headquarters to see people and excite them and show them how much he loves the fbi he pressed me to answer whether i thought it was a good idea i said it was always a good idea to visit i was trying to take some of the immediacy out of his proposal to communicate that the door was always open so that he wouldn t feel he had to crash through it right away i knew what a disaster it could turn out to be if he came to the hoover building in the near future he pressed further asking specifically do you think it would be a good idea for me to come down now i said sure he looked at don mcgahn the president said don what do you think do you think i should go down to the fbi and speak to the people mcgahn was sitting in one of the wooden chairs to my right making eye contact with trump he said in a very pat and very prepared way if the acting director of the fbi is telling you he thinks it is a good idea for you to come visit the fbi then you should do it then mcgahn turned and looked at me and trump looked at me and asked is that what you re telling me do you think it is a good idea it was a bizarre performance i said it would be fine i had no real choice this was not worth the ultimate sacrifice in this moment i felt the way i d felt in 1998 in a case involving the russian mafia when i sent a man i ll call big felix in to meet with a mafia boss named dimitri gufield the same kind of thing was happening here in the oval office dimitri had wanted felix to endorse his protection scheme this is a dangerous business and it s a bad neighborhood and you know if you want i can protect you from that if you want my protection i can protect you do you want my protection the president and his men were trying to work me the way a criminal brigade would operate for whatever reason the visit to the fbi never happened one of the regularly scheduled meetings with the attorney general deputy attorney general and some of their staff came two days later on friday may 12 after the meeting i asked the deputy rod rosenstein if he could stay behind in part i wanted to talk with him about ground rules governing the separate investigations of the russia case by the fbi and the senate intelligence committee rosenstein had oversight because the attorney general jeff sessions had had to recuse himself owing to his own interactions with russians during the campaign but my main message was this i need you to protect the process after speaking to these points rod shifted his gaze his eyes were focused on a point in space a few yards beyond and behind toward the door he started talking about the firing of jim comey he was obviously upset he said he was shocked that the white house was making it look as if jim s firing had been his idea he was grasping for a way to describe the nature of his situation one remark stands out he said there s no one that i can talk to about this there s no one here that i can trust he asked for my thoughts about whether we needed a special counsel to oversee the russia case i said i thought it would help the investigation s credibility later that day i went to see rosenstein again this is the gist of what i said i feel strongly that the investigation would be best served by having a special counsel i ve been thinking about the clinton email case and how we got twisted in knots over how to announce a result that did not include bringing charges against anyone had we appointed a special counsel in the clinton case we might not be in the present situation unless or until you make the decision to appoint a special counsel the fbi will be subjected to withering criticism that could destroy the credibility of both the justice department and the fbi rosenstein was very engaged he was not yet convinced i brought the matter up with him again after the weekend on wednesday we would be briefing the hill as i saw it by informing congress of the bureau s actions we would be drawing an indelible line around the cases we had opened the four cases known publicly and any others that may have gone forward the four known publicly were those of carter page a foreign policy adviser to the trump campaign and a man with many russian ties george papadopoulos another foreign policy adviser who had told a foreign diplomat that the russians had offered to help trump s campaign by providing information on hillary clinton michael flynn for a brief period the president s national security adviser who had pursued multiple high level contacts with the russian government and paul manafort trump s campaign manager who had shady business dealings with ukrainians and russians on the afternoon of may 17 rosenstein and i sat at the end of a long conference table in a secure room in the basement of the capitol we were there to brief the so called gang of eight the majority and minority leaders of the house and senate and the chairs and ranking members of the house and senate intelligence committees rosenstein had i knew made a decision to appoint a special counsel in the russia case chuck schumer the democratic senator from new york was to our right mitch mcconnell the republican senator from kentucky and the senate majority leader was to our left the mood in the room was sober after reminding the committee of how the investigation began i told them of additional steps we had taken then rod took over and announced that he had appointed a special counsel to pursue the russia investigation and that the special counsel was robert mueller the gang of eight had questions what was the scope of the inquiry who would oversee the special counsel how could the special counsel get fired rod answered every question then it was over when i came out of the capitol it felt like crossing a finish line if i got nothing else done as acting director i had done the one thing i needed to do

using a rallying cry of it s the prices stupid the same people who used obamacare to make health insurance unaffordable and vastly expand public spending on medicaid for healthy people now want to impose stealth price controls on doctors hospitals and drug manufacturers some in the colorado legislature would be happy to cooperate they say u s health spending is high compared to other industrialized countries but that is only true if the u s spends more to get the same health services there is a lot of evidence that people in the u s get more health care and more for their health care dollar than people in other industrialized countries via better drugs more disease screening and more convenient and sophisticated care people in the u s also get health care faster they wait less for things like advanced imaging cataract surgery hip replacements and hernia repairs in fact the waiting times in other countries suggest that those countries pay too little for health care given a choice between spending more for operations or spending more for hideously expensive green energy which do you think a mostly blind british subject on an nhs waiting list for cataract surgery would choose even in the u s health prices in government run programs have little to do with actual costs medicare medicaid and the veterans administration lower their expenditures by arbitrarily paying pay lower prices than the private sector for the same services they benefit from laws requiring sweetheart deals for drugs free care from hospitals and provider taxes on hospital patients covered by private insurance when possible the private sector companies producing the health goods and services the government buys at artificially low rates make up their costs by charging people in the private sector more if private payers refuse to pay for the cost shift providers have no choice but to reduce services the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd provides the data used by those who claim that u s health costs are too high because u s expenditures are higher than those of other industrialized nations even with u s governments cost shifting oecd authors calculate that u s hospital prices are about the same as those in canada and sweden and are much lower than hospital prices in switzerland and norway as the graph shows a basket of hospital services that would cost 13 000 in the us would cost roughly 12 600 in canada 13 200 in sweden and 19 200 in switzerland what can u s governments do to reduce hospital costs they can make it easier for new hospitals to enter existing markets and level the playing field between for private and government owned profit and non profit hospitals they can begin removing the regulatory burdens they place on hospitals drug makers doctors and other health care providers how big is the regulatory burden the american hospital association estimates that hospital regulations add 1 200 to each patient admission that s a lot when a normal birth costs around 10 000 the majority of the federal regulatory costs are generated medicare s conditions of participation privacy laws federal quality reporting requirements the federal false claims act and electronic medical records meaningful use compliance standards few of those regulations have demonstrated benefits that are equal to their costs on balance they waste a lot of time and raise the cost of quality patient care want to move us hospital prices even lower in the oecd index the next time your elected representative claims to be doing something about u s hospital costs ask exactly which cost increasing regulations he proposes repealing if he cannot name any he is clearly not serious about really reducing health care costs linda gorman directs the health care policy center at the independence institute a free market think tank in denver

this is a re post of an op ed i recently wrote for the dong a daily newspaper it is follow up to my post from two weeks ago on the future of the south korean conservative party the post of two weeks ago was a diagnosis of the liberty korea party s lkp ills i argued that post park geun hye the lkp had no real ideology or platform beyond old style anti communism its devotion to the chaebol is passé and reeks of corruption and extolling korea inc yet again is just not enough when issues like terrible air quality spiraling consumer debt and hell joseon are the issues on voters minds so in this op ed i look at some possible models for the lkp to follow as it comes back from the wilderness the one which strikes me as most likely unfortunately is a trumpist populist turn the lkp presidential candidate of 2017 already test drove this idea calling himself the donald trump of korea other models either culturally don t fit well like a christian conservative party or represent no real change like copying the ldp of japan maybe we ll get lucky and the lkp will come back as pro market pro globlization party ready to open south korea s economy and support better corporate governance but i doubt it the trumpian path of racism damning immigrants and out groups and plutocracy is so much easier the extremely harsh backlash to the yemenis in jeju suggests this would be a fruitful path to follow too bad the full essay follows the jump in this space last month i argued that the liberty korea party is facing an existential crisis the lkp is now in what american political science calls the wilderness where a party out of power wanders in exile for a few years to reconstruct itself after a major defeat in order to become competitive again the question is how the lkp will come back will a post park geun hye lkp speak to south korea s current domestic priorities and not its own internal obsessions the lkp s last occupant of the presidency was impeached for a staggering corruption scandal which many party voters disturbingly continue to insist was actually a communist plot the party then got trounced in the 2017 presidential elections and then trounced again in the 2018 local elections its ideology of mccarthyite anticommunism and pro chaebol statist developmentalism is tired and has little appeal to younger and female voters on a host of major issues facing south korea the south korean right today has little to say or is simply reactionary south korea needs creative thinking on issues such as hell chosun i see this problem regularly among the students i have taught for more than a decade at pusan national university many pine to attend a school in seoul simply for prestige many wish to live work or attend school overseas everyone is obsessed with working for a chaebol samsung above all again because of the prestige those whose families do not have the resources for hagwons and tutors suffer south korea s intense stratification is brutal and far too humiliating for the less well off skyrocketing household debt a speculative real estate market here punishes the poor and lower middle class without the resources to rent or buy practically everyone is in debt now because of real estate and extraordinarily high consumer prices seeing costcos in korea flooded with koreans all the time is revelatory about just how expensive south korea is for consumers appalling air quality the usual excuse is that the dust comes from china but we know now that that is not true that much of it is home grown from the use of coal and lng everyone talks about this but the problem has gotten much worse in my time in south korea crashing birth rate south koreans are not replacing themselves fertility is now below one live birth per female south korea will start to contract demographically in less than five years some contraction of birth rates under modernization is typical but south korea s contraction has been extreme the government s response has been tepid controversial under resourced natalist programs tepid multiculturalism and vague hopes for unification with higher fertility north koreans this is just a partial list of concerns which strike me as the most important domestic issues here but one might include other obvious concerns such as traffic and pedestrian safety cleaner streets corruption family leave pregnancy and labor market participation relations with japan the world s highest rate of alcohol consumption corporate governance reform the treatment of minorities such as immigrants or homosexuals and so on in short south korea faces some pretty serious domestic issues where a normal political party would make interesting or at least relevant policy proposals and to the credit of the south korean left its parties have floated various ideas about these concerns over the years park won soon the mayor of seoul for example has prioritized these sorts of lifestyle issues including outreach to minorities and the less well off moon jae in has at least rhetorically recognized the need to discipline the chaebol and reduce corruption here is where the south korean right needs return from its exile with something interesting to say how would it win over the votes of my students with limited resources who want to find dignity and social mobility in a stratified society how will it speak to young women who would like to have children without losing the jobs they fought so hard to achieve in a patriarchal society looking at other democracies i see four possible models for a conservative party 1 a libertarian pro market pro globalization party the best examples here are the post ronald reagan pre donald trump republican party in the united states and the free democratic party in germany the lkp would return from the wilderness as a classical liberal low tax low regulation party determined to free up the south korean economy from heavy hand of south korea s state led development unfortunately this model has limited appeal voters like the social safety net the state s provision of services and progressive taxation the fdp has always been a minor party in germany and the american republicans have often had to cover their pro corporate agenda with more populist policy proposals 2 a religious party politically active christians in the west have organized themselves politically for two centuries and certainly south korea s protestant groups are both politically engaged and reliable conservative voters but south korea is religiously quite diverse with many buddhists and non religious voters there are probably not enough conservative religious voters for this strategy and politicizing religion would increase sectarianism in south korea as protestants catholics and buddhists sought to capture the party s agenda 3 tepid christian democracy european postwar conservatives organized themselves around the church after fascism had discredited nationalism this christian democratic strand dissolved into a general patriotism traditionalism and anticommunism the current lkp is somewhat like this although it is more akin to the liberal democratic party of japan than christian democracy in europe however this vague backward looking conservatism is losing out to the new populist trumpist model 4 populism trumpism the excitement on the global right today is around populist parties most obviously trump s remaking of the republican party but the brexiteers and the national front in france are also well known models while brazil and the philippines have trumpist presidents too the lkp has already flirted with this model hong joon pyo the lkp 2017 presidential candidate marketed himself as the donald trump of korea there is definitely some overlap trump and the european populists emphasize nationalism mercantilism xenophobia sovereignty hostility to islam and so on all of this would have obvious appeal to south korean conservative voters the sharp xenophobic response to the 550 muslim refugees on jeju in 2018 suggests trumpist populism might work here the downside is pretty obvious though trump the brexiteers the national front and the other populists are either openly racist and obviously flirting with racism most have authoritarian and gangsterish instincts all have disturbing relations with russia populist policy solutions tend to be pretty short sighted trade barriers reduced immigration looser money for an export dependent economy like south korea s which fought hard to free itself from both authoritarianism and corporate corruption the trump path would

amid slowing economic growth and rising inflation foreseen for hungary in 2019 equity investors are in search of the next big story in the country counting only blue chip papers on the budapest stock exchange brokerage equilor recommends buying into otp and mol but staying away from magyar telekom lajos török equilor head analyst otp bank s shares have been hovering around an all time high of huf 11 900 since it announced the acquisition of a bulgarian target and after record high net profits in the third quarter of 2018 a favorable economic background a further decrease in the hungarian banking sector tax strengthening lending activity in the region and a slow turnaround for a higher interest rate environment being the main drivers we expect otp bank to outperform its competitors on the stock exchange equilor head analyst lajos török said at a press conference on january 24 otp s bulgarian unit dsk bank announced the closing of the acquisition of the bulgarian unit of france s société générale group on january 15 and otp chairman ceo sándor csányi said the bank would keep its eyes peeled for further such possibilities among possible target countries slovenia and balkan states such as bosnia or macedonia seem to be the natural choice with société générale slowly but surely giving up its foothold in the region to be sure risks related to otp s operations are also plentiful especially regarding country specific regulations such as the surprise romanian banking tax or sanctions in russia in addition otp s wage related expenses are rising due to a narrowing pool of available professionals equilor nevertheless expects news related to acquisitions and the bank s increasing weight in the region to drive the share price to new heights in 2019 and therefore recommends buying the stock hungary based regional oil and gas firm mol is another favorable target for equity investment this year the brokerage reckons after a strong performance in the first nine months of 2018 the company s stocks are trading minimally below huf 3 328 its highest since 2007 while results for the full year are due to be published only on february 22 equilor expects the year to have been an overall success for mol despite a drop in refinery margins bálint szécsényi ceo of equilor reaching its goals the company is on a path towards reaching its 2030 goals strengthening is presence in the petrochemical market to diversify its portfolio amid decreasing oil prices equilor says mol in its latest investor presentation in london raised its net profit outlook by 10 for the 2019 2021 period and also for 2021 2023 risks involved here include a prolonged weakness in oil prices and a slowing global economy that would in turn make its mark on petrochemical and refinery margins nevertheless the company intends to raise its oil stock via acquisitions or organically continuing drilling in its norwegian fields mol s croatian refinery ina also remains a question mark with the story likely dragging on this year as well mol has signaled its willingness to sell its stake at a fair price the ongoing lawsuit that mol filed against the croatian government is nearing an end but recent regulatory steps in croatia may indicate that hopes mol s stake in ina would be subject of a state buyout could be trashed and the case could again stall this is indeed a never ending story so to say and risks continue to loom török said magyar telekom the telecommunications paper on the bse should be avoided in 2019 equilor says the fundamentals currently do not underpin the share price that saw a major rally late last year on buyout rumors the stock reached huf 465 earlier in january the highest in 11 months these rumors have proved unfounded but investors are seemingly still hoping for related news and expect its german stakeholder deutsche telekom to sell its ownership in hungary s largest telco we have heard the rumors we do not think a buyout is likely to take place this year török said yield versus the risks involved is relatively low equilor says with competition on the market increasing with the upc vodafone fusion as well as digi having acquired invitel another factor that has marred profitability is high personnel costs while the increasing interest rate environment would also be a negative for the paper whose dividend yield is traditionally compared to government bond yields the company paid huf 25 per share in dividends last year and equilor expects the rate to remain unchanged this year since magyar telekom needs to put money aside for coming frequency tenders in hungary the government is set to announce tenders for 5g frequencies which ensures immediate data transfer and the technology will likely help replace the landlines that have been used thus far for data protection szilárd buró financial and innovation director at equilor neutral target equilor considers gedeon richter the budapest based international pharmaceutical company a neutral investment target in 2019 last year the company had its ups and downs with the operations of its romanian wholesaler pharmafarm temporarily suspended and issues around its esmya that ate into profits for the whole 2018 it s a big positive that pharmafarm is operating again the string of unlucky events may be over at richter we will take a careful look at this year s performance török noted richter is set to publish 2018 results on february 7 when exact figures of the revenue fallout on the romanian suspension should be published the stock price rose to as high as huf 6 020 in january the highest since march 2018 which could remain around current levels this year equilor expects a further increase after the publication of the 2018 results if there is a lower than expected drop in revenues and profits and on any favorable news around the drug esmya used to treat uterine fibroids in adult women on the upside the company s own cariprazine a drug approved in the united states under the brand name vraylar for treating bipolar depression has been a success the company may be well over the shocks that hit operations last year and may return to business as usual in 2019
