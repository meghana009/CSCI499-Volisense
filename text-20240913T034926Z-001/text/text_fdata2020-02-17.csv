as you know once in a while splendid exchange looks at seven major currency pairs in search of the evidence of popular delusions and the madness of crowds the idea is to find anomalies and bullish or bearish divergences that will break the trend not prolong it it is a painful exercise but also highly rewarding in order to find the most overbought and oversold currency i conduct five econometric studies over extension analysis secular performance analysis oil correlation economic divergence analysis and effective exchange rate study additionally i look at traders positioning to understand the psychological state of the market analyzed currency pairs aud usd eur usd gpb usd nzd usd usd cad usd chf and usd jpy relevant etfs most popular croc ero eufx fxa fxb fxc fxe fxf fxy and gbb macro forces before revealing the results let me first say a few words about the current global market environment this is important because global macro conditions cannot be numerically measured and cannot be directly factored into econometrical models they must be studied in qualitative terms in my opinion the most important themes impacting global foreign exchange market right now are the spread of coronavirus and growing fears of a global recession coronavirus if the virus is brought under control which seems possible given that the rate of increase in the number of new cases has slowed after a big jump due to a change in methodology then it is reasonable to assume that chinese economy will resume operations later in february and get more or less back to normal from march onwards however some output especially discretionary spending will be lost forever still most output lost in q1 will be made up later as activity slowly gets back to normal and that front loading of macro stimulus measures will also support a recovery in growth coronavirus chart 1 daily increases in total confirmed cases and recovered cases coronavirus chart 2 logarithmic growth source johns hopkins university the impact on other economies outside china will work through lower demand for their exports disruption to supply chains and less tourism if the virus takes longer to control the weakness in global economic growth in q1 could spread to q2 and although there would still be a rebound beyond that the net effects would be larger the economic shock due to the coronavirus probably means that the global monetary easing cycle is not over yet although the shock is likely to be temporary it will have a significant near term dampening effect on a global economy that was in a weak position to start with see below global recession in 2020 the united nations has warned that weaker growth in both advanced and developing countries means the possibility of a global recession in 2020 is a clear and present danger in a flagship report the un s trade and development body unctad said that 2019 endured the weakest expansion in a decade and there was a risk of the slowdown turning into outright contraction next year while there is no consensus among the economists about the impending recession there is certainly an agreement that growth in 2020 would be sluggish at best in addition central banks attempts to normalize monetary policy are now endangered by persistently low inflation growth forecasts downgraded source abn amro forex traders should therefore be on high alert for competitive devaluations as countries across the globe take steps either implicitly or explicitly to depreciate the value of their currency in order to spur exports and boost the economy in this regard it becomes particularly important to monitor currencies relative value this is exactly what my econometric studies attempt to achieve below are the latest results forex valuation latest results i will not go through the results of each of the studies but instead will illustrate the final ranking if you want to see the individual results of each of the studies scroll down to the charts section below i have ranked 28 currencies on the scale of 13 0 to 14 0 for each of the studies where 13 0 indicates oversold conditions and 14 0 indicates overbought conditions therefore the overall minimum score that any currency can have is 65 0 while the maximum is 70 0 source personal calculations ranking as of february 16 2020 on balance the israeli new shekel new taiwan dollar and mexican peso appear to be the most overrated currencies with a net score of 55 46 and 37 respectively see the chart above the thai baht czech koruna british pound and indian rupee are not far behind at 36 34 34 and 33 respectively the most underrated or undervalued currencies are the chilean peso 47 hungarian forint 36 and norwegian krone 32 when looking solely at the major currencies we see that the swiss franc and british pound stand out among the rest as the most overvalued currencies on the basis of all six studies by turn the australian dollar appears to be the most undervalued currency among the majors see the chart below source personal calculations ranking as of february 16 2020 what is important is that the relative overvaluation of the british pound is rather broad based in other words the results are above zero for most econometric studies plus traders sentiment analysis conversely the relative undervaluation of the australian dollar is less extensive for instance secular performance analysis indicates that the currency is more or less fairly valued if you are a contrarian investor you will want to short the most overvalued currency against the most undervalued currency at this point in time the most contrarian trade among the major currencies is to sell the british pound against the australian dollar or buy aud gbp however one needs to be careful here because technicals do not yet support the bullish case for aud gbp see the chart below the pair needs to close above 0 5200 to negate the bearish trend source tradingview now let s look at the econometric studies econometric studies over extension analysis over extension analysis ranks the exchange rates in percentages of their respective trading ranges over the past years and allows us to see how far each currency has deviated from its historical three year trading range i choose to look at the three year period for several reasons first of all it is long enough to capture more than half of a standard business cycle of most economies according to the national bureau of economic research the average length of a business cycle is about 69 months or a little less than six years at the same time a three year range is short enough to be relevant and not to produce too smoothed out results in other words analytical curves maintain some healthy volatility and tend to generate actionable trading signals the most overextended currency is the japanese yen as of friday it was trading at 50 74 of its three year range the most lagging currency is the australian dollar trading at only 2 85 of its three year range sources fxcm forex databank website personal calculations oil correlation oil correlation study simply examines the link between a country s exchange rate and the price of oil this relationship is quite critical because oil prices serve as an important proxy for future changes in the consumer price index which influences countries macroeconomic policies which in turn affect the exchange rate based on the 12 month running oil price standard correlations i have calculated that the australian dollar is undervalued by 8 74 while the british pound is overvalued by around 0 66 sources fxcm forex databank website personal calculations secular performance assessing the strength of any given currency is quite tricky because we usually measure the performance of one currency against the other the result is always biased for example a rising gbpusd may not necessarily reflect improved fundamentals in the united kingdom but rather point to deteriorating fundamentals in the united states a less biased approach would be to compare a currency s performance against some kind of neutral asset such as gold analysts call it a secular performance analysis secular performance is a useful but underused concept in forex trading it is an important measure because gold it is assumed has some intrinsic value as opposed to fiat currency which is just a legal tender not backed by any physical commodity in the end the price of gold will be determined by supply and demand rather than by central banks monetary policy and the printing press analyzing currency performance against that of gold allows us to see the scale of real demand for this or that currency based on the 12 month running secular performance observations i have calculated that the us dollar is currently undervalued by an average of 1 4 against seven majors however as of last friday it was most undervalued against the british pound 4 28 and the australian dollar 2 79 in other words gbp usd is the most overvalued currency pair based on secular performance analysis the japanese yen is undervalued by 2 28 sources fxcm forex databank website personal calculations economic divergence as a general rule economic data should always justify the moves in currencies exchange rates however it is difficult if not downright useless to cherry pick a single economic indicator and compare it to a currency s performance because the relative importance of any given economic indicator will vary depending on the economy in question for example trade balance data can influence the exchange rate of commodity exporters such as australia and new zealand but it is less relevant for the united states whose dollar is a global safe haven at least for now in theory gdp growth should act as an ultimate barometer of economic health but gdp data is released too infrequently usually on a quarterly basis to be relevant in my analysis instead i prefer to look at countries bond yields two year bond yields are considered to be an important measuring stick for market confidence and investor appetites most importantly yields essentially reflect investors and traders expectations of central banks monetary policy which is a major driver for the exchange rates therefore the difference between two countries two year bond yields should indicate which country is running a more expansionary monetary policy which should be bearish for that country s currency and which country is in the contraction stage which should be bullish for that country s currency usually the currency of the country with the higher bond yield appreciates against the currency of the country with the lower bond yield based on the 12 month running two year bond spreads correlations i have calculated that the australian dollar is the most undervalued currency among the majors 6 20 while the british pound is the most overvalued one 1 16 sources fxcm forex databank website personal calculations effective exchange rate effective exchange rate eer equals nominal exchange rate calculated as geometric weighted averages of bilateral exchange rates adjusted for relative consumer prices the most recent weights are based on trade in the 2014 16 period with 2010 as the indices base year as you can see from the chart below the swiss franc has appreciated the most among its peers followed by the u s dollar while the australian dollar the canadian dollar and the japanese yen are clearly lagging behind overall the eer analysis does confirm the relative overvaluation of the swiss franc 127 93 and the relative undervaluation of the australian dollar 81 92 see the charts below source central bank official statistics positioning commitments of traders reports issued by the u s commodity futures trading commission help me analyze traders sentiment in all my studies i am on the lookout for potential extremes over a three year period specifically i monitor net positions by non commercial traders large speculators such as hedge funds and convert them to the scale from 0 to 100 a reading close to 0 suggests that commitments are close to the lower bound of a three year range while a reading close to 100 suggests that commitments are approaching the upper bound for me overbought conditions are present when non commercial positions are at 90 and higher while oversold conditions are present when non commercial positions are at 10 and lower on this measure the most overbought currency is the swiss franc while the most oversold currency is the euro sources cftc personal calculations trading

the s performance last week is best understood as the fulcrum of the seesaw the major currencies that are perceived to be levered or growth and or risk rose these are the dollar bloc and the scandis the sold off before the weekend perhaps as the market anticipates a weak report that may reinforce ideas that the rate hike at the end of last year was not the start of a tightening sequence actually led the advancers with a 1 2 gain it was firm all week but was bid higher on speculation that the new chancellor of the exchequer often seen as the second most important person in the uk government will support a more expansionary fiscal policy it would arguably boost growth prospects and take pressure off the bank of england the and and along with the swedish krona were on the other side of the teeter totter the euro was the weakest of the majors losing a little more than 1 on its way to its lowest level since april 2017 the euro lost twice as much as the swiss franc so the cross fell to its lowest level since july 2015 among emerging market currencies eastern and central european currencies underperformed while the edged out sterling to be the best performer last week the peso rose every session last week unperturbed by the quarter point rate cut year to date the peso is the strongest currency in the world rising by a pinch more than 2 so far the jp morgan emerging markets currency index snapped a four week slide with an almost 0 3 gain the two strongest technical indications are for a higher and a continued recovery in prices dips in the mexican peso will likely be seen as a buying opportunity for asset managers and hedge funds recognizing that china heavily manages its currency even if not by direct intervention the political and economic considerations favor modest weakening fo the dollar index two weeks into this month and the dollar index has fallen once it sits at a four month high near 99 15 the macd is getting stretched but moving higher the slow stochastic has begun leveling out it continues to hug the upper bollinger band the next immediate target is near 99 25 and then 99 65 last year s high there is also the psychological attraction of the 100 level the dollar index would have to fall through the 98 50 area to signal this leg is over remember that the dollar index is not really a valid trade weighted basket and instead is heavily weighted toward the euro which has underperformed euro the euro fell out of bed in the first half of february it rose once above the previous session s high february 13 by one hundredth of a cent it closed january a little below 1 11 and approached 1 0825 ahead of the weekend the strength of the downside momentum is illustrated by the fact that it has closed underneath its lower bollinger band for the past three sessions there is an old gap on the daily and weekly bar charts from the 2017 french elections first round that is found roughly between 1 0740 and 1 0820 the macd is stretched but trending lower while the slow stochastic appears to be trying to bottom the 1 0900 1 0925 area marks the nearby ceiling japanese yen last week s range jpy109 55 jpy110 15 was the narrowest weekly range this year the greenback is consolidating after rising in the first three sessions last week it slipped in the previous two to finish a little higher for the second consecutive week the macd and slow stochastic are tentatively rolling over though not from extended territory initial support for the dollar is seen near the jpy109 45 jpy109 50 area that houses a 38 2 retracement of the month s gain and the 20 day moving average below there support is pegged in the jpy109 00 jpy109 20 band british pound the increased possibility of a stimulative budget helped sterling recover back above 1 30 for the first time in five sessions on february 13 spurred by the naming of a new chancellor of the exchequer sterling rose in every session last week something it has not done since april 2018 the macd and slow stochastic look to be turning higher a move above the 1 3085 1 3100 area opens the door to retest the month s high near 1 3215 provided the 1 30 level holds the euro lost 2 25 against sterling last week to trade below gbp0 8300 and is approaching last year s low mid december near gbp0 8275 while the technical indicators suggest there is scope for additional near term losses it has closed below the lower bollinger band for the past two sessions gbp0 8325 canadian dollar the u s dollar began the week rising to new four month highs near cad1 3330 it fell about 0 5 in the next two sessions before consolidating in the last two the greenback snapped a four week advance by slipping about 0 4 against the loonie the 3 4 rally in oil prices and the nearly 1 7 advance of the last week the first weekly advance this year coupled with the risk appetite reflected in rising equities seemed to help fuel the canadian dollar s recovery this is consistent with our reading of the charts the technical studies suggest the greenback s pullback has just begun initial support has been encountered near cad1 3235 and below there in the cad1 3215 cad1 3220 area the 20 and 200 day moving averages are found as is the 38 2 retracement of the rally since january 22 low cad1 3035 a break of these supports will boost our confidence that the u s dollar may return toward cad1 3100 cad1 3150 australian dollar the extended its recent losses to see its lowest level in a decade 0 6660 at the start of last week before bouncing to 0 6750 in the middle of the week it spent the previous two sessions consolidating at lower levels a break of the 0 6680 0 6700 area now would suggest a durable low is not in place the low from the great financial crisis was near 0 6000 and a secondary low was near 0 6250 still the macd and slow stochastic are turning higher and the latter did not even confirm last week s new low a close above the 20 day moving average 0 6755 to start the new week something not done since january 6 would lend support to those thinking the aussie may be bottoming mexican peso the dollar has not bottomed against the peso our mxn18 50 target is being approached a convincing break leaves the greenback with little support until the mxn18 00 area the macd and slow stochastic are not generating strong signals but also have not confirmed last week s lows note that speculators in the futures market have taken some profits recently the net long position which reached a record at the end of january has fallen for the past two weeks through february 11 gross longs have fallen for three weeks even after banxico s 25 bp rate mexico s high real and nominal interest rates attract asset managers and levered accounts some of whom use the yen swiss franc and perhaps more recently the euro to fund the peso position chinese yuan since returning from the extended lunar new year holiday chinese officials have accepted roughly a cny6 95 cny7 0260 range for the dollar the logic of the situation i e a negative economic shock easier monetary policy and a push not to miss economic growth targets seems most consistent with a weaker yuan a move toward cny7 05 would be unlikely to raise the american s ire gold the price of the yellow metal rose by about 14 5 last week 0 9 after falling 18 7 1 2 the prior week the macd is trying to turn up from a decline that began last month around the escalation of u s iran hostilities the slow stochastic is curling up found support around 1550 after spiking to a little above 1611 in january the month s high near 1592 is the next hurdle for gold which finished last week at 1584 oil the april light sweet crude oil futures contract ended a five week 20 plunge with a 3 5 bounce the contract appears to have put in a double bottom 49 50 49 60 and the neckline is about 52 35 the high before the weekend was roughly 52 55 but the close was a few cents below the neckline the measuring objective of the double bottom is around 55 50 which corresponds with the 200 day moving average 55 70 and the 38 2 retracement objective of the decline from last month s spike 65 00 the macd and slow stochastic have turned higher u s rates the u s

terms that means a return to 1 50 even after powell s testimony before congress and a number of other fed officials noting how well the economy is doing the market continues to price in more than one

been trending higher since early this month but the slow stochastic is flattening near where is has peaked previously the 3385 area may need to be surmounted to sustain the recent momentum it is

summary more on the asian contagion rating the ease of doing business sweden tries being positive i spent a good portion of the last two weeks traveling along the west coast of north america the atmosphere in the airplanes and airports was cautious many were wearing face masks jumbo dispensers of hand sanitizer were everywhere and heads turned nervously at every sneeze and cough sneezes and sniffles are not at all uncommon in early february nor is influenza which infected an estimated 35 million americans last year sadly about 34 000 of those patients did not survive according to the centers for disease control and prevention but this year fear of the coronavirus has people around the world on edge while we don t anticipate significant damage to global growth the spreading sickness and the response it has prompted could create a more serious economic affliction when an outbreak of disease occurs cases initially escalate rapidly this trajectory can generate considerable alarm which persists until officials demonstrate control as events unfold epidemiologists monitor an r factor which captures the number of people that are likely to be infected by a given carrier to reduce the r factor public health officials use preventative measures like quarantine chinese officials have taken aggressive steps to contain the coronavirus they have closed down entire cities limited travel and closed workplaces while well advised from a medical perspective this strategy has the side effect of initiating an economic r factor with the movement of products and people restricted businesses across the globe are hindered those markets linked most closely to china economically are the ones facing the biggest impairment hong kong which was already in recession in the wake of stress with beijing and the contraction of trade flows now has another significant challenge to deal with south korea and japan import substantial volumes of components from chinese factories and have been forced to slow or stop their own assembly lines japan must also be sweating over how the epidemic might affect the 2020 summer olympics in tokyo which are scheduled to begin in late july even countries further from the epicenter of the outbreak have been affected providers of commodities used in chinese factories have seen orders reduced and prices fall crude oil prices have fallen by about 15 since the start of the year the inability to get parts from china has idled plants in europe and north america global manufacturing which has been struggling amid trade frictions is likely to remain in retreat for a good portion of 2020 actions to contain the virus inhibit economic activity on the demand side chinese consumers have been put into limbo the lunar new year interval usually witnesses the peak of annual spending in many asian countries so the outbreak came at an especially bad time stores selling wares from domestic and western providers have closed due to a lack of traffic chinese tourism which has burgeoned over the past decade with chinese tourists spending an estimated 279 billion annually in other countries has slowed to a crawl business interruption damages a company s finances and the finances of chinese firms had been the subject of concern even before the coronavirus appeared china s corporate sector has taken on a substantial amount of leverage during the past decade a good portion of which is owned by retail investors a prolonged battle with the epidemic could cause a series of defaults and compromise financial stability the interruption in chinese factory production will complicate delivery schedules which have been engineered to very tight tolerances apparel and computer makers are already concerned about supplies for the fall season longer term the vulnerability exposed by the coronavirus may provide another reason for global manufacturers to consider alternate sourcing trade frictions between the united states and china have already prompted a re examination of global supply chains the outbreak could add momentum to this effort analysts trying to anticipate the progression of economic impairment caused by the coronavirus have leveraged past pandemic episodes like the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in 2003 but each pathogen is different as is its potential to interfere with commerce china had only recently entered the world trade organization in 2003 the scale of its economy and its linkages to others through supply chains has mushroomed since then our central expectation is that preventative measures will take the worst case outcomes off the table medical officials are expressing optimism that the virus and its consequences will be contained in this optimistic scenario output would be deferred by the coronavirus but not lost most forecasters have downgraded their estimates of global growth in the first half of the year but have compensated by adding to their projections for the second half we expect the virus to be contained but the outbreak presents substantial downside risk the message from markets on the coronavirus has been mixed equity markets in the u s continued their upward march without much apparent concern but asian stock markets have slumped safe haven currencies and safe investments are in heavy demand the u s dollar has been exceptionally strong and u s interest rates have fallen the american yield curve is flirting with inversion again but we do not see this as a sign that recession is imminent to provide a cushion chinese officials have injected substantial amounts of liquidity into chinese markets and reduced the reserve ratios that banks are required to meet the u s federal reserve has mentioned the coronavirus as a situation it is watching but the threat is not yet severe enough to prompt a u s interest rate cut ironically lowering the epidemiological r factor for the coronavirus increases the economic r factor at least in the short term for now it appears that this is a short term concern that will not create lasting economic damage but if the outbreak escalates the global economy may fall seriously ill easier said than done entrepreneurs and business leaders around the world will tell you that it isn t easy to start and run a business there are forms to file fees to be paid loans to be drawn inventory to purchase but these steps are easier to take in some countries than others the world bank s ease of doing business index is an ambitious effort to compare the experience of running a business across nations this effort has prompted the adoption of business friendly reforms and can help to steer investment decisions compiling the index is no small task requirements and procedures are usually available freely but actual experiences can differ from what is laid out in statute world bank researchers don t merely track policy at arm s length they visit with business owners lawyers and accountants worldwide to see how countries processes work in practice comparisons are made across the following broad categories starting a business the survey rates the effort expense and complexity of establishing a new business among the factors considered are constructing buildings obtaining electric service and registering property in leading countries filing paperwork for a new venture will cost less than 1 of average annual per capita income and can be completed in less than a week meanwhile entrepreneurs in suriname can expect to pay nearly a year s income and wait two months just to file a new business application running a business the survey assesses the challenges businesses face in obtaining credit and conducting import and export transactions as recent trade tensions have reminded us international trade can be quite complex even under supportive regimes the ability to send and receive products and payments across borders is a clear proxy for a country s accommodation for its businesses governance the survey evaluates tax rates the complexity of the tax system protections for investors the legal structures for enforcing contracts and creditors ability to recover losses from an insolvent business the world bank index compiles all of these into a score allowing a ranking of countries nations can make policy changes to improve their standing the less red tape and lower fees required for business activity the more business will get done but that is not to suggest a free for all would be deemed optimal the index rewards countries that require complete financial disclosures and grant recourses for payment to creditors low tax rates alone are not sufficient to get a leading score countries that score well should come as little surprise their reputations precede them as countries with high productivity diverse economies and well functioning governments countries that struggle are conversely burdened by unrest and war 2020 s worst scores came from somalia eritrea venezuela yemen and libya these countries have greater and more immediate problems than paperwork and tax collection the world bank recognizes business friendly reforms the index is most notable for giving developing nations an opportunity to demonstrate improvement several growing economies have had their recent reforms recognized by substantial improvements in their ease of doing business ranking it can be difficult to climb to the top of a list of 180 countries but an improved rating is direct evidence of successful reform increased liberalization in india stands out as an example of effective policy naturally the ease of doing business index has limitations its focuses on experiences in major cities and does not give a full view of each country comparing company structures and fees requires some discretion and under the table facilitation fees often go undisclosed but as a measure of economic potential the index helps us to put national growth in context zero can be a positive number sweden is home to plenty of trendsetters from fashion music technology and décor it is also home to the world s oldest central bank which has also proven itself a trendsetter recently five years ago sweden s riksbank was one of the first central banks to wield negative interest rates in december it was the first to bring those rates back to zero what happens next will be the subject of intense interest from the european central bank ecb among others the latest riksbank interest rate hike was supported by an inflation rate close to its target as well as growing concerns about the implications for the economy from sub zero rates an overheated housing market caused by negative interest rates and a shortage of housing was also on governors minds the removal of negative monetary policy will reduce pressure on the nation s financial sector the riksbank has its critics the swedish economy is slowing in the face of weak domestic and external demand the composite purchasing managers index reached a multi year low and consumer confidence remains weak by historical standards falling commodity prices will soften inflation business sentiment is painting a gloomy picture and with the coronavirus disrupting global supply chains and trade flows the export focused swedish economy could slow further it seems like a bad time to tighten policy but proponents might question whether the riksbank s actions should be viewed as more restrictive negative rates have had adverse side effects including weaker bank profitability and the promotion of excessive risk taking moving back to zero realigns incentives to lend and invest in a manner that should promote more healthy economic growth in sweden s case raising interest rates may be viewed as an easing developments in sweden will be closely watched in frankfurt the headquarters of the ecb where many think negative interest rates have been counterproductive hindering lending and saving as ecb president christine lagarde takes the bank through its current strategic review she may use sweden as a reason to become more positive

by nottingham advisors fourth quarter real gdp in the us grew at a 2 1 annual rate consistent with q3 s pace personal consumption along with federal state and local government spending all contributed to growth during the last quarter while inventories and nonresidential fixed investment were detractors disposable personal income rose 127 billion in q4 down slightly from q3 s 180 billion rise personal saving amounted to 1 29 trillion during the quarter which translates into a 7 7 savings rate as we go to press estimates for q1 gdp are being ratcheted downwards as the world copes with the spreading coronavirus which emanated out of china in mid january the biggest hit so far has been to the chinese economy however the ripple effects of the pandemic are beginning the hit around the globe the price of oil has fallen 16 since the virus was identified early estimates from goldman sachs suggest the outbreak may trim 0 5 from us gdp in the first quarter of 2020 the coronavirus outbreak comes as the global economy was beginning to pick up steam following the recent us china trade dispute détente and signing of the new usmca trade accord it remains to be seen what impact the virtual shutdown of the chinese economy will have on the rest of the world a swift containment of the virus should limit the damage to the world economy however an extended battle to contain the outbreak will prove more damaging to global growth the federal open market committee concluded a 2 day meeting on january 29th and left interest rates unchanged signaling a desire to remain on hold for the balance of 2020 time will tell if the recent virus outbreak will force the fed to consider lowering interest rates to ward off a significant slowdown in the us economy with unemployment and interest rates historically low home building picking up and fiscal spending robust the us remains in an enviable position relative to the rest of the world it s too early to tell if this is the black swan event that derails this 11 year expansion however we would suggest a cautious stance until we get more clarity around probable outcomes domestic equity u s equities finished the month of january in the red as fears over the chinese coronavirus spread globally markets sold off hardest on friday with the s p 500 losing 1 76 as the number of people infected globally increased and the death toll rose furthermore the world health organization who declared the outbreak a global health emergency companies including starbucks mcdonald s and apple have closed stores out of an abundance of caution and have guided forward looking earnings expectations into wider than normal ranges given the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak and its impact on economic activity globally friday s selloff pushed the benchmark s p 500 into negative territory for january with the index down 0 04 small and mid caps fared worse with the s p smallcap 600 and midcap 400 indices falling 3 97 and 2 61 respectively low volatility momentum and growth stocks bucked the trend and finished in positive territory with the s p 500 low volatility momentum and growth indices posting returns of 3 07 2 93 and 2 27 respectively thanks to a robust earnings season from technology stocks which contributed 0 92 to the s p 500 s performance on the month helping keep it flat from a sector standpoint utilities added 6 65 during the month as investors rushed for safety and the 10 year u s treasury finished the month yielding 1 51 down from 1 88 at the start of the year technology stocks were the next best performing sector up 3 95 as strong earnings from microsoft and apple propelled the sector google part of the communication services sector which was up 0 92 joined the two tech behemoths in the 1 trillion market cap club while amazon part of the consumer discretionary sector which was up 0 63 briefly surpassed 1 trillion in market cap after a strong earnings beat but finished the month with a sub trillion dollar market capitalization energy was the worst performing sector shedding 11 07 during the month after oil prices sank and giants such as exxonmobil and chevron announced disappointing results materials and healthcare were also firmly in the red losing 6 17 and 2 72 respectively on the month while financials gave back 2 58 as yields fell international equity international equities sold off in january as fears over the coronavirus spread and overshadowed the united kingdom s official exit from the european union bringing the brexit saga to the next phase of where to next developed international equities as measured by the msci eafe index lost 2 07 while emerging markets as measured by the msci em index lost 4 66 the benchmark shanghai composite index in china was closed for the lunar new year but resumed trading overnight only to fall 7 7 the market s drop comes with a caveat that the index was catching up with the rest of the world many underlying stocks hit their daily down limit of 10 a cap on how far stocks can fall per day furthermore in response to the outbreak and market s reaction the people s bank of china pboc injected 1 2 trillion yuan 173 billion of liquidity into the financial system over the weekend the largest bout of stimulus in more than 15 years the pboc also instructed securities regulators to have brokerage firms suspend securities lending which could be used for short selling while the impact of the virus is unknown and difficult to predict it is likely to have an impact on the chinese economy given that it is more heavily dependent on consumption than it was in the early 2000 s with the outbreak of sars with china and the world facing the threat of slowing economic growth the impact of the virus on consumption earnings supply chains etc that are still inexplicably linked to china is uncertain the impact of the virus on the phase 1 trade deal between the u s and china could be another wild card that is impossible to predict from a sector standpoint utilities were the top performers as investors rushed to safety and yields fell the utilities sector rose 4 89 one of only two sectors healthcare to finish in positive territory on the month energy and materials were the worst performers down 7 32 and 5 40 respectively as oil prices dropped and fears of slower global growth amplified losses while headlines in china may be scary and get worse pullbacks may prove opportunistic for long term investors focused on fundamentals and valuation which look relatively attractive to those in the u s fixed income the recent fed meeting was uneventful as expected the fed funds rate did not change and chairman powell signaled that he did not think any future moves were likely in the near term there was discussion of inflation being lower than the committee would like which can be interpreted as dovish posturing making the next rate move more likely to be a cut than a raise the recent movement in the shape of the yield curve is supportive of a rising likelihood of a fed rate cut there was significant concern during 2019 while the yield of 3 month treasury securities were higher than the yield of 10 year treasury securities resulting in an inverted yield curve which typically precedes a recession the fed took its sweet time but eventually cured the inversion by lowering short term interest rates below those of longer term rates the discussion of recession worries declined significantly well the curve has moved lower and the inversion has reappeared this can be interpreted as the fed being behind the market again if the inversion proves durable and does not resolve itself the fed will likely take the hint and adjust the fed funds rate the complication being that this is an election year powell would prefer higher rates to lower but he is also keen to avoid being the reason our extremely long economic expansion comes to an end the u s government bond index was the top performer for the month this has a couple drivers with interest rates declining duration has continued to be an investor s friend increasing the value of their bond holdings one of the things that has changed in the first month of 2020 is the additional return offered by taking on the credit risk of investment grade and high yield corporate bonds throughout 2019 spreads consistently tightened providing a performance tailwind to these exposures january 2020 has been an about face with spreads widening detracting from the performance offered by these riskier bond allocations even with this widening spreads continue to appear relatively low and could cause investors additional heartburn if there is an economic slowdown associated with the viral outbreak or other end of cycle issues the green bond index offers a yield that is low relative to other options but it does carry a significant amount of duration amongst its holdings that duration has acted as ballast providing strong performance this month and over the last twelve months as rates have decreased alternative investments alternative investments such as gold real estate and the u s dollar proved their worth in january as global equities sold off however commodities and oil prices fell on fears that the coronavirus could slow consumption and future economic growth gold prices rose sharply in january rising 4 74 or

following the tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019 will now struggle to do anything except contract further in the first quarter as the impact of covid 19 weighs on consumer sentiment weighing in particular on the consumer services sector ing said in a report some further government spending may help to curb any further contraction in gdp beyond 1q20 but that will not stop what started off as a technical downturn from evolving into a full blown recession it said thailand and singapore also reported weak growth in the last quarter of 2019 in figures that like japan s do not yet reflect the consequences of the coronavirus outbreak but good news came in the form of fresh help from the people s bank of china which cut its one year medium term lending rate to 3 15 from 3 25 the central bank also injected some 200 billion yuan 28 6 billion and conducted 100 billion yuan 14 3 billion in reverse repos in effect putting more cash into the market through short term purchases of securities such moves will likely be followed by still more said julian evans pritchard given that many of the companies worst affected by the virus outbreak are smaller ones that lack access to loans from major

following the tax hike in the fourth quarter of 2019 will now struggle to do anything except contract further in the first quarter as the impact of covid 19 weighs on consumer sentiment weighing in particular on the consumer services sector ing said in a report some further government spending may help to curb any further contraction in gdp beyond 1q20 but that will not stop what started off as a technical downturn from evolving into a full blown recession it said thailand and singapore also reported weak growth in the last quarter of 2019 in figures that like japan s do not yet reflect the consequences of the coronavirus outbreak but good news came in the form of fresh help from the people s bank of china which cut its one year medium term lending rate to 3 15 from 3 25 the central bank also injected some 200 billion yuan 28 6 billion and conducted 100 billion yuan 14 3 billion in reverse repos in effect putting more cash into the market through short term purchases of securities

the united states markets are closed today to celebrate president s day leaving asia to its own devices for a change although volumes may be somewhat muted because of it while celebrating us presidents and presidential wannabees in the present day and age may be somewhat of an oxymoron for many of us that has left weekend coronavirus developments and asian economic data to dominate the start of the week with coronavirus and its potential downstream effects still grabbing the headlines one glimmer of hope is that new cases in china appear to be occurring at a lower rate that has been overshadowed by the release of japan s tankan index and preliminary q4 gdp which made grim reading the reuters tankan index fell to 5 but q4 preliminary gdp fell 1 60 qoq and a whopping 6 30 yoy as japanese consumers stayed home after the october sales tax hike with the data no even encompassing the inevitable coronavirus slowdown to start the new year it suggests the more stimulus is on the way sooner rather than later in japan singapore grabbed the headlines over the weekend and this morning with singapore s prime minister suggesting that the coronavirus impact on the city state was already deeper than the sars one in the early 2000 s that said singapore s gdp growth rate for q4 outperformed both on a qoq basis and yoy basis qoq gdp rose 0 60 versus 0 10 expected and yoy gbp rose 1 0 versus 0 80 expected meanwhile its balance of trade posted a gain of sgd 1 58 billion the data while positive wouldn t have set the world on fire and does not off course encompass the economic one two punch coming from coronavirus in january and february singapore s already hotly anticipated 2020 budget to be released this week will now ratchet up a level financial markets are now expecting some serious deficit spending from the government to offset the coronavirus slowdown the wonderful thing about singapore that about 99 0 of governments around the world should take note of is that they run strong budget surpluses during the good times in order to have room to spend during the bad times expect some strong measures to support sme s and employment to help companies whether the slowdown a lot of bad news of priced into singapore with the mas almost certain to ease in april it is early days but progress on the coronavirus front could make singapore one of the value trades of the year in 2020 for the brave as singapore s fiscal and monetary engines start pumping thailand releases q4 and annual gdp at 1030 sgt this morning it will be closely watched for signs of the effects of the strong baht on growth with q4 gdp expected to grow only 0 40 given the massive hit that thailand has taken on its critical tourism industry in january from the stay away chinese investors will have itchy trigger fingers should the gdp print on the low side indonesia releases its january balance of trade at 1200 sgt with the trade balance expected to be flat led by a drop in imports the bank of indonesia meets this week and will almost certainly trim rates again by 0 25 as it tries to break indonesia growth through its 5 0 glass ceiling the boi will also be mindful that its resource dependant export sector is going to face challenging times due to the china coronavirus slowdown it will be interesting times for indonesia in the months ahead as it deals with a slowdown in china and more importantly attempts to pass an omnibus bill through parliament to enact sweeping reforms in indonesia s labour market indonesia s employee protections are something of a sacred cow here and investors should not underestimate both their challenge and potential impact if they are passed that s still a big if though but if president jokowi thinks jakarta can host the 2032 olympics whom am i

though the data is somewhat irrelevant coming ahead of both the lunar new year and the coronavirus outbreak the february data for china that arrives in early march will give the world a much truer

the united states markets are closed today to celebrate president s day leaving asia to its own devices for a change although volumes may be somewhat muted because of it while celebrating us presidents and presidential wannabees in the present day and age may be somewhat of an oxymoron for many of us that has left weekend coronavirus developments and asian economic data to dominate the start of the week with coronavirus and its potential downstream effects still grabbing the headlines one glimmer of hope is that new cases in china appear to be occurring at a lower rate that has been overshadowed by the release of japan s tankan index and preliminary q4 gdp which made grim reading the reuters tankan index fell to 5 but q4 preliminary gdp fell 1 60 qoq and a whopping 6 30 yoy as japanese consumers stayed home after the october sales tax hike with the data no even encompassing the inevitable coronavirus slowdown to start the new year it suggests the more stimulus is on the way sooner rather than later in japan singapore grabbed the headlines over the weekend and this morning with singapore s prime minister suggesting that the coronavirus impact on the city state was already deeper than the sars one in the early 2000 s that said singapore s gdp growth rate for q4 outperformed both on a qoq basis and yoy basis qoq gdp rose 0 60 versus 0 10 expected and yoy gbp rose 1 0 versus 0 80 expected meanwhile its balance of trade posted a gain of sgd 1 58 billion the data while positive wouldn t have set the world on fire and does not off course encompass the economic one two punch coming from coronavirus in january and february singapore s already hotly anticipated 2020 budget to be released this week will now ratchet up a level financial markets are now expecting some serious deficit spending from the government to offset the coronavirus slowdown the wonderful thing about singapore that about 99 0 of governments around the world should take note of is that they run strong budget surpluses during the good times in order to have room to spend during the bad times expect some strong measures to support sme s and employment to help companies whether the slowdown a lot of bad news of priced into singapore with the mas almost certain to ease in april it is early days but progress on the coronavirus front could make singapore one of the value trades of the year in 2020 for the brave as singapore s fiscal and monetary engines start pumping thailand releases q4 and annual gdp at 1030 sgt this morning it will be closely watched for signs of the effects of the strong baht on growth with q4 gdp expected to grow only 0 40 given the massive hit that thailand has taken on its critical tourism industry in january from the stay away chinese investors will have itchy trigger fingers should the gdp print on the low side indonesia releases its january balance of trade at 1200 sgt with the trade balance expected to be flat led by a drop in imports the bank of indonesia meets this week and will almost certainly trim rates again by 0 25 as it tries to break indonesia growth through its 5 0 glass ceiling the boi will also be mindful that its resource dependant export sector is going to face challenging times due to the china coronavirus slowdown it will be interesting times for indonesia in the months ahead as it deals with a slowdown in china and more importantly attempts to pass an omnibus bill through parliament to enact sweeping reforms in indonesia s labour market indonesia s employee protections are something of a sacred cow here and investors should not underestimate both their challenge and potential impact if they are passed that s still a big if though but if president jokowi thinks jakarta can host the 2032 olympics whom am i to dampen the optimism japan releases industrial production for december at 1230 sgt with markets expecting a fall of 1 0 china releases fdi at 1500 sgt and january new loans at 1700 sgt realistically though the data is somewhat irrelevant coming ahead of both the lunar new year and the coronavirus outbreak the february data for china that arrives in early march will give the world a much truer picture of the state of play on the mainland although official data and truer in china may be considered an oxymoron in the same light as celebrating us presidents by many equities wall street limped

eased by 0 10 us markets are closed for president s day although i am sure donald trump s twitter account is not an apparent slowdown in the rate of new coronavirus cases in china has given asia cause

weekend to gain 0 75 south korea s kospi has risen 0 25 with kuala lumpur and jakarta both flat the singapore straits times is also unchanged after falling initially as the coronavirus fears gripping the city state s economic outlook are somewhat mollified by an impending budget this week full of stimulus goodies japan s nikkei 225 plunged after the poor gdp numbers but has since recovered to be only 0 55 down as mainland exchanges lift the gloom glimmers of progress in china s coronavirus fight will likely keep sentiment cautiously positive today that should flow into european markets germany s dax with its high beta to china growth is likely to be a notable beneficiary in the short term currencies the us dollar retreated on friday notably against the euro which rose to 1 0830 as investors lightened positioning ahead of the long weekend notably the week was a good one for china recovery currencies the australian dollar rose 0 45 for the week to 0 6725 and the new zealand dollar following a stay put reserve bank rose 0 85 on the week to 0 6440 the usd cnh continues to flip flop each side of 7 0000 in a broad 6 9500 to 7 0300 range depending on the day s coronavirus sentiment unless the us dollar strengthens markedly against its g 10 compatriots the pboc is unlikely to allow either the onshore or offshore yuan to weaken much past the 7 0300 region with the white house as belligerent as ever coronavirus or not petro currencies enjoyed a strong finish to the week powered by the fool s gold as opposed to black gold rally in oil prices the russian rouble gained 0 95 to 63 42 00 and the norwegian kroner strengthened 0 55 against the dollar to 9 2400 in both cases further gains are entirely dependent on the rally in oil continuing with the us on holiday volatility and volumes are low in asia currency markets today for the most part both major and regional asian currencies are unchanged from friday europe s arrival should see more dollar selling as bets are placed misguided or not that there is light at the end of the coronavirus tunnel oil whether last week s oil rally is black gold or fool s gold remains to be seen the author is strongly backing the latter nevertheless coronavirus optimism and fast money chasing its tail saw both brent crude and wti carve another day of gains out on friday brent crude rose 1 75 to 57 35 a barrel and wti rose 1 30 to 52 10 a barrel oil in unchanged in asia with volumes expected to be light due to the us holiday oil remains acutely vulnerable to both excess supply and the economic coronavirus induced slowdown in china and other parts of asia i will not stand in front of the assembled might of epidemiologists that populate the equity and energy markets i do note though that the rally of last week is built on concrete with a lot of sand in it it s ability to withstand even a minor shaking of the ground therefore is very marginal gold gold prices rose on friday as investors loaded up on risk hedges ahead of a long weekend in the united states gold rose 0 40 to 1582 00 an ounce some unwinding of those hedges is evident in asia with coronavirus optimism seeing gold pull back slightly to 1581 50 an ounce this morning gold will continue to bounce around on the see sawing coronavirus sentiment of the day but remains locked solidly in the middle of its longer term 1550 00 an

here s our summary of key economic events overnight that affect new zealand with news 2020 is shaping up to be a very weak year for world trade firstly however we should note that today is a public holiday in the us with the nyse closed and very limited trading in commodities markets there but overnight european markets rose about 0 3 across all of them and yesterday shanghai was up a very strong 2 3 followed by hong kong which was up 0 5 tokyo however fell down 0 7 on weaker than expected gdp data in china foreign direct investment in the final quarter of 2019 was 4 0 higher than for the same period a year earlier this was a somewhat better result than many were expecting and it is unlikely to be repeated in the first quarter of 2020 the flow of investment into china has been pretty steady since the end of 2017 despite the americans and their tariff war overnight the chinese central bank let its official interest rate ease by 10 bps to 3 15 with a relatively small liquidity injection liquidity in the chinese financial systems doesn t seem to be an issue at present but that may not last china s overall leverage ratio which measures outstanding debt in the real economy against nominal gdp increased to 245 at the end of 2019 up from 243 in 2018 very high leverage carries with it very high risks during financial stress a new survey shows that almost 70 of companies can survive a cashflow crunch of three months and about 45 can sustain it for more than half a year but by the same token that means that 30 can t survive a 90 day economic crisis today s updates for covid 19 sees the tally of official infection up over 71 900 and 1775 deaths a week ago these levels were at 40 500 and 910 respectively china s economic growth will obviously take a heavy hit in 2020 and current estimates are that it could fall to 4 5 pa those estimates may prove optimistic japan s economy suffered its biggest contraction in five years in the final quarter of 2019 slowed by a combination of their sales tax hike and a destructive typhoon japanese gdp ended 2019 0 4 lower than in the same quarter in 2018 but for all of 2019 they ended up 0 7 above 2018 the annualised rate of fall on q4 was however a startling 6 3 from q3 you may recall this was also the time of the rugby world cup an event that had almost zero impact on their economy perhaps this year s olympics in july and august later this year will be more influential japan s december industrial production surprised the other way rising at an annual rate of 1 2 from november and clawing back some of the 3 year on year decline of course this progress will be undone in february in singapore they reported that their economy grew at less than 1 in 2019 and they see that slowing further in 2020 so it is hardly surprising that given all this news the wto sees 2020 as a poor one for world trade in australia new official research finds that lower interest rates increase housing wealth inequality while higher rates do the opposite and they find that investor activity accentuates the inequality effect of low rates the ust 10yr yield is still just on 1 59 their 2 10 curve is less positive at 16 bps and their 1 5 curve is still negative at 7 bps and their 3m 10yr curve still negative at 1 bp the aussie govt 10yr is unchanged at 1 06 the china govt 10yr now at 2 92 and up 3 bps the nz govt 10 yr will start today at 1 36 and down 2 bps gold is down us 3 to us 1 581 oz in very limited trading in new york today us oil prices are at just over us 52 bbl the brent benchmark is lower just under us 57 50 bbl the kiwi dollar will start today unchanged at just over 64 4 usc on the cross rates we have held at 95 9 auc against the euro we also unchanged at 59 4 euro cents that means our twi 5 is now at 70 3 bitcoin has stayed down at us 9 718 after the sharp fall yesterday the bitcoin rate is charted in the exchange rate set below the easiest place to stay up with event risk today is by following our economic calendar here our exchange rate chart is here

how investors should take into consideration looming federal deficits the relationship between federal budget deficits and the financial markets may be changing in the short run both the stock and bond markets seem to have very little concern about federal budget deficits now however that may not be the case in the future thus longer term investors may want to keep an eye on deficits when allocating funds in business cycle terms even though the expansion is at a record length current conditions do not favor any tightening by the federal reserve this is supporting the fixed income markets unemployment is very low although there is some question about the data real gdp growth is running about 2 this is supportive of the equity markets a possible cause for this is that two opposing forces are contributing to the current economic conditions first is the harm to the world economy by the u s tariffs these are making almost everyone in the world poorer on balance some countries and some people are impacted more than others in america the weakness caused by trade restrictions that disrupt supply chains and raise consumer prices above what free markets would produce are offset by the stimulus provided by the trillion dollar federal budget deficits and relatively low interest rates the recent budget agreement that prevented a federal government shutdown assures that the deficits will exceed the trillion dollar level in the foreseeable future the trillion dollar federal budget deficits could be characterized as boosting private sector income and wealth today possibly at the expense of future generations additionally the rollback of environmental regulations could also be characterized as boosting private sector income and wealth today also possibly at the expense of future generations the negative impacts on efficiency and productivity from tariffs and the positive impacts of both fiscal stimulus from the trillion dollar deficits and rollback of environmental regulations impact different segments of the population differently more important is the fact that different segments of the population are very different in their ability to offset the negative impacts on efficiency and productivity from tariffs this is especially true in the current low interest rate environment the segments of the population whose wealth and income are primarily derived from labor are mostly unable to offset the negative impacts on efficiency and productivity from tariffs they generally must pay the higher prices that tariffs cause for all products made from steel and aluminum and many items that come from china such as bicycles and christmas tree ornaments furthermore the reductions in productivity and efficiency caused by trade restrictions that disrupt supply chains and raise input prices reduce the ability of most workers to obtain higher wages from their private sector employers for those segments of the population whose wealth and income are primarily derived from investments it is much easier to offset the reductions in productivity and efficiency caused by trade restrictions that disrupt supply chains and raise consumer and input prices for many investors the low interest rates caused in many cases worldwide by actions of central banks in response to the reductions in economic activity productivity and efficiency caused by trade restrictions boost the value of their fixed income securities lower interest rates also lift equity prices the federal deficits and debt levels are growing in the foreseeable future the congressional budget office cbo released its latest ten year budget outlook in late january taking into account current spending and tax legislation this captures provisions in the bipartisan budget act of 2019 which was signed into law by the president last august the legislation increases the automatic budget caps that were set to take effect for fiscal 2020 and 2021 and it increases the debt ceiling tables i and ia attached sketch key macro assumptions that underlay the cbo ten year budget outlook that it made last year and now this year on balance the key macro drivers would infer a lower deficit path because cbo revised up its growth forecast and lowered its assessment of unemployment and interest rates but the result is different tables ii and iia show major components of the budget and tables iii and iiia show the deficit and debt paths that resulted from tables ii and iia you will note that while economic growth is stronger and unemployment is lower revenue is now estimated to be lower than cbo forecast for this period one year ago the revenue generating power of tax cuts is apparently falling short of estimates the spending side of the ledger is where things really get egregious the bipartisan budget act of 2019 allows discretionary spending to exceed the budget caps by 312 billion in the 2020 24 period military spending is 164 billion higher and nondefense discretionary spending is 148 billion higher so whereas in 2019 cbo forecast that both defense and nondefense discretionary spending would decline in the 2020 2024 period they both increase extending this to the out years cbo now has the deficit reaching 1 74 trillion by 2030 with the debt held by the public increasing every year from 79 2 of gdp in 2019 to 98 3 of gdp in 2030 in last year s forecast the deficit was shown to have peaked at 1 43 trillion in 2028 with the debt to gdp ratio topping out around 92 to 94 these deficit and debt levels appear scary especially when one considers that all this fiscal stimulus and concomitant monetary stimulus is delivering a little over 2 economic growth additionally one should be aware that these numbers significantly underestimate what realistic projections might indicate this is because cbo must rely on current law assumptions but current law calls for expiration of the personal tax cut in 2025 while business tax cuts are permanent there does not appear to be any opposition to extending the personal tax cut except perhaps for the uppermost brackets see congressional budget office versus office of management and budget there is also the issue of mandatory programs that will very likely continue beyond current expiration dates in the cbo current law baseline for example the supplemental nutrition assistance program is set to expire in 2024 under current law but hardly anyone thinks this is about to be shelved there is also the cbo assumption that postponed healthcare related taxes will be reinstated even though the postponement will very likely become permanent finally there were approximately 30 tax provisions that expired in 2017 that were extended by legislation in 2018 and this is likely to be a continuum let us not forget that the house of representatives voted 419 to 6 to repeal the tax on high cost health insurance plans that was a key part of obamacare the overwhelming vote allowed the house to bypass rules that would require the cost to be offset by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere new theories relating to monetary policy are emerging investors should also keep an eye on new developments in monetary theory that could bring about interest rate environments previously not considered possible the trillions of dollars worth of bonds now trading with negative interest rates are an example modern monetary theory mmt calls for essentially unlimited spending to be financed by the federal reserve so long as there is no inflation see modern monetary theory and 20 dividend yields on reml morl and mrrl once the inflation appears it presumes the fed would then tighten policy and congress would legislate tax increases most significant for the financial markets modern monetary theory implies that risk free interest rates would be zero possibly even long term government bond rates twelve years ago most market participants would have scoffed at the possibility that interest rates could be zero for any extended period of time they considered the possibility of years of negative interest rates persisting for years as absurd many of those who now scoff at modern monetary theory would not have believed that many developed countries would have negative interest rates for any extended period of time before it actually happened japan and many european countries still have negative or close to zero interest rates this alone gives some support to modern monetary theory in the usa after 2009 as unemployment declined while budget deficits remained large and grew many demanded that the federal reserve raise interest rates some forecast dire outlooks for both inflation and long term interest rates as they perceived the federal reserve as being behind the curve by not raising rates fast enough those critics of the federal reserve whose interest rate forecasts now seem to have been wrong mostly were relying on conventional economics in terms of what were likely to be the impacts of the monetary and fiscal policies that were and are still in effect that leads to the question of why the dire inflation and bond market consequences did not occur conventional wisdom suggests that governments can only control short term interest rates but not long term rates furthermore most think that artificially depressing short term rates by a central bank eventually increases long term rates the extended existence of negative 10 year government bond rates in europe could put that conventional wisdom in doubt if long and short term government interest rates in america were at the close to zero or negative levels of those in germany and other european countries the prices of existing securities issued by the federal government and us government agencies and instrumentalities would soar time will tell if the current ideal conditions for the financial markets that combines low inflation low interest rates and low unemployment can persist as the levels of federal debt and deficits soar this is the key question for investors in the past the primary variables that interest rate forecasters focused on were the federal budget deficit inflation unemployment and monetary aggregates today the only attention most interest rate forecasters pay to those variables is to remark about how little they seem to matter now this had led some to utter the dangerous phrase this time is different the key to predicting the path of interest rates and thus the prospects for bonds and stocks is to answer the question is this time really different previously a major risk involving interest rates has been that which occurs when the federal reserve acts to punish what it perceives as bad government policy by raising rates from the late 1970s until arguably 2007 the federal reserve at times used monetary policy to dissuade politicians from what the federal reserve considers profligate fiscal policy the term bond market vigilantes referred to financial market participants who voted with their money against the inflationary impacts of government deficits by selling treasury securities however it was the federal reserve that took on the major role of punishing politicians when it considered fiscal policy too inflationary as it appears that the federal reserve does not seem inclined to take on the job of disciplining fiscal policies any time soon investors might want to enjoy the ideal conditions as long as they last but keep an eye on any hint that such indifference to deficits on the part of most market participants including the federal reserve may be ending comparisons on cbo forecasts january 2020 vs january 2019 click to enlarge table i macro table ia macro real gdp gdp price index unemployment rate 10 year treasury

investors buoyed by apparent deceleration it s been an eventful start to the year and not exactly in the way than anyone would have anticipated even two months ago once again once the initial panic has passed investors have taken the spread of covid 19 in their stride a little too much you could argue the initial panic was that it could be as bad as sars and yet it s been worse and it turns out investors aren t that worried after all the stock market can be a very strange place at times next week is typically among the quieter of the month which means news around the coronavirus will continue to dominate pmis later in the week will also be of interest as will minutes from the fed ecb and rba country uk this should have been a pretty normal week in the uk compared to what we ve become accustomed to but it didn t quite go according to plan the cabinet reshuffle was largely as boring as is to be expected until chancellor sajid javid resigned in a different time a different country perhaps that may be seen as bad news but investors in the uk were buoyed while there appears to be a number of reasons behind the resignation including demands by boris johnson that no self respecting minister would accept investors are considering what it means for the budget it s clear that at the very least the government will look to push the boundaries of their fiscal rules but perhaps this indicates something more so the market reaction suggests anyway us will wall street start pricing in the risk of a democratic president right now the answer seems to be no the democrats are in the very early stages of the primary season and right now bernie sanders and pete buttigieg are gaining momentum the focus shifts to the february 22nd nevada caucuses and the february 29th south carolina primary with super tuesday on march 3rd being the main event financial markets may start to get nervous if democrats start feeling the bern but if biden buttigieg or bloomberg get the nomination we may see optimism for a much higher stock market remain roughly in place china coronavirus and its global spread is still the hot topic thursday s review of the data methodology caused a mild downturn in risk appetite as case numbers spiked dramatically central bankers appear to be viewing the virus effect as a mere speed bump for local economies with the rbnz basing its current monetary policy outlook on the assumption it would last six weeks while the fed is still on track to remain on hold throughout this year after the so called good new up to wednesday was decimated by thursday s revision investors will require either a slowdown in the increase in the number of confirmed cases or a total decline to continue the relentless pursuit of returns via equities it has been pointed out by a colleague that it could be a win win outlook for equities going forward if the virus accelerates central banks will ease policy thus supporting equities while if the virus vanishes the global economy can get back on track which would again be supportive of equities a lack of good news on the spread and death toll from the wuhan virus this week and next would take the edge off risk appetite capping the equity rally and forcing flows into the usual safe havens of gold the yen swiss franc the us dollar and us treasuries it would again be negative for oil and industrial metals hong kong nothing to report from hong kong this week still only 50 virus cases reported to thursday but the second country in the league table behind china hong kong data is still dismal and tuesday s release of january s unemployment rate has probably got more upside potential than down the hong kong dollar is holding up well despite the coronavirus effect and a firmer us dollar usd hkd is trading close to the lower limit of its trading band and it s possible that any escalation in the coronavirus outbreak could push usd hkd back to the upper half of the trading band and pressure the hongkong33 index india india economic data continues to disappoint with industrial output dropping 0 3 in december india still has only three coronavirus cases should the rbi be forced into further easing it could pressure the rupee australia tuesday s release of rba minutes is unlikely to be a headline grabber while thursday s employment report for january will be the main event headline numbers have been bullish of late but most jobs added are only in the part time category another strong number with a full time bias and markets will consider a hawkish shift from the rba mean reversion to a lower jobs number would hurt the aussie new zealand a hawkish feel to the rbnz s unchanged rate announcement sent the kiwi soaring this week an extended virus period chinese are currently barred from entering nz would hurt the tourism sector and pressure the kiwi japan the week kicks off with q4 gdp data which is seen weaker overall according to the latest surveys the cruise ship quarantined off japan is getting more headlines than the economy boj or government a bigger than expected drop in gdp would hurt equities but could benefit the yen on safe haven flows singapore singapore s close links with china have brought the city state to the forefront of coronavirus news with 50 reported cases third behind hong kong the mas has already said there is room within the neer trading band to ease policy and we may see an inter meeting adjustment given the next policy meeting is not scheduled until april the singapore dollar weakened to the lowest level since september versus the us dollar this week policy easing amid rising virus cases would pressure the sgd further market usd the us economy will likely remain in a good place but we could start to see markets become nervous on a few fronts on friday february 21st the flash manufacturing pmi releases will show how much of a slowdown is hitting the us economy in february incremental updates with the us china trade war seemed destined for a sudden turn for the worse but so far all signs are pointing that may not be the case the third concern to the outlook is fed tightening the fed has started announcing cuts to the size of the overnight repo operations and as the balance sheet growth grinds to a halt sentiment for risky assets may take a blow oil the oil recovery is gathering momentum as the week draws to a close naturally any bounce was likely to be decent given the scale of the declines that preceded it but we re now on the fourth day of gains as optimism grows among traders that the fight against covid 19 has turned a corner despite the setback of the midweek spike the next test for brent comes around 58 with wti facing a similar test in the 53 50 54 50 region gold undeterred by its other failures already this year gold is creeping higher and approaching the heavily guarded 1 600 barrier the events in the middle east last month saw gold briefly break through the defence but this was short lived and it hasn t really come close since back at 1 580 now with the next test being where it fell at the last attempt earlier this month around 1 590 if it can get through here then perhaps the bullish case will grow bitcoin bitcoin has found its way above 10 000 and is holding above at the moment but that may not last it s been on an impressive run this year up around 45 already but as ever with this instrument it has the feel of buy now work out why later the list of reasons for the rally so far is endless from safe haven to halving and everything in between the only word that hasn t been used is hype and that s probably the most accurate explanation which is fine should it break above 11 000 interest may pick up 10 000 attracts a lot of attention for obvious reasons but 9 000 and 11 000 have arguably been more significant

in his state of the union address earlier this month president trump celebrated the putative success of the economy he claims to have built doing so in historic terms i am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been he boasted and yet at the same time budget deficits and the national debt continue to surge revealing that trump s policies are not designed to fuel an economy for the long haul but rather that currently the u s economy is running on a sugar high showing the potential to crash at any moment while the stock market is performing at record levels the national debt has also surged to record levels surpassing 23 trillion for the first time in history and promising only to bloat more over the first four months of 2020 fiscal year the deficit is outpacing last s year deficit expansion by 25 in the same time frame over the past 12 months the deficit has expanded 1 1 trillion bess levin writing for vanity fair gives perspective to the horror of trump s sugar high economy when she writes incredibly this is all happening against the backdrop of the longest economic expansion on record and the lowest jobless rate in 50 years conditions that typically cause the budget deficit to shrink to get more stories like this subscribe to our newsletter the daily trump promised of course that the enormously generous tax cuts he bestowed on corporate america and the wealthiest americans would spur a growth that would cover the cost of tax cuts and more spreading prosperity to all americans of course let s not forget he campaigned on the promise he would in fact eliminate the debt entirely which at the time stood at approximately 19 trillion yet while the gdp grew 2 9 in 2018 growth slowed to 2 3 in 2019 as the debt and deficit swelled to historic proportions days after trump s state of the union peacocking vice president mike pence defended trump s deficit expansion in an interview with cnbc here are a few of his responses which not only recycle the stale because failed narratives of trickle down economics and of tax cuts paying for themselves but also grossly distort history falsely claimly trump inherited an economy in decay as opposed to one of the most steadily expanding economies in history the obama administration engineered pence prevaricated as follows the president came into office and he said first and foremost we have to restore growth deficits and debt are right in line but it is first about getting this economy moving again and we really do believe the trajectory of this economy once we get this economy rolling we re going to work real hard not just to get president donald trump four more years in the white house but we re going to make sure we have a republican senate and a republican house to keep america growing and to deal with those long term fiscal challenges the big lie here of course is pence s insistence that obama did not have the economy rolling that trump needed to get it moving again politifact reported for example having looked at the economic measures trump invokes that the trend lines continued almost seamlessly from the second half of obama s presidency into the first three years of trump s tenure trump s claim that he turned around a failing economy is wrong obama ran deficits and increased the debt doing the arduous work of pulling the nation s economy out of a deep recession trump has been over stimulating an economy that was already healthy throwing money at the wealthiest while failing to invest in real growth for america deceiving americans it will trickle down of course the world bank rejected the efficacy of trickle down economics back in 2015 debunking it as a myth the international monetary fund actually lambasted it as a joke pence s insistence on recycling this failed myth is basically an admission of trump s fraudulent mismanagement of the u s economy to the detriment of american lives pence asserted that trump sees the real long term solution to the fiscal challenges in washington d c is making sure the budget of every american is growing and yet poverty and homelessness are in fact what is growing in america while trump seeks to make healthcare less accessible and affordable for the american majority and let s not forget how growing deficits impact americans economic well being the ballooning deficit resulting from the trump tax cuts for example cultivated a fertile context for paul ryan and mitch mcconnell to loudly renew their insistence that cuts to medicare and social security are necessary to address the out of control deficit their own policies immediately exacerbated far from benefiting americans these tax cuts which were supposedly to trickle down just keep cutting americans and increasing economic precarity not prosperity trump himself recently confirmed while attending the world economic forum in davos switzerland that he intended to cut social security medicare and medicaid and while we need to support farmers for our national and individual well being the reason taxpayers are contributing 28 billion to bail them out is precisely because of trump s failing trade war with china and the tariffs he has levied again this is 28 billion dollars effectively taken out of americans pockets for which they receive nothing in the return in fact they will lose more as these payouts lead to cuts elsewhere as well as rising deficits and keep in mind that as economist larry summers has pointed out the real investments that would spur economic growth would be to re build and update the nation s infrastructure but this infrastructure is largely public domain corporations won t rebuild our bridges and roads update our power grids lay new rail for faster trains etc they expect the government to do that with taxpayer money but oops corporations just aren t expected to pay a fair share in taxes and our tax money is being thrown at them while they engage in massive layoffs doing little in return to invest in american lives pence knows this of course he is admitting the failure of trump s economy

letter recently i shared a story about a young malaysian who came from a poor background did well in his spm obtained a state scholarship to study economics at a prestigious uk university only to struggle to find the right job here in malaysia upon graduation he decided to pursue a masters at a local university whilst waiting for the right offer only after completion of his masters did he finally land a job as a contract analyst for a financial firm his starting salary rm 1 800 little did i expect the response to this tale from fellow malaysians as it was shared in the thousands on social media and got hundreds of reactions many shared their own stories of highly qualified graduates struggling to find jobs and of low starting salary there are also those who reminisce how they started with low pay but are now doing well and that youths today are a bunch of whiners the usual doom and gloom versus we had a tougher time dichotomy that pervades today s hyper reactionary social media debate but beyond the rhetoric and anecdotes what s the economic reality for malaysian youths for that we will look at three areas of concern wages for entry level positions job creation for youths and finally cost of living stagnant wages are not a myth there are plenty of anecdotal stories of how starting salaries for graduates have been the same since the mid 2000s and the statistics lend credence to this narrative according to bank negara s economic development in 2018 report starting salaries after adjustment for inflation has declined for those with tertiary education between the period of 2010 to 2018 a fresh graduate with a diploma earned a real salary of only rm1 376 in 2018 2010 rm1 458 while a masters degree holder earned a real salary of rm2 707 a significant decline from rm2 923 in 2010 interestingly the reverse is true for those without tertiary education school leavers with only pmr spm stpm or certificate level qualifications have seen their starting salaries rise between 1 1 percent to 4 6 percent in fact it appears that there is an inverse relationship between qualification and growth in starting wages with the least qualified pmr level experiencing the highest growth rate and the most qualified masters degree experiencing the highest decline we often hear people citing the huge pay packages for mid and senior level management in particular ceos and directors of malaysian companies including government linked institutions as contrary evidence of stagnating wage growth for example in 2005 the executive director of a government linked telco giant was paid close to rm 1 million in salaries and bonuses by the end of 2016 the same role has seen total pay out worth rm 5 8 million with salary increasing to rm 2 3 million for the year despite absolute revenue before even adjusting for inflation being higher in 2005 whilst this wage growth for top executives is in line with global trends and by itself should not be a cause of concern the problem lies in the unequal distribution in growth especially for fresh graduates and those in non executive roles according to world bank s 2019 malaysia economic monitor report which looks at data from 2004 to 2016 the median monthly income for those between 20 to 29 years old with post secondary education has remained flat at between rm 2 000 rm 2 500 meanwhile those between 40 49 and 50 59 years old range experience the biggest growth in median wages moving from around rm 5 000 to more than rm 6 000 within the same 12 years this supports the earlier narrative that wage growth has been stagnant for the youths throughout the years despite malaysia experiencing an average of 7 0 percent gdp growth annually young malaysians especially graduates are suffering from a decline in starting salaries whilst their wage growth has been stagnant since the mid 2000s there are many factors to this but i would like to focus on what i feel is the biggest contributor the state of malaysia s job market focus on underemployment not unemployment we often hear of youth unemployment with many news reports citing the 2018 s 10 9 percent youth unemployment rate in malaysia as being a major cause of concern this is alarmist in isolation especially when reporters use phrases like youth unemployment is three times higher than the national unemployment rate the facts are simple our labour participation rate is growing we are technically fully employed by oecd s the organisation for economic co operation and development definition the 10 9 percent youth unemployment rate is below the global average and comparable to other growing economies without context this figure is meaningless for example the youth unemployment rate for rwanda is 1 64 percent and for australia it is 12 9 percent but do we prefer rwanda s state of economy or australia s japan has a low youth unemployment rate at around 5 percent but they are also an ageing nation sweden s youth unemployment rate 17 4 percent context is everything our youths are facing a more serious problem underemployment underemployment is where youths are employed in roles where they are not working full time or having regular jobs such as freelancing or where they are overqualified for the role you have heard of engineering graduates working as food delivery riders or health sciences graduates working as clerical staff sure a job is a job and beggars can t be choosers but do we have to accept that our youths have to beg for a job in the first place let s look at the numbers according to bank negara between 2010 and 2017 the number of tertiary graduates entering the workforce surpassed the number of jobs created for them in its annual report published in 2019 it said that on average 173 457 diploma and degree graduates entered the workforce annually over that period but only 98 514 high skilled jobs were created over that time between 2002 2010 8 0 percent of the net change in new jobs created are for low skilled work but between 2011 2019 this figure has risen to 16 percent a 100 percent increase in short this economy has created more low skilled work than high skilled work since the financial crisis of 2008 09 whilst the number of graduates continues to remain constant this has resulted in graduates unable to be employed appropriate to their skill or qualification level as of 2016 667 000 graduates are working in low or medium skilled jobs this is 20 7 percent out of the total 3 million plus graduates participating in the labour market the highest level since 2001 when there aren t enough high skilled jobs created skilled workers including fresh graduates will take on any job thus putting downward pressure on wages as medium and low skilled jobs pay on average less than high skilled ones not only that they limit the opportunities for those without qualifications as roles fit for high school leavers are now being filled with college graduates data shows that teenagers ages 15 19 have far higher unemployment rates than young adults 20 24 even though they all contribute to the youth unemployment numbers teenagers are 1 7 times and almost five times more likely to be unemployed compared to young adults and the overall labour workforce respectively the reality concerning expenses overall malaysia s labour market has created insufficient medium and high skilled jobs for the number of graduates which has resulted in stagnating wages especially for the youths and those occupying lower income jobs surely this is unsustainable what with our rising cost of living but herein lies a more nuanced truth that whilst rising cost of living has been bandied about by leaders politicians and news outlets the reality is that malaysia s core and headline inflation has been fairly stable over the years in fact studies have shown that there is a huge gap between the perceived inflation rate and the actual inflation rate this is not helped by the fear mongering in public discussions but at the same time this does not mean that malaysians are earning enough in 2018 bank negara presented a paper putting forth the idea of a living wage in kuala lumpur based on their assumption a single adult needs to earn rm 2 700 per month to be able to have meaningful participation in kuala lumpur according to the same report starting salaries for those with degrees are on average only rm 2 207 a big component of living expenses is on accommodation everyone agrees and khazanah research supports this that housing prices in malaysia especially in major cities are at a severely unaffordable level what is more worrying and related to wage stagnation is the prospect of intergenerational social mobility for the current generation intergenerational social mobility means the ability of the present generation to live a better life measured by income and education attainment compared to the previous generation based on khazanah research institute s 2019 paper on this matter those who were born to lower income parents experienced upward mobility in education and income whilst those who were born to higher income parents did not experience the same if this trend continues the generation born in the 2000s will find it harder to earn more and live a better life than their parents it s all about jobs jobs and more jobs discussion on youth unemployment stagnating wages and related often veer towards solutions focusing on improving the youths themselves skills mismatch tvet technical and vocational education and training increasing higher order thinking skills revamping education system these are all focusing on improving the supply side of the labour market whilst there are merits to these ideas the simple fact remains that our economy has not created enough jobs in the right sector at the right pay in the past 12 years that could absorb the number of supply coming through no matter how much improvement we make to their quality the reason why policy discussions often veer to the supply side is that it is relatively easier to correct the youths as opposed to solving the harder problem of job creation i put forward that we focus on ideas to create more jobs for malaysians increase the growth of high skilled jobs increase the income level for these jobs we could start by revisiting our policies on foreign labour according to bank negara s 2018 report in 2015 and 2016 a large share of net jobs created went to foreigners our documented migrant to population ratio at 8 percent is also higher than other regional peers with the exception of small states like singapore and brunei this loose policy on cheap foreign labour has resulted in the reliance on manpower over automation which reduces overall productivity per worker and prevents the introduction of higher paying jobs especially for our graduates from stem science technology engineering and mathematics fields related to this but more controversial is the proposal for government linked institutional investors to put shareholders pressure on invested companies to give preference to local talent in senior management roles the above measures may not increase the overall jobs created or the quality but it will increase the availability of such roles for malaysians to significantly increase the number of jobs created our economy must shift from its current economic mix and undergo the same massive transformation we experienced in the 80s as we moved from agriculture base to manufacturing as with any massive economic transformation programme the government plays a critical role the previous administration s focus on the strength in domestic consumption and services sector may help to increase overall gdp but it is my belief that to truly catapult us into a high income nation malaysia s primary gdp growth must come from exports and increasing the flow of foreign capital into the country there are many industries which i believe can be exportable creates massive highly skilled employment and where we have some inherent strategic advantage that cannot be easily replicated for example our climate and location make us the prime candidate to benefit from the battle for global food security the recent calls from the government and prominent figures like former finance minister daim zainuddin for malaysians to venture into agriculture appear timely another industry that stands to benefit from our natural advantage is renewable energy the government should embark on a massive renewable energy initiative through direct rebate and tax incentives for local households and businesses to shift towards solar energy which in turn would further drive down the cost of solar panels produced in malaysia fun fact as of 2016 malaysia is already the largest exporter of solar cells and modules to the united states we should endeavour to make malaysia one of the top nations in terms of energy security energy cost and sustainability to attract energy intensive industries to shift here such as data centres other sectors at the top of my head which can be further encouraged to exploit our existing advantages include tourism specifically edu tourism and events halal products and certification electronic and electrical manufacturing in remote devices and automotive manufacturing for electric vehicles as for increasing wages i find it perplexing that a lot of the discussion focuses on the high income of senior management and on closing the gap by putting caps on high wages whilst it may make good optics and be popular for a short while in the long term making some people earn less will not help the vast majority who are low income earners to meet their living needs the key has always been to create a growing demand for skilled workers that are higher than the supply of them to stimulate wage growth across the board at the same time i strongly believe that companies that operate based on government sanctioned monopolies such as power transport telecommunications and financial service which means they have virtually zero competition and enjoy above average margins should take the lead in both capping pay for senior management and increasing drastically the overall median pay of their lower income group this will create competition for talent especially young graduates and force other companies to offer similarly attractive packages structural changes to the economy will take some time and the effects on our youths will be felt in perhaps the following generation but change we must by focusing on creating more jobs for malaysians in industries of higher value we will improve the economic conditions for our youths i know that many are sceptical of the recently announced shared prosperity vision 2030 but at its core it tries to address the issue of inclusiveness in economic growth and that includes improving the wages living standards and economic reality for youths as always the devil is in the details and as steve jobs once allegedly said ideas are worth nothing unless executed they are just a multiplier execution is worth millions for the sake of our present and future youths we must get the execution right this time the views expressed here are those of the author contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of malaysiakini

keynote speech by philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb at the joint european central bank irving fisher committee and banco de portugal conference on bridging measurement challenges and analytical needs of external statistics evolution or revolution introduction it is a pleasure to speak at this first edition of the conference on external statistics which is jointly organised by banco de portugal the irving fisher committee and the european central bank not only as a central banker but also during my time in academia i have spent much of my time analysing data on external transactions and international investment position so it should come as no surprise that i take a very active interest in the programme of this event and look forward to the discussions today it is fair to say that the richness and availability of external statistics has increased considerably over the last 20 years at the same time the measurement challenges have increased meaning that there are still many analytical hurdles to overcome when interpreting external statistics for the ecb high quality measurement of cross border statistics is centrally important to the ecb for several reasons first the euro area is closely integrated into the global economy both on the real side via trade linkages and participation in global value chains chart 1 but also on the financial side as indicated by the size of euro area external assets and liabilities chart 2 second the current account balance of the euro area is a primary macroeconomic variable and the underlying shifts in the current account have widespread implications for the overall real and nominal dynamics of the euro area it follows that accurately measuring the external sector of the euro area is central to understanding exposures to external shocks and the international transmission of the ecb s policies in my remarks i will first discuss some of the globalisation related measurement challenges that are affecting the real side of external statistics before turning to the financial side i will then highlight some of the ongoing initiatives to address these measurement challenges and outline some ideas to enhance the external statistics compilation framework with a focus on the euro area chart 1 euro area trade and global value chain participation percentages of euro area gdp left side percentages of total exports right side sources ecb eurostat and world input output database notes the data refer to extra euro area trade the exports and import data account for goods and services global value chain participation is measured as the share of gross exports that cross at least three borders the latest observation for trade is 2018 and for global value chain participation is 2014 chart 2 euro area external assets and liabilities percentages of euro area gdp sources ecb and eurostat notes the data refer to positions vis à vis extra euro area counterparts the latest observation is for 2018 measuring the real side of globalisation the increase in international trade has been accompanied by the rise of complex production chains involving firms specialising in different stages of production the global production network includes both multinational enterprises mnes large profitable global firms and also smaller and often highly specialised firms by now it is well recognised that mnes have complex organisational structures which frequently involve numerous legal entities including special purpose entities spes this complexity influences balance of payments b o p statistics in various ways the size of transactions related to mnes which are often intra firm poses challenges to the interpretation of balance of payments and national accounts statistics the impact in terms of the magnitude and volatility of statistical indicators is especially visible in financial centres and small very open economies where global firms are large relative to the size of the domestic economy however these factors are also increasingly relevant in understanding the external statistics of the aggregate euro area and other large economies in relation to measuring international trade cross border production arrangements such as contract manufacturing have considerable implications for concepts that are central to the b o p and national accounts such arrangements may involve foreign subsidiaries offshoring or an arms length relationship with an unrelated company outsourcing the extent to which such production arrangements matter for the euro area trade balance can be seen by comparing data on trade in goods between the b o p and international trade statistics this is possible because of an important methodological difference between the two datasets b o p data are based on the concept of change in economic ownership while trade statistics measure all goods crossing a border in terms of the goods trade balance for the euro area the gap between these two datasets has been growing over time in particular since 2015 chart 3 this divergence has been driven by euro area financial centres with a high presence of mnes chart 3 euro area goods trade balance eur billions sources di nino v habib m m and schmitz m forthcoming based on ecb and eurostat notes the blue area shows the net exports of the euro area as recorded in trade statistics the yellow and orange areas depict the difference between b o p and trade statistics in financial centres and other euro area economies respectively the group of financial centres includes belgium cyprus ireland luxembourg malta netherlands four quarter moving sums the latest observation is for the second quarter of 2019 this episode illustrates how b o p data and by extension also national accounts statistics can be affected by exports of goods that are not produced domestically and also do not cross the border of the domestic economy in line with this recent ecb research already presented in session 2 of this event finds that the trade surplus of euro area financial centres is mainly generated by foreign value added notably the pricing of the various transactions involved in cross border production arrangements in particular if these are intra firm substantially affects the amount and location of profits booked reflecting the well established concept of transfer pricing over time the location of corporate structures has become increasingly mobile this is partly driven by the redomiciliation of headquarters and the increased relevance of intangible assets such as patents and copyrights these intellectual property products ipps are particularly important for digital companies but are also relevant in other industries such as the pharmaceutical sector ipps can easily be moved across borders including to jurisdictions that offer favourable tax treatment for profits arising from such assets typically one entity of an mne group owns the ipp assets of the group while other entities in the same group pay licence fees and royalties for their use over the past few years ipp related transactions have had a marked effect on the services component of the euro area current account balance in particular there have been three large spikes in ipp related imports chart 4 chart 4 euro area services trade balance eur billions source ecb notes quarterly data the latest observation is for the third quarter of 2019 these episodes which reflect the transactions of a small number of large companies are also visible in the euro area national accounts where they show up as large imports of services and commensurately high gross fixed capital formation chart 5 importantly this increase in investment has also translated into a larger measured level of euro area domestic demand although the associated change in the underlying euro area domestic production patterns is likely to be quite minor chart 5 euro area national accounts selected components quarter on quarter growth rates in percentages source eurostat notes seasonally and working day adjusted quarterly data the latest observation is for the third quarter of 2019 such episodes highlight the dichotomy between the residency principle underlying macroeconomic statistics and the global footprint of mnes data on the numerous entities belonging to mne groups are not consolidated across borders with the home country of the parent mne instead they are recorded in the national statistics of the economy where the entities reside even if their effect on domestic economic activity may in fact be small this dichotomy also extends to the way statistics are still collected and compiled nowadays which is not much different from a century ago these are gathered nationally and subject to strict data confidentiality rules which often prevent cross border data sharing for global companies this implies that the information sets available to national statisticians differ across countries which gives rise to both gaps and overlaps at the same time this in turn has negative implications for cross country comparability and overall data quality including for the euro area it also enables the emergence of large bilateral asymmetries a case in point is the sizeable differences recorded for the bilateral current account balance between the euro area and the united states based on us and euro area data chart 6 this discrepancy gives rise to several interpretations which i will come back to later on chart 6 bilateral euro area us current account eur billions 2018 sources ecb and us bureau of economic analysis note positive balance indicates a surplus for the euro area measuring the financial side of globalisation let me turn to the financial side of globalisation while the post crisis environment was generally marked by a halt in financial globalisation foreign direct investment fdi positions continued to expand until recently a striking pattern that i identified in collaboration with gian maria milesi ferretti of the international monetary fund is that the post crisis expansion was concentrated in positions vis à vis international financial centres chart 7 this can in turn be linked to the increased complexity of the corporate structures of mnes as i just mentioned chart 7 evolution of external assets percentages

economic review vol 66 no 1 international monetary fund pp 189 222 due to these trends interpreting headline fdi data has become increasingly difficult including for the aggregate euro area notably there is a high presence of spes in a number of euro area countries in these economies spes account for sizeable shares of cross border financial transactions and positions not only in terms of fdi but also in terms of portfolio investment and other investment spes located in euro area financial centres typically hold equities manage debt issuance and allocate funding across parent and subsidiaries statistics on spes are however not yet sufficiently developed these are only available for a limited set of countries largely focus on fdi and do not follow a harmonised international definition large changes to the international balance sheet and financial flows of an economy may also arise from redomiciliations of headquarters common patterns associated with moving the headquarters of an mne to a financial centre economy are increases in net fdi assets of the financial centre while portfolio equity liabilities increase if the shareholders remain unchanged in relation to fdi of the euro area it is notable that in recent years gross fdi transactions of euro area financial centres have been so large that these have driven aggregate euro area developments chart 8 another defining feature of fdi is the strong positive correlation between gross assets and liabilities especially in financial centres which hints at the importance of the pass through of financial flows for the evolution of fdi data chart 8 euro area foreign direct investment assets and liabilities transactions percentages of euro area gdp sources ecb and eurostat notes financial

fdi assets of us companies in the euro area offer insights on the changing nature of euro area fdi liabilities between 2003 and 2018 us fdi positions in the euro area increased by a factor of 4 5 chart 9 a striking pattern is that this increase was largely driven by us investment in holding companies in the euro area which are often spes while us fdi in other more traditional sectors such as manufacturing grew more modestly chart 9 us foreign direct investment assets in the euro area by industry of euro area affiliate usd billions source us bureau of economic analysis notes the euro area is based on data available for austria belgium finland france germany greece ireland italy luxembourg netherlands portugal and spain the latest observation is for 2018 a forthcoming ecb study suggests that the income recorded on us fdi assets in the euro area plays a decisive role in the asymmetries observed in the bilateral euro area us current account balance chart 10 that i mentioned earlier the likely drivers of asymmetries in fdi income are first the difficulty in recording reinvested earnings of us mnes with complex ownership chains including holding companies and second the problems in properly allocating the income flows geographically differences in the information set on mnes available to european and us statisticians may be an important factor behind these patterns chart 10 bilateral euro area us foreign direct investment income flows eur billions 2018 sources ecb and us bureau of economic analysis data note positive balance indicates a surplus for the euro area going beyond fdi a careful interpretation of cross border statistics is also needed for appropriate risk assessments and policy analysis related to international financial exposures data on international financial transactions and positions have improved significantly over the past decade both in terms of coverage and available details as regards instruments sectors and geographic breakdowns such data are helpful for identifying the holders and issuers of financial instruments this in turn matters for the analysis of the transmission of shocks and the stability of investment positions over time however even these additional details cannot fully reveal the matrix of linkages between the ultimate investors and the ultimate issuers of financial instruments the identification of ultimate exposures has been further complicated in recent years by the rise of international financial intermediation chains which often involve non bank entities in international financial centres recent research on us investors and mutual funds shows that ultimate exposures for example with regard to securities issued by emerging market economies may differ significantly from those observed in international investment positions data these patterns point to the need to improve the statistical information available for the analysis of interconnectedness another way of helping to complete the analysis of exposures would be to integrate the sectoral information of the external balance sheet in domestic sectoral data this would enable the identification of the domestic sectors that ultimately drive external imbalances a further important dimension in measuring international balance sheet risks relates to the transmission of financial shocks through the valuation channel arising from exchange rates and other asset price movements in the past data on the valuation channel could only be roughly estimated resulting in substantial measurement errors however such data are now available in the official statistics for many economies including the euro area with a considerable degree of detail chart 11 for some economies security level data that provide highly granular insights into the trading of individual assets are now available for example granular datasets such as the escb s securities holdings statistics enable analysts to zoom in on refined dimensions of security holdings and draw up an ad hoc analysis of specific exposures studies exploiting these data show that different investor types respond differently to asset price fluctuations chart 11 valuation changes in euro area portfolio investment assets eur billions source ecb notes quarterly data the latest observation is for the third quarter of 2019 official statistics that provide a comprehensive picture of foreign currency exposures in international balance sheets are still relatively sparse such data are important however since the full analysis of the transmission of exchange rate movements needs to take into account net foreign currency exposures the lack of official statistics on the currency dimension of the international balance sheet has prompted the assembly of research based datasets plausible estimates can be constructed by carefully merging a range of datasets together with some estimates of the currency positions in different financial instruments chart

sample includes 50 advanced adv and emerging eme countries international initiatives to address measurement challenges the measurement challenges that i have discussed are well recognised in the international statistical community a number of data initiatives both at european and global level point to progress in addressing these problems as for instance recognised in the g20 data gaps initiative i am sure that over these two days you will have the opportunity to become familiar with many of these initiatives i would like to turn to what i consider to be required in order to enhance the relevance of cross border and national accounts statistics in general the statistical system needs to become more agile to keep pace with the rapidly evolving activities of multinational firms and financial intermediaries to this end the international statistical infrastructure needs to be enhanced a key pillar in this infrastructure is the legal entity identifier lei which will bring transparency and facilitate the distinct identification of legal entities and link them to the ultimate parent entity the ecb is actively engaged in this project since it not only supports the statistical process but also brings transparency to financial markets and to the exercise of prudential supervision moreover a concentric system of administrative and business registers can be a promising avenue for reconciling statistical and non statistical needs as the core of this system of registers one could develop a single near real time eu business register containing non confidential information this register could be made available as a public good for all administrative purposes establishing such a core register would require intensive cooperation among the operators of administrative statistical and commercial business registers and should draw on the initiatives to enforce the universal use of the lei ideally it should support all non statistical needs including those of the eu commission and those arising from the ecb s functions including banking supervision in concentric circles around the core business register one could first add the necessary statistical variables which would be the reference for european system of central banks escb and european statistical system ess statistical production further separate concentric circles could add variables for other administrative purposes such as tax administration i acknowledge the sizeable initial investment implied by such a system this requires thinking big and establishing eu law to bring it to life without these changes however i see little chance of keeping european statistics fit for purpose in the digital age i also think that the existing data confidentiality framework in the eu needs to be urgently reviewed the sharing of confidential data for statistical purpose within the escb ess should be facilitated by creating a solid legal basis while the exchange of confidential information for statistical purposes is already enabled under eu statistical law the experience of the last decade shows that this is not enough in a number of member states some legal initiatives will be required possibly to replace some enabling clauses with mandatory ones for instance a single statistical business register would never be possible without such an enhanced data confidentiality framework these infrastructure developments would create a world of opportunities for example given the importance of mnes and the associated measurement challenges the centralised collection of data on for instance the top 500 mnes in the eu could be envisaged as is already the case in the financial sector for the 120 significant and 4 000 less significant banks within the framework of banking supervision such data which could be made accessible to the relevant statistical authorities in the eu have the potential to eliminate information gaps and overlaps across countries and hence ensure a more complete and consistent cross country recording of the activities of mnes moreover this offers the prospect of significantly improving timeliness at the same time i am convinced that such an approach would be a win win situation for mnes in terms of the statistical reporting burden instead of receiving questionnaires from 27 member states in 20 plus languages a coordinated approach across the eu could significantly reduce reporting burdens in individual member states like my own the centralised approach to the biggest mnes is bundled in large case units which are often responsible for all reporting obligations and serve as a one stop contact point for mnes such an idea could also be considered at the euro area or eu level to the benefit of reporters and statistical authorities turning to data wishes as outlined earlier further sectoral detail is necessary for an adequate analysis of risk exposures and to account for the activities of purely internationally oriented entities there are important ongoing initiatives in this direction both at a global level and within the escb with regard to the need for a harmonised recording of spes in cross border statistics the definition provided by the dedicated task force of the imf committee on balance of payments statistics is welcome and will be helpful in ensuring the availability of internationally consistent statistics with a separate breakdown for spes the escb s work programmes on external statistics and financial accounts also seek to separately identify foreign controlled corporations in financial accounts and provide more refined breakdowns of the non bank financial sector moreover the euro area datasets on b o p and domestic sector accounts will achieve full consistency over the next year with important benefits for the analysis of interconnectedness taking a longer time horizon the next review and update of the statistical manuals in particular the balance of payments manual and the system of national accounts offers an opportunity to rethink the key concepts of macroeconomic statistics one avenue is the consolidated framework in which all entities belonging to a corporate group are assigned to the country of the headquarters such an approach has the potential to provide a useful alternative perspective in particular on mnes and in the identification of ultimate financial exposures however such a consolidated accounting framework should be considered as complementary rather than as a substitute for the residence based framework as both approaches have their merits their usefulness depends on the specific purpose of the analysis conclusions in this speech i have focused on the topic of measurement challenges for external statistics in particular i have highlighted the role that measurement issues play in determining the analytical value of the statistics on euro area trade and the national accounts on the financial side key issues relate to the changing nature of fdi and to the proper measurement of exposures and risks i have also discussed some of the ongoing initiatives to address these measurement challenges both at a global and european level i would like to highlight once more that further efforts are needed to improve the analytical value of external statistics this relates for instance to facilitating

new cases from the coronavirus outbreak for a third consecutive day this will be good news for the market to run with this morning and we should see the usually predictable unwinding of weekend defensive hedges out of the gates and the spx should continue to plow higher on the cleanest dirty shirt argument for owning us assets which is particularly salient at the moment given the likely asymmetric growth impact of the coronavirus shock at present the growth impact of the virus remains expected to be more severe in china and hence in germany than in the us fund flows continue to be supportive of the general risk on theme epfr data showed 23 6bn flowed into fixed income funds in the week ending wednesday the most significant inflow since 2001 i am surprised that fund flows into equities were not higher given the ongoing move for now equity markets remain in look through mode however it s not hard to be skeptical about just how much looking through investors will be willing

out bad enough for confidence to plummet investors could quickly find themselves up the creek schitt s creek without a paddle let s face it financial markets are not known for their rational thinking lately and given the 500 million or so mainlanders affected by the covid19 quarantine and it s also not hard to come up with more downside risks than upside ones right now this is a tricky market environment there isn t intemperate fear and there isn t unreasonable optimism the easy trades of reverting overextended markets are gone which has turned traders very wary of taking on big wagers while the virus stories don t carry the same headline gravitas it s still a focal point while the economic data fears continue to simmer on the back burner it will soon be the fear of the data unknowns that will keep investors awake at night but that has not stopped the market frustrating the bears in the past and now feels no different depressing the returns available through the duration in risk free government bonds creates incentives for investors to re allocate capital to stocks even more so into the resilient us markets oil markets the oil price action continues to be swayed backward and forwards by news flow around the covid 19 infection death rates and the prospects of opec agreeing a quota cut to balance off the demand slowdown however with a reality check about to set in when the china high frequency data start to roll in and in the absence of the russian compliance commitment any excuse to sell still feels like the sentiment in the market right now and while the worst is probably priced into the china equation the convexity of global economic data to how much of the china economy comes back on line should not be underestimated especially with a reported 500 million chinese lives touched by the quarantine that over 1 5 times the us population on friday oil market investors took solace after the us energy secretary noted only slight reductions in production from the coronavirus and that the agency is not yet concerned about its ultimate impact after markets closed the office of the us trade representative announced it would lift tariffs on aircraft imports from the eu from 10 to 15 effective march 18 though it stopped short of raising higher tariffs on other goods gold markets there s more to the recent gold move that meets the eye while retail sentiment seems to be now moving purely on the end of coronavirus headlines long term strategic buyers are starting to take notice of a soft underlying read for us retail sales the headline for january was in line but the bit that matters for gdp retail control was weaker recording a flat outturn against expectations of a 0 3 mom rise and with a sizeable downward revision for december the recent trend has been weak 3m annualized is only up 0 22 and the 6m annualized is down 0 12 only the second negative reading since the gfc the other was during the collapse in december 2018 while it is early in the quarter and retail sales are often revised the next retail sales release on march 17 takes on added significance as it has the potential to impact the fed s current policy narrative and while analyst has been focusing on asean central bank policy measures it s the fed who is now wearing the yellow jersey in the rate cut peloton as there are far more cuts priced for the fed than the other central banks from the time coronavirus cases started to pick up in mid january the fed went from being middle of the pack to now leading the pack at 36bp of cuts being priced this is a bullish swing in the gold narrative also the convexity of global economic data to how much of the china economy comes back on line should not be underestimated especially with a reported 500 million chinese impacted by the quarantine with the us stock markets trading at record highs and downside risks outnumbering upside one s by a count of 2 1 according to my watch list it s not hard to figure out why gold markets are bid with bond yields falling on coronavirus concerns and as the effects of existing tariffs make there way through the us economy but when factoring in geopolitical tensions such as the recent standoff between the united states and iran a potential technological divergence between washington and beijing and the possibility of a u s eu trade war gold should be on everyone s radar stock market liquidity liquidity on driving equity that s not what the chart below shows the fed s balance sheet is pretty much unchanged so far this year and shrank over the latter stages of january same for reserves balances yes both rose steeply in q4 last year but they haven t made further progress this year well the markets will soon get to test the liquidity theory as the new york fed reported it would lower its 14 day repo offerings by 5 bn down to 25 bn through march 3 and then down to 20 bn from march 3 onward the overnights will drop 20 bn to 100 bn maximum on thursday the fed provided 30 bn in 14d and 48 85 bn in overnight still its bill purchases hold at 60 bn month so perhaps the idea is to get back to a more conventional balance sheet management sooner rather than later currency markets asia fx mainland authorities have leaned mostly on targeted measures like individual re lending facilities with the macro policy response more fiscal additional pre financing quota for local governments than monetary net omo injection of the only 140bn in the last two weeks and usdcny fix mostly been in line with the model after the initial lowballing adjustment post lny with rmb1 2tn of omos maturing early next week the focus will be on whether pboc rolls them using mlf and at a cheaper price point ahead of lpr reset on the 20th the emphasis in rest of the region is on singapore budget 18th bank indonesia mpc 20th and bok 27th even although coronavirus risk premia are reducing and vols are taming there a gigantic swath of economic carnage left in covid 19 wake so even with hubei province not reporting fewer infections from the day before its full steam ahead for the region s economic stimulus plans if the past week is any indication investors are will be looking for a buying asia fx opportunity but could remain cautious about adding more currency risk before assessing the depth of the economic fallout but with regional policymakers taking protractive actionable measures to thwart of the legacy effects of covid 19 this should be viewed as growth positive but the market appears to lack a catalyst for a real trend and i expect consolidation to continue until bluer skies look likely the yuan usdcnh slipped from the high of 6 9917 and traded at 6 9830 80 last friday asia morning but back up again in the ny time zone there was no demand for long usd gamma however instead with the curve pointing south implying that traders seemed to have priced in a potential rrr cut friday so when it didn t come forward points reverse higher and dragged spot along for the ride the drop in the daily virus headcount is a positive for regional risk as the curve now refocuses on pboc policy measures which should be bullish for the yuan the ringgit for the ringgit which is a mid level carry currency it very much relies on a pickup in growth expectations to recover sustainably and with another rate cut looks largely priced into swap markets and out to 10y on the bond curve and with 10y mgs trading this week with yields through 3 0 to all time lows it might be up to equity flows to do much of the heavy lifting this week as perhaps offshore blond flows could turn more neutral from here after significant inflows in the past three months look for the ringgit to take it s lead from the yuan today the thai baht the usdthb continues to hold well above the 31 00 level as currency trader to a tee the negative tail to the covid 19 outbreak is best expressed at this stage via being long usd vs thb singapore dollar fx and rates curves in singapore are mostly already pricing in a shift by mas to neutral while the reduction in new flu cases ex hubei has already helped asian fx consolidate but if the response to sars were any indication it might take a positive announcement shock like a lifting of the travel ban to get the singapore dollar moving in the other direction g 10 currency markets the yen why isn t the yen working don t even get me going besides the fact covid 19 poses a significant near term downside risk to japan s economy negative rates and a magnetic attraction to the 110 level have made it an expensive proposition to purchase in a panic and then sit on the euro any concerns about your short euro position you bet besides president trump s twitter feed set to exposed if the eurusd breaches 108 the ecb s strategic review has a hawkish bias particularly given the current euro weakness i think this supports the euro if this is the case g10 traders will take their cue for the rates markets as this should create a measurable bounce in near term eu interest rate yields still given the dismal economic outlook in germany given my current view look to sell on rallies to the 1 09 handle not before while downside optionality volumes are exploding cash remains a bit neutral at this point suggesting the market looks to well positioned for a downside move and in this low vol environment short term positioning looks a bit extreme at the moment the australian dollar the aussie which continues to trade super beta to china risk is punching higher this morning on improving

bid with bond yields falling on coronavirus concerns and as the effects of existing tariffs make there way through the us economy but when factoring in geopolitical tensions such as the recent standoff between the united states and iran a potential technological divergence between washington and beijing and the possibility of a u s eu trade war gold should be on everyone s radar stock market liquidity liquidity on driving equity that s not what the chart below shows the fed s balance sheet is pretty much unchanged so far this year and shrank over the latter stages of january same for reserves balances yes both rose steeply in q4 last year but they haven t made further progress this year well the markets will soon get to test the liquidity theory as the new york fed reported it would lower its 14 day repo offerings by 5 bn down to 25 bn through march 3 and then down to 20 bn from march 3 onward the overnights will drop 20 bn to 100 bn maximum on thursday the fed provided 30 bn in 14d and 48 85 bn in overnight still its bill purchases hold at 60 bn month so perhaps the idea is to get back to a more conventional balance sheet management sooner rather than later currency markets asia fx mainland authorities have leaned mostly on targeted measures like individual re lending facilities with the macro policy response more fiscal additional pre financing quota for local governments than monetary net omo injection of the only 140bn in the last two weeks and usdcny fix mostly been in line with the model after the initial lowballing adjustment post lny with rmb1 2tn of omos maturing early next week the focus will be on whether pboc rolls them using mlf and at a cheaper price point ahead of lpr reset on the 20th the emphasis in rest of the region is on singapore budget 18th bank indonesia mpc 20th and bok 27th even although coronavirus risk premia are reducing and vols are taming there a gigantic swath of economic carnage left in covid 19 wake so even with hubei province not reporting fewer infections from the day before its full steam ahead for the region s economic stimulus plans if the past week is any indication investors are will be looking for a buying asia fx opportunity but could remain cautious about adding more currency risk before assessing the depth of the economic fallout but with regional policymakers taking protractive actionable measures to thwart of the legacy effects of covid 19 this should be viewed as growth positive but the market appears to lack a catalyst for a real trend and i expect consolidation to continue until bluer skies look likely the yuan usdcnh slipped from the high of 6 9917 and traded at 6 9830 80 last friday asia morning but back up again in the ny time zone there was no demand for long usd gamma however instead with the curve pointing south implying that traders seemed to have priced in a potential rrr cut friday so when it didn t come forward points reverse higher and dragged spot along for the ride the drop in the daily virus headcount is a positive for regional risk as the curve now refocuses on pboc policy measures which should be bullish for the yuan the ringgit for the ringgit which is a mid level carry currency it very much relies on a pickup in growth expectations to recover sustainably and with another rate cut looks largely priced into swap markets and out to 10y on the bond curve and with 10y mgs trading this week with yields through 3 0 to all time lows it might be up to equity flows to do much of the heavy lifting this week as perhaps offshore blond flows could turn more neutral from here after significant inflows in the past three months look for the ringgit to take it s lead from the yuan today the thai baht the usdthb continues to hold well above the 31 00 level as currency trader to a tee the negative tail to the covid 19 outbreak is best expressed at this stage via being long usd vs thb singapore dollar fx and rates curves in singapore are mostly already pricing in a shift by mas to neutral while the reduction in new flu cases ex hubei has already helped asian fx consolidate but if the response to sars were any indication it might take a positive announcement shock like a lifting of the travel ban to get the singapore dollar moving in the other direction g 10 currency markets the yen why isn t the yen working don t even get me going besides the fact covid 19 poses a significant near term downside risk to japan s economy negative rates and a magnetic attraction to the 110 level have made it an expensive proposition to purchase in a panic and then sit on the euro any concerns about your short euro position you bet besides president trump s twitter feed set to exposed if the eurusd breaches 108 the ecb s strategic review has a hawkish bias particularly given the current euro weakness i think this supports the euro if this is the case g10 traders will take their cue for the rates markets as this should create a measurable bounce in near term eu interest rate yields still given the dismal economic outlook in germany given my current view look to sell on rallies to the 1 09 handle not before while downside optionality volumes are exploding cash remains a bit neutral at this point suggesting the market looks to well positioned for a downside move and in this low vol environment short term positioning looks a bit extreme at the moment the australian dollar the aussie which continues to trade super beta to china risk is punching higher this morning on improving regional risk sentiment as china reported a drop

workers perform docking operations at a port in qingdao east china s shandong province on feb 11 when the world health organization announced the novel coronavirus outbreak was a public health emergency of international concern pheic it made it clear that it opposed countries imposing travel or trade bans on china but more than 10 000 international flights to china have been canceled due to the impact of the epidemic as the world s factory and a major country trading in goods china is the largest trade partner of more than 100 countries and its manufacturing industry accounts for 25 percent globally restricting china s trade and personnel exchanges with other countries will not only impact china s exports for a short time but also undermine the stability of global supply chains and world economic growth in the short run the epidemic s impact on china s exports will be larger than that on imports to cope with the adverse impact of the epidemic on china s economy the country has launched macroeconomic and fiscal measures to support china s imports and exports and the global supply chain will rapidly recover in the second quarter as the epidemic is effectively brought under control the extended spring festival closure of businesses due to the epidemic has not only hit the catering and tourism industry but also international trade but after the epidemic is curbed the consumption that has been constrained will be rapidly released and there will be an explosive growth in imports and exports the novel coronavirus outbreak will impact china s exports in the first quarter of this year but international experience shows that the five pheics that have previously been declared only had a temporary impact on the economy of the countries where the health threat emerged hubei province has been suffering the most because of the virus but it only accounts for 1 5 percent of the country s total exports which means the outbreak s impact on china s exports in 2020 is expected to be limited although the epidemic has had a negative impact on china s imports in the full year it will drive imports up because china has just signed the phase one trade deal with the united states to import agricultural products and foods worth 100 billion and there will be increased imports of medical supplies and medicines because of the epidemic the epidemic will mostly impact the tourism industry and airline companies as many countries have imposed travel bans or canceled flights to china but some other trade in service items such as cross border payments and software services will not be affected by the epidemic and may even grow rapidly in general the epidemic s impact on the trade in services is controllable china should enhance countercyclical adjustment and resolutely propel reform and opening up exports and imports should be promoted especially cross border e commerce and the digital economy in particular the government should first cut tax and administrative fees to support imports and exports and foreign trade enterprises and second the authorities should provide financial support to export enterprises especially in virus hit regions to satisfy their credit and loan demands in terms of monetary policy the central bank should reduce interest rates and the deposit reserve ratio requirement appropriately to maintain reasonable and sufficient liquidity and reduce actual interest rates based on loan prime rate reform third in terms of industrial policy the digital economy and modern logistics industry should be promoted and intelligent manufacturing as well as the enterprises digitalized transformation should be advanced fourth multiple measures should be implemented to promote exports and a green export channel should be established diversified policies should be implemented to ease the complete restraints of the epidemic on china s exports and encourage exports of large products such as electromechanical equipment imports not limited to medicines should also be boosted trade liberalization and facilitation should be promoted by enhancing multilateral free trade agreement construction of the belt and road initiative as well as trade and investment with the european union association of southeast asian nations and the african union fifth foreign trade risks caused by epidemic prevention and control work should be prevented foreign trade enterprises should prevent three major kinds of risks credit and contractual risks market risks and foreign exchange losses and logistical and supply chain risks china s economic basis has changed since 2002 03 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak took place china s per capita gdp has increased from less than 10 000 yuan at that time to more than 70 000 yuan 10 056 today and china s total gdp has increased from 13 trillion yuan at that time to nearly 100 trillion yuan today meanwhile china s foreign trade dependence has reduced from 51 3 percent to 31 8 percent meaning that exports are no longer the major driving force of economic growth with the successful experience to prevent and control the sars outbreak china will definitely win the battle against the novel coronavirus and pursue import and export trade growth the author is a researcher at the chongyang institute for financial studies renmin university of china the views

greatest impact the focus will then shift to germany s gfk consumer climate figures due out on thursday consumer spending continues to be a key area of focus for the ecb so we can expect sensitivity to the numbers this week wrapping up the week we ve got prelim february private sector pmi numbers out of france germany and the eurozone story continues upward momentum will need to continue towards a return to growth in the manufacturing sector to support the eur the spread of the coronavirus in china and beyond however may give the eur another blow germany s manufacturing pmi and the eurozone s

retail sales figures due out on thursday we saw last month s employment figures temper market expectations of a boe rate cut which leaves the pound exposed to this month s numbers off the back of labor market numbers january inflation figures are due out on wednesday that will also influence sentiment towards monetary policy forecasts are for an uptick in inflationary pressure that should further ease expectations of a near term rate cut much will depend on employment and retail sales figures however the retail sales figures will likely be the key driver on the data front a bounce back in spending would support the boe s initial outlook on economic growth following brexit of less influence in the week is cbi industrial trend orders due out on friday outside of the numbers expect chatter on trade negotiations to also influence while there may be no progress with the eu progress elsewhere is a must early on the gbp usd ended the week up by 1 20 to 1 3047 for the loonie it s a busy week ahead on the economic calendar december manufacturing sales figures due out on tuesday will garner some attention ahead of an important 2nd half of the week sales are forecast to fall by a further 0 2 in december following a 0 6 slide in november positive numbers would be needed to deliver the loonie with support in the 2nd half of the week january inflation figures on wednesday and december retail sales figures on friday will be key a negative set of numbers and the boc may well have a green light to ease policy further outside of the numbers the news wires and sentiment towards the global economy and oil consumption will also be key the loonie ended the week up by 0 42 to c 1 3252 against the u s dollar out of asia for the aussie dollar it s another relatively quiet week ahead key stats include 4th quarter wage growth figures due out on wednesday and january employment numbers due out on thursday expect both sets of numbers to influence wage growth has been tepid which has raised concerns over the outlook for domestic consumption the rba sees that the current low in interest rates and a pickup in wage growth would drive spending on thursday the employment numbers will also need to reflect a tightening in the slack to support a positive outlook on wage growth while the numbers will influence expect news from china and any further moves by beijing and the pboc to deliver support the aussie dollar ended the week up by 0 61 to 0 6714 for the kiwi dollar it s another quiet week ahead on the economic data front key stats are limited to 4th quarter

to 0 6438 for the japanese yen it s a busy week on the economic calendar key stats include 4th quarter gdp numbers due out on monday alongside february industrial production figures the focus will then shift to january trade data due out on wednesday gdp numbers are forecasted to be quite dire which may force the boj to show what it has on offer trade data will also garner plenty of attention as the markets look to assess the impact of covid 19 on regional growth at the end of the week january inflation figures will likely have a muted impact barring a spike outside of the numbers economic data from the u s could continue to give the dollar the upper hand a jump in covid 19 related deaths and an increase in fatalities outside of china would likely drive demand for the yen however news from china on the weekend was market risk positive the japanese yen ended the week down by 0 03 to 109 78 against the u s dollar out of china it s a particularly quiet week on the economic data front there are no material stats due out of china to provide direction to the global financial markets the lack of stats leaves the covid 19 updates and impact analysis in focus we are expecting the

services will not be affected by the epidemic and may even grow rapidly in general the epidemic s impact on the trade in services is controllable china should enhance countercyclical adjustment and resolutely propel reform and opening up exports and imports should be promoted especially cross border e commerce and the digital economy in particular the government should first cut tax and administrative fees to support imports and exports and foreign trade enterprises and second the authorities should provide financial support to export enterprises especially in virus hit regions to satisfy their credit and loan demands in terms of monetary policy the central bank should reduce interest rates and the deposit reserve ratio requirement appropriately to maintain reasonable and sufficient liquidity and reduce actual interest rates based on loan prime rate reform third in terms of industrial policy the digital economy and modern logistics industry should be promoted and intelligent manufacturing as well as the enterprises digitalized transformation should be advanced fourth multiple measures should be implemented to promote exports and a green export channel should be established diversified policies should be implemented to ease the complete restraints of the epidemic on china s exports and encourage exports of large products such as electromechanical equipment imports not limited to medicines should also be boosted trade liberalization and facilitation should be promoted by enhancing multilateral free trade agreement construction of the belt and road initiative as well as trade and investment with the european union association of southeast asian nations and the african union fifth foreign trade risks caused by epidemic prevention and control work should be prevented foreign trade enterprises should prevent three major kinds of risks credit and contractual risks market risks and foreign exchange losses and logistical and supply chain risks china s economic basis has changed since 2002 03 when the severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak took place china s per capita gdp has increased from less than 10 000 yuan at that time to more than 70 000 yuan 10 056 today and china s total gdp has increased from 13 trillion yuan at that time to nearly 100 trillion yuan today meanwhile china s foreign trade dependence has reduced from 51 3 percent to 31 8 percent meaning that exports are no longer the major driving force of economic growth with the successful experience to prevent and control the sars outbreak china will definitely win the battle against the novel coronavirus and pursue import and export trade growth the author is a researcher at the chongyang institute for financial studies renmin university of china the views

like a newtonian law of motion market participants will continue to rely on a particular trading style or system until it stops working betting that volatility stays low is a cash register for many and there appears to be what soros called reflexivity here like a self fulfilling prophecy why is volatility low because it is being sold in various ways besides directly selling options buying equity pullbacks and selling euro bounces for example also seem to be expressions of short volatility there is little on next week s calendar that threatens to pull the plug on this cash register in other circumstances the eurozone s preliminary february pmi could have potential it is to be reported at the end of the week ahead the composite had not fallen since last september when it reached 50 1 in january it was at 51 3 little above where it finished 2018 51 1 however one of the most important reasons market participants pay attention to sentiment data of which this purchasing manager survey is an example is that it ought to shed light on real sector developments yet the market was shocked by the magnitude of the decline in the december industrial figures the december manufacturing pmi for emu eased to 46 3 from 46 6 having bottomed in september at 45 7 the 2 1 decline reported last week was tipped by the national figures but the aggregate decline was the largest since february 2016 2 2 which itself was the biggest drop since early 2009 while the flash pmi may pose headline risk it is most unlikely to turn the market the ecb s course also appears set lagarde has not cleaned house as georgieva has at the imf and continues on the path set out by draghi however her presence has already been evident in the lack of sniping and media leaks this represents an improvement in communication there have been reports in the media claiming a backlash against negative interest rates yet lagarde has given a spirited defense last week so did germany s executive board member schnabel who may be the first in her position to defend it and vigorously the ecb s chief economist lane also endorsed its efficacy china s economic data for january and february was always going to be distorted by the lunar new year holiday this year because of the new coronavirus covid 19 the data is particularly of little value in addition to monitoring the progress of the virus in china where the cases and mortality are the highest the setting of the loan prime rate will be an important signal recall the one year loan prime rate has become the new benchmark and it is set by a survey of the leading banks in this sense it is a more market driven metric than previously administered attempts it is set on the 20th of every month and currently stands at 4 15 the median forecast in the bloomberg survey looks for a 10 bp cut if it is wrong it is likely because rates have fallen faster the pboc granted banks this week funds that can be re lent to businesses struggling to cope with the effects of the covid 19 for 100 bp below the one year loan prime rate the signal from beijing is to go for growth yet the inclusion of cat scan diagnosis rather than the nucleic acid test saw a jump in confirmed cases and nearly doubling of fatalities this raises new questions and prompts an extension of closures and disruptions while the initial reaction is this was a one off adjustment it is not immediately clear there are problems outside of china too with some observers for example seeing that indonesia s claim of having no cases is a bit unlikely also there is concern in some quarters that the incubation period may be longer than initially estimated the political consequences are already materializing the death of li wenliang a young doctor who was among the first to detect the virus and was harassed by local officials for doing so and ended up being infected himself is an unexpected catalyst for change it seems clear that public health requires clear and forthright communication and yet in china like several other places this does not exist in fact the lack of open and honest communication costs lives it is in this way that this experience is similar to the soviet union s chernobyl tragedy in 1986 a campaign pushing for open communication has begun on social media another political fallout is the replacement of the communist party heads in hubei and wuhan however the replacement of the director of hong kong and macau affairs suggests that xi may be using covid 19 as cover to pursue a broader agenda it may not be so dissimilar from using the anti corruption campaign to also punish rivals and secure greater power a common understanding is that there is a social contract between the chinese people and the communist party the latter delivers the goods literally rising living standards and the people defer to the party however the lack of trust that was simmering below the surface is becoming manifest this is another window of opportunity for a change a concession to people a civil liberty but the greater probability is the opposite push hard for a quick resumption of economic activity and repress dissent at the start of the week investors will learn just how bad last year ended for japan with the first official look at q4 19 gdp the tax hike and typhoons are expected to have led to a 1 quarter over quarter contraction and risk is on the downside the reason the market will not act much is that the data is historical and there are no new policy implications more important is how the economy is doing in q1 there are concerns about the disruption of trade due to covid 19 and the sluggishness of consumption after the sales tax increase this may translate into an economic contraction here in the first quarter japan s january trade figures will be released the interest lies not in the balance itself but the components exports were off 6 3 year over year in december which of course was before the public knew about china s new virus recall that in december japan s exports of semiconductor fabrication equipment to china jumped by 60 this is important too because semiconductor chips design and manufacturing are seen to be a bottleneck for china japan reports cpi and the preliminary february pmi the composite pmi was at 50 1 in january any decline would fan recession two quarters of contraction fears while much has been done in the name of the core inflation excluding fresh food it tends not to elicit much of a market reaction the headline may ease from 0 8 to 0 6 while the core rate is likely steady at 0 7 the uk reports employment cpi retail sales and the flash pmi a couple of weeks ago the market was particularly sensitive to speculation that bank of england governor carney would cut rates at his last meeting not only wasn t it delivered but now the data might not be so important either the two dissenters at the boe have been unable to convince any colleagues to join them and the new governor is unlikely to start his tenure with a rate cut the market is fully pricing in a 25 bp rate cut around the middle of q3 meanwhile the fiscal rules were already relaxed before chancellor javid unexpectedly resigned as a consequence of the cabinet and staff shuffle the market anticipates an expansionary budget when it is presented in less than a month last week the reserve bank of new zealand flagged that its easing cycle was over and the markets believed it the currency rallied and yields rose the reserve bank of australia and the bank of canada are in somewhat different positions the bank of canada withstood three fed cuts last year and stuck to its neutrality it has since softened its tone and the january employment data was sufficient to refute any sense of urgency the january cpi report due in the middle of next week is expected to reinforce this message after finishing last year at 2 2 november and december it is forecast to rise to 2 4 which would match last may s pace which itself was the strongest since the 2 8 rate in august 2018 the core measures are expected to remain broadly steady 2 0 2 2 the reserve bank of australia s cautious optimism rests on the labor market which naturally draws attention to the january employment report the market is expecting the rba will cut the cash rate by 25 bp in june or july australia created an average of almost 22k net new jobs a month last year after nearly 21k a month in 2018 the median forecast in the bloomberg survey calls for a 10k increase last month full time positions grew by an average of 12 7k month in 2019 and 13 5k in 2018 this may overstate the recent trend full time jobs fell in q4 19 for the first time since q1 18 if the australian dollar sells off on a strong report it would be revealing about psychology and positioning it has depreciated by 4 4 so far this year to multiyear lows according to the oecd s measure of purchasing power parity the aussie is less than 1 undervalued 0 6720 the key to the dollar s outlook and to fed policy does not hinge on the high frequency data that will be reported in the week ahead the market continues to discount one rate cut fully and is roughly half way toward factoring a second cut the logic is the same as last year the pce deflator measure of inflation which the fed targets is at 1 6 the target is 2 officials continue to see mostly international risks and continued weakness in the industrial sector contraction four of the past five months indicating that some risks are in fact materializing the economy they assure us is in a good place but that does not preclude taking further insurance out possibly in q2 extending the business cycle further and pushing the envelope of full employment last week s retail sales and industrial production reports for january told investors and policymakers that the new year has begun pretty much the way 2019 ended the consumer continues to shop but at a more subdued pace it should not be surprising as investors also learned last week that real weekly pay is flat year over year even though average hourly pay has increased higher hourly is offset by working a few hours revolving debt credit cards has increased to pick up some of the slack the production cuts at boeing are being felt aerospace and parts output fell 9 4 in january and without it manufacturing output may have gained 0 3 instead of contracting by 0 1 on the other hand auto production picked up and without it manufacturing output would have fallen by 0 3 manufacturing accounts for around three quarters of industrial output which includes mining drilling and utilities the output of utilities also fell in january due to unseasonably warm weather that helped other sectors more troubling is the continued decline in capacity utilization at 76 8 it is the lowest in nearly 2 5 years the low usage rates are associated with weaker profitability and deter new capital expenditure the empire state and philadelphia manufacturing surveys may draw attention because outside of weekly jobless claims they will offer the first insight into economic activity in february the fed s term repo will also attract interest despite the last three repos being oversubscribed the fed announced it would reduce the amount it would make available and taper further next month the fed is implicitly assuming that it is the cheapness of the funds it makes available that attracts the strong demand and not a shortage of reserves

final destination of any good that u s companies are forbidden to sell inside north korea is of no consequence when it s remembered that the feds do not control those whom u s companies sell to so long as they re selling their wares u s companies are ultimately selling to north koreans who desire u s products and who have the means to purchase them and how do north koreans exchange goods and services including that which is u s produced according to fifield the u s dollar is still the preferred currency for north korean businessmen since it is easier to convert and spend you read that right the economy of one of the u s s foremost enemies is liquefied by u s dollars that the dollar facilitates exchange in pyongyang and that it does so without the help of the federal reserve is a statement of the obvious simply stated money is a consequence of production not a driver of it individuals produce in order to exchange what they produce with others which explains why the dollar factors into so much global trade precisely because the dollar can be exchanged for goods and services the world over its role in global trade and investment is of the 90 kind all of which brings us to judy shelton s nomination to the federal reserve board up front what s previously been said should exist as yet another reminder that the fed s presumed ability to influence economic outcomes is exponentially more theoretical than real that the u s dollar liquefies the economy of this most econmically isolated country speaks to how overstated the fed s power is credible money finds production period that the fed can t limit dollars flowing to their highest use in north korea should have even the mildly sapient questioning why so many pundits politicians and economists focus so much on the fed stateside if the central bank can t keep dollars from refereeing trade and investment in a police state does anyone seriously think the fed can tighten or loosen access to dollars in the u s the question answers itself so while all this breathy excitement about the fed is silly and something that future historians will marvel at it s still easy to energetically support shelton for the fed board the fed employs more economists than any other entity in the world these economists almost unanimously believe that economic growth causes inflation so it will do the fed good to have someone inside who thinks differently shelton knows well that economic growth is actually a consequence of investment and investment is what brings about falling prices how fun to see what s calcified and ludicrous economists also almost unanimously think that empowering nancy pelosi and kevin mccarthy to spend with abandon is the path to prosperity to be shaken up by the unafraid shelton she should be confirmed yesterday thank goodness shelton doesn t think like economists thinking about the nominee more broadly the discussion of shelton within the pundit class would be quite a bit more productive if those who presume to talk money understood that no one trades it or exchanges it underlying all transactions that involve money is the exchange of real goods services and labor always money is merely an agreement about value among producers that facilitates the exchange of actual things thus explaining yet again why the dollar is the currency of choice in a country whose official currency is the won the problem is that the won commands little in north korea and nothing outside of it since financial transactions are yet again always about the exchange of goods and services for goods and services the currency refereeing these exchanges must once again be seen as exchangeable for market goods all of this rates stress given shelton s past support for a gold defined dollar to be clear she s long been a supporter of just such a currency as she put it in her classic 1994 book money meltdown going on a global gold standard would provide a much more democratic international monetary system than the one that exists today statements like this are all over the book that they are speaks to shelton s possession of common sense the latter something that s very challenging to find inside the marriner eccles building on washington s constitution avenue or for that matter any of the other fed branches around the country shelton s support for stable money is an explicit statement from her that she understands money s sole purpose as a medium of exchange nothing else shelton s support for a gold defined dollar is an acknowledgement of a simple truth previously stated no one trades money currency exchanges signal the exchange of goods services and labor let s say it again always given this statement of the supremely obvious it s only natural that the goal among serious people when it comes to currencies is that they be as stable as a measure of value as possible and for those who say a gold defined dollar or a stable dollar pick your commodity would limit the ability of the fed to act during recessions you re showing how little you understand money to say that a dollar with a stable definition exists as a barrier to central bankers politicians and economic growth is the equivalent of some dope saying that a slow second keeps his 40 yard dash times at 6 seconds and is keeping him out of the nfl as a consequence seconds measure objectively money measures objectively nothing else of course this too is a pointless discussion when it s remembered that the fed s policy portfolio doesn t include the dollar s exchange rate in short shelton s support of the gold standard and dollar price stability would only be relevant if she were being appointed treasury secretary and for those readers absolutely convinced the fed manages the dollar s value despite all evidence revealing the exact opposite don t forget that the fed operates under an implied consensus rule 4 3 votes or even 5 2 votes by fed board members are the major exception to the rule shelton would be but one believer in a gold defined dollar translated even if it were true that the fed controlled the dollar s value the fed is short about four or five sheltons if the goal is a return to the gold standard this is true even if shelton ultimately replaces jerome powell some object to shelton because her views have evolved with those of the man who appointed her this is true but it s also irrelevant about it being true in a wall street journal interview from 2019 shelton recalled u s auto workers telling her in the 1980s that we can compete against the best in the world but we can t compete against the central bank of japan in particular shelton made the point more than once that currency devaluation by countries makes their products more competitive globally in shelton s 2019 words nations gain a price advantage over competitors by devaluing their currencies that s what she was referencing while discussing japan except that what she referenced isn t true and the source supporting the previous claim is shelton s previously mentioned 1994 classic money meltdown contrary to modern commentary from shelton about japan s central bank devaluing the yen versus the dollar the fed nominee knows well what really happened and the truth will inform her thinking while at the fed or it should writing about the 1985 plaza accord in money meltdown shelton observed that if the success of it were judged by the steep descent in the dollar s value as measured against other currencies in the ensuing months there can be no denying that the plan worked 36 pages later shelton noted that the yen was at 358 to the dollar in 1970 265 yen to the dollar in 1973 184 in 1978 129 in 1988 and 105 in 1993 shelton described the dollar s steep drop against the yen in the 1980s as a final outcome of the deliberate government effort engineered by baker and darman to lower the value of the dollar against the yen baker was treasury secretary at the time and darman was his 2 translating all this shelton has tailored her views to fit those of the president appointing her and trump incorrectly believes that the dollar has soared against the yen since the 1980s no not at all arguably something similar is at work with interest rates or the fed s role shelton is too smart to believe that price controls work that s why her modern stance in favor of so called fed ease is so easy to read as politics in play if we ignore what s true that the fed can t control access to credit in the first place the idea that it could expand credit access by lowering the fed funds rate is as silly as the belief that artificially low apartment rent controls will lead to apartment abundance no not at all and the fed can t create easy credit shelton knows this politics is once again at work and that s ok the fed has long been a politicized institution and so it remains under president trump it says here that shelton doesn t need to compromise her views on the dollar and interest rates but she knows her own situation better than yours truly furthermore her compromises or evolving opinions that have some up in arms are a distraction from the much bigger truth about the economics profession it s populated by the near monolithically incorrect it s not just that they believe against all evidence that growth causes inflation or that government spending stimulates growth as opposed to it being a consequence of it economists also near unanimously believe world war ii ended the great depression yes they believe that maiming and killing boost economic progress the economics profession is increasingly ridiculous and so is the fed ridiculous when it s remembered how many economists are in its employ shelton will greatly improve an institution and an economics discussion that s degenerated into the wildly silly and that can t hurt her existence will surely trigger some on the left and that can t hurt either all that plus she s a remarkably gracious person

easy to read as politics in play if we ignore what s true that the fed can t control access to credit in the first place the idea that it could expand credit access by lowering the fed funds rate is as silly as the belief that artificially low apartment rent controls will lead to apartment abundance no not at all and the fed can t create easy credit shelton knows this politics is once again at work and that s ok the fed has long been a politicized institution and so it remains under president trump it says here that shelton doesn t need to compromise her views on the dollar and interest rates but she knows her own situation better than yours truly furthermore her compromises or evolving opinions that have some up in arms are a distraction from the much bigger truth about the economics profession it s populated by the near monolithically incorrect it s not just that they believe against all evidence that growth causes inflation or that government spending stimulates growth as opposed to it being a consequence of it economists also near unanimously believe world war ii ended the great depression yes they believe that maiming and killing boost economic progress the economics profession is increasingly ridiculous and so is the fed ridiculous when it s remembered how many economists are in its employ shelton will greatly improve an institution and an economics discussion that s degenerated into the wildly silly and that can t hurt her existence will surely trigger some on the left and that can t hurt either all that plus she s a remarkably gracious person
