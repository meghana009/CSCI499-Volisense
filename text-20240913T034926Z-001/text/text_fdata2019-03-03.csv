pakistan will soon reach an agreement with the international monetary fund imf on a potential bailout package worth 12 billion dh44 billion that will help islamabad support its fledgling economy improve foreign exchange reserves and overcome a balance of payment crisis early indications suggest that pakistani authorities requested aid of 12 billion we maintain that pakistan and the imf will reach an agreement over a bailout soon with a potential bailout size of about 12 billion fitch solutions said in its latest update on pakistan s economy we believe that the conditions and targets will focus on key areas such as fiscal consolidation and debt management a review of monetary and exchange rate policy financial and banking sector reforms as well as the implementation of key structural reforms it added it will be the highest loan by any pakistani government in its history from the fund fitch noted that 2013 package improved pakistan s macroeconomic fundamentals over the three year time frame before fiscal and monetary management started to slip again in late 2016 and 2017 we would expect similar measures to be implemented in the event of a package being signed fitch said measures to strengthen pakistan s fiscal and debt dynamics will likely be a major cornerstone of the imf deal with the end goal of narrowing the budget deficit and stabilising the debt to gdp ratio through austerity measures these policies will likely be aimed at reducing the budget deficit from an estimated 6 6 per cent in 2018 to approximately 4 5 per cent or even lower over the next one to three years this would be roughly in line with the consolidation programme implemented in 2013 that set out expectations for a reduction in the fiscal deficit by an annualised one per cent per year for three years fitch added read more 20 billion from saudi arabia to pakistan to boost economy pakistanis in dubai can now work rent free in these spaces in dubai atik munshi senior partner at crowe horwath uae said prime minister imran khan s government has been striving to secure more funds and aid from friendly countries and the imf to put back pakistan s economy on track and improve its global reputation pakistan has been successful in securing some funding from the gulf countries and has good hopes of getting imf loan such a loan will come at stringent terms and pakistan government would need to work hard for its servicing a lot needs to be done on international and regional relationships the imran led government has obtained 10 billion from countries including the uae saudi arabia and china in order to help stabilise foreign exchange meet its current account deficit and support the rupee due to a persistent decline in forex reserves the rupee has depreciated approximately 30 per cent in the past year and islamabad needs fresh funding to support the currency and forex reserves and the biggest loan from the imf will certainly help stabilise the rupee imran met imf managing director christine lagarde on the sidelines of the world government summit in dubai last month to discuss the loan i had a good and constructive meeting with prime minister khan during which we discussed recent economic developments and prospects for pakistan in the context of ongoing discussions toward an imf supported programme i reiterated that the imf stands ready to support pakistan i also highlighted that decisive policies and a strong package of economic reforms would enable pakistan to restore the resilience of its economy and lay the foundations for stronger and more inclusive growth lagarde said in a statement issued after the meeting ahmed shaikhani senior vice president at the pakistan business council said a 12 billion imf loan in current circumstances is positive but in the coming months there could a challenge for repayment the government has no policy in place to expand its tax net or a improve exports even after being in the power for seven months also inflation will increase due to a hike in gas and electric prices due to the loan deal said shaikhani who is also the head of shaikhani group he noted that the government has to come up with quick solutions and policies as the stock market and currency are under pressure iqbal dawood president of the pakistan business council said the government has no option but to go to the imf for the loan the benefit of going to the imf is that interest rate is low as the government tte government must control its costs and reduce expenditures in addition to managing funds in such a way that the government must not opt for a loan again in the future he said according to fitch solutions public debt currently stands at 71 4 per cent of gdp hence fiscal consolidation will help to stabilise and potentially lower the debt load the imf previously targeted to lower the debt to gdp ratio from 63 9 per cent in 2013 to 60 5 per cent over a period of three years however this was not achieved and the ratio eventually rose to 67 6 per cent in 2016 similar to the previous loan agreement fitch solutions expects the imf will request pakistan to strengthen tax administration broaden the tax base and raise its tax to gdp ratio in addition the reduction in public spending would likely involve further reductions to energy subsidies as the target of reducing the subsidies to 0 4 per cent of gdp under the previous package was not met given that subsidies still stood around 0 9 per cent in 2016 moreover there will also likely be a focus on reducing transfers to provinces so as to better align federal and provincial responsibilities in expenditure fitch believes that structural reforms will be another pillar of the imf deal similar to the reforms under the loan arrangement in 2013 and these will likely focus on the privatisation of loss making public sector entities and measures to improve the local business scene

markets will be on high alert to rba governor philip lowe s wednesday morning speech titled the housing market and the economy we think lowe s speech will cover the key channels by which the current housing downturn can affect the macroeconomy such as 1 reduced residential investment 2 the wealth effect of lower prices on household spending 3 reduced construction related employment 4 lower rents affecting underlying inflation and 5 lower prices weighing on small business investment we think the governor will argue that the wealth effect is limited and that the economy has absorbed the decline in prices to date well it will be interesting to see though whether he concedes that investment is falling at a faster rate than forecast by bank staff and we think this issue will come up in the q a session even if he does not directly address it in his speech if the governor does end up suggesting that the bank is reconsidering its outlook particularly for residential investment and employment

the dramatic health care shift is just one facet of a much broader transformation that a younger increasingly diverse electorate is demanding a transformation leading away from the democrats decades long infatuation with neoliberalism with a similar expansion of support for ideas like a 15 minimum wage debt free college education taxing the wealthy a federal jobs guarantee and a green new deal up until 2016 leading democrats had accepted the basic premises of conservatives the era of big government is over bill clinton famously proclaimed while still claiming continuity with traditions they had largely abandoned typically as exemplified by welfare reform my 2010 critique here means testing would replace universal programs with success defined by reducing costs and the number of people served rather than by improving people s lives clinton s presidency followed a path laid out by charles peters founder and editor of the washington monthly in his influential 1983 essay a neoliberal s manifesto where he put it thus we still believe in liberty and justice for all in mercy for the afflicted and help for the down and out but we no longer automatically favor unions and big government or oppose the military and big business indeed in our search for solutions that work we have to distrust all automatic responses liberal or conservative in short neoliberals argued they shared liberal left values but favored more practical solutions but time has shown them not to be more practical after all as democratic activists and base voters have increasingly come to realize the question in 2020 is how the party as a whole evolves how it honestly comes to terms with its past it s a question that all the presidential hopefuls must grapple with and their supporters as well economic policies like nafta and wall street deregulation represent core neoliberal failures in the economic realm that stretch back long before peters as described by economic historian philip mirowski never let a serious crisis go to waste and colleagues the road from mont pelerin the making of the neoliberal thought collective but the economic vision has profound social consequences as mirowski elsewhere notes while neoliberal think tanks are busy riling up the groundlings with debt clocks and boogeyman statistics of ratios of government expenditure to gdp neoliberal politicians organize to extravagantly increase incarceration and policing of those whom they deem unfit for the marketplace a whole host of such offshoot policies incubated by peters his colleagues and funders mass incarceration school privatization welfare reform etc have likewise been discredited as well with profound impacts on the unfolding 2020 presidential primary race a growing awareness of how these failures are linked and what s required to replace them ought to play a significant part in that race if it does not democrats risk needlessly repeating past failures and handing republicans yet another chance to make things dramatically worse republicans are doing that right now imposing work requirements to roll back medicaid expansion even as new research shows welfare reform had significant negative impacts on children the intergenerational effects of welfare reform on adolescent behaviors were unfavorable particularly for boys and do not support longstanding arguments that limiting cash assistance leads to responsible behavior in the next generation in sharp contrast a recent new york times magazine article documents how much the living wage delivers a living wage is an antidepressant it is a sleep aid a diet a stress reliever it is a contraceptive preventing teenage pregnancy it prevents premature death it shields children from neglect the choice couldn t be more clear between what works and what doesn t but the need to break decisively with past failures poses challenges for potential 2020 candidates as a former chair of the senate judiciary committee joe biden faces a difficult task explaining his key role in helping to expand federal mass incarceration policies just one of several now dormant topics that may play a role in keeping him out of the race so far similarly as former prosecutors sens amy klobuchar and kamala harris perfectly fit the neoliberal formula for combating conservative attacks against soft on crime bleeding heart liberals but that creates significant tension with the growing momentum of criminal justice reformers whose bipartisan appeal is reflected in the recently passed first step act even as democratic aligned activists black lives matter and others push for much more klobuchar and harris aren t alone every potential 2020 candidate has undergone or is undergoing some sort of evolution elizabeth warren was a republican for most of her life for example sen cory booker has strong wall street ties including a long affiliation with the hedge fund group democrats for education reform dfer described by justin miller in 2016 as established with a mission to break the teacher unions stranglehold over the democratic party as miller noted early on dfer identified then senator barack obama and then newark mayor cory booker as promising politicians willing to break with teachers unions dfer was instrumental in convincing obama to appoint charter friendly chicago superintendent arne duncan as secretary of education and it spent a lot of time and money lobbying the administration to pursue reformist education policies like race to the top and common core this style of top down education reform supported by elites in both parties has angered parents students teachers and whole communities across the political spectrum not least because it s served to both help fuel and distract from massive disinvestments in public education this in turn helped fuel last year s wave of red state teacher walkouts which clearly fed into midterm victories this is part of a larger pattern of anti privatization victories described by jeff bryant of the independent media institute booker s record including his past ties to betsy devos could be a problem for him chalkbeat noted sure to draw a skeptical eye from unions and public school advocates my purpose here is not to single out any candidates for their past positions every candidate could be attacked for some aspect of their past which would only serve to make donald trump s day what voters care most about is the future what candidates promise to do and why and the past matters most for making sense of what they say for showing they saw things in the past how they came to change and how they see us all moving forward in the future evolution learning from our past mistakes is good we need to encourage more of it not endlessly get mired down in refighting old battles at the same time we need an honest accounting of the past in order to have confidence in politicians pledges for the future and we also need a much more broadly shared sense of what was wrong in the neoliberal agenda and how that plays out in a multitude of different forms to do that it helps to take a step back from looking at specific issues in order to see more clearly how they all fit together recognizing three main mistakes around neoliberalism can help go a long way toward helping to make sense of the way forward the first mistaken belief about neoliberalism is that there s nothing neo about it it s just plain old fashioned lockean liberalism jonathan chait has made this mistake most loudly how neoliberalism became the left s favorite insult of liberals but mirowski makes it clear how mistaken that is in a nutshell classical liberalism imagined a night watchman state that would set the boundaries for the natural growth of the market like a shepherd tending his flock markets were born not made and they existed to serve human society the neoliberals were having none of that mirowski wrote markets were to be the master far from trying to preserve society against the unintended consequences of the operations of markets neoliberal doctrine instead set out actively to reshape it in the market s image in short neoliberalism is a technocratic perversion of classical liberalism rather than an evolutionary advancement of it a second mistake is to conflate neoliberalism with the mask of economics that it wears neoliberalism or market fetishism is not the consistent application of modern economics but its primitive simplistic perversion as economists suresh naidu dani rodrik and gabriel zucman recently wrote at the boston review their article economics after neoliberalism introduced the work of a new group the economics for inclusive prosperity efip network as they explain the tools of economics are critical to developing a policy framework for what we call inclusive prosperity while prosperity is the traditional concern of economists the inclusive modifier demands both that we consider the whole distribution of outcomes not simply the average the middle class and that we consider human prosperity broadly including non pecuniary sources of well being from health to climate change to political rights to bring things down to earth one of the policy briefs they introduce is an expanded view of government s role in providing social insurance and investing in children by sandra e black and jesse rothstein the summary explains while private provision of goods often yields the efficient outcome there are a number of goods that are not efficiently provided in the private market here we outline two such situations investments in child care and education and insurance against risks created by business cycles poor health and old age because private markets work poorly for these goods and the costs of market failure are large standard economic reasoning implies a significant role for government provision we first discuss childhood investments including expenses relating to child care and early education as well as post secondary education they go on to discuss specific reasons that illuminate why the neoliberal argument for charter schools and other forms of privatization are profoundly flawed not just from an egalitarian justice perspective but in straightforward economic terms as well similar kinds of arguments could surely be made around issues of criminal justice reform as for example the purported rationality of the private prison industrial complex could hardly withstand such an analysis what s more this broader framework of inclusive prosperity not only serves to clarify the arbitrary constricted nature of the neoliberal outlook it fits into an broader framework that elucidates a third mistake failing to distinguish how neoliberalism fits into a larger political context which produces different incarnations as described by new school professor nancy fraser in the article from progressive neoliberalism to trump and beyond which i cited last year fraser speaks in terms of hegemonic blocs a term developed by the italian marxist antonio gramsci which she develops further as involving two aspects the distributive aspect conveys a view about how society should allocate divisible goods especially income this aspect speaks to the economic structure of society and however obliquely to its class divisions the recognition aspect expresses a sense of how society should apportion respect and esteem the moral marks of membership and belonging focused on the status order of society this aspect refers to its status hierarchies progressive neoliberalism might sound self contradictory she notes but it combined an expropriative plutocratic economic program with a liberal meritocratic politics of recognition such that protecting the environment meant carbon trading promoting home ownership meant subprime loans bundled together and resold as mortgage backed securities equality meant meritocracy in contrast progressive populism calls for something different combining egalitarian redistribution with nonhierarchical recognition this option has at least a fighting chance of uniting the whole working class more than that it could position that class understood expansively as the leading force in an alliance that also includes substantial segments of youth the middle class and the professional managerial stratum the two aspects recognition and redistribution can be viewed as more complementary frameworks for developing the full meaning of the inclusive modifier that naidu rodrik and zucman introduced ideally the democrats 2020 primary campaign could and should involve a full throated debate about the best ways to realize the full meaning of inclusive growth including all the non economic dimensions of recognition as well it should flesh out specific aspects of what progressive populism means and how to achieve its goals it should promote sound policies to advance inclusive growth and it should reclaim the once commonsense idea that while the market can be a good servant it makes a terrible tyrannical master
thomas dworzak magnum photos a yellow vest demonstration paris december 2018 driving was already expensive in france when in january 2018 the government of president emmanuel macron imposed a tax that raised the price of diesel fuel by 7 6 centimes per liter and of gasoline by 3 8 centimes about 9 and 4 cents respectively further increases were planned for january 2019 the taxes were an attempt to cut carbon emissions and honor the president s lofty promise to make our planet great again priscillia ludosky then a thirty two year old bank employee from the seine et marne department outside paris had no choice but to drive into the city for work every day and the cost of her commute was mounting when you pay regularly for something it really adds up fast and the increase was enormous she told me recently there are lots of things i don t like but on that i pushed in late may 2018 she created a petition on change org entitled pour une baisse des prix du carburant à la pompe for a reduction of fuel prices at the pump over the summer ludosky s petition which acknowledged the entirely honorable aim of reducing pollution while offering six alternative policy suggestions including subsidizing electric cars and encouraging employers to allow remote work got little attention in the fall she tried again convincing a radio host in seine et marne to interview her if the petition garnered 1 500 signatures she posted that challenge on her facebook page and the signatures arrived in less than twenty four hours a local news site then shared the petition on its own facebook page and it went viral eventually being signed by over 1 2 million people éric drouet a thirty three year old truck driver and anti macron militant also from seine et marne created a facebook event for a nationwide blockade of roads on november 17 to protest the high fuel prices around the same time a fifty one year old self employed hypnotherapist named jacline mouraud recorded herself addressing macron for four minutes and thirty eight seconds and posted the video on facebook you have persecuted drivers since the day you took office she said this will continue for how long mouraud s invective was viewed over six million times and the gilets jaunes the yellow vests named for the high visibility vests that french drivers are required to keep in their cars and to wear in case of emergency were born even in a country where protest is a cherished ritual of public life the violence and vitriol of the gilets jaunes movement have stunned the government almost immediately it outgrew the issue of the carbon taxes and the financial burden on car reliant french people outside major cities in a series of saturday demonstrations that began in mid november and have continued for three months a previously dormant anger has erupted demonstrators have beaten police officers thrown acid in the faces of journalists and threatened the lives of government officials there has been violence on both sides and the european parliament has condemned french authorities for using flash ball guns against protesters maiming and even blinding more than a few in the crowds but the gilets jaunes have a flair for cinematic destruction in late november they damaged parts of the arc de triomphe in paris in early january they commandeered a forklift and rammed through the heavy doors of the ministry of state the only time in the history of the fifth republic that a sitting minister had to be evacuated from a government building the gilets jaunes are more than a protest this is a modern day jacquerie an emotional wildfire stoked in the provinces and directed against paris and most of all the elite french history since 1789 can be seen as a sequence of anti elite movements yet the gilets jaunes have no real precedent unlike the paris commune of 1871 this is a proletarian struggle devoid of utopian aspirations unlike the poujadist movement of the mid 1950s a confederation of shopkeepers likewise opposed to the americanization of a thieving and inhuman state and similarly attracted to anti semitic conspiracy theories the gilets jaunes include shopkeepers seemingly content to destroy shop windows there is an aspect of carnival here a delight in the subversion of norms a deliberate embrace of the grotesque many have said that the gilets jaunes are merely another populist movement although the term is now so broad that it is nearly meaningless comparisons have been made to the britain of brexit the united states of donald trump and especially the italy of cinque stelle but the crucial difference is that the gilets jaunes are apolitical and militantly so they have no official platform no leadership hierarchy and no reliable communications everyone can speak for the movement and yet no one can when a small faction within it fielded a list of candidates for the upcoming european parliamentary elections in may their sharpest opposition came from within to many gilets jaunes the ten who had put their names forward among them a nurse a truck driver and an accountant were traitors to the cause having dared to replicate the elite that the rest of the movement disdains advertisement concessions from the government have had little effect under mounting pressure macron was forced to abandon the carbon tax planned for 2019 in a solemn televised address in mid december he also launched the so called grand débat a three month tour of rural france designed to give him a better grasp of the concerns of ordinary people in some of these sessions macron has endured more than six hours of bitter criticisms from angry provincial mayors but these gestures have quelled neither the protests nor the anger of those who remain in the movement performance is the point during the early acts as the weekly demonstrations are known members refused to meet with french prime minister édouard philippe on the grounds that he would not allow the encounter to be televised and that sentiment has persisted perhaps the most telling thing about the gilets jaunes is the vest they wear a symbol of car ownership but more fundamentally a material demand to be seen inequality in france is less extreme than in the united states and britain but it is increasing among wealthy western countries the postwar french state l état providence is something of a marvel france s health and education systems remain almost entirely free while ranking among the best in the world in 2017 the country s ratio of tax revenue to gross domestic product was 46 2 percent according to statistics from the organization for economic co operation and development oecd the highest redistribution level of any oecd country and a ratio that allows the state to fight poverty through a generous social protection system of that 46 2 percent the french government allocated approximately 28 percent for social services the french social model is so integrated that it almost seems a natural preexisting condition alexis spire a sociologist of inequality at the école des hautes études en sciences sociales told me recently a number of the gilets jaunes i met said that despite the taxes they pay they do not feel they benefit from any social services since they live far from urban centers but anyone who has ever received housing assistance a free prescription or sixteen weeks of paid maternity leave has benefited from the social protection system the effect of redistribution is often invisible and yet the rich in france have gotten much richer between 1983 and 2015 the vast majority of incomes in france rose by less than one percent per year while the richest one percent of the population saw their incomes rise by 100 percent after taxes according to world bank statistics the richest 20 percent now earns nearly five times as much as the bottom 20 percent this represents a stark shift from the trente glorieuses france s thirty year economic boom after world war ii as the economist thomas piketty has pointed out between 1950 and 1983 most french incomes rose steadily by approximately 4 percent per year the nation s top incomes rose by only one percent what has become painfully visible however is the extent of the country s geographical fractures paris has always been the undisputed center of politics culture and commerce but france was once also a country that cherished and protected its vibrant provincial life this was la france profonde a clichéd but genuinely existing france of tranquil stone villages and local boulangeries with lines around the block on sundays douce france cher pays de mon enfance goes the beloved song by the crooner charles trenet mon village au clocher aux maisons sages these days the maisons sages are vacant and the country boulangeries are closed the story is familiar the arrival of large multinational megastores on the outskirts of provincial french towns and cities has threatened and in many cases asphyxiated local businesses 1 in the once bustling centers of towns like avignon agen calais and périgueux there is now an eerie quiet windows are often boarded up and fewer and fewer people are to be found this is the world evoked with a melancholy beauty in nicolas mathieu s novel leurs enfants après eux which won the prix goncourt france s most prestigious literary prize in 2018 the expansion since the 1980s of france s high speed rail network has meant that the country s major cities are all well connected to paris but there are many small towns where the future never arrived where abandoned nineteenth century train stations are now merely places for teenagers to make out monuments of the way things used to be in these towns cars are the only way people can get to work i met a fifty five year old truck and taxi driver named marco pavan in the franche comté in late november what he told me then about how carbon taxes can seem like sneers from the parisian elite has stayed with me ask a parisian for him none of this is an issue because he doesn t need a car pavan said there s no bus or train to take us anywhere we have to have a car i cited that remark in a washington post story i filed from besançon in the online comments section many attacked the movement for what they saw as a backward anti environmentalism missing his point advertisement few have written as extensively as the french geographer christophe guilluy on la france périphérique a term he popularized that refers both to the people and the regions left behind by an increasingly globalized economy since 2010 when he published fractures françaises guilluy has been investigating the myths and realities of what he calls the trompe l oeil of a peaceful moderate and consensual society he is one of a number of left wing french intellectuals among them the novelist michel houellebecq the historian georges bensoussan and the essayist michel onfray who in recent years have argued that their beloved patrie has drifted into inexorable decline a classic critique of the french right since 1789 but guilluy s decline narrative is different he is not as concerned as the others with islamist extremism or decadence broadly conceived for him france s decline is structural the result of having become a place where the social question disappears guilluy born in montreuil in 1964 is something of a rarity among well known french intellectuals he is a product of the paris suburbs not of france s storied grandes écoles and it is clear that much of his critique is personal as a child guilluy whose family then lived in the working class paris neighborhood of belleville was forcibly relocated for a brief period to the heavily immigrant suburb of la courneuve when their building was slated to be demolished in the midst of paris s urban transformation i saw gentrification firsthand he told le figaro in 2017 for the natives the natives being just as much the white worker as the young immigrant what provoked the most problems was not the arrival of magrebis but that of the bobos this has long been guilluy s battle cry and he has focused his intellectual energy on attacking what he sees as the hypocrisy of the bobos or bourgeois bohemians his public debut was a short 2001 column in libération applying that term coined by the columnist david brooks to french social life what was happening in major urban centers across the country he wrote then was a ghettoization by the top of society that excluded people like his own family guilluy crystallized that argument in a 2014 book that won him the ear of the élysée palace and regular appearances on french radio this was la france périphérique comment on a sacrifié les classes populaires in which he contended that since the mid 1980s france s working classes have been pushed out of the major cities to rural communities a situation that was a ticking time bomb partly as a result of rising prices he advanced that view further in 2016 with la crépuscule de la france d en haut now translated into english as twilight of the elites prosperity the periphery and the future of france a pithy screed against france s bobo elite and what he sees as its shameless embrace of a neoliberal americanized society and a hollow feel good creed of multicultural tolerance in 2018 one month before the rise of the gilets jaunes he published no society whose title comes from margaret thatcher s 1987 comment that there is no such thing as society ludovic marin afp getty images french president emmanuel macron meeting with young people as part of the great debate he launched in response to yellow vest protests étang sur arroux france february 2019 in guilluy s view an immigrant working class has taken the place of the native working class in the banlieues on the outskirts of major cities this native class he argues has been scattered throughout the country and become an unnoticed presence that france s elite has made to disappear from public consciousness in order to consolidate its grip on power cities are now the exclusive preserve of the elites and their servants and what guilluy means by no society is that the visible signs of class conflict in urban daily life have vanished this is his trompe l oeil rich insulated parisians have convinced themselves that everything is fine while those who might say otherwise are nowhere near the simmering discontent of rural france has never really been taken seriously he writes in twilight of the elites since november much of the french press has declared that guilluy essentially predicted the rise of the gilets jaunes they seem after all a fulfillment of his prophecy about the betrayal of the people by the elites even if he is always elusive about who exactly the people are while critiques from the movement have remained a confused cloud of social media invective guilluy has served as its de facto interpreter no society puts into words what many in the gilets jaunes have either struggled or refused to articulate this is the hazy middle ground between warning and threat the populist wave coursing through the western world is only the visible part of a soft power emanating from the working classes that will force the elites to rejoin the real movement of society or else to disappear for now however there is just one member of the elite whom the gilets jaunes wish would disappear and calls for his violent overthrow continue even as the movement s momentum subsides an intense and deeply personal hatred of macron is the only unifying cry among the gilets jaunes eighteen months before the uprising began this was the man who captured the world s imagination and who after populist victories in britain and the united states had promised a french third way yet the macronian romance is already over both at home and abroad to some extent the french always turn against their presidents but the anger macron elicits is unique this is less because of any particular policy than because of his demeanor and most of all his language mr macron always refused to respond to us muriel gautherin fifty three a podiatrist who lives in the paris suburbs told me at a december march on the champs élysées it s he who insults us and he who should respond when i asked her what she found most distasteful about the french president her answer was simple his words she has a point among macron s earliest actions as president was to shave five euros off the monthly stipends of france s aide personalisée au logement apl the country s housing assistance program around the same time he slashed france s wealth tax on those with a net worth of at least 1 3 million a holdover from the mitterand era macron came to office with a record of unrelentingly insulting the poor in 2014 when he was france s economic minister he responded to the firing of nine hundred employees most of them women from a breton slaughterhouse by noting that some were mostly illiterate in 2016 he was caught on camera in a heated dispute with a labor activist in the hérault when the activist gestured to macron s 1 600 suit as a symbol of his privilege the minister said the best way to afford a suit is to work in 2018 he told a young unemployed gardener that he could find a new job if he merely crossed the street yet nothing quite compares to the statement macron made in inaugurating station f a startup incubator in the thirteenth arrondissement of paris housed in a converted rail depot it is a cavernous consulate for silicon valley a soaring glass campus open to all those with big ideas who can also pay 195 a month for a desk and can fill out an application in fluent english we won t consider any other language the organization s website says google amazon and microsoft all have offices in it and in a city of terrible coffee the espresso is predictably fabulous in june 2017 macron delivered a speech there a train station he said referring to the structure s origins it s a place where we encounter those who are succeeding and those who are nothing this was the moment when a large percentage of the french public learned that in the eyes of their president they had no value ceux qui ne sont rien is a phrase that has lingered and festered to don the yellow vest is thus to declare not only that one has value but also that one exists on the whole the gilets jaunes are not the poorest members of french society which is not surprising as tocqueville remarked revolutions are fueled not by those who suffer the most but by those whose economic status has been improving and who then experience a sudden and unexpected fall so it seems with the gilets jaunes most live above the poverty line but come from the precarious ranks of the lower middle class a group that aspires to middle class stability and seeks to secure it through palliative consumption certain clothing brands the latest iphone the newest television in mid december le monde profiled a young couple in the movement from sens in north central france identified only as arnaud and jessica both twenty six they and their four children live in a housing project on the 2 700 per month that arnaud earns as a truck driver including more than 1 000 in government assistance according to statistics from france s institut national de la statistique et des études économiques insée this income places them right at the poverty line for a family of this size and possibly even slightly below it but the expenses arnaud and jessica told le monde they struggled to pay included karate lessons for their oldest son and pet supplies for their dog jessica who does not work told le monde children are so mean to each other if they wear lesser brands i don t want their friends to make fun of them she said she had traveled to paris for gilet jaune protests on three separate weekends journeys that presumably cost her money readers of le monde many of them educated affluent and pro macron were quick to attack arnaud and jessica but the sniping missed their point which was that they felt a seemingly inescapable sense of humiliation fearing ridicule everywhere from the élysée palace to their children s school they were explaining something profound about the gilets jaunes the degree to which the movement is fueled by unfulfilled expectations for many demonstrators life is simply not as they believed it would be or as they feel they deserve there is an aspect of entitlement to the gilets jaunes who are also protesting what the french call déclassement the increasing elusiveness of the middle class dream in a society in which economic growth has not kept pace with population increase this entitlement appears to have alienated the gilets jaunes from immigrants and people of color who are largely absent from their ranks and whose condition is often materially worse 2 it s not people who don t have hope anymore who don t have a place to live or who don t have a job rokhaya diallo a french activist for racial equality told me recently describing the movement it s just that status they re trying to preserve the gilets jaunes have no substantive ideas resentment does not an ideology make they remain a combustible vacuum and extremist agitators on the far right and the far left have sought to capitalize on their anger both marine le pen of the recently renamed rassemblement national and jean luc mélenchon of the left wing la france insoumise have tried hard to channel the movement s grassroots energy into their own political parties but the gilets jaunes have so far resisted these entreaties the gilets jaunes also found themselves at the center of a diplomatic spat in early february italy s deputy prime minister luigi di maio met with two of their members on the outskirts of paris in a jab at macron two days later france withdrew its ambassador to rome for the first time since 1940 but the gilets jaunes have not attempted to exploit this attention for their own political gain instead there was infighting a twitter war over who had the right to represent the cause abroad and who did not the intellectual void at the heart of an amorphous movement can easily fill with the hatred of an other that may already be happening to the gilets jaunes although a careful analysis by le monde concluded that race and immigration were not major concerns in the two hundred most frequently shared messages on gilet jaune facebook pages between the beginning of the movement and january 22 a number of gilets jaunes have been recorded on camera making anti semitic gestures insulting a holocaust survivor on the paris metro and saying that journalists work for the jews importantly the gilets jaunes have never collectively denounced any of these anti semitic incidents a silence perhaps inevitable for a movement that eschews organization of any kind likewise a thorough study conducted by the paris based fondation jean jaurès has shown the extent to which conspiracy theories are popular in the movement 59 percent of those surveyed who had participated in a gilet jaune demonstration said they believed that france s political elites were encouraging immigration in order to replace them and 50 percent said they believed in a global zionist conspiracy members of the movement are often quick to point out that the gilets jaunes are not motivated by identity politics and yet anyone who has visited one of their demonstrations is confronted with an undeniable reality far too much attention has been paid to the symbolism of the yellow vests and far too little to the fact that the vast majority of those who wear them are lower middle class whites in what is perhaps the most ethnically diverse society in western europe can the gilets jaunes truly be said to represent the people as the members of the movement often claim priscillia ludosky arguably the first gilet jaune is a black woman it s complicated that question she told me i have no response the gilets jaunes are also distinctly a minority of the french population in a country of 67 million as many as 282 000 have demonstrated on a single day and that figure has consistently fallen with each passing week down to 41 500 during act 14 of the protest on february 16 on two different weekends in november and december other marches in paris one for women s rights the other against climate change drew far bigger crowds than the gilets jaunes did but the concerns of this minority are treated as universal by politicians the press and even the movement s sharpest critics especially after trump and brexit lower middle class and working class whites command public attention even when they have no clear message stephane grangier corbis getty images christophe guilluy paris 2015 french citizens of color have been protesting social inequality for years without receiving any such respect in 2005 the killing of two minority youths by french police in the paris suburb of clichy sous bois ignited a string of violent uprisings against police brutality but the government declared an official state of emergency instead of launching a grand débat in 2009 the overseas departments of guadeloupe and martinique saw a huge strike against the high cost of living a forty four day uprising that also targeted fuel prices and demanded an increase to the minimum wage in 2017 an almost identical protest occurred in french guiana another french overseas department where residents demonstrated against household goods that were as much as 12 percent more expensive than they were in mainland france despite a lower minimum wage the french government was slow to respond in both of these instances while the concerns of the gilets jaunes have resulted in a personal apology from the president and a slew of concessions guilluy whose analysis of la france périphérique ultimately fails to grapple significantly with france s decidedly peripheral overseas territories does not shy away from the question of identity he sees a racial element to the frustrations of la france périphérique but he does not see this as a problem some of the most frustrating moments in his work come when he acknowledges but refuses to interrogate white working class behavior that seems to be racially motivated public housing in outlying communities is now a last resort for workers hoping to be able to go on living near the major cities he writes in twilight of the elites describing the recent astronomic rise in france s urban real estate prices these projects mostly occupied by immigrant renters are avoided by white french born workers barring some utterly unforeseeable turn of events their expulsion from the largest urban centers will be irreversible it would not diminish guilluy s broader point about la france périphérique if he acknowledged that victims of structural changes can also be intolerant guilluy also regularly recycles anxieties over immigration often from controversial theorists such as michèle tribalat who is associated with the idea of le grand remplacement the alleged great replacement of france s white population by immigrants from north and sub saharan africa in making his case about the demographic revolution in process guilluy has been accused of inflating his statistics france he wrote in fractures françaises welcomes a little less than 200 000 legal foreigners every year but these claims were attacked by patrick weil a leading french historian of immigration who noted in his book le sens de la république 2015 that guilluy failed to consider that a large number of those 200 000 are temporary workers students who come and go and others of irregular status guilluy has not responded to these criticisms and in any case his rhetoric has since grown more radical in no society he writes multiculturalism is intrinsically a feeble ideology that divides and weakens whether the gilets jaunes will eventually come to agree with him is a crucial question like guilluy they are responding to real social conditions but if following guilluy s lead they ultimately resort to the language of race and ethnicity to explain their suffering they will have chosen to become a different movement altogether one in which addressing inequality was never quite the point in some ways they have already crossed that line on the afternoon of saturday february 16 the prominent french intellectual alain finkielkraut got out of a taxi on the boulevard montparnasse a crowd of gilets jaunes noticed him and began hurling anti semitic insults the scene recorded on video was chilling in the center of paris under a cloudless sky a mob of visibly angry men surrounded a man they knew to be jewish called him a dirty zionist and told him go back to tel aviv finkielkraut s parents were polish refugees from the holocaust he was born in paris in 1949 and has become a fixture in french cultural life a prolific author a host of a popular weekly broadcast on france culture and a member of the académie française the country s most elite literary institution in the words of macron who immediately responded to the attack he is not only an eminent man of letters but the symbol of what the republic affords us all the irony is that finkielkraut another former leftist who believes that france has plunged into inexorable decline and ignored the dangers of multiculturalism was one of the only parisian intellectuals who had supported the gilets jaunes from the beginning i spoke to finkielkraut after the attack and he explained that the gilets jaunes had seemed to him the evidence of something authentic i saw an invisible france neglected and forgotten he said wearing fluorescent yellow vests in order to be visible of being a somewhere as opposed to an anywhere as goodhart has said seemed to me an absolutely legitimate critique the british journalist david goodhart popular these days in french right wing circles is the author of the road to somewhere 2017 which sees populist anger as the inevitable response to the widening gulf between those rooted in a particular place and cosmopolitans at home anywhere france is not a start up nation finkielkraut told me it can t be reduced to that finkielkraut said that the attack was a sign that the reasonable critiques orginally made by the gilets jaunes had vanished and that they had no real future i think the movement is in the process of degradation it s no longer a social movement but a sect that has closed in on itself whose discourse is no longer rational although the paris prosecutor has opened an investigation into his attackers finkielkraut has not pressed charges he told me that the episode as violent as it was did not necessarily suggest that all those who had worn yellow vests in recent months were anti semites or extremists those who insulted me were not the nurses the shopkeepers or the small business owners he said noting that he doubted he would have experienced the same prejudice at the roundabouts the traffic circles across the country where gilets jaunes protesters gathered every saturday in a sense these were the essence of the movement which was an inchoate mobilization against many things but perhaps none so much as loneliness the roundabouts quickly became impromptu piazzas and a means however small of reclaiming a spirit of community that disappeared long ago in so many french towns and villages in paris where the remaining gilets jaunes have now focused most of their energy the weekly protests have become little more than a despicable theater filled with scenes like the attack on finkielkraut there is no convincing evidence that those still wearing yellow vests are troubled by the presence of bigotry in their ranks what is more many gilets jaunes now seem to believe that pointing out such prejudice is somehow to become part of a government backed conspiracy to turn public opinion against them consider for instance a february 19 communiqué released in response to the attack on finkielkraut from la france en colère one of the movement s main online bulletins for many days the government and its friends in the national media seem to have found a new technique for destabilizing public opinion and discrediting the gilets jaunes movement it begins we denounce the accusations and the manipulations put in place by this government adept at fake news but this is all the communiqué denounces it does not address the anti semitic violence to which finkielkraut was subjected nor does it apologize to a national figure who had defended the movement when few others of his prominence dared to do the same a month after our last conversation i called priscillia ludosky back to see if she had any reaction to the recent turn of events in the movement her petition had launched she was only interested in discussing what she called the french government s systematic abuse to manipulate public opinion she also believes that a government media conspiracy will stop at nothing to smear the cause if there was one person who ever said something homophobic it was on the front page of every newspaper she told me in the days after the attack finkielkraut lamented not so much the grim details of what had happened but the squandered potential of a moment that has increasingly descended into paranoid feverishness as he told me this was a beautiful opportunity to reflect on who we are that s been completely ruined february 21 2019
zimbabwe introduces a new currency for maxi devaluation until february 20th zimbabwe produced a quasi currency it was dubbed a zollar on the 20th the quasi currency became zimbabwe s official currency this new currency is called rtgs dollars and consists of bond notes and rtgs electronic money the rtgs dollars possess legal tender status and will serve as the unit of account for the government s books the official exchange rate for zollar quasi currency had been set at a one to one rate with the u s dollar but now the rtgs dollar will trade at a managed floating exchange rate the rate today is 2 50 per u s dollar not par as it used to be so zimbabwe s official exchange rate has experienced a maxi devaluation of 60 that however is not the end of zimbabwe s exchange rate story zimbabwe imposes a plethora of exchange and capital controls on its citizens under these exchange controls private individuals traders and companies must seek permission from the government to buy sell and hold foreign currencies so neither the old zollar nor the new rtgs dollar is freely convertible into a foreign currency in consequence a black market read free market exists indeed whenever there are exchange controls and restrictions on free convertibility black markets always appear at present the black market rate is 5 75 which represents a considerable premium over the official rate of 2 50 rtgs usd the black market usually yields a premium over the official rate as it does zimbabwe in some cases the premiums can reach staggering levels for example in 1982 ghana s cedi carried a premium of over 2 000 these premiums are known as black market premiums the black market premium indicates among other things the severity of the controls and restrictions a country imposes on its citizens in the case of zimbabwe the official currency devaluation caused the black market premium to shrink from 456 to 130 as the official rate moved from 1 rtgs usd to 2 50 so as of now the markets deem that the introduction of the new currency and the maxi devaluation have reduced the severity of controls that drive a wedge between the official and black market exchange rate moreover since the black market premium on foreign exchange is an implicit tax on exports the reduction in the premium means that the export tax resulting from exchange controls has been reduced the chart below contains 22 countries that have black markets in foreign exchange and for which data are available north korea tops the list with a black market premium of 811 this suggests that controls are severe and that an official devaluation will eventually be in the cards venezuela is at the bottom of the list with an unusual negative black market premium this negative premium suggests that market participants think the bolivar will appreciate relative to the greenback and that individuals are willing to pay a premium to obtain bolivars on the black market prof steve h hanke just why do countries impose restrictions and controls on foreign exchange markets and restrict free convertibility in most cases controls are seen as a way to cool off hot money and conserve official foreign exchange reserves the pedigree of exchange controls can be traced back to plato the father of statism inspired by lycurgus of sparta plato embraced the idea of an inconvertible currency as a means to preserve the autonomy of the state from outside interference so the temptation to turn to exchange controls in the face of disruptions caused by hot money flows is hardly new in the modern era tsar nicholas ii was the first to pioneer limitations on convertibility in 1905 he ordered the state bank of russia to introduce a limited form of exchange control to discourage speculative purchases of foreign exchange the bank did so by refusing to sell foreign exchange except where it could be shown that it was required to buy imported goods otherwise foreign exchange was limited to 50 000 german marks per person the tsar s rationale for exchange controls was that of limiting hot money flows so that foreign reserves and the exchange rate could be maintained as we move to reflect on zimbabwe or any of the other countries in the hanke quarterly black market review we must lift a page from nobel laureate friedrich hayek s 1944 classic the road to serfdom the extent of the control over all life that economic control confers is nowhere better illustrated than in the field of foreign exchanges nothing would at first seem to affect private life less than a state control of the dealings in foreign exchange and most people will regard its introduction with complete indifference yet the experience of most continental countries has taught thoughtful people to regard this step as the decisive advance on the path to totalitarianism and the suppression of individual liberty it is in fact the complete delivery of the individual to the tyranny of the state the final suppression of all means of escape not merely for the rich but for everybody hayek s message about convertibility has regrettably been overlooked by many contemporary economists exchange controls are nothing more than a ring fence within which governments can expropriate their subjects property open exchange and capital markets in fact protect the individual from exactions because governments must reckon with the possibility of capital flight from this it follows that the imposition of exchange controls leads to an instantaneous reduction in the wealth of the country because all assets decline in value to see why it is important to understand how assets are priced the value of any asset is the sum of the expected future installments of income it generates discounted to the present value for example the price of a stock represents the value to the investor now of his share of the company s future cash flows whether issued as dividends or reinvested the present value of future income is calculated using an appropriate interest rate that is adjusted for the various risks that the income may not materialize when convertibility is restricted risk increases because property is held hostage and is subject to a potential ransom through expropriation as a result the risk adjusted interest rate employed to value assets is higher than it would be with full convertibility investors are willing to pay less for each dollar of prospective income and the value of property is less than it would be with full convertibility president emmerson mnangagwa has proclaimed that zimbabwe is open for business this refrain rings hollow in the face of zimbabwe s exchange controls and its new currency the rtgs dollar if zimbabwe wants to be open for business and wants its own sound currency it should adopt a currency board that would make zimbabwe s currency a clone of the u s dollar or some other suitable anchor such as gold a currency board would mandate that exchange controls be thrown in the dustbin free convertibility would reign and so would low inflation rates and higher asset valuations the open for business sign would be the real deal by steve h hanke www cato org people hanke html twitter

more than ever before there seems to be a growing convergence between south africa s main political parties on key foreign policy issues while there is no obvious foreign policy consensus between the anc da and the eff there are more similarities than differences on key issues than perhaps at any other time in our post apartheid history this bodes well for south africa moving forward and suggests that the department of international relations particularly under the current administration has been effective in communicating the rationale behind south africa s current foreign policy minister lindiwe sisulu has said that human rights are at the centre of south africa s foreign policy and similarly da leader musi maimane has said that human rights should guide our foreign policy it is clear in the positions of the eff that it also prioritises a human rights based foreign policy the african union the anc solidly supports the au s agenda 2063 which is a plan to work towards the economic development of the continent regional integration and free trade through the continental free trade agreement the anc would like to see the au fully capacitated to intervene in conflicts on the continent in order to ensure peace and security the anc would like to see the african peer review mechanism strengthened to improve good governance on the continent while the da has called the african union a toothless and pointless organisation in reality the party is supportive of much of what the au is trying to achieve in this sense there does seem to be more convergence than one would expect with the anc in terms of supporting the au s fundamental goals the da supports regional integration the creation of a free trade area and the development of regional infrastructure it also would like to see the aprm strengthened one of the biggest reasons why the da considers the au ineffective is the perception that it hasn t dealt decisively with human rights abuses and poor governance in countries like zimbabwe like the anc the eff supports the african union the process of regional integration and would like to see greatly enhanced intra african trade however the eff would like to see the radical transformation of the au so that it is strengthened and capacitated to effectively intervene in conflicts on the continent the eff would like to see a fully functioning african court and it would like the pan african parliament to have legislative powers the eff has said in its manifesto that it will fight leaders who want to stay in power forever the eff believes that it is important to have political social and economic solidarity among african states it would seem that all three parties would like to see the au succeed in its stated goals and become more effective the international criminal court the anc would like south africa to withdraw from the icc which is a position held by the former zuma administration the anc believes that the icc has been manipulated by western powers and is overly focused on human rights abuses in africa without paying equal attention to such abuses in the rest of the world the anc would like to see a strengthening of the au s capacity to prosecute human rights abuses on the african continent and a fully functioning and effective african court for human and peoples rights the eff does not believe that it is in south africa s interest to withdraw from the icc and would rather like to see a full transformed icc it also does not accept the manipulation of the icc by the big powers and believes that membership of the icc should be compulsory for all states and it should not be voluntary to sign the rome statute it believes that the icc should prosecute former british prime minister tony blair and former us president george bush for their military intervention in iraq the da believes that the icc is a very important international institution to try human rights abuses and crimes against humanity especially given that africa currently does not have the capacity to do so the da recently wrote to the office of the chief prosecutor of the icc to refer the issue of human rights in zimbabwe following the recent abuses by the military and police against civilian protesters and asked the prosecutor to start a preliminary investigation there is more divergence between the parties on the icc given the anc position that south africa should withdraw from the body but there is consensus for the need to try gross violations of human rights with urgency brics the anc is completely supportive of the partnership between brazil russia india china and south africa it believes that brics will increase trade and investment between the emerging economies which will directly benefit south africa the anc is for greater south south cooperation and development and believes that the brics new development bank will provide much needed financing for development particularly for infrastructure development the anc believes that the ndb provides an additional source of financing beyond the traditional international financial institutions such as the world bank and imf which often attach conditionalities to loans the eff is supportive of the brics formation as it would like south africa to build relations with all progressive nations in latin america asia and africa the eff wants to work towards building a world order that is not dominated by the west and it would like to see the end of the global imperialist dominance of the western powers the da believes that the brics partnership is very useful to promote trade between the emerging economies and is of the view that any investment into south africa is beneficial as long as it is correctly used and that south african maintains high standards of good governance the da is currently uncertain about what benefits the new development bank provides for south africa while the da supports strong relations with the brics countries it also maintains that south africa needs to strengthen ties with traditional partners such as the us and uk from where a significant amount of south africa s trade emanates while the da has acknowledged that china has overtaken the us as south africa s largest trading partner in volume it believes that the us is important for south africa s future growth and development there is therefore a general consensus among the three main political parties of the utility of the brics partnership for south africa zimbabwe the anc is strongly in favour of the sanctions currently imposed on zimbabwe being lifted in order to provide relief to the zimbabwean economy the anc is also in favour of south africa providing financial assistance to zimbabwe to assist its development within the realms of what south africa can afford the anc would like south africa to assist wherever it may be asked to in promoting a national dialogue between zimbabweans on the way forward the anc has also expressed concern about human rights abuses in zimbabwe particularly following the latest repression by the security forces against civilian protestors the eff has a very similar position to zimbabwe as that of the anc advocating for the lifting of sanctions the need to assist zimbabwe financially and providing conditional grants to zimbabwean development programs the eff has been the most vocal against the human rights abuses committed by the zimbabwean military and police forces against civilians and has said that the military has no place in dealing with civilian protesters the eff has also condemned president emmerson mnangagwa s shutdown of the internet the eff has been pushing south africa to intervene in zimbabwe and had wanted to call for a three day shutdown in solidarity with the zimbabwean people last year the eff had warned zanu pf against intimidating voters or engaging in vote rigging the da has also pushed south africa to intervene in the situation in zimbabwe and has referred zimbabwe s human rights abuses to the icc the da would also like to see the un human rights council investigating human rights abuses in zimbabwe the da strongly condemned the human rights abuses committed by the zimbabwe authorities against its people and the da leader was intent on carrying out a fact finding mission to zimbabwe in order to meet with president mnangagwa opposition leaders and civil society to date the zimbabwean authorities have not responded positively to the da leader s request on zimbabwe all three political parties are concerned about the political social and economic situation on the ground in zimbabwe and how it impacts on south africa all are advocating measures to ensure a stronger economy so that zimbabwe can again become an economic powerhouse which would strengthen sadc venezuela the anc is strongly against any attempts at regime change in venezuela through unconstitutional means as it will create a more dangerous world order and bring further chaos the anc believes that only venezuelans can determine their own destiny and that there can only be a political solution to the situation that involves dialogue and negotiation while the anc recognises that there is a humanitarian crisis in the country it believes that the maduro government is a victim of a concerted regime change agenda orchestrated by certain western governments and backed by western media houses the eff strongly supports the government of nicolas maduro and believes that the campaign against him is an imperialist one championed by the western powers the eff leader had taken a group of youths to venezuela in 2010 to study venezuela s economic model and returned saying that venezuela was a successful model of nationalisation at the time venezuela had expropriated businesses and investments and imposed stringent price controls and subsidized the prices of basic commodities with the subsequent dramatic fall in oil prices the government was no longer able to subsidize prices pay its debt and it led to severe shortages in the country on venezuela the da claims that it is not in favour of regime change through unconstitutional means and is only in favour of military intervention when it is authorised by the un through chapter vii the da believes that the dire economic situation in the country is what happens when a populist regime takes over and implements expropriation without compensation none of the three political parties is in favour of regime change in venezuela through unconstitutional means including military intervention that is not sanctioned by the un israel palestine the anc believes in a two state solution along the 1967 borders and has strongly criticised israel s continued illegal settlement building in the occupied territories its apartheid policies and its ongoing human rights abuses and repression of the palestinians the anc at its 51st national general conference called for the downgrading of relations with israel with the south african embassy in tel aviv being downgraded from an embassy to a representative office as a sign of protest against the current situation the eff does not believe that a two state solution between israel and palestine is still possible given the extent of land expropriation by israel in the occupied territories the eff believes that israel wants to wipe palestinians off the map and it wants israel to give the palestinians back their land and allow them to exercise the right to self determination the eff is calling for the boycott of israeli products and does not believe there should be an israeli embassy in south africa nor a south african embassy in israel

help enlighten your fellows be sure to pass this on survival depends on it putin s approval rating is high but it has declined over the past year the decline is mainly related to domestic policy apparently the public perceives recent kremlin economic policy as a continuation of the disastrous policies that washington imposed on russia in the 1990s when russia was loaded up with foreign debt while state assets were privatized and plundered by oligarchs sponsored by the west who cashed out by selling the assets to foreigners the approval rating of putin and the government dropped in response to the recent increases in the retirement age and value added tax the former raised concerns about pension security and reminded russians of the collapse of soviet pensions the latter reduced consumer disposable income and lowered consumer demand and the economic growth rate these policies represent austerity imposed on the domestic population instead of on foreign creditors and reflect the neoliberal view that austerity leads to prosperity deeply unpopular austerity measures advised and implemented by the internal neoliberal cliques russia s fifth column all behind the cloak of us imposed sanctions serve to stir up divisions and dissaffection toward putin and the government eventually if the nation is to be saved it must abandon capitalism altogether and embrace socialism once and for all editor russia is experiencing capital outflows due to the russian private sector s repayment of loans to western creditors russia has experienced over 25 billion a year of capital outflows since the early 1990s accumulating to over a trillion dollars this money could have been invested in russia itself to raise the productivity and living standards of its citizens the outflow puts the ruble under pressure and the interest payments draw money out of the country away from russian uses if it were not for these outflows the value of the ruble and russian wages would be higher the us sanctions give russians every reason not to repay their foreign loans yet russians continue to enable their own exploitation by foreigners as neoliberal economists have told them that there is no alternative russia s economic problems are due to the looting of the country during the yeltsin years to the imposition of neoliberal economics by the americans and to financialization as a result of the privatizations russia s stock market became the darling of the west in the mid 1990s as underpriced mining oil and infrastructure were sold for a fraction of their value to foreigners thus transferring russian income streams abroad instead of leaving the income to be invested in russia in effect russians were told that the way for their country to get rich was to let kleptocrats oligarchs and their u s and british stock brokers make hundreds of billions of dollars by privatizing russia s public domain washington took advantage of the gullible and trusting yeltsin government to do as much political and economic damage as possible to russia the country was torn apart historic parts of russia such as ukraine were split off into separate countries washington even insisted that crimea long a part of russia and the country s warm water port be retained by ukraine when the soviet union was dismembered people s savings called the overhang were wiped out with hyperinflation privatization was not accompanied by new investment the economy was not industrialized but financialized the proceeds from privatization were deposited by the russian government in private banks where the money was used to privatize more russian assets the banking system thus served to finance the transfer of ownership not to fund new investment and the proceeds were transferred abroad russia was turned into a financial colony in which proconsuls created wealth at the top today privatization continues in the de facto privatization of public assets such as charging fees for use of federal highways as the russian economic profession has been brainwashed by the americans the country is devoid of economic leadership we have pointed out on more than one occasion that it is nonsensical for russia to indebt itself by borrowing abroad in order to finance investments the russians were sold a bill of goods that the central bank cannot issue rubles unless the rubles are backed by dollars this advice served to prevent russia from using its own central bank to fund public infrastructure and private investment projects by issuing rubles in other words russia might as well not have a central bank money that flows into productive projects that raise output is not inflationary apparently russian economists do not understand that russia does not spend borrowed foreign currencies inside russia if russia takes a foreign loan the borrowed money goes into central bank reserves the central bank then issues the ruble equivalent to be spent on the project and the cost of the project goes up by the pointless interest paid to the foreign lender as far as we can tell the institute of economics of the russian academy of sciences is so brainwashed by neoliberal economics that their minds are closed to correct policies the failure of russian economic leadership imposes far more costs on the russian economy than do washington s sanctions intellectual leadership is weak with many in the intellectual class favoring integration with the west rather than with the east to be part of the west has been an important goal since peter the first and catherine the great and the russian atlanticist integrationists cannot let go of the ancient goal this goal no longer makes sense although putin is a leader and has a sense of russian purpose many officials use their office not in service to russia but in service to their own wealth much of which is held abroad corruption and embezzlement seem to be the purpose of many office holders scandals abound among members of government and reflect badly on putin and medvedev the russian government s popularity was at a peak when the government showed it had the intelligence and will to reincorporate crimea into russia however the russian government hoping to reassure washington and europe refused the requests of the luhansk and donetsk republics to be reincorporated into russia russian nationalists the majority of the population saw this as kowtowing to the west moreover the russian government s decision has resulted in ukraine s ongoing military assault on the breakaway republics and to the arming of ukraine by the west instead of acting decisively the russian government enabled the continuation of conflict that can be exploited by washington the russian people understand this even if the government does not by failing to show firmness the russian government encourages the crony system of oligarchs who want a government that they can use for their narrow interests their interests include participating in the system of western plunder known as globalism these client elites of the west oppose a powerful russian state that could assert itself on the world stage and offer an alternative policy to the west s policy of plunder the influence of this narrow interest group on government policy indicates that the russian government is compromised putin is trying to break free of the west s grip by directing russia s economic orientation to the east his effort is helped by the american sanctions but russia remains sufficiently mired in the western system to be vulnerable to sanctions and is only slowly extracting itself various aspects of russia s difficulties and transformation into a power with a foot in both west and east are discussed by commentators what goes unacknowledged is that russian economic policy is constrained indeed crippled by the neoliberal brainwashing given to russian economists by the americans in the 1990s consequently russia is enfeebled by an economic policy that encourages privatization and foreign ownership and by financialization of economic rents that is of income streams that do not result from productive investment but from such factors as location and rise in value due to public infrastructure development such as a road built across a property in a financialized economy credit is used to transfer property ownership instead of to finance new plant and equipment and construction of infrastructure the russian government and central bank have been blinded to the fact that russian infrastructure projects and private investment are not dependent on borrowing dollars abroad or by acquiring dollars by selling russian assets to foreigners such projects can be financed by ruble creation by the russian central bank money that flows into productive projects that raise output is not inflationary generally speaking such projects lower costs for russia to succeed russia needs an economic re education and a government that finds its footing in russian nationalism and discourages western provocations with firmer responses it is our view that the western world indeed all of life has an interest in a russia too strong to be attacked or provoked as a strong russia is the only way to curtail the western aggression that is leading to nuclear war addendum will no one stop american gangsterism an accurate description of the us orchestrated event today at venezuela s border with colombia was posted on the saker s website 3 days ago most of the world sees this as us gangsterism but no one does anything about it john wight asks does anybody really think that donald trump mike pompeo john bolton elliott abrams care one bit about the welfare of the venezuelan people these are thugs in tailored suits whose views are far closer to al capone than to thomas jefferson president maduro s failure to arrest juan guaido the puppet chosen by washington to be the empire s front man in venezuela might spell the end of venezuelan democracy the venezuelan military will wonder why they are at risk when all maduro has to do is to arrest guaido try the traitor and execute him chavez s lack of decisive action against the elite enemies of venezuelan democracy is now being repeated by maduro this sends the signal of a lack of confidence and it is this lack of confidence that has given birth to the american coup maduro even made the mistake of allowing american and british media to be on the scene of the orchestrated humanitarian aid border crossing to make propaganda films against him bolivia will be next

extreme weather variations and increasingly dire scientific reports have spurred surprisingly robust policy proposals for a green new deal rather admirably the resolution sponsored by sen ed markey d ma and rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny marks a significant break from the usual small ball incrementalist approach to politics adopted in d c reflecting the increasingly prevailing view that the next decade or two is make or break for planet earth the sheer scale of the ambitious proposal net zero greenhouse gas emissions clean air and water married to traditional bread and butter progressive issues such as a job guarantee and universal health care have led to two predictable lines of attack the first is that the program represents full on socialism a grab bag of the left s favorite policies with everything from universal health care to a job guarantee draped under the mantle of environmentalism as a recent new york times opinion piece explains the second issue is how we are going to pay for it given that the proposed green new deal resolution envisages costs that will run into the trillions to undertake this whole restructuring of the u s economy shorn of ideological rhetoric the answer to the second question is actually quite simple we pay for these specific proposals much as we do with any government initiative congress appropriates the funds and the government literally spends the money into existence the key point here is that when a government issues a currency that is not backed by any metal or pegged to another currency i e the currency is created via government order or fiat hence the term fiat currency then there is no reason why it should be constrained in its ability to finance its spending by issuing currency in the way it was say under a gold standard in which the supply of gold held by each nation literally controlled its capacity to spend by extension taxes don t actually fund the government so much as they constrain overall expenditures in the economy in essence government spending adds new money to the economy whereas the imposition of taxes takes some of that money out again the constant addition and subtraction of these spending and taxing activities is how fiscal policy actually works and the sequencing is actually the opposite of what is traditionally taught in most economics textbooks likewise as the monopoly issuer of the currency the u s government via the federal reserve establishes the rates at which we borrow not the market it therefore follows that a sovereign currency issuing government unlike a private company does not have market based costs of capital that set the opportunity cost of their activities this is important to remember when you hear politicians outlining how certain policy goals are somehow constrained by borrowing costs or a particular discount rate this is also why private sector concepts such as internal rates of return irr or return on equity roe are only relevant in macroeconomic policy terms to the extent that the appropriated capital is used as productively as possible to mitigate possible inflationary pressures as opposed to whether this spending ultimately generates a profit or loss for the government to put it another way even if the government s balance sheet is adversely affected by poorly conceived and executed policy choices these mistakes have no bearing on whether the united states as the currency issuer has the fiscal capacity to meet any future crisis in contrast to a private firm which can t afford to misuse its finite capital resources lest cumulative losses drive it out of business as such costs and benefits must be measured largely in social terms rather than financial terms even as we acknowledge that the damage to gdp from the negative effects of climate change can be substantial note that although there is no financial constraint on the ability of a sovereign nation to deficit spend this does not mean that there are no real resource constraints on government spending this is the real concern that should guide policy not financial constraints if government spending pushes the economy beyond full capacity inflation will result a government can create all of the currency it likes but there are finite supplies of natural resources labor and other productive assets that form the backbone of an economy put another way money is not scarce but real resources can be so if government spending does not add to the economy s productive capacity then excessive expenditures will almost certainly become inflationary and that does represent a legitimate constraint that is why the main focus of the green new deal should be on how the money is spent rather than how the program is to be funded so in assessing how appropriated funds under a green new deal are spent the decarbonization of the u s economy must be constructed with a view toward other broad social goals which is why the markey ocasio cortez resolution incorporates so many additional features that at first glance do not deal solely with environmental issues a complaint recently made by speaker nancy pelosi a job guarantee for example must be a germane consideration in contemplating a substantial reduction and ultimately a full on elimination of the fossil fuels industry this not only means the hundreds of thousands of workers actually involved in the extraction production and distribution of oil gas coal etc but also the administrative and support jobs connected to these industries and the communities adversely impacted by the resultant job losses to give some idea of the scale of potential jobs at risk here a recent u s energy and employment report from 2017 estimates that there are about 2 3 million jobs in transmission distribution and storage with approximately 982 000 working in retail trade gasoline stations and fuel dealers and another 830 000 working across utilities and construction it is virtually impossible to contemplate the implementation of a green new deal if it is not accompanied holistically by policies that address the potential job disruption we don t want to have this debate framed yet again within the sterile paradigm of jobs vs environment which is a political non starter the canadian labor congress among others has enumerated a number of possible jobs to which the displaced workers could transition these jobs would include the retrofitting of buildings for energy conservation the retraining of workers to become energy auditors developing renewable energy sources promoting sustainable transport systems supporting community based sustainable industries community revitalization projects moving towards a complete waste recycling program and creating a publicly owned infrastructure that will manage in the public good there s no question that a properly revived manufacturing sector would also lead to a revived working and middle class because as the economist seymour melman explained high skill manufacturing leads to a process of economic growth that gives workers more power economically and within the firm even with mechanization and automation to be sure historically manufacturing has often been associated with dirty industries according to jon rynn a fellow at the cuny institute of urban systems emissions from manufacturing account for about 28 percent of greenhouse gas emissions once the electrical system is renewable however a substantial amount of these emissions is eliminated because almost all industrial machinery uses electricity so if the electricity is clean manufacturing can expand without worsening the climate problem needless to say this will require significant investments in energy efficiency alongside rapid decarbonization of power sources for as much of the economy as possible the broader question of inequality must also be tackled we live in a world where things are interdependent hence the whole concept of a just transition to an environmentally sustainable economy can only be adequately addressed when it is wrapped in a broader set of policies designed to help most americans which raises distributional questions that are part of the broader problem of today s highly unequal economy as the economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman have documented tax data in the united states illustrates that top 0 1 percent now hold 22 percent of the total wealth in the united states the same amount as the bottom 90 percent this takes us back to levels of economic distribution that existed more than 100 years ago when we barely had cars unions were virtually non existent and social welfare provision was minuscule simply believing that creating a whole bunch of clean tech jobs in and of itself will resolve this problem is disingenuous which is why the markey ocasio cortez resolution specifically addresses the broader issue of economic inequality failure to address the inequality question exacerbates the inflationary problem because when increasing amounts of gdp are directed toward those with the highest savings propensities i e the 1 percent it means that the economy doesn t grow as efficiently this matters when we are addressing a genuine national emergency such as climate change as opposed to the faux national emergency related to trump s southern border wall the scale of the spending shouldn t scare people at 2 trillion a year that s around 10 percent of a 20 trillion economy put another way the american government has spent greater sums in its afghanistan and iraq wars with no lasting productive benefit accruing to the u s economy to say nothing of the social costs and global environmental degradation by way of comparison as jon rynn writes the federal government paid for most of the machinery used to create the military equipment during world war ii and the corporations bought the factories for pennies on the dollar after the war ended to put it another way the federal government did not record a profit on the sale of these assets but the return came in the form of much of the industrial machinery that was the basis for the shared prosperity of the post wwii boom a period of unparalleled shared prosperity emphasis added for the united states we have to make choices but the idea that we can t make the right choices based on funding concerns is ridiculous however the policy goal embodied in the green new deal must be part of a broader policy framework much as franklin delano roosevelt ultimately conceived of his economic bill of rights which featured a government funded health care provision as an extension of the original new deal after all the green new deal is as much about enhancing human capital that is increasing the wealth generating capability of people as it is about physical capital the machinery and systems that are physical in nature speaking about one without the other is as misconceived as speaking about a tree outside the context of the forest in which it grows remember that the next time someone dismisses the green new deal as a grab bag of policies designed to ensure a communist style capture of the commanding heights of the economy

acquisition of all outstanding shares of chevron canada r m ulc the chevron acquisition closed on october 1 2017 collectively the acquisitions the increase in full year adjusted ebitda and net earnings was driven by full year contributions from the acquisitions in addition to the factors outlined above see section 3 of the management s discussion and analysis for further discussion fourth quarter fuel and petroleum product volume was 4 4 billion litres relatively flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 q4 2017 on a full year basis fuel and petroleum product volume was 17 0 billion

filld s mobile fuelling service to consumers across canada starting in vancouver british columbia parkland co led a 15 million investment into series b preferred shares in the capital of filld in october 2018 as part of parkland s investment parkland will be the exclusive supplier of fuel to filld in canada retail highlights fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 78 million a decrease of 16 million relative to q4 2017 due to very strong comparable gasoline and diesel margins in q4 2017 and softer fourth quarter 2018 margins in some markets our underlying retail business is performing well with consistent execution in the field resulting in strong key performance indicators full year adjusted ebitda was 316 million an increase of 85 million relative to 2017 primarily due to the acquisitions fourth quarter company c store sssg was 10 3 our 12th consecutive quarter of positive company c store sssg while full year company c store sssg was 7 6 growth was attributable to the successful implementation of the new on the run marché express flagship and retrofit store concepts the successful roll out of parkland s proprietary private label brand 59th street food co and continued backcourt convenience store optimization that resulted in higher forecourt to backcourt conversion rates fourth quarter company volume sssg was 3 5 while full year company volume sssg was 0 7 the increases were primarily due to strategic efforts to increase same store volume at company sites we retrofitted 78 existing on the run marché express locations and constructed twelve flagship locations in 2018 our development initiatives will see the brand rolled out across our canadian network in the coming years in 2018 we expanded our private label brand 59th street food co and are now offering 20 products at select parkland locations we are planning to launch an additional 20 private label products in 2019 in addition we are currently testing our journie loyalty program in two

adjusted ebitda was 93 million an increase of 23 million relative to 2017 primarily due to the acquisitions and strong first half 2018 propane organic growth and customer wins fourth quarter fuel and petroleum product volume decreased 4 relative to q4 2017 primarily due to softer volumes in western canada this was partially offset by a 4 decrease in operating costs as parkland continues to maintain a strong emphasis on cost management ongoing optimization of our commercial brand portfolio in various geographies has seen certain legacy operations particularly in eastern canada successfully rebranded to ultramar this enables parkland to drive future growth and sustained profitability under one aligned customer value proposition supply highlights fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 199 million an increase of 105 million relative to q4 2017 these exceptional results were primarily driven by profitable supply sourcing initiatives improved supply economics continued efforts in executing parkland s supply advantage strategy and strong refining crack spreads due to the rapid price decrease of both crude feedstock and refined products in the fourth quarter parkland also realized a 49 million benefit from its working capital funding agreement at the burnaby refinery which flows through cost of purchases on a full year basis this benefit totalled 20 million full year adjusted ebitda of 561 million an increase of 401 million relative to 2017 the increase was driven by full year contributions from the acquisitions and the factors outlined above refinery utilization which measures the amount of crude oil processed and converted to products in the burnaby refinery was 87 8 for the fourth quarter compared to 94 4 for q4 2017 the burnaby refinery processed intermediary products and bio fuels such as canola and tallow which are not reflected in crude throughput and therefore not included in refinery utilization parkland usa highlights completed three acquisitions in 2018 the largest of which was the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of rhinehart oil co llc and its affiliates the rhinehart acquisition the rhinehart acquisition closed on august 27 2018 and added 10 distribution facilities 9 retail sites and 4 cardlock facilities across utah colorado wyoming and new mexico fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 11 million an increase of 7 million relative to q4 2017 full year adjusted ebitda was 28 million an increase of 12 million relative to 2017 the increases are primarily due to the rhinehart acquisition and parkland s continued focus on its strategy to drive new business grow organically and manage costs fuel and petroleum product volume increased 92 million litres in the fourth quarter and 119 million litres on a full year basis relative to q4 2017 and full year 2017 respectively the increase was primarily due to the rhinehart acquisition and organic growth initiatives subsequent to the quarter parkland opened a houston office that will support its growing supply and trading business in the u s and caribbean markets parkland will continue to look for acquisition opportunities in the u s including tuck in opportunities in and around its existing regional operations centers and new regional operations centers in areas where we can establish a supply advantage corporate segment highlights marketing general and administrative expenses were 32 million in the fourth quarter and 111 million on a full year basis as expected these expenses increased primarily due to additional corporate costs to support the larger integrated business and execute future growth strategies in particular additional costs were incurred for technological innovation initiatives and employee costs

the world trade organisation is in the spotlight as hard brexiteers advocate leaving the european union without a deal on wto terms a phrase that is supposed to sound reassuring but regardless of what sort of trade relationship with europe we eventually settle into we should all take a keen interest in how much protection this institution really provides if our departure from the eu is as hard as some hope we will know soon enough if it is softer then the brexiteers will grumble about vassalage submitting to european rules we no longer help to write and continue to agitate for dealing with the continent on wto terms and the way politics is drifting they could very well sooner or later succeed but what exactly is the world trade organisation it is based in geneva but where did it come from what security can it really give and what lies ahead for an institution that an avowedly america first us president is through a mix of his public diatribes and stealthy black ops working to undermine and how worried should we be the road to geneva with or without brexit the wto matters because of its role in regulating international trade for two centuries since david ricardo spelt out the underlying rationale the case for countries to trade with one another has been crystal clear it works to their mutual advantage leaving both sides better off overall just as fundamentally international competition drives industries to become more productive despite the overall gains though trade can create losers such as lower skilled workers in more advanced economies as well as winners which is why it so often runs up against protectionist pressures and although history testifies to the benefits of free trade it also records the frequent misuse of trade policy by governments pursuing their strategic national interests or offering a sop to domestic producer lobbies the appellate body is the cornerstone of the system but the us is vetoing the appointment of judges it could soon cease to exist the prospect of wto terms was spelt out recently an 8 per cent knock to projected gdp in 15 years time there are past eras that support the sanguine view that institutions and policies are in the end less important than the sheer logic of trade and the power of technology take the first globalisation of the late 19th and early 20th centuries britain may have been open in these years but america and much of the european continent were increasingly protectionist but that didn t matter much when steamships were replacing sailing vessels and railways were opening up frontiers in the new world tumbling shipping costs stimulated trade growth of over 3 per cent a year in the four decades before the first world war in this era of digital technology which is also cutting trading costs maybe things will turn out fine but set against the optimistic perspective of the victorian world is the chilling experience of the interwar period which shows how economic nationalism truly can destroy both trade and growth the imposition of higher tariffs by america in the smoot hawley act of 1930 prompted retaliation by other countries it contributed to a ruinous downward spiral in both trade and gdp during the great depression the value of us imports from and exports to europe fell by around two thirds between 1929 and 1932 it was that dismal chapter that prompted the original post war drive to liberalise trade and to underpin it through a multilateral agreement a drive that culminated in the creation of the wto in 1995 at the same time as the world bank and the international monetary fund were being set up in the 1940s western nations had hoped to create the international trade organisation covering foreign investments and labour standards as well as merchandise trade but this plan foundered perhaps tellingly for our present moment on opposition in the us congress that setback however did not thwart the impetus to boost global trade by lowering tariffs in a series of eight trade negotiations starting in 1947 whose outcomes were codified in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt customs duties on industrial products fell drastically from an average of 22 per cent for the us western europe and japan to less than 4 per cent by 2000 the number of countries participating in the gatt which developed a rudimentary institutional capacity with a secretariat and director general the first one was british rose from 23 at the outset to over a hundred the eighth negotiation called the uruguay round because it was launched at punta del este in 1986 and wrapped up in marrakesh in 1994 was a step change in ambition for one thing it wasn t only about industry for the first time agriculture was tackled in a meaningful way through a plan to eliminate quotas on farm products textiles too were to be freed from import constraints the emphasis on goods was now supplemented by two new trade agreements covering services gats and intellectual property such as copyright and patents trips last but not least the uruguay round also created the wto to administer these two new agreements as well as the gatt the wto inherited the language of post war trade liberalisation using the formulation most favoured nation what that seemingly contradictory term actually means is that countries must not discriminate between their trading partners grant one a lower customs duty on a product and you must offer the same to all other member states it doesn t make for a natural rallying cry but that is the logic that underpins any multilateral system there are two prime exceptions groups of countries that have forged free trade agreements or closer ties such as the eu s customs union which can levy tariffs on outsiders that they don t apply to each other and developing economies which can be given especially favourable access to markets a second core doctrine was that of national treatment once foreign goods have been admitted they should be treated the same as domestic products again this may sound prosaic but without this rule internal taxes and regulations could be devised purely to advantage home producers this was therefore a precondition of the creation of an integrated global economy the wto represented continuity but the hope was that with its wider responsibilities and its status as a permanent institution it could go far beyond the gatt s traditional focus on tariff cuts for merchandise trade the new outfit broke the old unofficial rule that reserved the top jobs at the imf and world bank for europeans and americans respectively as early as 1999 the wto s director general hailed from new zealand and its current head roberto azevêdo is from brazil and in one crucial role that of resolving trade disputes the wto really did have more teeth than its predecessor under the gatt any member state could veto a ruling even if it was itself the offending party there was no meaningfully independent trade court but under the wto the tables were turned a ruling could be blocked only if all countries voted against it in theory that was a huge difference but in practice the wto remained an intergovernmental body generally operating through consensus between the member states when it comes to writing the rules as opposed to enforcing them everyone still had a veto unlike the imf for example the wto does not have an executive board the highest decision making body is the ministerial conference of all the member countries usually held every two years similarly the council that operates between those meetings is made up of members national representatives and even in settling trade disputes where the wto does have some autonomy its locus is limited to the member states unlike in the eu individuals and businesses cannot bring cases a state found in the wrong does not have to pay a fine but must instead promise to put an end to the violation it s as though a court could extract nothing more from a criminal than a promise to do better despite these in built weaknesses the wto was born amid high hopes and in the middle of an exceptional boom in global trade reflecting the integration of china into the world economy and also that of the countries emerging from the break up of the soviet union cross border commerce was thriving as never before in the post war era as a whole trade grew at one and a half times the rate of expansion in global gdp in the two decades running up to the financial crisis of 2008 though it expanded at fully double the rate of world growth to many politicians it all seemed permanent and irreversible new labour s peter mandelson for example would mock those who queried globalisation by saying they wanted to stop the world and get off but long before brexit and trump revealed that many voters did indeed want to get off and long before even the crash the breakneck pace of globalisation was running into some discontent the anti globalisation movement was born in late 1999 in seattle where the wto held its third ministerial conference talks about a new trade round collapsed amid the dramatic protests for which the event is now remembered despite this early warning the wto retained a spring in its step in the late 1990s further agreements among many member states were reached on it telecoms and financial services the attacks of 11th september 2001 provided a brief spur to a new trade round as america sought to link collective security and shared prosperity those negotiations launched in doha in late 2001 were focused on how liberalisation could help poorer countries mike moore the wto s director general styled the new round the doha development agenda in another boost china joined but it did not take long for the doha round to run into trouble in 2005 an exasperated pascal lamy who had become the wto s director general that year waved a wand at a ministerial conference in hong kong to make the point that he could not conjure a breakthrough in stalled negotiations by 2008 the doha round was dead in all but name though it was not until december 2015 that the final rites were read and today almost a quarter of a century old the wto has only one noteworthy multilateral agreement to its name a deal to smooth customs procedures for the movement of goods across borders which came into force in 2017 this sought to speed the transit of goods and though a step forward it certainly does not avoid the need for border controls still less does it offer any solution to the brexit irish border conundrum in 2015 the wto scored another success when its it agreement was extended to cover new products such as gps navigation systems but overall its record has been blighted by the failure of the doha round the difficulties the wto has faced in negotiating further liberalisation in part reflects the growing heft of emerging economies previous trade rounds might have been called international but it was the quad the us the eu japan and canada that called the shots but now china brazil and india have more clout there are more power blocs to co ordinate but nobody certainly not the wto with the power to broker a deal between them and make it stick even before trump stealthy protectionism was making a comeback trade was slowing prior to 2008 and over the past few years it has sagged at times growing even more sluggishly than anaemic global gdp a bounce back in 2017 has tapered away and with the chinese economy slowing and trump s trade aggressions already hurting the outlook is far from bright the wto s problem is not reach it has 164 members with 22 countries seeking to join rather its problem is one of clout and the culture of the times the increasingly unilateral actions of washington picking fights with china the obsession with eliminating bilateral trade deficits are making a mockery of the multilateral order that the wto is supposed to uphold at the g20 summit late last year in buenos aires trump s animosity to the wto bore fruit he assented reluctantly to some warm words about a rules based international order but only in return for other leaders signing up to an unspecified and ominous necessary reform of the wto to improve its functioning the aim is to spell out what the reform might mean by june when the next g20 summit takes place in osaka but more sinister than the public grandstanding is the quiet undermining of the ability of the wto to discharge what it describes as its main function to ensure that trade flows as smoothly predictably and freely as possible the us which in the distant days of the uruguay round had pushed for a wto with the teeth required to settle trade disputes could very soon render it impotent panels of independent arbiters do the day to day sorting out of trade quarrels but states can appeal against their rulings to the appellate body though it sounds as obscure as dickens s circumlocution office the appellate body is in effect the wto s appeal court described by the jacques delors institute as the cornerstone of international trade regulation any stone though can be dislodged with enough determination since trump took office the us has been vetoing any replacements to this seven strong body from which a minimum of three must be fielded to hear a case there are only three judges left and when two more depart in december as their terms of office expire it will cease to exist any panel ruling could then be stymied simply by appealing it in effect the us would have wound the clock back to the gatt before 1995 if and when this happens then taken together with the wto s failure to broker a trade round the purpose of the organisation could come into question today s reality is that when trade is liberalised it is through bespoke arrangements between willing partners not by across the board multilateral negotiations in this new world it could soon become hard to remember what the point of the wto is rhetorically brexiteers shelter behind the imagined protection of the wto but perhaps in their hearts even they know this will not count for much they have made a battle cry of striking nation to nation deals with fast growing emerging markets even if we indulge their delusion that britain s bargaining clout will increase once it is outside the eu this is a revealing ambition it speaks volumes about the lost multilateral dream and by extension about the folly of seeking to head out into a cold world on wto terms the grim prospects of what trading with the eu on wto terms alone would mean was spelt out by a recent government estimate an 8 per cent loss of gdp in 15 years time compared with the trajectory if the country remained in the eu after all in a december speech delivered in washington alan wolff one of the wto s deputy director generals confessed that he found these prospective costs disquieting from the viewpoint of what it says about the multilateral trading system but he did not dismiss them even the wto itself then seems to harbour doubts about how much fall back protection it can really offer for a major economy leaving an integrated regional bloc the underlying problem for the wto is the blurring of trade policy and strategic rivalry between great powers though trump and china s leader xi jinping appear to be sparring only over trade in reality we are witnessing america contesting the rise of a rival superpower the american alarm is more about beijing s growing technological prowess than the bilateral trade balance once again there is nothing new about this britain imposed navigation acts in the 17th century to curb dutch power napoleon s continental system aimed to bring britain to its knees by blocking access to european markets america for its part has never shied away from trying to use trade sanctions to influence countries going back to colonial boycotts on britain before independence and thomas jefferson s embargo on trade with both britain and france during the napoleonic wars even with the best will in the world a technocratic body like the wto is always going to struggle to deal with brute political power play and right now it is operating in anything but a good will environment the many useful things that this inherently feeble body can usefully achieve are slipping beyond its reach because it is as strong or as frail as its most powerful members above all america want it to be
exporters are quick to finger baht appreciation whenever shipments sag but studies reveal that the global economy and demand from trading partners have a much larger effect cranes and containers sit at laem chabang port photo by pattarapong chatpattarasill despite some relief from de escalating tensions over the sino us trade spat continued export contraction and currency appreciation remain a double whammy for shipment oriented thailand with exporters blaming the strengthening baht as a culprit for dismal numbers an abrupt currency appreciation can weaken the country s price competitiveness and reduce export revenue in baht terms though it lowers import costs of raw materials and keeps consumer cost of living stable especially when there is an increase in global energy prices blaming foreign exchange movements for lower outbound shipment value is a regular knee jerk response in thailand whenever exports contract or grow at a slower pace but external demand and protectionist trade policies could bear more responsibility for slowing thai shipments lower demand thailand is an export oriented economy with shipments accounting for around 70 of gdp the country mainly exports manufactured goods comprising 86 of total shipments with electronics machinery and equipment and foodstuffs among the most important products agricultural goods mainly rice and rubber account for 8 of total shipments as an economy dependent on exports thailand felt the tremors when the us announced punitive tariffs on chinese imports as an attempt to make america great again us president donald trump had originally warned he would escalate the tariffs he has imposed on us 200 billion worth of chinese imports from 10 to 25 if the two sides failed to reach a deal by march 2 but there was a sudden change of tone as he raised the possibility of extending that deadline if negotiators were nearing an agreement previous tariffs the us imposed on chinese imports worth 250 billion had an indirect effect on thai shipments reflected in a contraction of computers equipment and components exports to china of 17 1 year on year from july to november 2018 after expanding positively throughout most of 2018 customs cleared exports fell for a third straight month in january contracting by 5 7 year on year exports to other markets shrank especially those closely related to chinese supply chains such as hong kong and taiwan furthermore exports of numerous products to china dropped in response to china s trade slowdown aat pisanwanich director of the center for international trade studies at the university of the thai chamber of commerce utcc said thailand s exports are expected to see the lowest growth in three years because of the sino us trade row a global economic slowdown and the strengthening baht the utcc s latest study puts export growth this year at 4 4 to 263 billion 8 24 trillion baht the lowest rate in three years thailand reported export growth of 6 7 to 252 billion in 2018 while in 2017 growth was 9 9 to 236 billion the estimates for this year assume the baht averages 32 to the us dollar with global gdp growth of 3 5 dubai crude oil prices of 60 per barrel no further tariff restrictions between china and the us and a marginal impact from brexit jitipol puksamatanan chief markets strategist at krungthai bank said foreign exchange dynamics are a normal occurrence and baht appreciation produces only a short term effect on export value non value added exports such as farm products have reeled from foreign exchange movement but value added exports have not seen much effect as companies have hedged against foreign exchange fluctuation mr jitipol said brexit uncertainty and china s lower imports stemming from trade disputes have a greater effect on thai exports than the baht s value he said even if the baht s value depreciates by 10 trading partners will not buy our products as there has been a hiccup in imports because of protectionist trade policy mr jitipol said real effective rate the global economy and demand from thailand s trading partners have had a larger impact on outbound shipments than the strengthening baht with exports in january contracting at a faster pace than the baht s gain said somprawin manprasert executive vice president of bank of ayudhya the baht rose nearly 3 5 against the us dollar in january from the end of last year while the country s customs cleared merchandise shipments shrank 5 7 year on year other regional currencies have also appreciated but the baht s gain is at a faster pace mr somprawin said he referred to a bank of thailand study on elasticity of exports and foreign exchange movement suggesting that trading partners economies have a greater effect on thai exports than the baht s value the study found that the correlation between the baht s real effective exchange rate reer and export volume has subsided in recent years as thailand s participation in the global value chain has reduced exchange rate effects on export volume while local businesses have moved to enhance value added products sharpening their competitive edge local currencies are also increasingly used for trade settlement according to the bank of thailand s monetary policy report published in june 2018 estimated results on the relationship between export volume and the baht s reer between 2008 and 2017 showed that the appreciation of reer reduced export volume in line with theories yet the elasticity of exports to exchange rate movements was lower over time suggesting a weaker link between the reer and export volume a 1 appreciation of the reer in the past would reduce export volume by 0 6 however elasticity has decreased to around 0 3 and becomes statistically insignificant during the past two years the report said moreover exchange rates have much less impact on export volume than income related factors regarding the relationship between exchange rates and export prices a 1 strengthening of the baht against the us dollar is found to increase export prices in us dollar terms by only 0 3 on average this result suggests limited ability to pass on costs of baht appreciation to export prices in order to maintain revenue in baht terms the report said the dollar s retreat against major global currencies is the main cause of currency appreciation among several asian nations while tourism income which is a factor pushing up thailand s current account surplus makes the baht gain at a faster pace than other regional currencies mr somprawin said as a representative of the manufacturing sector supant mongkolsuthree chairman of the federation of thai industries said business operators are concerned about the strengthening baht putting pressure on the country s trade competitiveness we fear that currency appreciation could reach 30 baht to the dollar from an average of 31 now he said if the baht gains more without any relief measures it will affect the competitiveness of thai exporters and tourism operators grim outlook although the us has shelved its plan to increase import duties on chinese goods from 10 to 25 on march 1 not many positive signs in the way of robust export growth are on the horizon this year thailand s exports in 2019 will face downside risk factors including a slowdown in global demand low commodity prices because of oversupply the baht s appreciation and ongoing trade disputes said pimchanok vonkorpon director general of the trade policy and strategy office the export contraction is expected to extend into february and persist through the first quarter given prevalent external risks and a high base effect said don nakornthab senior director of the economic and policy department at the bank of thailand in december the central bank slashed its forecast for payment based 2019 export growth to 3 8 from 4 3 predicted in september and lowered its economic growth forecast for the year to 4 from 4 2 the central bank s monetary policy committee is scheduled to review its economic growth forecast at the upcoming meeting on march 20 siam commercial bank s economic intelligence center eic is even more pessimistic the research house forecasts this year s exports to expand by 3 4 far below the full year expansion of 6 7 in 2018 slower global trade pressure from falling crude prices and uncertainty about the sino us trade spat are factors keeping a lid on higher shipment growth according to the eic despite numerous headwinds kasikorn research center k research is maintaining its export growth forecast for 2019 of 4 5 within a range of 2 6 though it projected a 4 8 year on year contraction in the first quarter because of a high base effect in last year s corresponding period export growth is expected to pick up during the final three quarters partly because us china trade tensions have shown signs of improvement according to k research this may help ease the impacts of the trade war somewhat though close attention must be paid to the sluggish chinese and euro zone economies as well as low commodity prices because they will likely affect thai export performance over the long term the think tank said

undervalued the yuan or renminbi rmb is not freely convertible and the government limits its movement against the us dollar to a two percent range on either side of a central parity rate which the people s bank of china sets each day to reflect market trends that managed float system limits volatility the currency has remained confined in the last five years between 6 2 and 6 8 yuan to the dollar a historically high level compared to 8 28 fixed rate in the 2000s while the rmb strengthened 6 3 percent in 2017 it depreciated by 5 7 percent last year falling to its lowest level in a decade which was enough to spur speculation beijing was putting its foot on the currency scale again but the international monetary fund has said the rmb is not undervalued and in a july report said it was broadly stable against the basket of currencies and broadly in line with fundamentals even the us treasury has regularly acknowledged in a semi annual report most recently in october that beijing is not manipulating its currency beijing however shook the markets in august 2015 with a one time devaluation that weakened the yuan by about five percent in a week the decision led to massive capital flight out of china which exacerbated the currency s decline outflows amounted to nearly 650 billion in 2016 can beijing control the currency the pboc actively intervened in currency markets in 2015 2016 to counteract this depreciation using its massive foreign reserves to buy yuan capital flight slowed as the rmb stabilized analysts say more recent weakening of rmb is not due to manipulation but is the result of china s economic slowdown the trade war and rising us interest rates that push up the value of the dollar against all currencies as investors search for higher yields but amid renewed optimism on the progress of trade negotiations with washington the yuan has rebounded by almost three percent since early january china certainly can use its colossal foreign reserves 3 1 trillion at the end of january to intervene if it chooses to prop up the rmb and after the experience in 2015 and 2016 anxious to halt the yuan s plummet the pboc had drastically tightened capital controls to keep funds from flooding out of the country does china want a weak yuan a weakened yuan makes chinese exports cheaper and more competitive and can therefore partly offset the impact of us tariffs but

people want jobs elected officials want what is best for their districts employers want to lower their costs these are all good intentions but aligning them can be difficult amazon and new york city recently learned this lesson the hard way governments around the world use economic development incentives to encourage new investment internationally ireland has been a leading applicant of this strategy within the united states incentives are frequently employed at the state and local levels the inducements offered can include reduced taxes subsidized or no cost lending provision of land building new infrastructure and exemptions to zoning or environmental requirements the incentives make intuitive sense the locality gets new jobs both directly from the employer s investment and indirectly as new shops are opened to support the new residents employers improve their profits though the cost reduction of local grants on a small scale economic opportunity zones and tax increment financing districts help direct new investment to areas with the most need and have proven effective in attracting entrepreneurs because the success stories are small and local from salons to brewpubs to boutiques they rarely receive national attention as they grow larger incentive programs become risky major projects compete across regions to find better deals the more jobs that are promised the greater the temptation is to boost incentives these competitions become a race to the bottom with ever larger offers straining return on investment calculations successful bidders often suffer a winner s curse the entity that paid most generously has probably overpaid this is what the residents of new york city became concerned about amazon conducted a broad search for its second headquarters expanding beyond its native seattle more than 200 cities and regions submitted proposals confidentially including incentive offers amazon split its decision choosing two winners new york and arlington virginia the celebration in gotham was short lived opposition began mounting almost immediately after the decision was announced congestion was one issue new york has little open space for large scale developments long island city the neighborhood that would have hosted amazon suffers from full trains and full sewers labor leaders organized protests against the company over its alleged mistreatment of workers critics were also outraged at the offer of 3 billion in incentives to a company that earned 11 2 billion last year and reportedly paid no income tax on that sum further growth has other costs as more jobs are created communities will need to plat new housing tracts expand infrastructure and staff new schools while every new job has a multiplier effect new residents need grocery stores restaurants and household services which generate sales taxes the risk is that some of the costs of growth will not be covered and that public budgets will be worse off the risk of excess is playing out in foxconn s facility in southeastern wisconsin the region offered a total of 4 billion in incentives for a factory that promised 13 000 manufacturing jobs a cost of more than 300 000 per job now foxconn is hedging its local development outlook wisconsin s hope spurring a new cluster of technology employers remains an aspiration on this topic economic consensus is clear economic development initiatives rarely pay off they are characterized as an enduring scam worse than useless and a drag on the nation even past grants to build amazon warehouses failed to improve local employment for its part amazon did not weigh proposals solely by incentive values other cities presented a bevy of generous offers the virginia bid contained a relatively low 550 million in job creation grants plus an additional pledge of 1 billion to support local education this illustrates that incentives are helpful but not sufficient employers are attracted to regions that offer the right mix of affordability physical capacity labor and infrastructure in the face of the growing public outcry amazon surprisingly withdrew its commitment to new york the company will move on without much fuss even without a second headquarters amazon has offices in 17 u s cities all of which would welcome new jobs that were meant for new york for long island city the cancellation should not be cause for cheer having lost the chance to attract a major corporate name local officials will now be pressed to describe how they intend to generate the kind of economic activity that amazon had promised to provide the promises of redeveloping dated industrial areas in new york s bid to amazon were compelling but this episode may stop other potential employers from considering expansion into any of the five boroughs while some observers may have been uncomfortable with the appearance that the rich were getting richer amazon s departure may leave the poor poorer a city that clings to a principle of never offering grants may risk losing incremental business to its neighbors legislators are working to address this risk with several states considering a pact to stop competing for employers but such a truce would continue the prisoner s dilemma as defectors would be rewarded and states that don t sign would continue to attract new investments the amazon situation illustrates the difficulty that arises when trying to balance growing the economy and ensuring that growth is equitably shared worrying about slicing the pie before it is fully baked can lead to the cancellation of dessert this is a conundrum that will be faced by congress as reformers seek to change the terms of fiscal debate as new yorkers learned getting the ingredients right and keeping the debate at the proper temperature will not be easy to do substantial progress last weekend president trump announced his decision to delay tariff increases from 10 to 25 on 200 billion of chinese goods that were scheduled to come into effect starting today the move came amid optimism that the sides would eventually reach a deal the u s administration is of the view that substantial progress has been made on important structural issues including intellectual property protection technology transfer agriculture services currency and many other issues chinese equity markets rallied powerfully on the news this is welcome progress toward de escalation of trade tensions but some tension remains existing tariffs will stay in place at least until a trade agreement is reached between the two sides and they are introducing discomfort for both countries among the many open issues further discussions will be required to address the chinese government s subsidies to domestic industries a central tenet of the chinese communist party s platform as of now there is no clarity as to which side has offered more concessions and in what areas preliminary reports speculate that china has agreed to buy significant amounts of u s goods up to 1 2 trillion of agricultural products energy and semiconductors china is also expected to reduce non tariff trade barriers providing greater market access to u s firms in financial services and auto manufacturing improve protection of intellectual property rights and reduce forced technology transfers china s economy has hit a soft patch amid internal imbalances and is also feeling the pinch of tariffs these circumstances have made it a willing bargainer at the same time the u s administration appears to have softened some of its key demands and is not pushing beijing to fundamentally restructure its methods washington s negotiating strategy seems intent on deferring some of the harder to solve issues which may need to be addressed separately chief among these will be striking a balance between china s aspiration to technological dominance and america s resolve to remain the world s leading technological power the u s pushback on huawei and china s counter accusations are preliminary skirmishes in a brewing tech war american attempts to get allies to join the offensive against chinese telecommunications makers have lost momentum and may be a key reason why the tech sector has moved to a back burner in the negotiations the more moderate u s stance which may be driven by politics more than economics has angered hard liners in the administration a compromise from the u s side on core issues will make the passage of any future agreement difficult in congress which will be wary of a weak deal that fails to provide a transparent and level playing field for u s businesses and there remains a strong appetite on both sides of the aisle to combat what is perceived as china s economic and diplomatic aggression even if a limited accord is agreed defining the enforcement mechanisms a crucial point for the u s in guaranteeing china s compliance with any future deal will also be a complex task this could also require additional time and care a fairly limited deal covering the less prickly elements is highly possible as the two sides have come closer to finding a common ground on simpler issues but tensions related to china s industrial practices technology and its rise as a global power are unlikely to recede while markets have been cheered by signs of détente important battles still lie ahead moving target the federal reserve is once again contemplating changes to its system for targeting inflation officials are frustrated at their inability to reach the current objective and worried that inflation expectations may fall as a consequence with interest rates settling in at much lower levels than they have during past expansions there is less dry powder to arrest a decline in the price level which raises the specter of deflation during the next downturn the fed has initiated a series of discussions to consider its options as we concluded in our essay a testing time for inflation targeting it is unlikely that the fed would discard 2 as its objective having invested considerably to embed that figure in the minds of the markets but the fed could elect to seek that target on average over some period instead of at every point in time under this kind of system underages in one interval would be made up for by overages in another price level targeting is one example of this kind of framework committing to this process would in theory raise inflation expectations during periods where actual inflation was below the long run target investors would in those cases expect the fed to remain easier for longer than they would under the present structure we would advise the fed to proceed with caution first inflation expectations do not seem to have stepped down meaningfully as shown in the chart below market based measures of expectations are closely anchored to oil prices which have recovered from last fall s decline second the fed might have a hard time committing credibly to getting inflation above 2 when called for given its recent struggles to reach that level finally a move to average inflation targeting or price level targeting would suggest lower interest rates across the business cycle or even an interest rate cut in the current environment this could invite financial excess which could beget financial instability without confident financial supervision nonetheless the fed s willingness to move in a new direction is another clear sign that the odds of an interest rate hike this year are falling

the canadian government shocked the professional financial and economic media with their latest fourth quarter gdp release showing the economy has essentially come to a grinding halt at 0 1 growth the canadian q4 gdp growth isn t one percent it s one tenth of one percent 0 1 essentially halted but everyone discussing this is missing something very important first the financial post headline canada s economy practically came to a halt in the final three months of 2018 in a much deeper than expected slowdown that brings the underlying strength of the expansion into doubt the country s economy grew by just 0 1 per cent in the fourth quarter for an annualized pace of 0 4 per cent statistics canada said friday from ottawa that s the worst quarterly performance in two and a half years down from annualized 2 per cent in the third quarter and well below economist expectations for a 1 per cent annualized increase while a slowdown was widely expected in the final months of the year due to falling oil prices it s a much bleaker picture than anyone anticipated with weakness extending well beyond the energy sector consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years housing fell by the most in a decade business investment dropped sharply for a second straight quarter and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015 read more the financial punditry go on to give multiple reasons for the drop and all of them are factually accurate however there s a key aspect that i cannot find discussed in any analysis of the data a very specific key aspect first let me say cth does not want to see the canadian economy falter not even a little bit by disposition cth wants to see economic abundance for everyone especially our close friends and allies but stand back look at the bigger big picture the media always avoid discussing you ve got to ask yourself how can canada be slowing down at the exact same time the usa economy is skyrocketing there s a connection again all of the currently expressed financial reasons for the slowdown are accurate i am not disputing them however it s what they are not discussing that really matters in the third paragraph of the fp article i highlighted a partial sentence business investment dropped sharply for a second straight quarter that means sharp drops in business investment for canada in the time frame july 2018 through december 2018 now pause and reference the u s fourth quarter consumer spending continued to grow solidly and most encouragingly business investment growth recovered sharply after a dip in the third quarter despite big external headwinds and financial market volatility in the fourth quarter u s firms are not retrenching sharply on capex astute economic followers will note what the background is in july august september q3 of 2018 the new nafta negotiation was in the final stages the u s and mexico had already come to the terms canada was the outlier having to re join an agreement in september where they previously abandoned negotiations on october 1st 2018 the first day of q4 the usmca was unveiled now the u s mexico and canada were all committed throughout the fourth quarter all business interests had an opportunity to review the much anticipated usmca outcome and details multinational corporations domestic corporations u s and canadian businesses were all looking for the same very specific detail what happened with the nafta loophole within the new usmca the critically important nafta loophole was closed over the past three decades both canada and mexico structured key parts of their independent trade agreements to take advantage of their unique access to the u s market under the existing nafta mexico and canada generate billions in economic activity through exploiting the nafta loophole china asia writ large and the eu enter into trade agreements with mexico and canada as back doors into the u s market so long as corporations can avoid u s tariffs and rules of origin that pertain to those tariffs by going through canada and mexico they would continue to exploit this approach by shipping parts to mexico and or canada and by deploying satellite assembly facilities in canada and or mexico china asia and to a lesser extent eu corporations exploited a nafta loophole for rules of origin on finished goods through a process of building assembling or partially manufacturing their products in mexico canada those foreign corporations could skirt u s trade tariffs and direct u s trade agreements the finished foreign products entered the u s under nafta rules why deal with the u s when you can just deal with mexico and use nafta rules to ship your product directly into the u s market this exploitative approach a backdoor to the u s market was the primary reason for massive foreign investment in canada and mexico it was also the primary reason why candidate donald trump now president donald trump wanted to shut down that loophole and renegotiate nafta at the conclusion of round 6 just before giving up on chrystia freeland for good this was the direct issue at the heart of a very frustrated u s t r lighthizer s strongly worded response to canada in another proposal canada reserved the right to treat the united states and mexico even worse than other countries if they enter into future agreements those other countries may in fact even include china if there is an agreement between china and this proposal i think if the united states had made it would be dubbed a poison pill we did not make it though obviously this is unacceptable to us and my guess is it is to the mexican side also read full remarks this loophole was the primary reason u s manufacturers relocated operations to mexico corporations within the u s auto sector could enhance profits by building in mexico or canada using cheap parts imported from asia china the labor factor was not as big a part of the overall cost consideration as cheaper machined parts and imported raw materials if the u s applied the same tariffs to canada and mexico we apply to all trade nations then the benefit of using canada and mexico by those trade nations is lost corporations will no longer have any advantage and many are likely to just deal directly with the u s this was the reason trump lighthizer and ross to retained steel and aluminum tariffs on canada and mexico until they agreed to the new usmca rules when trump took away the flawed nafta market access and when trump removed the ability of mexico and canada to broker themselves for economic benefit there was no longer a financial benefit behind corporations investing in canada under a binding trade pact between the usmca partners the nafta flaw is closed as a direct outcome billions of investment dollars are now being removed from any future consideration into canada that s the overarching reason for the canadian gdp to halt here s the proverbial 64 000 question can canada re engineer their economy and actually begin to make products again not just simply assemble foreign products from other nations can canada reverse three decades of specifically structured economic policy decisions that were centered around this assembly brokered economy can the environmentalists be put back into a box while heavy manufacturing and raw material development are reconstituted can the environmentalists allow natural resource development oil development mining operations lowered overall energy costs etc can canada somehow lower national energy costs so that heavy manufacturing might consider restarting note heavy manufacturing requires massive energy use can canada find any industrial development investors who would be willing to take a chance on all the above see the problem the canadian economy is not likely going to get better without a radical shift in canadian political perspectives and outlook s then again perhaps that s really why justin and chrystia were so damned set on protecting their cultural industries ie media from competition think about it

street signs for broad st and wall st are seen outside of the new york stock exchange nyse in new york u s february 22 2019 reuters brendan mcdermid files by lewis krauskopf new york reuters u s stock prices are outpacing those in most other regions to start 2019 but the gap is narrow and some investors are eyeing potential catalysts to tip the scales to the rest of the world investors say several factors could sway performance in favor of other developed or emerging markets including slowing u s profit growth a weaker u s dollar improving economies in china and europe and resolution of global trade tensions the 11 percent gain this year for the s p 500 is helping the u s benchmark index expand its global edge since the u s equities bull run began a decade ago u s stocks are near 70 year highs relative to other global developed markets according to bank of america merrill lynch for the most part it has been a pretty consistent trend that u s outperforms non u s said nathan thooft head of asset allocation for manulife asset management in boston the reality is though it can t go on forever u s corporate earnings are expected to climb 5 3 percent this year after rising 24 4 percent in 2018 according to global markets research at ftse russell european companies excluding the uk are expected to see profits rise 9 1 percent this year while profits for emerging market companies are projected to rise 13 9 percent moreover the s p 500 is trading at 16 4 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months more expensive than the 13 4 times for europe s stoxx and 11 5 times for the msci emerging markets index according to refinitiv data moreover the s p 500 s valuation gap over those indexes is wider than it has been historically people are willing to pay a very hefty premium for the u s stock market said lance humphrey a portfolio manager with usaa asset management it s our view that the fundamentals in the u s don t necessarily justify the degree of that premium that valuation difference has been one attraction in particular for emerging markets which was the most crowded trade in a baml fund manager survey last month the strength of the u s dollar is another factor for emerging markets many of which have debt denominated in the greenback for u s investors a strong dollar also requires a costly currency translation for investments in international funds investors say the dollar has held up surprisingly well this year given the more dovish stance by the federal reserve but any weakening in the u s currency could be a boon for stocks outside the country resolution of the trade dispute between the united states and china could provide another boost as investors have become optimistic about a deal between the world s two largest economies if china and the u s can reach a good agreement that will actually propel emerging markets and have a bigger impact on emerging markets than on the u s market said chris gaffney president of world markets at tiaa bank all the emerging markets are somewhat dependent on china because that s their largest trading partner for the most part the potential for a positive trade resolution has helped fuel the 22 percent run this year for china s shanghai composite index which has outperformed both u s and other major world indices europe s stoxx has climbed 10 percent this year a weak economic outlook the euro zone economy is expected to expand 1 3 percent this year just over half the u s rate along with political uncertainty in britain and elsewhere have pressured equities lisa shalett chief investment officer at morgan stanley wealth management last week issued a report saying european equities should top u s equities noting that modest economic growth forecasts look achievable the best thing going for europe right now is no one has expectations said keith lerner chief market strategist at suntrust advisory services in atlanta what that means is a little bit of good news could go a long way one factor driving u s outperformance this year is the heavy weight of technology stocks in the country s indexes nearly one quarter of msci s u s index is tech companies compared with 15 percent in financials by contrast msci s european union index has a 19 percent weighting in financials and 6 percent in tech tech and other high growth stocks have been in favor but some investors anticipate a shift toward financials and other value stocks so europe could see a relative boost of course not everyone agrees nicholas colas co founder of datatrek research doubts that financials will lead this year which is one reason he prefers the s p 500 over indexes for other global regions indeed willie delwiche investment strategist at baird says geographic diversification away from the u s market has hurt returns so

new york cnn business 1 ten years gone in march 2009 the us economy was in the midst of the great recession the government had just reported that more than 650 000 jobs were lost in the prior month the dow and s p 500 were each down more than 50 from their october 2007 peaks and there seemed to be no end in sight to the doom and gloom on wall street and main street flash forward 10 years and it s been mostly blue skies for investors since then thanks to steady economic growth and a surge in corporate profits the dow and s p 500 are up more than 300 since they hit bottom on march 6 2009 but now that this bull market is approaching its 10 year anniversary some are wondering how much longer the rally can last stocks have soared so far in 2019 following the tumultuous fourth quarter of last year that s led to new questions about whether stocks are too pricey the s p 500 had been trading at 18 times 2019 earnings estimates before stocks cratered last fall that multiple fell as low as 14 following the huge sell off but it s now at 16 after the index started 2019 with a 12 pop what s happened in this rally is that valuations have crept back up said hugo rogers chief investment strategist with deltec stocks were oversold last year but now they are no longer cheap earnings growth is expected to slow this year after a strong 2019 that s partly due to the fading effect of corporate tax cuts but economic weakness in italy and germany worries about brexit and slowing growth in china and india are causes for concern too all of that could hurt earnings for huge multinationals in the dow and s p 500 companies like apple aapl caterpillar cat coca cola ko and procter gamble pg and even though the federal reserve has already signaled that it will probably not raise interest rates this year the us economy and corporate earnings may start to slow because of the lag from prior rate hikes the fed has boosted rates seven times in the past two years that will hurt companies with a lot of debt in particular the markets may be topping out said randy swan ceo of swan global investments the damage from the fed s rate hikes could already be done of course it s fair to point out that bull markets aren t like a carton of milk they don t have an expiration date stocks could keep climbing as long as earnings and the economy are growing but complacency may be setting in as investors continue to ignore risks with the benefit of hindsight it seems all too obvious how and why trouble struck wrote strategists at dws most recessions and bear markets are not like that they tend to catch central bankers investors and even economists by surprise all this argues for a bit of caution 2 jobs jobs jobs last month analysts watched the us jobs report for signs of damage from the partial government shutdown but employment growth in january was surprisingly strong the us economy added 304 000 jobs the 100th straight month of gains another solid report could juice markets which finished february on a positive note the dow increased 3 7 the s p 500 finished up 3 and the nasdaq ended up 3 4 good economic news would add to investors optimism they re already feeling good about the likelihood of a trade deal between the united states and china as well as the fed s decision to pause interest rate hikes 3 retail s haves and have nots the verdict is in from last year s holiday shopping stretch there s a widening gap between retail s best and worst performing companies a flood of top retailers reported uneven results this earnings season some including walmart wmt tjx tjx and best buy bby thrived but l brands lb owned victoria s secret jcpenney jcp and gap inc gps struggled department chains macy s m and nordstrom jwn faced pressure in their full price divisions but those companies found strength through their discount stores target tgt kohl s kss kroger kr and costco cost all report earnings this week target tgt has become a formidable competitor to amazon amzn and walmart because of its lineup of trendy private label clothing and its sharp focus on trying to win over moms and dads costco cost has also succeeded because of its low prices on groceries and household basics and through the popularity of its trademark kirkland signature brand 4 coming next week monday salesforce crm earnings tuesday target kohl s and ross rost stores earnings us ism non manufacturing index wednesday dollar tree dltr and abercrombie fitch anf earnings fed beige book thursday kroger h r block hrb costco earnings friday us jobs report
the trump administration hit its forecast of 3 percent real gdp growth last year as new data show that the economy grew 3 1 percent from the last quarter of 2017 through the last quarter of 2018 there are other ways to measure this sort of thing but i think this way is the most accurate and its policy contributed to this outcome the deficit financed tax cuts added to growth in 2018 as did significant deficit spending but before popping the champagne corks trump aides should recognize that contrary to their claims gdp growth is already slowing for students of the failed promises of supply side trickle down economics that s not a surprise lower taxes or increased government spending that s not offset by tax increases or spending cuts elsewhere feeds automatically into higher gdp for the simple and obvious reason that both consumer and government spending count as part of gdp that result isn t guaranteed if tax cuts and spending push up interest rates either through actual overheating or by making the federal reserve nervous about potential overheating that would counteract the growth effects of spending but even as the fed began last year with a few minor rate hikes it backed off and the interest rate on the 10 year bond is lower now than it was a year ago inflation is also in check so the big story for last year s 3 percent growth rate is that deficit spending fueled growth without overheating or crowd out the theory that public borrowing takes the place of more productive private borrowing thus pushing up interest rates this result has ushered in a robust debate about whether deficits matter at all they do but it s nuanced but the real problem for the administration is that the growth effects of large 2018 deficits are already fading and that reveals some bad news about the impact of the tax cuts since around 2010 the gdp s trend growth rate has been about 2 percent meaning 2018 came in about a point above trend in human terms that means unemployment was about half a point lower than would have occurred absent the fiscal stimulus which in turn translates into around 800 000 jobs and while real wages haven t done anywhere near as well as the administration promised when selling the tax cuts they have recently been growing in real terms thanks in part to the high pressure labor market as well as lower energy prices but for 3 percent to become the new trend as the fiscal stimulus fades structural growth accelerators must kick in most importantly faster productivity growth this in fact is the administration s theory of the case one immortalized by economist art laffer s supply side growth story high end tax cuts would juice business investment which would lead to faster productivity growth it s a lovely story but the data never fail to reject it most forecasters got last year about right but as fiscal stimulus fades they predict slower growth ahead they re collectively saying that what happened last year was keynesian stimulus providing a temporary growth bump not a lasting upshift as in the laffer story these forecasts could be wrong but thursday s report already shows gdp slowing from its faster trend earlier in the year moreover while the business investment data has been solid it s been what we d expect at this stage of the expansion leading economist dean baker to conclude that the evidence is overwhelming that the impact of the tax cut was a conventional keynesian demand side stimulus rather than the investment led growth that was the ostensible justification for the large reduction in corporate income taxes finally whenever we re talking about gdp growth in our highly unequal economy we have to ask how much it lifted all boats not just the yachts recent analysis by david leonhardt at the new york times finds that after tax income growth for the wealthiest household has long outpaced gdp growth while the upper middle class the 90th to 99th percentiles have kept pace with gdp everyone else has lagged far behind to be clear that data takes a few years to come out but up to date information on corporate profitability vs wage outcomes suggests that these unequal patterns persist sure we can temporarily juice the economy with deficit financed tax cuts but we ve known that since keynes but such stimulus always fades and if the cuts are structured mostly to benefit the wealthy the middle class won t have much to show for them so here s something else we re learning again even though we ve long known it was true trickle down economics still doesn t work jared bernstein a former chief economist to vice president joe biden is a senior fellow at the center on budget and policy priorities and author of the reconnection agenda reuniting growth and prosperity
the global financial markets continue to climb walls of worry each week with the pundits experts still focusing primarily on the shift in the fedâ s stance last december while that move was pivotal for us too and created a bottom for all markets the truth is that so much more is happening globally that supports remaining optimistic for the foreseeable future if we were to tell you the following would you think that the markets had run their course or that there was a lot more room to go all major monetary bodies are accommodative with money supply outstripping demand fiscal policies are easing with more spending and less taxes inflationary pressures remain muted interest rates are ridiculously low trade negotiations with china are reaching a climax with japan u s talks on deck brexit will most likely be delayed we fully recognize that there will be glitches along the way and that corrections could occur at any time but the simple truth is that the wind is to our backs and will be so for the foreseeable future letâ s look at the pivotal economies in the world to see if our outlook is validated by the factsâ or not fed chairman powell had hearings before the house and senate this past week where he acknowledged that future rate hikes were on hold and that the unwinding of the balance sheet will most likely end in a few more months fourth quarter gnp data was released last week too and was much stronger than generally anticipated led by consumer spending and much better than expected capital spending data it is important to note the 13 1 increase in technology spending which portends strong productivity gains down the road core inflation remained below the 2 fed threshold for yet another year first quarter economic stats have begun on a weak note impacted to a small degree by the government shutdown in january the government is traditionally off in its first quarter stats due to weather and seasonal adjustments we would expect the first quarter to be the weakest one reported for the year and the economy to pick up in the springtime housing sales should benefit from the recent sharp decline in mortgage rates our economy will continue to benefit in 2019 from that sharp reduction in taxes and increased domestic spending and then consider the benefit to our economy once if trade deals are reached which look more and more likely it even appears that u s officials are finalizing a trade deal with china that both presidents can sign the end of this month has to be a plus for both of our economies as well as for the global economy finally we expect president trump to do everything in his power to have a strong domestic economy as we approach national elections in 2020 donâ t bet against city hall no doubt the chinese economy has slowed down considerably over the last few months the bank of china has not only lowered reserve and capital requirements it has also shoveled billions of dollars into the financial system even lowering lending requirements once again after having raised them last year expect some big announcements next week from president xi when he speaks to parliament look for additional spending plans lower taxes and optimism on reaching a trade deal with the u s the boj remains overly accommodative as both economic growth and inflation remain well below targets japanâ s lower house just passed a record budget for 2019 starting april 1st with increased spending along with tax cuts japan economic minister motegi wants to proceed immediately with bi lateral trade talks with the u s we are confident that a deal can be reached before the end of the summer the eurozone is the problem child as growth is stagnant and inflation is running at around 1 well below the ecb targets ecb president draghi has maintained an overly accommodative stance throughout 2018 and appears willing to increase the ecb balance sheet further beginning before year end europe is clearly suffering from weakening exports especially to china we were pleased to see that germany has approved a 170 4 year plan to increase spending for infrastructure education housing and technology clearly all members of the eurozone need to do the same but it will have to come at the expense of rising deficits which we do expect to happen we remain concerned that trade discussions between the eurozone and u s will be difficult but we do expect a deal before year end as trumps needs the win for his election run while it is clear that global growth weakened as we entered 2019 big change is in the air thank heaven that all of the powers to be recognize the need to stimulate their economies as the consequences of any alternative are unthinkable donâ t be surprised to see a big lift in both consumer and business sentiment while none of this will occur overnight it appears that the dye has been cast and growth will accelerate especially if trade deals are reached all of these actions normally occur at market bottoms not tops donâ t bet against city hall we realize that this is a minority view but we are not paying for it anyway the general outlook which includes the imf forecast is that global growth continues to slow as we move through 2020 we disagree for all the reasons stated above we are fully cognizant to the risks in our view debt levels are too high we are also bothered by the rise in socialism far left in american politics and populism abroad what ever happened to working together for the common good despite all of these problems buffett would tell you that our economy will thrive over time so invest for the long term the bottom line is that our market as well as many of the foreign markets remain undervalued today we keep hearing that our market is fully valued at 17 times estimated 2019 earnings that doesnâ t make sense to us with bond yields so low and financial capital liquidity ratios so high expect first quarter earnings comparisons to be the weakest ones for the year we are amazed how many

last december the benchmark s p 500 equity index suffered its worst final four weeks of the year since 1931 as investors fretted about a too hawkish federal reserve a sharp slowdown in europe and china and the lack of meaningful progress in trade negotiations between washington and beijing fast forward two months and the s p 500 is enjoying its best start to the year since 1987 up 11 3 per cent since the beginning of january it is not just american stocks that have rebounded spectacularly the msci all country world index ex us a gauge of global equities that excludes american shares has risen almost 10 per cent this year having lost 11 5 per cent in the final quarter of last year the rally moreover has been indiscriminate all major asset classes including commodities high yield corporate bonds and local currency emerging market debt have delivered positive returns in the last two months after a year in which nearly every leading asset class suffered heavy losses yet the speed and scale of the rebound having come perilously close to entering a bear market a fall of at least 20 per cent from a recent high last christmas eve the s p 500 had already risen 13 5 per cent by mid january should be treated with caution whenever the pendulum of investor sentiment swings too far in the opposite direction in such a short period alarm bells ought to be ringing for starters the sell off at the end of last year was overdone making a sharp snapback at some point inevitable investors had become too pessimistic in the final weeks of 2018 the clearest example of this was the roughly 60 per cent probability us equity markets were assigning to a recession in america in the next 12 months according to data from jpmorgan despite the relatively strong performance of the nation s economy the question is whether this year s rebound across asset classes is proportionate to the improvement in the outlook for both markets and the global economy the evidence suggests that it most definitely is not while the two main catalysts for the rally the fed s decision at the end of january to put its interest rate hiking campaign on hold and signs that a breakthrough in us china trade negotiations is in the offing are undoubtedly significant they leave many questions unanswered it is unclear for instance how patient the fed will prove to be in the coming months especially if inflationary pressures start to build investors moreover should be careful what they wish for a significant easing of trade tensions could encourage the fed to be more hawkish the bigger risk however is a continued stand off on the more contentious issues bedevilling sino us relations notably china s weak intellectual property regime its industrial polices and technology transfer practices one of the reasons trade talks appear to be making headway is that us president donald trump has more incentive to clinch a deal to prove that his trade strategy is working amid mounting political pressures at home in the run up to next year s crucial presidential election the easing of trade tensions is also attributable to beijing s desperate need to head off a further rise in tariffs as china s economy continues to slow as i argued previously it was partly concerns about the severity of china s slowdown that forced the fed to turn dovish in january that china s main stock indices have since entered bull market territory a rise of more than 20 per cent from a recent low despite persistent weakness in the economy and doubts about the efficacy of stimulus measures is a clear sign that investors have got ahead of themselves the risk is amplified by the fact that retail investors account for more than 80 per cent of equity trading volume in china fuelling volatility still at least china is ramping up its stimulus efforts which is more than can be said for the euro zone where the european central bank which ended its quantitative easing programme last december has yet to react to a fall in the bloc s growth rate to its weakest level since 2013 this makes this year s 12 per cent rise in the stock market of italy which has slipped back into recession even harder to fathom even in america where growth is much stronger the surge in equities belies growing concerns about corporate earnings according to bloomberg s p 500 profits are expected to fall 2 7 per cent this quarter their first year on year decline since 2016 driven by a squeeze on margins stemming partly from the disruption caused by the trade war oversold markets at the end were due for a rally yet this year s rebound has gone too far source south china morning post

president trump while delivering a two hour wide ranging speech at the conservative political action conference blamed a strong u s dollar and interest rate hikes by the federal reserve for hurting the economy we have a gentleman that loves quantitative tightening in the fed he said referring to federal reserve chair jerome powell we have a gentleman that likes a very strong dollar in the fed so with all of those things we want a strong dollar but let s be reasonable with all of that we re doing great can you imagine if we left interest rates where they were if we didn t do quantitative tightening i want a dollar that s great for our country but not a dollar that s prohibitive for us to be doing business with other countries although officials at the u s central bank have signaled they will be patient with raising the benchmark federal funds rate moving forward a result of a u s china trade war and fears of slowing growth in europe and china the fed raised interest rates four times in 2018 although still low by historical standards interest rates are at the highest level in nearly a decade after the last hike america is now booming like never before trump said other countries are doing very poorly that makes it even harder for us to be successful plus we have a gentleman that likes raising interest rates in the fed he said it s not the first time that trump has taken a swipe at powell although the president handpicked powell to replace then fed chair janet yellen he s made no secret of his disdain for interest rate hikes which he blames for curtailing economic growth interest rates can affect consumers by making borrowing costs higher at the end of december during which the stocks posted the worst month since the great depression trump said the only problem our economy has is the fed trump also was reportedly considering firing powell during that same time period although the white house denied that report in the beginning of february however trump and powell had an informal dinner during which the fed chair stressed the importance of economic data and non political analysis in establishing monetary policy did not discuss his expectations for monetary policy except to stress that the path of policy will depend entirely on incoming economic information and what that means for the outlook fed officials said in a statement at the time

the canadian government shocked the professional financial and economic media with their latest fourth quarter gdp release showing the economy has essentially come to a grinding halt at 0 1 growth the canadian q4 gdp growth isn t one percent it s one tenth of one percent 0 1 essentially halted but everyone discussing this is missing something very important first the financial post headline canada s economy practically came to a halt in the final three months of 2018 in a much deeper than expected slowdown that brings the underlying strength of the expansion into doubt the country s economy grew by just 0 1 per cent in the fourth quarter for an annualized pace of 0 4 per cent statistics canada said friday from ottawa that s the worst quarterly performance in two and a half years down from annualized 2 per cent in the third quarter and well below economist expectations for a 1 per cent annualized increase while a slowdown was widely expected in the final months of the year due to falling oil prices it s a much bleaker picture than anyone anticipated with weakness extending well beyond the energy sector consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years housing fell by the most in a decade business investment dropped sharply for a second straight quarter and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015 read more the financial punditry go on to give multiple reasons for the drop and all of them are factually accurate however there s a key aspect that i cannot find discussed in any analysis of the data a very specific key aspect first let me say cth does not want to see the canadian economy falter not even a little bit by disposition cth wants to see economic abundance for everyone especially our close friends and allies but stand back look at the bigger big picture the media always avoid discussing you ve got to ask yourself how can canada be slowing down at the exact same time the usa economy is skyrocketing there s a connection again all of the currently expressed financial reasons for the slowdown are accurate i am not disputing them however it s what they are not discussing that really matters in the third paragraph of the fp article i highlighted a partial sentence business investment dropped sharply for a second straight quarter that means sharp drops in business investment for canada in the time frame july 2018 through december 2018 now pause and reference the u s fourth quarter consumer spending continued to grow solidly and most encouragingly business investment growth recovered sharply after a dip in the third quarter despite big external headwinds and financial market volatility in the fourth quarter u s firms are not retrenching sharply on capex astute economic followers will note what the background is in july august september q3 of 2018 the new nafta negotiation was in the final stages the u s and mexico had already come to the terms canada was the outlier having to re join an agreement in september where they previously abandoned negotiations on october 1st 2018 the first day of q4 the usmca was unveiled now the u s mexico and canada were all committed throughout the fourth quarter all business interests had an opportunity to review the much anticipated usmca outcome and details multinational corporations domestic corporations u s and canadian businesses were all looking for the same very specific detail what happened with the nafta loophole within the new usmca the critically important nafta loophole was closed over the past three decades both canada and mexico structured key parts of their independent trade agreements to take advantage of their unique access to the u s market under the existing nafta mexico and canada generate billions in economic activity through exploiting the nafta loophole china asia writ large and the eu enter into trade agreements with mexico and canada as back doors into the u s market so long as corporations can avoid u s tariffs and rules of origin that pertain to those tariffs by going through canada and mexico they would continue to exploit this approach by shipping parts to mexico and or canada and by deploying satellite assembly facilities in canada and or mexico china asia and to a lesser extent eu corporations exploited a nafta loophole for rules of origin on finished goods through a process of building assembling or partially manufacturing their products in mexico canada those foreign corporations could skirt u s trade tariffs and direct u s trade agreements the finished foreign products entered the u s under nafta rules why deal with the u s when you can just deal with mexico and use nafta rules to ship your product directly into the u s market this exploitative approach a backdoor to the u s market was the primary reason for massive foreign investment in canada and mexico it was also the primary reason why candidate donald trump now president donald trump wanted to shut down that loophole and renegotiate nafta at the conclusion of round 6 just before giving up on chrystia freeland for good this was the direct issue at the heart of a very frustrated u s t r lighthizer s strongly worded response to canada in another proposal canada reserved the right to treat the united states and mexico even worse than other countries if they enter into future agreements those other countries may in fact even include china if there is an agreement between china and this proposal i think if the united states had made it would be dubbed a poison pill we did not make it though obviously this is unacceptable to us and my guess is it is to the mexican side also read full remarks this loophole was the primary reason u s manufacturers relocated operations to mexico corporations within the u s auto sector could enhance profits by building in mexico or canada using cheap parts imported from asia china the labor factor was not as big a part of the overall cost consideration as cheaper machined parts and imported raw materials if the u s applied the same tariffs to canada and mexico we apply to all trade nations then the benefit of using canada and mexico by those trade nations is lost corporations will no longer have any advantage and many are likely to just deal directly with the u s this was the reason trump lighthizer and ross to retained steel and aluminum tariffs on canada and mexico until they agreed to the new usmca rules when trump took away the flawed nafta market access and when trump removed the ability of mexico and canada to broker themselves for economic benefit there was no longer a financial benefit behind corporations investing in canada under a binding trade pact between the usmca partners the nafta flaw is closed as a direct outcome billions of investment dollars are now being removed from any future consideration into canada that s the overarching reason for the canadian gdp to halt here s the proverbial 64 000 question can canada re engineer their economy and actually begin to make products again not just simply assemble foreign products from other nations can canada reverse three decades of specifically structured economic policy decisions that were centered around this assembly brokered economy can the environmentalists be put back into a box while heavy manufacturing and raw material development are reconstituted can

the canadian government shocked the professional financial and economic media with their latest fourth quarter gdp release showing the economy has essentially come to a grinding halt at 0 1 growth the canadian q4 gdp growth isn t one percent it s one tenth of one percent 0 1 essentially halted but everyone discussing this is missing something very important first the financial post headline canada s economy practically came to a halt in the final three months of 2018 in a much deeper than expected slowdown that brings the underlying strength of the expansion into doubt the country s economy grew by just 0 1 per cent in the fourth quarter for an annualized pace of 0 4 per cent statistics canada said friday from ottawa that s the worst quarterly performance in two and a half years down from annualized 2 per cent in the third quarter and well below economist expectations for a 1 per cent annualized increase while a slowdown was widely expected in the final months of the year due to falling oil prices it s a much bleaker picture than anyone anticipated with weakness extending well beyond the energy sector consumption spending grew at the slowest pace in almost four years housing fell by the most in a decade business investment dropped sharply for a second straight quarter and domestic demand posted its largest decline since 2015 read more the financial punditry go on to give multiple reasons for the drop and all of them are factually accurate however there s a key aspect that i cannot find discussed in any analysis of the data a very specific key aspect first let me say cth does not want to see the canadian economy falter not even a little bit by disposition cth wants to see economic abundance for everyone especially our close friends and allies but stand back look at the bigger big picture the media always avoid discussing you ve got to ask yourself how can canada be slowing down at the exact same time the usa economy is skyrocketing there s a connection again all of the currently expressed financial reasons for the slowdown are accurate i am not disputing them however it s what they are not discussing that really matters in the third paragraph of the fp article i highlighted a partial sentence business investment dropped sharply for a second straight quarter that means sharp drops in business investment for canada in the time frame july 2018 through december 2018 now pause and reference the u s fourth quarter consumer spending continued to grow solidly and most encouragingly business investment growth recovered sharply after a dip in the third quarter despite big external headwinds and financial market volatility in the fourth quarter u s firms are not retrenching sharply on capex astute economic followers will note what the background is in july august september q3 of 2018 the new nafta negotiation was in the final stages the u s and mexico had already come to the terms canada was the outlier having to re join an agreement in september where they previously abandoned negotiations on october 1st 2018 the first day of q4 the usmca was unveiled now the u s mexico and canada were all committed throughout the fourth quarter all business interests had an opportunity to review the much anticipated usmca outcome and details multinational corporations domestic corporations u s and canadian businesses were all looking for the same very specific detail what happened with the nafta loophole within the new usmca the critically important nafta loophole was closed over the past three decades both canada and mexico structured key parts of their independent trade agreements to take advantage of their unique access to the u s market under the existing nafta mexico and canada generate billions in economic activity through exploiting the nafta loophole china asia writ large and the eu enter into trade agreements with mexico and canada as back doors into the u s market so long as corporations can avoid u s tariffs and rules of origin that pertain to those tariffs by going through canada and mexico they would continue to exploit this approach by shipping parts to mexico and or canada and by deploying satellite assembly facilities in canada and or mexico china asia and to a lesser extent eu corporations exploited a nafta loophole for rules of origin on finished goods through a process of building assembling or partially manufacturing their products in mexico canada those foreign corporations could skirt u s trade tariffs and direct u s trade agreements the finished foreign products entered the u s under nafta rules why deal with the u s when you can just deal with mexico and use nafta rules to ship your product directly into the u s market this exploitative approach a backdoor to the u s market was the primary reason for massive foreign investment in canada and mexico it was also the primary reason why candidate donald trump now president donald trump wanted to shut down that loophole and renegotiate nafta at the conclusion of round 6 just before giving up on chrystia freeland for good this was the direct issue at the heart of a very frustrated u s t r lighthizer s strongly worded response to canada in another proposal canada reserved the right to treat the united states and mexico even worse than other countries if they enter into future agreements those other countries may in fact even include china if there is an agreement between china and this proposal i think if the united states had made it would be dubbed a poison pill we did not make it though obviously this is unacceptable to us and my guess is it is to the mexican side also read full remarks this loophole was the primary reason u s manufacturers relocated operations to mexico corporations within the u s auto sector could enhance profits by building in mexico or canada using cheap parts imported from asia china the labor factor was not as big a part of the overall cost consideration as cheaper machined parts and imported raw materials if the u s applied the same tariffs to canada and mexico we apply to all trade nations then the benefit of using canada and mexico by those trade nations is lost corporations will no longer have any advantage and many are likely to just deal directly with the u s this was the reason trump lighthizer and ross to retained steel and aluminum tariffs on canada and mexico until they agreed to the new usmca rules when trump took away the flawed nafta market access and when trump removed the ability of mexico and canada to broker themselves for economic benefit there was no longer a financial benefit behind corporations investing in canada under a binding trade pact between the usmca partners the nafta flaw is closed as a direct outcome billions of investment dollars are now being removed from any future consideration into canada that s the overarching reason for the canadian gdp to halt here s the proverbial 64 000 question can canada re engineer their economy and actually begin to make products again not just simply assemble foreign products from other nations can canada reverse three decades of specifically structured economic policy decisions that were centered around this assembly brokered economy can the environmentalists be put back into a box while heavy manufacturing and raw material development are reconstituted can the environmentalists allow natural resource development oil development mining operations lowered overall energy costs etc can canada somehow lower national energy costs so that heavy manufacturing might consider restarting note heavy manufacturing requires massive energy use can canada find any industrial development investors who would be willing to take a chance on all the above see the problem the canadian economy is not likely going to get better without a radical shift in canadian political perspectives and outlook s then again perhaps that s really why justin and chrystia were so

1 ten years gone in march 2009 the us economy was in the midst of the great recession the government had just reported that more than 650 000 jobs were lost in the prior month the dow and s p 500 were each down more than 50 from their october 2007 peaks and there seemed to be no end in sight to the doom and gloom on wall street and main street flash forward 10 years and it s been mostly blue skies for investors since then thanks to steady economic growth and a surge in corporate profits the dow ands p 500 are up more than 300 since they hit bottom on march 6 2009 but now that this bull market is approaching its 10 year anniversary some are wondering how much longer the rally can last stocks have soared so far in 2019 following the tumultuous fourth quarter of last year that s led to new questions about whether stocks are too pricey the s p 500 had been trading at 18 times 2019 earnings estimates before stocks cratered last fall that multiple fell as low as 14 following the huge sell off but it s now at 16 after the index started 2019 with a 12 pop what s happened in this rally is that valuations have crept back up said hugo rogers chief investment strategist with deltec stocks were oversold last year but now they are no longer cheap earnings growth is expected to slow this year after a strong 2019 that s partly due to the fading effect of corporate tax cuts but economic weakness in italy and germany worries about brexit and slowing growth in china and india are causes for concern too all of that could hurt earnings for huge multinationals in the dow and s p 500 companies like apple caterpillar coca cola and procter gamble and even though the federal reserve has already signaled that it will probably not raise interest rates this year the us economy and corporate earnings may start to slow because of the lag from prior rate hikes the fed has boosted rates seven times in the past two years that will hurt companies with a lot of debt in particular the markets may be topping out said randy swan ceo of swan global investments the damage from the fed s rate hikes could already be done of course it s fair to point out that bull markets aren t like a carton of milk they don t have an expiration date stocks could keep climbing as long as earnings and the economy are growing but complacency may be setting in as investors continue to ignore risks with the benefit of hindsight it seems all too obvious how and why trouble struck wrote strategists at dws most recessions and bear markets are not like that they tend to catch central bankers investors and even economists by surprise all this argues for a bit of caution 2 jobs jobs jobs last month analysts watched the us jobs report for signs of damage from the partial government shutdown but employment growth in january was surprisingly strong the us economy added 304 000 jobs the 100th straight month of gains another solid report could juice markets which finished february on a positive note the dow increased 3 7 the s p 500 finished up 3 and the nasdaq ended up 3 4 good economic news would add to investors optimism they re already feeling good about the likelihood of a trade deal between the united states and china as well as the fed s decision to pause interest rate hikes 3 retail s haves and have nots the verdict is in from last year s holiday shopping stretch there s a widening gap between retail s best and worst performing companies a flood of top retailers reported uneven results this earnings season some including walmart tjx and best buy thrived but l brands owned victoria s secret jcpenney and gap inc struggled department chains macy s and nordstrom faced pressure in their full price divisions but those companies found strength through their discount stores target kohl s kroger and costco all report earnings this week target has become a formidable competitor to amazon and walmart because of its lineup of trendy private label clothing and its sharp focus on trying to win over moms and dads costco has also succeeded because of its low prices on groceries and household basics and through the popularity of its trademark kirkland signature brand 4 coming next week monday salesforce earnings tuesday target kohl s and ross stores earnings us ism non manufacturing index wednesday dollar tree and abercrombie fitch earnings fed beige book thursday kroger h r block costco earnings friday us jobs report
it was a choppy week with economic data central bank chatter and geopolitics contributing to the moves in the week the stats if the markets were looking for some semblance of calm but the week was far from it with a mass of stats and some significant geopolitical events providing direction on the data front it was a mixed bag the data count was skewed to the negative with 41 of a total 83 stats monitored coming in below market forecasts through the week out of the u s consumer confidence got a boost in february suggesting that domestic consumption would continue to provide strong support to the u s economy for the housing sector the slide in mortgage rates likely contributed to a jump in pending home sales in january and building permits in december while both the manufacturing pmi surveys disappointed the chicago pmi surged in february the figures suggest that it s not all doom and gloom in the manufacturing sector the greenback found little love through the week rising by just 0 02 4th quarter gdp numbers could have been far worse slower u s economic growth in the 4th quarter and the fed s preferred core pce price index likely contributed to the dollar s flatness by the week concerns over the economic outlook continue to linger which has ultimately led to a shift in forward guidance by the fed fed chair powell s 2 day testimony to congress provided plenty of pressure on the dollar whilst providing further support to the u s equity markets out of the uk stats were limited to the uk s manufacturing pmi while the manufacturing sector saw output slow marginally there were no major alarm bells for the uk economy the lion s share of contribution to the economy comes from services and not manufacturing a light economic calendar worked in favor of the pound through the week following theresa may s decision to delay brexit s meaningful vote until 12th march support kicked in on expectations of a delay to britain s departure from the eu there are two big parliamentary votes that the markets will need to look out for first up is the 12th march vote on theresa may s deal the second is a 14th march vote to decide whether the 29th march departure date should be delayed assuming theresa may s deal is thrown it and that is the current view when looking at the pound there does remain a slight chance of the 14th march vote not going the way the bulls out of the eurozone a heavy calendar was skewed to the positive while sentiment towards ecb monetary policy was a eur negative risk appetite provided support for the eur and european equities through the week consumer confidence in germany held its ground and the eurozone s unemployment rate fell to 7 8 in january a combination of positive consumer spending figures out of france and germany and stronger than expected labor market figures were also key in the week the eur closed out the week with a 0 26 gain the rise came even with inflationary pressures in the eurozone easing in february according to prelim figures manufacturing remains the key and while the threat of u s tariffs on eu exports to the u s remains every present there was a brief visit to 1 14 levels before easing back risk on sentiment also supported the european equity markets in the week hopes of a resolution to the u s china trade war supported the dax and eurostoxx50 to 1 26 and 1 27 gains respectively only the csi300 outperformed the pair the gains coming in spite of a pickup in the eur whether the eur and the equity majors can stand their ground remains to be seen the u s president and the ecb will likely be in control of the eur s fate this week elsewhere the loonie went for a dive on friday a 1 23 slide on friday saw the loonie give up gains from the week the canadian economy contracted in december ultimately supporting the material shift in the bank of canada s recent forward guidance with the boc s march interest rate decision due next week the loonie could be in for a spin a dovish boc and the loonie could hit c 1 34 levels against the u s dollar oil prices certainly haven t helped and neither has twitter trump tanked crude oil prices in the early part of the week which came before friday s sell off geo political risk focus had ultimately been on geopolitical risk the economy bundling along in support of robust labor market conditions and consumption trump s north korea summit in hanoi left the u s president empty handed which caught the markets by surprise an unwillingness by the u s to remove sanctions led to an abrupt end to the summit for the u s president there was then some time to respond to the chatter over michael cohen time will tell perhaps on who is telling the truth the trump attack was scathing but not enough to throw risk appetite into the abyss can the democrats and cohen demonstrate a link between campaign funds and the daniels pay off it could be quite a scandal the republicans have doused the flames for now but they re not out of the woods just yet while the north korea summit and cohen were certainly negatives u s china trade talks were ultimately positive while the djia closed out the week in the red the s p500 broke through to 2 800 levels for the first time since 8th november that s quite a bounce back from a late 2018 slide to 2 351 on christmas eve this article was originally posted on fx empire more from fxempire
executive summary nonstandard or alternative employment relations refer to employment by a temporary help agency or contract company or as an on call worker or day laborer we refer to these nonstandard employment relations which involve an employer and employee and independent contracting collectively as nonstandard or alternative work arrangements in this report contingent workers are workers who do not expect their job to last or who report that their jobs are temporary contingent workers and workers in alternative work arrangements are measured separately both have become increasingly prominent in theoretical and policy thinking about how employment has changed in recent years in the united states and other postindustrial countries this report was produced in collaboration with the center for economic and policy research until recently only relatively poor information on the extent of contingent work and nonstandard work arrangements and how this has changed during the past several decades has been available the may 2017 contingent worker supplement cws conducted by the bureau of labor statistics bls 12 years after the last cws and 22 years after the first provides an opportunity to examine how contingent work and nonstandard work arrangements have changed over the last two plus decades this report examines these changes between 2005 and 2017 with special attention to how older workers ages 55 to 65 and 65 have fared major findings perhaps surprisingly workers were slightly more apt to have standard work arrangements in 2017 than in 2005 in 2017 the total share of the labor force working in nonstandard arrangements was 10 1 percent down from 10 9 percent in 2005 the share who worked as independent contractors fell to 6 9 percent from 7 4 percent older workers are more likely to be independent contractors than any other age group in both 2005 and 2017 however the share of all older workers who are independent contractors declined from 10 8 percent of those ages 55 64 and 18 3 percent of those ages 65 in 2005 to 9 3 percent and 16 2 percent respectively in 2017 among independent contractors the share who were ages 55 64 increased from 18 8 percent to 22 9 percent for those ages 65 the share increased from 8 5 percent to 14 1 percent in other words 37 percent of independent contractors were older workers in 2017 up almost 10 percentage points since 2005 in contrast to the main body of the cws the questions on participation in the gig economy applied to the first job second job or other additional work for pay data from bls show that only 1 0 percent of workers engaged in electronically mediated gig work in the survey week in may 2017 just under 22 percent of gig economy workers were employed in transportation and utilities among all workers and among workers ages 55 64 independent contractors had the highest median weekly earnings in 2005 though those in standard employment relations had the highest median weekly earnings in 2017 for workers ages 65 however independent contractors had the highest median weekly earnings in both 2005 and 2017 indicating the economic advantage for the oldest workers of being independent contractors in may 2017 89 9 percent of the workforce was employed in a standard work arrangement in their main job and this proportion has been relatively stable since 1995 introduction nonstandard employment relations that is temporary help agency and contract company employment and employment as an on call worker or day laborer as well as independent contracting have become increasingly prominent in both theoretical and policy thinking about how employment has changed in recent years in the united states and other postindustrial countries interest in and theories of nonstandard work arrangements have outrun empirical evidence based on representative data and using consistent definitions and adequate measures until recently only relatively poor information on the extent of nonstandard work arrangements and how these arrangements have changed during the past several decades has been available a major source of consistent data on nonstandard and contingent work was the important program of data collection undertaken by the bureau of labor statistics bls in their contingent work supplement cws to the february current population survey cps beginning in 1995 and replicated in 1997 1999 2001 2005 and now may 2017 analysis of the earlier cws data found that the employment shares of workers in nonstandard work arrangements were quite stable across all of the surveys from 1995 to 2005 with the share employed as independent contractors ranging from 6 3 to 7 4 percent the on call worker share ranging from 1 5 to 1 8 percent the temporary help agency worker share ranging from 0 9 to 1 0 percent and the contract company worker share ranging from 0 5 to 0 6 percent in 2005 researchers at bls found that in all 10 7 percent of workers were employed in these nonstandard work arrangements horrigan 2016 the may 2017 cws conducted 12 years after the last cws and 22 years after the first provides an opportunity to examine how nonstandard work arrangements have changed over the last two plus decades the years since 2005 encompass the great recession of 2007 2009 the period of the largest economic upheaval in the united states since the great depression of the 1930s comparing the results of the 2017 survey with those conducted in earlier years enables us to examine the extent to which the employment relationship and the experience of work in the lives of people and communities have changed given the relative stability that characterized nonstandard work arrangements as measured in the cws between 1995 and 2005 this report focuses on comparisons between 2005 and 2017 and focuses on older workers ages 55 64 and 65 our report helps to develop a common understanding of what has changed it can inform a broader research agenda that can address the opportunities and challenges inherent in current work and employment realities this is a prerequisite to the examination of whether and what new policies may be necessary to improve the functioning of the labor market distribution and trends in nonstandard work arrangements table 1 shows overall employment growth for the period 2005 2017 and growth for workers in these two age groups the first two columns indicate that the labor force grew by about 10 percent overall while those in the labor force ages 55 64 and 65 grew by 46 percent and 92 percent respectively table 1

workers temporary agency workers contract company workers day laborers in 2005 and 2017 for all workers and for those workers ages 55 64 and 65 we see that workers ages 55 and older and especially those ages 65 were less likely than workers overall to have standard work arrangements surprisingly perhaps in light of the general perception that there was a rapid rise in the share of workers in nonstandard work arrangements in the 12 years since 2005 workers in all of these groups all ages ages 55 64 and ages 65 were slightly more apt to have standard work arrangements in 2017 than in 2005

overall growth in the share of independent contractors with college degree or more from 35 1 percent to 40 0 percent the growth was most pronounced for independent contractors ages 65 the share of workers with a college degree or more increased 11 5 percentage points to 52 3 percent independent contractors continue to be mostly white but their share declined from 80 0 percent to 70 9 percent the share of white workers decreased to a lesser degree for older workers ages 55 62 and 65 while independent contractors mostly work full time 70 5 percent in 2017 more than half of older workers ages 65 worked part time in 2017 overall there has been a slight decline in the percentage of employed persons who are independent contractors from 2005 to 2017 in the cws data a relative stability that goes back to the first survey in 1995 the 2017 bls cws result differs from katz and krueger s 2016 finding of an increase in the percent of independent contractors from 6 9 percent in 2005 to 8 4 percent in 2015 they also reported an increase in all four categories of nonstandard work from 10 7 percent in 2005 to 15 8 percent in 2015 this raises questions about possible reasons for differences between the bls s 2017 cws and the 2015 katz and krueger rand study katz and krueger 2016 indeed in a new working paper katz and krueger 2019 note that their estimates of nonstandard work arrangements were too high as they were skewed by spotty data and the recession of a decade ago a problem in estimating the extent of independent contracting in the united states is that independent contractors are often measured in different ways the cws supplement classifies an independent contractor as anyone who self identifies as working as an independent contractor an independent consultant or a free lance worker in the past week the cws also focuses on a worker s main job and does not consider those who work as independent contractors to supplement income from their main job as is the case for many lyft or uber drivers for example moreover those classified as an independent contractor in the supplement could be either wage and salary workers or self employed in the basic cps survey nearly nine in 10 independent contractors are self employed conversely three in every five self employed workers are independent contractors insights into the limitations of using the cws to measure independent contractors are provided by abraham et al 2017 they compare estimates of independent contractors from household survey data such as the cps with other ways of measuring this group such as individual surveys the general social surveys or gss and administrative records the census bureau s detailed earnings record or der they show that estimates based on household survey data indicate smaller percentages and more stable trends than the gss estimates of independent contractors in the 2002 2006 2010 and 2014 quality of worklife supplements to the gss show no consistent pattern of growth in independent contractors though the levels are about twice that of the cws the der which also indicates higher levels of independent contractors than the cws shows an increasing trend as well a likely explanation for some of these differences might be that the gss asks an individual directly about their own activity while the cws answers might be supplied by someone else in the household and so the gss respondent might be more aware of the work arrangement the der which is based on income tax returns picks up individuals who did any independent contracting at any time in the previous year as compared with the cws which asks about independent contracting as the respondent s main job in the last week as a result the der is likely to be measuring those who work as independent contractors as a supplemental activity or who tried it briefly and decided not to continue recent research manyika et al 2016 farrell and greig 2016 suggests that many workers with independent contractor income use it to supplement income from a main job as a standard employee thus an explanation for the discrepancy in trends between the cws and other measures of independent contracting may be that independent contracting as the main job is stable while it is growing among those who do it on a supplemental basis the gig economy discussions of the future of work abound in the popular press and social media and these are usually centered on the idea that a large and growing share of jobs does not involve an employer employee relationship gig workers a type of independent contractor whose work is mediated by technological platforms such as uber upwork or taskrabbit we are told are the wave of the future workers according to the pundits face a future characterized by dramatic growth in jobs in which they are likely to be gig economy workers matched to tasks by online platforms two recent reports jpmci 2018a bls 2018 suggest that despite the ubiquity of uber and lyft drivers in our major cities the gig economy does not currently hold the key to the future of work this may already have been apparent in our earlier discussion where we noted that nonstandard work arrangements characterized less than 11 percent of jobs in 2017 in september 2018 both the jp morgan chase institute jpmci and bls published data on participation in the gig economy electronically mediated work in the parlance of bls the jpmci data tracks supply side participation and earnings in the platform economy the earnings are directed through 128 different online platforms to 2 3 million distinct chase accounts out of the 39 million in the database over the period october 2012 to march 2018 the platforms fall into four distinct categories transportation non transport work selling and leasing transportation and non transport work are the labor platforms in may 2017 bls added four questions to the contingent worker supplement the questions were designed to measure electronically mediated work that is short jobs or tasks that workers find through websites or apps that connect them with customers and arrange payment for the work the questions distinguish between jobs that are done in person for example driving people delivering something doing someone s household tasks or errands and those that are done entirely online for example data entry translating text or graphic design in contrast to the main body of the cws the questions on participation in the gig economy applied to the first job second job or other additional work for pay many respondents misunderstood the questions and answered yes when it was obvious that the reported work was not through a website or app that arranged for payment for the work bls evaluated all records with affirmative answers and recoded erroneous answers the cleaned data from bls show that only 1 0 percent of workers engaged in electronically mediated work in the survey week in may 2017 despite the differences in methodology the share of workers in the labor platform economy in the jpmci data set in the month of may 2017 was also 1 percent jpmci 2018b 3 this similarity provides support for the view that the gig economy represents a very small only about 1 percent portion of workers however while the top line numbers for participation in the gig economy are the same in both the jpmci and bls data sets there are also key differences see also bernhardt and thomason 2017 the two studies reach different conclusions about whether workers engage in gig economy work as their main job or as a way to supplement income earned on their main job bls found that electronically mediated work was the main job for 75 percent of gig workers only a quarter of them did it as a second job or as additional work for pay bls 2018 19 by contrast the jpmci data suggest that gig economy work is primarily a source of supplemental income about 60 percent of labor platform workers engage in these activities for three months of the year or less while only 12 percent are gig economy workers for 10 months or more while platform earnings are a little more than half the income of families during the months they participate they are only 20 percent of annual earnings for those who did any platform work during the year jpmci 2018a 3 4 jpmci observes that platforms are not replacing traditional sources of family income jpmci 2018a 3 a second difference is in the shares of labor platform workers employed in transportation more than 90 percent of these workers were engaged in transportation in the month of may 2017 in the jpmci data jpmci 2018b 5 in the bls data just under 22 percent of gig economy workers were employed in transportation and utilities in the reference week in may 2017 bls 2018 17 it s not clear how these differences can be reconciled bls 2018 20 24 also presents detailed personal information about the respondents personal and occupational characteristics that allow us to examine

demographic categories a more refined analysis is given in table 7 which reports estimates of the probability of persons in each of the two older age groups employed as contingent workers or working in each nonstandard work arrangement relative to prime age workers 25 54 in 2005 and 2017 after controlling for characteristics that are associated with work arrangements such as race ethnicity nativity education and state in addition to gender in 2017 older workers ages 55 64 and 65 were more likely to be independent contractors than prime age workers 2 7 percentage points and 9 4 percentage points respectively older workers ages 65 were also 2 6 percentage points more likely to be on call workers in 2017 similar patterns held in 2005 for both independent contractor and on call work workers ages 65 were 2 2 percentage points more likely than workers ages 25 54 to hold contingent jobs in 2005 but there was no significant difference in 2017 the results of this analysis bolster our previous findings as they show that older workers especially those ages 65 but also those ages 55 64 are more likely to be independent contractors in each year as well as more likely to be on call workers we also see that older workers are generally not more likely than workers in other age groups to be contingent though workers ages 65 were more apt to be contingent workers than other age groups in 2005 given the relevance to older workers of independent contracting in particular as well as on call work and contingent work we focus on only these three types of work arrangements in the

55 64 in standard work arrangements were more apt to have health insurance in each year than independent contractors on call workers and contingent workers however among workers ages 65 independent contractors and on call workers were more apt than standard workers to have health insurance in 2005 in 2017 independent contractors in this age group were just as likely as standard workers to have

on your website download image table 9 also provides information on whether workers overall and in the two oldest age groups and in the various types of work arrangements participated in employer related pension plans not surprisingly workers in standard employment relations were much more likely than workers in the other groups to have employer provided pension plans and independent contractors who are not employees were by far the least workers ages 65 were more likely to participate in employer provided pension plans in 2017 relative to 2005 on call workers most of whom were elementary middle school teachers drivers laborers and registered nurses had the second highest percentages of workers with employer provided pension benefits these increased for workers overall and for those ages 55 64 but declined among workers ages 65 workers ages 65 were less likely than those ages 55 64 to participate in pension plans which may reflect their having retired from their main jobs and continuing to work this group also had the lowest rate of working part time for economic reasons especially in 2017 finally table 9 includes information on union membership for workers overall and in the two oldest age groups and in the various types of work arrangements unionization is also a dimension of job quality in the sense that union members have better protections and a greater voice in their working lives the percentage of union members increased somewhat among standard employees from 2005 to 2017 for workers overall and for the oldest group but declined for workers ages 55 64 in both years workers ages 65 had the lowest rates of unionization on call workers generally had the highest union rates which is reasonable given the occupational composition of this group which includes a large number of elementary school teachers and registered nurses occupations that are more highly unionized than most and in which workers are likely to work in the public sector policy implications a steady drumbeat of pronouncements by prognosticators pundits policymakers and economists have raised the specter of a future of workers not tethered to a business and lacking the protections of employment laws written for a bygone era when most workers had an employer numerous conferences in the past few years have been devoted to the future of work a future in which traditional jobs would largely disappear there has been much discussion and often concern that most of us will become independent contractors and an increasing share of independent contractors would be gig economy workers this narrative has developed in a largely fact free environment in which a lack of solid data has led to conclusions based on anecdotes the release by the bureau of labor statistics bls of the 2017 contingent worker supplement provided the first consistent and reliable look at nontraditional work since 2005 bls found that in may 2017 89 9 percent of the workforce was employed in a standard work arrangement in their main job compared with 89 1 percent in 2005 most workers main jobs were characterized by standard employment relations and this proportion has been relatively stable since 1995 just 10 0 percent of workers in 2017 were employed in an alternative work arrangement for their main job independent contractors at 6 9 percent of employment were the largest category followed by on call workers at 1 7 percent just 1 0 percent of workers were gig economy workers whose tasks were electronically mediated in 2017 this includes workers for whom this is a main job a second job or something they do to make extra money a separate report from the jp morgan chase institute jpmci using an entirely different type of data and methodology also found that gig economy workers made up just 1 0 percent of employment in may 2017 the jpmci found that employment in the gig economy was negligible in 2013 so the rise to 1 0 percent starting from such a low base represents a very fast rate of growth and that may be what misled observers but that report also found that most workers engaged in electronically mediated work do it for three months or less and usually as a second job workers do face an array of problems that have worsened since 1995 including less job and economic security fewer opportunities for upward mobility and the possibility that they and their job will be outsourced to a company that pays low wages and provides few benefits there is certainly much room for improvements in employment law that will enhance outcomes for the vast majority of workers who currently and for the foreseeable future will be employed in much diminished standard employer employee relationships remaking labor law as has been proposed to accommodate work relationships in the online gig economy however seems both unnecessary and unwise harris and krueger 2015 propose modernizing labor laws for the twenty first century by introducing a new legal category of worker the independent worker they propose lyft and uber drivers as archetypal examples of independent workers they are particularly interested in the online gig economy because this sector is growing rapidly harris and krueger 2015 10 although their ballpark estimate for the number was also 1 percent harris and krueger 2015 12 but jpmci whose data tracks payments to the bank accounts of gig economy workers by the platform intermediaries that employ them concludes that for most workers gig jobs are mostly sporadic and represent second jobs done by a worker in a household in which the worker or another family member has a standard employment relationship rejecting the harris and krueger approach does not mean that independent contractors including gig workers do not need policies that address the loss of legal employment protections these workers face the relatively high representation of older workers as independent contractors raises important questions for work related policies and labor laws existing labor laws and social protections are often linked to people who work for an employer often on a full time and relatively continuous basis labor and other laws provide fewer protections for independent contractors and the fact that so many older people are classified as independent contractors means that policies must address their concerns for social protections as they contemplate retirement one fruitful approach is to address the deliberate or inadvertent misclassification of many workers as independent contractors who should rightfully be viewed as employees one of the challenges is that the definition of employee varies in different federal laws the fair labor standards act the internal revenue code and erisa which governs retirement accounts california addressed this by adopting the abc test and putting the burden on the entity that wishes to classify a worker as an independent contractor a worker can be classified as an independent contractor only if the hiring entity establishes all of the following marks 2018 that the worker is free from the control and direction of the hirer in connection to the work both under the contract for the performance of such work and in fact that the worker performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity s business and that the worker is customarily engaged in an independently established trade occupation or business of the same nature as the work performed for the hiring entity anyone who meets the abc test will meet the criteria in all of the existing laws where the distinction between an employee and an independent contractor is relevant the abc test was upheld by the california supreme court in a landmark unanimous ruling eaton 2018 the case involved a same day delivery service that had converted drivers from employees to independent contractors in order to save money the court s decision means that not meeting all three parts of the test will preclude the hiring entity from treating a worker as an independent contractor companies like lyft and uber may not be able to meet the criteria in parts b and c nevertheless we have shown in this report that working as independent contractors may actually benefit older workers workers ages 65 who were independent contractors had the highest weekly earnings of any work arrangement in both 2005 and 2017 and were among the highest group receiving health insurance in the case of older workers in particular the issue might not be what they are classified as independent contractors or standard workers but whether they have the social and economic protections to live a comfortable and productive life here the focus would not be so much on the nature of the work arrangement but on the protections associated with it this points to the importance of expanding the affordable care act to cover workers not covered by employer or current medicare and medicaid policies and providing state sponsored iras for workers who do not have other access to retirement savings something that several states have done workers in all industrial countries have experienced a deterioration of the standard employment relationship in the past several decades driven by globalization technological changes and pressures to reconfigure welfare states to cope with decreased economic growth in some countries such as japan or spain there has been a marked growth in nonstandard work arrangements due to employer and government responses that have sought to protect standard workers at the expense of an increasingly insecure group of nonstandard workers in other countries such as the united states weak employment protections for all workers made it less imperative to create a large group of nonstandard workers the challenge for the united states is to provide protections for all workers that are not tied to whether they work in a standard or nonstandard work arrangement about the authors

and employee and independent contracting collectively as nonstandard work arrangements in this report these work arrangements have also been referred to as alternative work arrangements polivka 1996 market mediated arrangements abraham 1990 flexible staffing arrangements houseman 1997 atypical employment córdova 1986 and contingent work polivka and nardone 1989 barker and christensen 1998 nonstandard work arrangements depart from standard work arrangements in which it was generally expected that work would continue indefinitely and would be performed at the employer s place of business under the employer s direction standard work arrangements were the norm in the united states and many industrial nations for much of the twentieth century and were the basis of the framework within which labor law collective bargaining and social security systems developed macro and mezzo structural forces such as globalization technological change financialization deregulation union decline and neoliberal political economic policies emerging in the united states in the 1970s and 1980s led to a shift in employment norms from standard to nonstandard work arrangements e g kalleberg 2000 2011 since then there has been a rise in both nonstandard work arrangements and concerns about their impacts on individuals families organizations and the broader society bls does not include day laborers in this total total employment in nonstandard work arrangements including day laborers was 10 9 percent in 2005 the trends in these nonstandard work arrangements thus appear to be relatively flat except perhaps for independent contractors this conclusion is somewhat misleading however as the main increases in temporary help agency employment and the other forms of nonstandard work are likely to have occurred before 1995 we should also keep in mind that the cws links to the cps and is a household survey of workers and thus almost certainly undercounts nonstandard work because it does not count a worker s second or third job mishel bernstein and allegretto 2007 239 in 2015 katz and krueger 2016 tried to replicate the study of alternative work arrangements in the cws by conducting a survey in the summer of 2015 using the rand institute s american life panel alp the core of their questionnaire was based on the bls s cws they made their survey as comparable as possible asking about alternative work arrangements for each individual s main job while they did not follow some of bls s protocols e g not asking temporary help workers if they were also freelancers they did impose the bls s classification scheme in their analysis they used a variety of weighting procedures in an attempt to align their sample to the cps according to key demographic characteristics and to account for the over representation of self employed workers in the alp survey their alp survey was conducted in october and november compared with the cps which was conducted in february they conclude that seasonality was unlikely to distort their comparisons they show that the two samples are broadly similar in terms of their representation of the united states labor force as represented by the october cps although the samples differ in some important respects respondents in the apl sample were about 8 percent more likely to hold more than one job and reported considerably higher earnings than the cps respondents despite their efforts at achieving comparability with earlier bls surveys of contingent workers katz and krueger s 2016 study only approximately replicated the cws importantly their survey was conducted online reaching a population narrower than the overall workforce and more likely to have some employment as an independent contractor to distinguish independent contractors from business operators such as a restaurant owner the supplement includes a question for workers who identified as self employed incorporated and unincorporated in the basic cps that asks are you self employed as an independent contractor independent consultant freelance worker or something else such as a shop or restaurant owner those identified as wage and salary workers in the basic cps are asked last week were you working as an independent contractor an independent consultant or a freelance worker that is someone who obtains customers on their own to provide a product or service the u s census bureau receives an extract called the detailed earnings record or der that can be used to produce an estimate of the number of schedule se recipients as well as those who file a schedule c the recipients of self employment income file both schedule se and schedule c see also research conducted by the u s treasury jackson looney and ramnath 2017 the jpmci sample is composed of 39 million unique chase checking accounts jpmci 2018a 25 the sample over represents families headed by a younger person headed by a man or located in the west it under represents families headed by a younger person headed by a woman or located in the south the questions on electronically mediated work in the cws yielded a large number of false positives some respondents answered yes to the questions if any of their job duties resembled the examples yes i drive my car to work or yes i sometimes use a computer at work some also answered yes if they used websites or mobile apps in their work bls determines whether a job is contingent based on three definitions we present information on the broadest definition which includes wage and salary workers who have been in their jobs for a year or more and expect to continue for a year or more but not the self employed or independent contractors who have been in their jobs for more than a year or expect to continue for more than a year we also report in table 7 the probabilities of workers in each of the other demographic categories being in the various work arrangements for example the column for independent contractors shows that white workers are more apt to be independent contractors than black hispanic or asian workers while the column on contingent workers finds the reverse black hispanic or asian workers are more likely than white workers to be contingent workers we do not calculate weekly earnings for on call workers due to a small sample size for starters these workers would not be paid for waiting time between gigs and would not be eligible for hour based benefits such as overtime pay or the minimum wage they would be allowed to organize have access to nondiscrimination protections and tax withholding by platform intermediaries who could also voluntarily pool their independent workers to provide health insurance many gig economy workers appear to be doing gig work for the money to supplement their earnings on their main job recent events in new york city where uber and lyft drivers recently won the right to the minimum wage suggests that gig workers would value this employment protection references abraham

us officials have said any trade deal with china will include a provision to prevent manipulation of the exchange rate to help exporters but beijing s currency regime reflects a complex reality us president donald trump who has accused the asian giant of artificially undervaluing its currency for competitive purposes last week said we have a deal with china on the currency and white house economic adviser larry kudlow on thursday said the draft documents would prohibit currency manipulation and oblige authorities in beijing to report any interventions in the market but at the center of the issue is a paradox china does not necessarily want a weak currency and the downward pressure on the yuan is in large part caused by us economic conditions like rising interest rates the yuan or renminbi rmb is not freely convertible and the government limits its movement against the us dollar to a two percent range on either side of a central parity rate which the people s bank of china sets each day to reflect market trends that managed float system limits volatility the currency has remained confined in the last five years between 6 2 and 6 8 yuan to the dollar a historically high level compared to 8 28 fixed rate in the 2000s while the rmb strengthened 6 3 percent in 2017 it depreciated by 5 7 percent last year falling to its lowest level in a decade which was enough to spur speculation beijing was putting its foot on the currency scale again but the international monetary fund has said the rmb is not undervalued and in a july report said it was broadly stable against the basket of currencies and broadly in line with fundamentals
u s sen dan sullivan r alaska speaks to a joint session of the alaska legislature at the capitol on thursday feb 21 2019 senate president cathy giessel r anchorage and speaker of the house bryce edgmon of dillingham listen from the speaker s desk in the house of representatives michael penn juneau empire government has a big role in the future alaskan economy whether intentional or not that s the message sen dan sullivan delivered to the state legislature last week hopefully gov mike dunleavy heard it too because it might help him realize that balancing the state budget is about values first not numbers sullivan teed off with his party s usual talking points it s because of policies like cutting taxes on middle class families and small businesses getting rid of job killing regulations and unleashing the promise of american energy production that the the u s economy in the lower 48 is firing on all cylinders and he s optimistic that by continuing to enact good policies at the federal level and bringing investment dollars home to alaska the economic dynamism in job growth down south will hopefully be coming our way soon surprisingly though he didn t promote last year s tax cuts any further the roll back of regulations wasn t highlighted much either on energy of course he could claim a hand in opening the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil exploration and there are more leases up for grabs but those are the only new jobs he mentioned that might be created here solely from activity in the private sector the rest will come courtesy of the american taxpayer and deficit spending sullivan began that story by saying he s helped secure over 1 3 billion in military construction during the past three and half years leading to hundreds if not thousands of good paying alaskan jobs and we can expect more because previous pentagon budgets that cut spending by almost 25 percent are a thing of the past his omission is what s relevant here the spending cuts he referred to was fallout from republican resistance to raising the ceiling on the federal debt known as sequestration they became law when congress passed the budget control act of 2011 the cuts were automatically triggered because congress failed to enact deficit reduction legislation it s not the first time this approach to deficit reduction failed the graham rudman legislation of the 1980s had to be abandoned those were also accompanied by republican refusal to consider new taxes the message for dunleavy here is two pronged government spending boosts employment in the private sector and reducing it without new revenue is an unrealistic solution to the state s fiscal deficit but the biggest lesson for our new governor came from the recent bipartisan successes sullivan described for example he said we funded the child s health insurance program known in alaska as denali kid care for 10 years that is longest reauthorization of that important program in history created in 1997 chip was was the largest expansion of taxpayer funded health insurance coverage for u s children since medicaid was enacted in 1965 according the weekly publication modern healthcare that may sound like another big government program but it wasn t democrats who championed it it became law while the gop controlled both the house and senate sullivan also cited federal budget increases for community health centers chcs last year the funding was close to 8 billion he said with 170 we have more of them than any other state serving more than 113 000 alaskans who would otherwise be medically underserved or uninsured and sullivan promised congress will continue to fund these vitals centers as well and finally sullivan spoke about a whole new very big market for our fish he helped create it came through a provision in the farm bill that mandates that only domestically landed and processed fish be included in the national school lunch program to make it happen congress removed a loophole that allowed russian caught pollock that s sent to china injected with phosphates sent back to the u s and served to american school children using federal dollars that s smart legislation but to the point i m trying to make like chip and chcs the national school lunch program wouldn t exist if congress tried to make its spending decisions by building its budget from the bottom up these programs are an extension of how sen lisa murkowski views the state s power cost equalization program and ferry system responsibilities our government accepts because of it s part of who we are that s values speaking and dunleavy won t succeed as governor by slicing and dicing those into a bottom line rich moniak is a juneau resident and retired civil engineer with more than 25 years of experience working in the public sector he contributes a weekly my turn to the juneau empire my turns and letters to the editor represent the view of the author not the view of the juneau empire
barring another government shutdown we should be hearing about the north american free trade agreement as early as mid april if and when the renegotiated agreement comes up for a crucial vote in congress the united states canada and mexico are parties to nafta you may recall the original nafta was supposed to create hundreds of thousands of new american jobs instead nafta has destroyed at least a million good jobs and continues in that vein by making it super easy to move u s businesses to mexico where hourly wages are many times lower than in the united states nafta caused job losses have helped force down wages in the rest of the u s economy evaporate the middle class and consign millions to low wages in the precarious benefit free gig economy nafta also failed its promise to help family farmers in the united states and mexico instead american small farmers fared poorly while competing against cheap mexican produce more tragically the livelihoods of most mexican corn farmers were wiped out by massive u s government subsidized corn imports facilitated by nafta that hugely benefited big agribusinesses consequently millions of impoverished mexican farm workers and their families left their homes to find work in the united states president trump promised to improve on nafta s failed free trade legacy and in some important respects the new deal contains some major improvements corporations would no longer be able to sue countries over labor public health and environmental protections shadowy trade tribunals could no longer overrule a country s laws and courts and win limitless compensation from taxpayers this change would make it considerably more difficult for corporations to export american jobs and subvert democracy also a significant proportion of mexican auto worker wages would have to be raised to 16 an hour helping to close the u s mexico wage gap countries would no longer be obligated to export natural resources meaning if we decide to preserve and conserve those resources like our ancient forests we can cut exports on the negative side those provisions said to protect workers and the environment are couched in weak language and basically unenforceable our government would not be required to employ a minimum number of american workers on public projects paid for by american taxpayers border food inspections would be watered down risking more food borne diseases worst of all the revised nafta grants massive monopoly protections for big pharma through extreme patent requirements threatening to wipe out generic drugs and further raise already outrageous drug prices this would be a major disaster for public health in all three countries citizens from around the country are organizing to ensure congress will either force the administration to vastly improve the agreement keeping the good changes and eliminating bad provisions or kill the deal outright citizens in colorado where some 20 000 jobs were eliminated by nafta are forming coalitions to make sure our congressional representatives work for us and not just for monsanto and pfizer it s clear the existing nafta has to go it s an undemocratic corporate friendly concoction that works for transnational corporations at the expense of american jobs communities and the environment the revised nafta has potential only if congress adopts a fair trade philosophy which says everyone not just giant corporations should benefit congress has the power to either improve or stop a deal that doesn t work for most of us we need to tell our federal representatives in no uncertain terms what we expect from them ken bonetti lives in boulder
president george manneh weah greeting officials upon his return from israel sunday the president told reporters at stakeout upon his return that he is content with the kroll report monrovia president george manneh weah says his administration knew all along that it would be vindicated once investigation into the missing ld16 billion was completed henry karmo speaking to reporters sunday upon his return from an official visit to israel president weah hailed the united states government for its assistance in the probe and declared that his administration sought an independent because it had nothing to hide said president weah we wanted to show liberians that we are transparent and the only way they could believe that is to get the international group to probe into this alleged ld16 billion missing which is of course we all know that our government was going to be vindicated so we brought in the us embassy to help us and today kroll was able to give determination on what happen the us embassy in october 2018 the u s embassy in response to a request to the international community from the government of liberia and liberian civil society groups began the process through the united states agency for international development usaid to commission an independent report by a firm with expertise in forensic investigations the firm chosen was kroll associates inc kroll a division of duff phelps llc their mandate was to research matters stemming from allegations in the press that a container of new liberian dollar lrd banknotes had gone missing upon arrival in liberia in a statement the us embassy said upon the release of the report that kroll s analysis of delivery documentation provided by the central bank of liberia cbl confirmed that new banknotes totaling lrd 15 506 billion were received into the cbl s reserve vaults but kroll also found no information to support allegations that a container of banknotes went missing the report however raised concerns regarding the overall accuracy and completeness of the cbl s internal records and identified systemic and procedural weaknesses at the cbl and identifies shortcomings in liberia s fiscal and monetary management processes that are longstanding and continue to the present day the kroll report also flagged a number of discrepancies in relation to mop up exercise conducted by president weah s technical economic management team temt headed by minister samuel d tweh and nathaniel patray we wanted to show liberians that we are transparent and the only way they could believe that is to get the international group to probe into this alleged ld16 billion missing which is of course we all know that our government was going to be vindicated so we brought in the us embassy to help us and today kroll was able to give determination on what happen president george manneh weah the report states the approach taken by the cbl to implement the usd mop up exercise whereby small teams of bank personnel directly purchased ldr from local businesses and foreign exchange bureaus in exchange for usd notes created an enhanced level of risks with respect to i potential misappropriation of banknotes ii potential opportunity for money laundering and iii potential execution of transactions with illegal businesses consequently there is a risk that significant funds were unaccounted for by the cbl and kroll therefore recommends that this matter merits further understanding on his return sunday president weah expressed the hope that liberians are happy that there s no ld16 billion missing whatever happen now the findings the other findings now you know try to get information a lot of things show up and a lot of the things that are coming up now we hope that the process will also be transparent and we will go through the due process and once everything is done i hope there will be peace and there will be no more going to the streets and trying to rally for missing billions the president stressed the need for peace as he cautioned liberians against rushing to conclusions so again i told you to keep it peaceful and help our country to grow and i hope we all do the same because liberia has suffered it s time now to focus on building our economy but i m glad that the process is transparent and it will continue to be that way i will ask all liberians that going to the streets without information is wrong i think you should get facts before you should get into what we call rioting the president heaped praise on the security apparatus for maintaining the peace they have done so well they give you human rights to go to the street our government is here to promote peace
jean pisani ferry the green new deal promoted by alexandria ocasio cortez a fast rising star in the us congress and others among her fellow democrats may trigger a welcome reset of the discussion on climate change mitigation in the united states and beyond though not really new european greens have been pushing for such a new deal for a decade her plan is ambitious and wide ranging it may be too ambitious and wide ranging but unlike economists favorite approach to climate change set the right price for carbon and leave the rest to private decisions the green new deal rightly encompasses the many dimensions of what must be a fundamental transformation of our economies and our societies if the climate challenge is to be met successfully the transition to a carbon neutral economy is bound to be as revolutionary as the transition to the industrial age given the comprehensive nature of this transition it cannot be summarized in one price it must be a collective endeavor in which governments invest and every citizen finds his or her role the optimistic participatory ethos of the green new deal should be commended but let s be clear the green transition will not be a free lunch there is no doubt that life and work will be far better if we succeed in containing climate change than if we fail which is the rationale for undertaking the corresponding efforts yet that is not the question many citizens are asking their baseline expectation unrealistic but understandable is a business as usual scenario in which they continue to consume and travel according to their current habits they may accept eating a little less meat and using more efficient cars provided their purchasing power does not change and they may wish to change jobs if the new one is better paid and less stressful but there is little evidence that most citizens are ready for more understandably the green new deal supporters tend to pander to these feelings the ocasio cortez proposal is vague enough to evade precise criticisms but what is evident is that it does not put a finger on anything that may hurt the same applies to many plans that promise a nicer life together with more and better jobs the truth is unfortunately quite different the transition to a carbon neutral economy is bound to make us worse off before it makes us better off and the most vulnerable segments of society will be hit especially hard unless we acknowledge and address this reality support for greening the economy will remain shallow and it may eventually wane the reason brings us back to economists favorite instrument prices one way or another we must start paying for something carbon that we have been consuming for free and putting a price on carbon is bound to reduce overall consumption the cause is not the tax the proceeds of which can be redistributed to taxpayers for example on a per capita basis as an impressive group of us economists has proposed rather putting a price on carbon inevitably will result in what economists call a negative supply shock some equipment will become unusable and some technologies will no longer be profitable maximum production what economists call potential gdp will decline if the price hike is abrupt a slump will follow as occurred in 1974 when oil producers suddenly hiked prices a corollary is that wealth drops as the value of fuel inefficient houses gluttonous cars and oil companies shares declines the problem does not come from the use of a price instrument it would be the same in a planned economy carbon efficiency would also require old inefficient equipment to be discarded and additional investment so that gdp becomes less carbon intensive with recent estimates putting the required additional investment at some 2 percent of gdp annually in 2040 a correspondingly smaller share of output will be available for household consumption furthermore the distributional effects of the green transition are unfortunately adverse the poor and the suburban middle class spend more of their income on energy than the rich and the urban professionals do and often lack the means to buy a new efficient heating system or to insulate their house and because working class jobs tend to be more carbon intensive factory workers and truck drivers will be hurt more than designers and bankers the problem our societies are facing is massive it should not be hidden the french government had to backtrack after the yellow vests revolted against a 55 euros 63 per ton fuel tax but a recent estimate of what its needed to decarbonize put the rate at 250 euros per ton in 2030 european countries already agonizing over increasing their defense spending to 2 percent of gdp as us president donald trump has demanded now face the prospect of paying another 2 percent for the transition to a carbon free economy for decades people have been given incentives to move from city centers to the suburbs and now they are being told that their lifestyle has no future fortunately these effects can be softened the full redistribution of carbon tax proceeds can alleviate the burden on the most vulnerable in an environment of ultra low interest rates debt finance is a rational way to accelerate economic transformation while spreading the corresponding cost across generations as the astonishing drop in the cost of solar panels suggests fostering innovation and competition will help accelerate the emergence of clean efficient technologies and the earlier action is taken and the more predictable the long term outlook the easier it will be to adapt and the less adverse the impact on production and wealth will be abrupt changes devalue existing assets while a smooth transition enables the right investments at the right time that said realism compels us to recognize that nothing can fully eliminate the hardship involved in the transition to win green new deal enthusiasts must be honest with citizens about what the coming transformation will entail how its costs will be minimized and equitably shared and what role they can play rather than portraying their scenario as rosy they should show that it is feasible jean

maintaining a sharp distinction between free and unfree is not always helpful if we narrowly focus on unfree labour then everything which ends up falling on the other side of the dividing line gets removed from the equation we need to focus upon all vulnerable workers rather than only workers subject to unfree labour this means incorporating forms of precarious labour which may be nominally free yet still have many highly objectionable features this is part of the rationale behind the framework of quality work which is defined in the ford foundation s report p 2 in terms of opportunities that provide safe working conditions a fair income social protection and freedom of association and expression this definition of quality work in turn draws upon the concept of decent work which is broadly defined by the international labour organisation ilo in terms of work that is productive delivers a fair income with security and social protection safeguards basic rights offers equality of opportunity and treatment prospects for personal development and the chance for recognition and to have your voice heard behind both definitions is a emphasis upon what work should be and what types of practical steps and employment conditions would help improve the overall quality of work this is very different to the minimum threshold associated with free labour which is frequently understood to mean that the market should decide so long as workers are not subject to direct coercion there are similar differences between accepting a minimum wage and advocating for a living wage quality work is clearly not a goal which can be advanced using a single strategy or approach this is one of the main reasons why this round table has been organised since it is crucial to have a wide range of perspectives and experiences represented when thinking about ways forward this therefore makes this an excellent time to introduce our contributors to our quality work round table who all have a number of valuable insights and proposals to share on this topic what would it take to reach quality work for all our first contributor alejandra ancheita is the founder of the economic social and cultural rights project prodesc in mexico city she observes that precarity has become the general rule for workers in mexico and latin america more generally most workers are not able to collectively organise as an independent union they are not able to create contracts through collective bargaining their instability affects their other rights and many no longer have access to the right to housing health or education for themselves or their families when it comes to thinking about potential solutions she observes that companies use social responsibility mechanisms because they are cheap and make corporations appear as the good guys she therefore discusses a series of alternatives including an ongoing programme designed to defend the rights of mexicans temporarily migrating to the united states on both sides of the border she also makes the important point that worker organisation doesn t necessarily have to go through traditional unions what is important is that they are organised our second contributor anannya bhattacharjee draws upon her experience in the indian subcontinent where she works as the international coordinator of the asia floor wage alliance bhattacharjee observes that in india job creation is really the creation of miserable jobs at the same time it really wouldn t take much to make these jobs more decent she suggests that a good way to start is by recognising that business is not one monolithic thing there is big capital and there is small capital if we approach all businesses as capital and have the same approach to all of them then we won t make the most strategic alliances yet at the end of the day working conditions will only improve when workers organisations are at the table to discuss implement and monitor the solutions however this rarely happens due to antipathy towards trade unions or any kind of representative organisations we also have an important contribution from shawna bader blau the executive director of solidarity center a us based international worker rights organisation she observes that things have now got to the point where it s hard to do very simple things like form unions or come together as workers to achieve collective bargaining this situation has been further complicated by the growth of free trade agreements which enormously privilege the rights of investors over the rights of humans and the rights of workers improving the lives of workers requires action on multiple fronts including building bridges between labour movements and other social and political movements exposing the fundamental lawlessness behind wage theft and effective global regulation based upon human rights frameworks much of the focus of her contribution is the model provided by the recent accord on fire and building safety in bangladesh which is a negotiated agreement between workers and employers akin to collective bargaining building upon his decades of experience within the us state department luis c debaca identifies a number of promising strategies for reducing vulnerability and exploitation he observes that developed countries have allowed their labour inspectorates to be weakened over time this has important effects if you re not dealing with wage theft if you re not dealing with hours worked if you re not dealing with the ability to act through unions then don t be surprised when the most horrendous violations of enslavement and abuse end up happening this has resulted in a situation where criminal justice mechanisms have stepped in to provide partial cover but this also comes with complications if we re forced into saying that something is slavery or trafficking in order to go after somebody it exempts companies from having to create better workplaces by making only the most egregious important improving the lives of workers requires action on multiple fronts including investing in worker driven social responsibility which doesn t depend on the largesse of the company and while prosecution is only one tool amongst many for c debaca one of the things that makes it possible to have worker led social responsibility is the prospect of a boss going to jail when thinking about future steps c debaca also suggests that the fight against unscrupulous employers sometimes gets stopped by the intermural fights and navel gazing of the modern slavery movement or the anti trafficking movement or the labour movement or whatever we re wanting to call it these days this is followed by some reflections from han dongfang the executive director of china labour bulletin in hong kong dongfang observers that global supply chains set workers further and further away from each other even as the goods they produce become ever more closely related this in turn creates major difficulties when it comes to organising both locally and internationally and contributes to a loss of local and global bargaining power he therefore maintains that corporate social responsibility will never become an effective tool for protecting workers rights unless it involves the workers producing these goods as a bargaining partner the decades of experience of the china labour bulletin in helping to develop collective bargaining and organising in both china and more recently india provides a valuable model here even in china one of the worst countries for workers rights violations we have seen numerous examples of workers with a common grievance coming together and taking strategic and well thought out collective action to force their employer to the bargaining table the round table also greatly benefits from the experience of lupe gonzalo from the coalition of immokalee workers when thinking about potential solutions gonzalo observes that corporate social responsibility programmes exist to satisfy consumer demand for ethical products their primary purpose is to protect the brand by preventing consumers from taking their business somewhere else they are not meant to and do not succeed in protecting the human rights of workers or in reducing poverty for workers she instead makes the case for an alternative based upon the fair food program whose essential features can and have been replicated in many contexts she also endorses a model provided by a recent campaign targeting the fast food company wendy s we spent years working on a public campaign to educate consumers about the conditions in their supply chain in mexico we pushed really hard to convey the reality despite what wendy s was saying we combined that with action steps we were not only telling consumers what was happening but we gave them ways to help the value of worker driven social responsibility wsr is mentioned by a number of contributors to the round table it should come as no surprise that it features in the contribution by theresa haas and penelope kyritsis from the worker driven social responsibility network reflecting on the power now exercised by leading corporations within supply chains kyritsis observes that it has become very difficult for suppliers to maintain successful commercial relationships and comply with labour standards including minimum wage laws at the same time haas similarly observes that responsibility lies almost exclusively with the brands at the top of supply chains she therefore advances a case for wsr as an effective way of shifting power resources and control from the entities at the top to the workers at the bottom in ways that legally obligate companies to prioritise the needs and rights of workers when it comes to thinking about the future of work kyritsis makes the further point that it s not technology rendering workers vulnerable to extreme labour exploitation but the fact that wealth and power are not concentrated in the hands of workers computers aren t the problem we also greatly benefit from having a contribution from emily kenway from focus on labour exploitation building upon her extensive experience both inside and outside government kenway observes that global supply chains fragment responsibility and create a vacuum of accountability in relation to labour rights resulting in a situation where workers sometimes do not know what company they are working for echoing other contributors kenway is reluctant to endorse ethical investment models and ethical consumerism and instead recommends specifically targeting the exposure of governments to abuses within their own supply chains she also specifically endorses the fair food program as one of the best examples of worker led labour rights change out there today when summarising the current state of play she observes that we are bargaining for scraps at the moment against a legislative and global economic framework which empowers capital that has to change but it won t unless we make the right sorts of targeted disruptive systemic interventions we also have a second contribution from the indian subcontinent featuring reema nanavaty the director of the self employed women s association sewa she observes that the the majority of the workforce in india and in the global south are informally employed what has meant that their work remains invisible emphasising a point which comes up time and time again within the round table nanavaty argues that the primary and most effective route is to organise informal sector workers this gives them a collective strength their voice is heard their work gets visibility she also points to sewa s efforts to provide alternative employment including the establishment of a company run by garment and textile workers that employs 15 000 people as part of their ongoing lobby efforts sewa is mobilising in support of a floor living minimum wage for informal sector workers skills development social development and social protection programmes in the case of informal workers innovation is a crucial part of their coping strategy they have to keep innovating day in and day out for their own survival the round table also features elizabeth tang the executive director of the international domestic workers federation emphasising the ways in which different problems intersect tang observes that lots of domestic workers are also migrants and as migrants they also face another layer of discrimination it is very hard to ask for legal protections when the people around you do not think you deserve them given the scale of these challenges it is essential to specifically prioritise investment in organisation building and movement building she observes that lots of people only want to invest in the last step fix this problem change that policy but they don t realise that the first half the work that enables us to have the capacity to take that last step hasn t been done yet investing only in the last step can consume large amounts of resources but it will be less likely to succeed when faced with corporate power it is also crucial not to submit to fear one of employers most common tactics is to threaten to leave when we demand better conditions but often it s just a bluff some smaller operations can close and open easily but when we talk about the bigger ones it s not so easy i can t remember how many times coca cola has threatened to leave hong kong but they are still here our final contribution comes from alison tate who builds upon her experience at the international trade union confederation as part of her contribution tate identifies the emergence of a model of business that undermines the capacity for job security and income security as one of the main obstacles to promoting workers rights she argues that no job should be without a floor of universal social protection which includes certain benefits for when a worker is not able to access sufficient income no worker should be without a minimum living wage or the capacity to bargain for a fair contract price floor yet that s what we re seeing more and more in the digitalised and platform economy improving the lives of precarious workers therefore requires action on multiple fronts including building workers power organising the informal economy in innovative ways leveraging the power of pension funds strengthening labour courts rewriting the rules of the global economy and campaigning for a convention on the elimination of violence against women and men in the world of work this project is supported by the ford foundation but the viewpoints expressed here are explicitly those of the authors our support is not tacit endorsement within the aim was to highlight new ideas and we hope the result will be a lively and robust dialogue
there are two big parliamentary votes that the markets will need to look out for first up is the 12th march vote on theresa may s deal the second is a 14th march vote to decide whether the 29th march departure date should be delayed assuming theresa may s deal is thrown it and that is the current view when looking at the pound there does remain a slight chance of the 14th march vote not going the way the bulls out of the eurozone a heavy calendar was skewed to the positive while sentiment towards ecb monetary policy was a eur negative risk appetite provided support for the eur and european equities through the week consumer confidence in germany held its ground and the eurozone s unemployment rate fell to 7 8 in january a combination of positive consumer spending figures out of france and germany and stronger than expected labor market figures were also key in the week the eur closed out the week with a 0 26 gain the rise came even with inflationary pressures in the eurozone easing in february according to prelim figures manufacturing remains the key and while the threat of u s tariffs on eu exports to the u s remains every present there was a brief visit to 1 14 levels before easing back risk on sentiment also supported the european equity markets in the week hopes of a resolution to the u s china trade war supported the dax and eurostoxx50 to 1 26 and 1 27 gains respectively only the csi300 outperformed the pair the gains coming in spite of a pickup in the eur whether the eur and the equity majors can stand their ground remains to be seen the u s president and the ecb will likely be in control of the eur s fate this week elsewhere the loonie went for a dive on friday a 1 23 slide on friday saw the loonie give up gains from the week the canadian economy contracted in december ultimately supporting the material shift in the bank of canada s recent forward guidance with the boc s march interest rate decision due next week the loonie could be in for a spin a dovish boc and the loonie could hit c 1 34 levels against the u s dollar oil prices certainly haven t helped and neither has twitter trump tanked crude oil prices in the early part of the week which came before friday s sell off geo political risk focus had ultimately been on geopolitical risk the economy bundling along in support of robust labor market conditions and consumption trump s north korea summit in hanoi left the u s president empty handed which caught the markets by surprise an unwillingness by the u s to remove sanctions led to an abrupt end to the summit for the u s president there was then some time to respond to the chatter over michael cohen time will tell perhaps on who is telling the truth the trump attack was scathing but not enough to throw risk appetite into the abyss can the democrats and cohen demonstrate a link between campaign funds and the daniels pay off it could be quite a scandal the republicans have doused the flames for now but they re not out of the woods just yet while the north korea summit and cohen were certainly negatives u s china trade talks were ultimately positive while the djia closed out the week in the red the s p500 broke through to 2 800 levels for the first time since 8th november that s quite a bounce back from a late 2018 slide to 2 351 on christmas eve
foreign direct investment in canada rebounded in 2018 showing businesses may be regaining some of their confidence in an economy hampered by falling oil prices and trade uncertainty fdi rose to 51 3 billion last year statistics canada reported thursday the highest annual total since 2015 that included inflows of 16 4 billion in the final three months of the year which was the second highest quarterly total since 2015 the numbers represent a bounce back from a dismal 2017 when inflows fell to the lowest since 2010 amid an exodus of capital from the nation s oil patch and worries about the fate of the north american free trade agreement the bulk of foreign direct investments last year were in non energy sectors of the economy the report should also be a relief to policy makers who are counting on investment to contribute more to canada s economic expansion going forward as consumption spending from households slow the need to attract investment was one of the rationales for why prime minister justin trudeau s government introduced 14 billion in temporary write offs for capital investment in november while declining oil prices have made canada s oil patch less attractive the pick up in other sectors is encouraging priscilla thiagamoorthy an economist at bank of montreal said in a note to investors while the fdi numbers are promising it s still too early to say how much the overall business investment picture is improving the next big numbers come out friday when statistics canada releases national economic account data for the final three months of 2018 analysts will be gauging the extent of a rebound in business investment which tanked last summer amid uncertainty around nafta negotiations a separate survey from statistics canada released thursday showed a mixed picture for investment with canadian businesses planning to increase capital expenditures by 2 5 per cent in 2019 while not an acceleration from last year s pace there are signs of strength in some sectors like manufacturing fdi is an important source of capital to canada because it is a stable source of funding to finance spending the economy has needed almost 600 billion of foreign funding over the past decade including 59 billion last year much of that financing has been met by short term funds which makes canada more vulnerable to a sudden loss of interest from foreign investors
states have an opportunity to act to close the loopholes that hide and protect the wealth of the top 1 remedy the impact of the new federal tax law that lowers taxes on the wealthy and make critical investments in infrastructure energy systems and programs that create broader opportunity and shared prosperity concentrations of wealth are distorting our economy and undermining our democracy and civic health state administrations and state legislatures can act to close the loopholes put a brake on economic inequality and concentrations of wealth and generate significant revenue here is a menu of some of the most promising options taxes on high income earners the strong majority of americans support progressive taxes on the rich a joint stanford treasury department report showed that high taxes do not drive millionaires to move across state lines state legislatures have increased taxes on the wealthy in 2018 the new jersey legislature increased taxes on incomes over 5 million new york state and new york city have both increased taxes on high income households as has washington d c in 2016 tax increases on high income earners passed in both states where they were on the ballot california and maine in california voters extended the nation s highest top tax rate 13 3 percent on those making more than 1 million per year delivering an estimated 4 billion to 9 billion in annual revenue for human needs maine voters passed a 3 percent surtax on income over 200 000 in 2018 maine activists organized the first ballot initiative to fund universal home care through a payroll tax increase of 1 9 on salaries and wages over 127 000 a year in the face of a heavily funded opposition campaign the initiative failed to get majority support but caring across generations and other groups are working to apply lessons from this effort to similar campaigns in other states state estate taxation the estate tax is a levy on large fortunes when they are transferred from one generation to the next with exemption thresholds that shield middle and working class families before the bush tax cuts passed in 2001 every state in the nation collected revenue from the state estate tax credit which sent the first 16 percent of federal estate tax revenue to the states congress phased out this tax credit gradually until fully repealing it in 2005 re instating a progressive state estate tax in states that lost their state estate tax could generate significant revenue while reducing the concentration of wealth in intergenerational wealth dynasties in 2006 washington state voters supported their state estate tax by a nearly 2 to 1 margin with the revenue raised directly funding education in the state an education opportunity trust fund a state estate tax has the power to fund critically important public initiatives like debt free higher education and universal long term care while halting the rising wealth at the very top the california college for all coalition is pushing legislation and possibly a 2020 initiative to levy a progressive tax on california estates and fund free public higher education restoring the state s leadership role on accessible college the estate tax would generate an estimated 4 billion a year and provide aid to 2 6 million california residents tax on corporations with extreme gaps between ceo and worker pay in 2016 the city of portland oregon adopted the world s first tax penalty on corporations with extreme gaps between their ceo and worker pay the city s business license tax is 2 2 percent of adjusted net income the surtax is 10 percent of the business tax liability for companies with a ceo worker pay ratio of more than 100 to 1 and 25 percent for companies with a ratio of more than 250 to 1 more than 500 corporations that do business in the city including mega firms like wells fargo and walmart are subject to the surtax such tax penalties are easy to administer because u s publicly held corporations began reporting the ratio between their ceo and median worker pay to the sec in 2018 lawmakers in seven u s states and in the u s congress have introduced legislation similar to the portland tax california connecticut illinois massachusetts minnesota rhode island and washington these efforts build on the living wage movement by creating an incentive to pull down the top end of the pay scale while sending a message that everyone in a workplace contributes value not just the ceo carried interest tax states with significant financial sectors can take action to make up for washington s failure to close the carried interest loophole which allows private equity and hedge fund managers to reduce their tax bills by claiming a large share of their earnings as capital gains instead of ordinary income this has allowed many of the wealthiest americans to pay lower rates than firefighters and teachers legislation to close the carried interest loophole has been introduced in new york new jersey massachusetts connecticut rhode island maryland the district of columbia and illinois new york governor andrew cuomo has included a state level carried interest fairness fee in his budget proposal two years in a row financial transaction tax a financial transaction tax is a tiny fee at rates of a fraction of a percent on trades of financial instruments such as stocks bonds and derivatives such taxes are promoted as having the dual benefits of discouraging short term speculation while generating significant revenue the notion of instituting a financial transaction tax has gained increased attention at the federal level in recent years but congress has failed to take action this would not be relevant in states that do not have a large trading exchange the illinois state legislature is considering a bill that would place fees of 1 2 per contract on chicago s commodities and financial exchanges with revenue estimated at 10 billion to 12 billion per year state capital gains tax a capital gains tax is a levy on income from investments rather than wages in the 42 states including dc that impose capital gains taxes rates range from 3 1 percent in pennsylvania to 13 3 percent in california states without a capital gains tax should implement one and states that have one should increase the rate to at least 10 percent raising or introducing such taxes would mostly impact the wealthy since the top 1 percent owns half of the nation s financial wealth and the bottom 50 percent only own 0 5 percent of financial wealth state capital gains taxes help ensure fairness between those who work paycheck to paycheck and those who pocket dividends high end real estate taxes to fund affordable housing and other priorities cities and states should consider taxes on luxury real estate investments particularly unoccupied vacant properties a huge number of new luxury high rise properties have been purchased with many vacant and unoccupied and many purchased by shell corporations creating a method for the ultra wealthy to hide their wealth the impact has been to disrupt local real estate markets and push up existing housing prices for rent or sale higher and higher states can pass enabling legislation to allow cities and localities to address this problem through taxes on vacant unoccupied luxury units and can consider transfer taxes and laws to require beneficial ownership transparency in real estate transactions states could also institute graduated real estate transfer taxes taxing properties transferring over 1 million at progressively higher rates in 2016 san francisco voters approved a tax on high end real estate transactions that contribute to gentrification the tax raises additional revenue from commercial and residential real estate transfers over 5 million funds have been used to provide free tuition and stipends to san francisco residents at the city s community college new york city has implemented a new mansion tax on properties sold for more that 1 million this tax takes the form of an additional payment equal to 1 of the home s sales price the mayor may increase the tax and the plan would optimally bring in 200 million a year with some percentage proposed to support affordable housing in boston city councilors have proposed levying fees on high end real estate deals to help pay for more housing the proposal would set a tax of up to 6 percent on many commercial and residential sales over 2 million and establish a flipping tax of up to 25 percent on some properties that are sold twice within two years the fees could raise from 175 million to 350 million a year legislation has been introduced at the massachusetts state level that would enable other boston and other municipalities to implement luxury transfer taxes affordable housing coalitions in other major cities are exploring implementing high end real estate transfer taxes to off set the huge disruption that wealthy investors have caused in local housing markets many favor using the revenue to fund the creation and preservation of permanently affordable housing and homeownership several states have graduated real estate transfer tax rates and many more are exploring this as a means to capture the impact of wealthy investors on housing hawaii has a 2 percent real estate tax on sales between 600 000 and 1 million and a 3 percent tax on transfers valued over 1 million new jersey has a number of graduated rates with 1 21 percent on properties over 1 million luxury taxes a luxury tax is a duty levied on luxury goods such as high end automobiles and expensive yachts in connecticut the sales tax rate jumps from 6 35 percent to 7 75 percent on vehicles costing more than 50 000 jewelry costing more than 5 000 and apparel and footwear costing more than 1 000 the clothing tax also applies to handbags luggage umbrellas wallets or watches costing more than 1 000 in new jersey a tax penalizes both luxury cars and gas guzzlers by imposing a 0 4 percent surcharge on vehicles that have price tags above 45 000 or get less than 19 miles per gallon state payroll tax on high incomes federal payroll taxes for social security have a huge loophole for the wealthy in the form of a cap on the amount of income subject to the tax it s currently 128 400 and is adjusted annually for inflation this means a multi millionaire and someone earning 128 400 per year pay the same amount in social security payroll taxes not the same rate the same amount states can close this loophole by imposing a state level payroll tax on income above the federal cap see maine proposal detailed above state corporate income tax with the federal corporate tax rate dropping from 35 to 21 this is an opportune moment for states to recoup some of these funds by raising or introducing corporate income taxes forty four states levy a corporate income tax with rates ranging from 3 to 12 nevada ohio texas and washington impose gross receipts taxes instead of corporate

the weekly wrap the eur and the pound saw green while the loonie tanked it was a choppy week with economic data central bank chatter and geopolitics contributing to the moves in the week the stats if the markets were looking for some semblance of calm but the week was far from it with a mass of stats and some significant geopolitical events providing direction on the data front it was a mixed bag the data count was skewed to the negative with 41 of a total 83 stats monitored coming in below market forecasts through the week out of the u s consumer confidence got a boost in february suggesting that domestic consumption would continue to provide strong support to the u s economy for the housing sector the slide in mortgage rates likely contributed to a jump in pending home sales in january and building permits in december advertisement advertisement while both the manufacturing pmi surveys disappointed the chicago pmi surged in february the figures suggest that it s not all doom and gloom in the manufacturing sector the greenback found little love through the week rising by just 0 02 4th quarter gdp numbers could have been far worse slower u s economic growth in the 4th quarter and the fed s preferred core pce price index likely contributed to the dollar s flatness by the week concerns over the economic outlook continue to linger which has ultimately led to a shift in forward guidance by the fed fed chair powell s 2 day testimony to congress provided plenty of pressure on the dollar whilst providing further support to the u s equity markets out of the uk stats were limited to the uk s manufacturing pmi while the manufacturing sector saw output slow marginally there were no major alarm bells for the uk economy the lion s share of contribution to the economy comes from services and not manufacturing advertisement advertisement a light economic calendar worked in favor of the pound through the week following theresa may s decision to delay brexit s meaningful vote until 12th march support kicked in on expectations of a delay to britain s departure from the eu there are two big parliamentary votes that the markets will need to look out for first up is the 12th march vote on theresa may s deal the second is a 14th march vote to decide whether the 29th march departure date should be delayed story continues assuming theresa may s deal is thrown it and that is the current view when looking at the pound there does remain a slight chance of the 14th march vote not going the way the bulls out of the eurozone a heavy calendar was skewed to the positive while sentiment towards ecb monetary policy was a eur negative risk appetite provided support for the eur and european equities through the week consumer confidence in germany held its ground and the eurozone s unemployment rate fell to 7 8 in january a combination of positive consumer spending figures out of france and germany and stronger than expected labor market figures were also key in the week advertisement advertisement the eur closed out the week with a 0 26 gain the rise came even with inflationary pressures in the eurozone easing in february according to prelim figures manufacturing remains the key and while the threat of u s tariffs on eu exports to the u s remains every present there was a brief visit to 1 14 levels before easing back risk on sentiment also supported the european equity markets in the week hopes of a resolution to the u s china trade war supported the dax and eurostoxx50 to 1 26 and 1 27 gains respectively only the csi300 outperformed the pair the gains coming in spite of a pickup in the eur whether the eur and the equity majors can stand their ground remains to be seen the u s president and the ecb will likely be in control of the eur s fate this week elsewhere the loonie went for a dive on friday a 1 23 slide on friday saw the loonie give up gains from the week the canadian economy contracted in december ultimately supporting the material shift in the bank of canada s recent forward guidance with the boc s march interest rate decision due next week the loonie could be in for a spin a dovish boc and the loonie could hit c 1

was then some time to respond to the chatter over michael cohen time will tell perhaps on who is telling the truth the trump attack was scathing but not enough to throw risk appetite into the abyss can the democrats and cohen demonstrate a link between campaign funds and the daniels pay off it could be quite a scandal the republicans have doused the flames for now but they re not out of the woods just yet while the north korea summit and cohen were certainly negatives u s china trade talks were ultimately positive while the djia closed out the week in the red the s p500 broke through to

competition is important and we need to also make sure that we have the right settings for start up firms it s not simply a fairness agenda but it s a growth agenda labor has unveiled a suite of competition and small business policies to attack the market power of big companies including boosting the powers of the competition watchdog rise in monopsony power dr leigh argued that a slowdown in small business employment compared to large firms below advanced economy average research and development spending and rising job tenure were signs the economy had become less dynamic there is a sense of security about being in the same job but dynamic economies also have a fair degree of job shifting dr leigh said people get the biggest wage gains when they shift jobs to another firm advertisement less mobility between jobs was an example of what economists call monopsony power he said economists have long worried that a lack of choice means customers get overcharged now there s also a real concern that when workers can only choose between a few employers they end up getting underpaid dr leigh s thesis is open to debate among economists in contrast reserve bank of australia governor philip lowe has blamed subdued wage growth in recent years on the globalisation of the labour market and technology dr lowe has said the threat of competition through the offshoring of tasks and potential for automation to replace human workers may have made employees too timid in requesting pay rises and kept a lid on wages australian competition and consumer commission chairman rod sims has said the core of competition policy should be about protecting and promoting competition for the benefit of consumers he said in a speech in november it was counterproductive to expand the range of considerations to income inequality low wage growth or unemployment advertisement can t ignore the literature dr leigh a former corporate lawyer and economics professor at australian national university before being elected to parliament in 2010 has been influenced on perceived problems of growing power among large firms in the global economy by research by organisation for economic co operation and development economist australian dan andrews and by university of chicago economics professor luigi zingales you just can t ignore the huge international literature dr leigh said it s coming up at the jackson hole conference the economist magazine and chicago that is linking sluggish wage growth to competition research by the oecd concludes that the global productivity slowdown may partly be due to rising barriers to entry and a decline in the contestability of markets the oecd said in a november 2016 research paper that the gap in productivity between leading frontier and laggard firms was much more extreme in sectors where pro competitive product market reforms were least extensive advertisement the international monetary fund last month projected that australian real incomes per capita would barely grow over the next six years and joined the rba s dr lowe in calling for a major focus on boosting productivity through reforms to competition innovation tax and infrastructure rba research shows the share of industry sales accounted for by the largest australian businesses has gradually risen since the start of this century and business concentration has been most pronounced in the retail sector retail prices rose in the 2000s but in more recent years prices fell following the expansion of big foreign retailers such as aldi amazon and international fashion shops the average australian industry has become more concentrated since the start of this century rba economists noted in its december bulletin the retail trade sector appears to have become more competitive in recent times most notably among the largest retailers following a period of declining competition through the 2000s penalties are too low advertisement labor would more closely scrutinise anti competitive behaviour including by directing the accc to review company mergers twice in the 10 years after the consolidation to check the enlarged firms are not abusing their power and increasing prices unjustly if anti competitive abuses were discovered the accc would be empowered to take enforcement action against the merged company including if it had failed to follow undertakings given at the time of the merger a labor government would also increase monetary penalties for competition law violations such as collusion helping to boost the accc s litigation budget the penalties are too low and too often regarded as a cost of doing business dr leigh said we also think they need more litigation to make sure they are cracking down on anti competitive conduct the statement echoes the accc s mr sims who said last week he wanted to impose tougher penalties to hit the share prices of companies engaging in misconduct advertisement labor has pledged to give the accc a market studies power which would allow it to do intrusive probes of industries where anti competitive conduct is suspected including tougher powers for authorities to gather corporate documents and to compel witnesses at the moment the accc can look at sectors but can t use its powers to get all the evidence it needs dr leigh said you need proper information gathering powers to delve deeper a labor drafted access to justice law supported by the nationals that passed parliament last month gave small business the right to immediately seek an order not to pay their larger opponent s legal fees when taking a competition case to court dr leigh said the new law would help address a lack of public interest private litigation case by cash restrained small firms against big companies for anti competitive behaviour this is so they don t face bankruptcy from the costs of funding the other side s qcs among several other pro small business policies labor would make unfair contract terms illegal and introduce penalties to deter big companies acting unfairly against small business suppliers or customers

november in depth oil price outlook beware the dip oil prices could go lower without an actual geopolitical disruption by paul kuklinski boston energy research paul kuklinski boston energy research the spike in oil prices since august provides us producers an attractive opportunity to hedge their 2018 capital program with a typical lag it will likely result in acceleration in us oil production growth from 2q18 coupled with a seasonal dip in global demand in 1q18 which will cause sizable excess oil inventories to persist a correction in oil prices is likely surplus oil inventories are likely to remain through 2018 taking the steam out of the upward momentum in prices without an actual supply disruption inventories will still be above the 5 year average in 4q18 but smaller wti is 56 b in response to increased geopolitical anxiety up from an average of 49 33 b for the first 9 months in 2017 without high geopolitical risk or an actual supply reduction oil prices have downside risk

nobody is going to be ready when a category 5 hurricane slams into southeast florida flattens miami bankrupts insurance companies threatens a foreclosure crisis and sends financial shockwaves across the world mes next will be even more shocking the storm s financial aftermath could spiral outwards from florida creating conditions that inevitably draw comparisons to the 2008 wall street crash the conventional wisdom is that a scenario like this is so unlikely to occur that it s almost not worth discussing the odds of a worst case hurricane making landfall in florida in any given year is low insurance companies have sophisticated strategies for mitigating risk and the financial system by and large is insulated from physically destructive events even 9 11 for instance caused a stock market downturn that only lasted a month yet in recent weeks vice spoke with financial political and scientific experts including a former special assistant to president barack obama the dean of science of a major canadian university and a uk organization on the global vanguard of disaster modeling who believe that conventional wisdom has its limits without wanting to be seen as alarmists by overstating dangers these experts think it s crucial that we question and challenge common assumptions around financial risk they point out that a warmer climate is making hurricanes more severe and destructive above average temperatures are increasing the rainfall of tropical cyclones between 5 to 10 percent while rising seas add to the intensity of flooding at the same time there are structural aspects of the insurance industry that are more opaque and perhaps riskier than the public thinks creating the potential for localized financial damage from a massive hurricane to quickly spread internationally a process similar to what happened during the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 though even the worst physical disasters have had little impact historically on global markets there is reason to believe that above a certain financial and even psychological threshold natural catastrophes can weaken economies and ultimately lead to damaging recessions given all that the experts vice spoke with think it s reasonable to wonder whether society is massively underestimating the economic dangers posed by rising global temperatures this has disturbing implications for all cities on the front lines of extreme weather and southeast florida in particular it could mean under a specific set of conditions that miami is a ticking financial time bomb waiting any day now to be detonated by climate change one version of a worst case hurricane for florida is a storm that makes landfall just south of miami heads slightly inland then moves steadily up the east coast this is the scenario of maximum devastation explained shahid hamid a finance professor at florida international university s international hurricane research center because part of the hurricane will be able to draw heat from the ocean while slamming miami fort lauderdale palm beach melbourne jacksonville and orlando with the strongest possible winds the hurricane is basically buzzsawing through the cities hamid said if this were to happen it could also create a ten foot storm surge that demolishes homes and blocks the streets with debris south florida is not remotely prepared for a category 3 or higher hurricane bryan norcross who was a tv meteorologist in miami during hurricane andrew which killed 65 people in 1992 warned the washington post in 2017 people will be stuck in buildings with no power no water likely little or no communications and no way to get out or get people in with supplies and aid for an extended time after the storm hamid thinks the probability is very low of this ever happening but he added that the scenario almost became real in 2017 when i saw the track of irma that was being predicted two to three days out it looked similar to the track of our worst case scenario irma killed dozens of people as it ripped through the caribbean but mellowed as it approached florida fortunately the hurricane weakened and moved west to the less populated areas hamid said over 60 percent of homes in florida lost power and ten people died still he added we dodged a bullet this time we may not be so lucky a florida condo building damaged by hurricane andrew in 1992 photo by steve starr corbis corbis via getty when hurricane andrew made landfall in florida it destroyed over 125 000 homes and caused 26 5 billion in damage to this day it s still considered one of the most destructive hurricanes ever but the value of coastal property in florida has grown from 870 billion to more than 3 7 trillion in the intervening years when today s worst case hurricane lands in miami it could cause 150 billion of insured losses according to hamid s estimates that only includes wind damage to people s homes not to structures like strip malls and office buildings nor flooding losses from a storm surge in 2015 boston based catastrophe modelers karen clark and company projected insured damage losses from a massive hurricane striking miami directly at 250 billion but even that number could be low last year the centre for risk studies at cambridge university s judge business school modelled a slightly different catastrophe than the one described by hamid in this one a category 4 hurricane first makes landfall in florida bay slightly south of miami with 147 mph winds it then heads northwest blasting tampa crossing the gulf of mexico and making a second landfall as a category 3 hurricane near pensacola in this scenario most of florida s coastal airports and seaports experience heavy damage further exacerbated by port closures national import and export rates fall by approximately 5 within a fortnight of the disaster writes the centre for risk studies it takes two years to fully rebuild everyone s homes the total physical damage exceeds 1 35 trillion this is an important threshold in disasters we commonly see today you ve got losses in the hundreds of billions of dollars oliver carpenter a research assistant at the centre who studies natural catastrophes and the global economy told vice as financial fallout from the disaster spreads from florida it may put 2 35 trillion of world gdp at risk the 2017 atlantic hurricane season for example caused 282 billion in damage that s relatively fickle in the grand scheme of things he argued for reference about 169 billion was traded each day on the new york stock exchange as of 2013 hurricane katrina which caused 125 billion in losses and may have had a total economic cost of 250 billion had a negligible impact on financial markets even as it caused massive amounts of human misery and death based on historical experience it s reasonable to conclude that even the most destructive catastrophes pose relatively little risk to the wider economy but damage over 1 trillion may challenge that logic that s the threshold when these losses have a noticeable impact and spread to the global economy carpenter explained the centre for risk studies estimated someone with a high quality investment portfolio could see a 6 percent drop in returns following the worst case miami hurricane as financial fallout from the disaster spreads from florida it may put 2 35 trillion of world gdp at risk though this likely wouldn t cause a recession the weakened economies that result would be more vulnerable to any other shocks that could occur coincidentally during the recovery period and make a recession more likely the centre s study reads while discussing catastrophic natural disasters in general it adds that this is thought to be towards the upper end of current scientific constraints but it is plausible that even larger magnitude events could occur flooding in pensacola florida in 2014 photo by marianna massey getty a storm of this size may have dire impacts for insurers hamid estimates florida s private insurers have the capacity to pay about 60 billion in claims following a major catastrophe a category 5 hurricane demolishing miami is way beyond the capacity of the insurance companies hamid argued some of the companies certainly will go under that 60 billion safety net includes something called reinsurance or insurance for insurers knowing that an unexpected disaster could drive them bankrupt insurers pay companies such as munich reinsurance company or berkshire hathaway to take on some of the risk these reinsurers also don t want to be on the hook for a disaster so they trade financial risk among themselves in the retrocession market it s a complicated market and it s very opaque said matt davison the dean of science at ontario s western university and co author of a 2016 bank of canada paper looking at systemic risk in reinsurance sometimes risks are traded and then traded again and then traded again in complicated layers and even the people trading them are no longer quite exactly sure which risk they re buying as long as losses don t exceed a certain threshold the system spreads and dampens financial risk but what we wanted to look at is what happens if one company in the chain fails he said the trigger may be a disaster or more likely a series of them more costly than anything in recent human history there are relatively few such potential events davison s paper argues although one such might be a miami hurricane in the aftermath a reinsurance company could receive a gigantic claim from an insurance company it has trouble paying something like that happens davison said it weakens company a at the same time company a is believing it s going to get a big check from company b through the retrocession market and it doesn t because company b is bankrupt now company a is even weaker it goes down now contracts with company c are in question and the whole thing spins out of control this is similar to what happened in the financial crash of 2008 risky mortgages were bundled into collateralized debt obligations and traded on financial markets led to financial products that were thought to be very safe they turned out to be not safe at all davidson said in some ways the retrocession market has some formal similarities on a financial structure basis davison is quick to add that this on its own doesn t mean the reinsurance sector is unsafe under most circumstances the trading of risk helps prevent a spiraling crisis i don t want to be alarmist here and say oh wow there s going to be another financial crisis coming from insurance i don t believe that s the case for a florida hurricane to pose systemic risk to the sector there kind of needs to be a uniquely bad constellation of events he said yet we re moving into an era of extreme weather that s challenging our ability to assess and manage risk a paper published last year in the academic journal nature climate change noted that warmer atmospheric temperatures are causing multiple stresses at once on our natural and social systems in 2018 for instance heat waves and drought in california led to the worst wildfires in state history and the bankruptcy of utility company pg e that same year hurricane michael became likely the strongest hurricane to hit florida and the us since hurricane andrew disasters will become more interlinked and harder to predict leading one of the paper s authors to describe a future that s like a terror movie that is real but it s an open debate whether the insurance industry or the wider financial system actually faces any near term risk from climate disaster daniel schwarcz a university of minnesota law professor and insurance expert who s testified before us congressional committees told vice most of the risk of climate change really isn t being held by insurers right now policies for property damage are renewed annually insurers are only exposed for the next year and they ve survived things like katrina he noted there could be some terrible storms in a given year and frankly they could really hit the industry hard but they can always recalibrate insurers can leave risky markets or raise prices they understand that there s massive risk associated with climate schwarcz said they re not taking it on that strategy has worked fine in the past but moody s investor service argued last year that climate change is challenging long held assumptions risk modeling and pricing will experience an extra layer of uncertainty since climate change tends to produce an unpredictable environment that makes assessing and pricing risk more difficult it wrote despite that warning berkshire hathaway ceo warren buffett told yahoo finance in 2018 that climate change is not really an insurance risk waterfront property on florida s marco island photo by creative touch imaging ltd nurphoto via getty in an ideal world the insurance industry would help us adapt to a warming planet by informing the public of risks insurers determine the likelihood of disasters using catastrophe models the cost of those disasters is then factored into insurance rates and when rates rise high enough towns and cities relocate away from high risk areas or at least they should that s not what s happening in florida which in recent years has seen a record setting coastal real estate boom even as the risk of flooding and hurricanes intensifies in 2017 for example a florida developer sold over 300 million worth of units in a building called the bristol making it the most expensive condo development in palm beach county history though the boom shows signs of slowing down there are currently homes worth a combined 6 4 trillion at risk of flooding in miami beach alone none of this would likely be possible without state subsidies that reduce the price of insurance and expose florida to huge financial risk if a series of weather events devastates florida losses could leave the state in a financially awkward position wrote storm risk expert lorilee medders in 2017 the state would virtually be forced to tax the business and tourism base more heavily to make up the shortfall a risky option in some worst worst case scenarios florida could face wide scale population emigration sustaining a heavy loss of its tax base michael wara a lawyer and research fellow at stanford s steyer taylor center for energy policy and finance explained to vice in january that if this comes to pass you could easily see the state of florida go bankrupt this increases pressure for a bailout from the federal government one form the bailout could come in is through a huge payout of claims from the national flood insurance program which insures 1 7 million florida households against flood disasters even though the federal program is in over 20 billion of debt it d be extremely difficult to deny aid to people suffering in the wake of a catastrophe it s just too hard for political leaders to say no we re going to stand firm in our fiscal beliefs and not get help to our constituents said alice hill a former special assistant to president barack obama and a research fellow at stanford s hoover institution even with a federal government bailout a severe enough hurricane could cause a psychological tipping point for developers insurers realtors buyers and investors who decide it s just too risky to stay in florida what we want to prevent is that canary in the coal mine effect where insurance companies pull out of the miami market which could have a catastrophic economic impact even before the climactic events miami mayor francis suarez said in february alternately homeowners who face skyrocketing insurance costs in the wake of a disaster may walk away from their mortgages threatening a foreclosure crisis when i was in the white house there was talk of how much do we really want to be widely known hill said you could have a sudden fall in the market prices without a hurricane it could be just a mass realization that all of this property is severely compromised that would be highly destabilizing to real estate markets warnings have gotten louder over time in 2016 sean becketti chief economist at mortgage company freddie mac argued that climate change could trigger financial chaos by destroying coastal property and forcing millions of people from their homes the economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and great recession he wrote the parallels with 2008 don t end there over the past decade there has been a boom in the growth of catastrophe bonds insurance products transferring the risk of hurricanes and other disasters to buyers on wall street and beyond a secondary market that is different from the traditional reinsurance market managers who work in the industry have explicitly compared what they re doing to the creation of mortgage backed securities in the 2000s a financial innovation that transferred mortgage risk to wall street and helped cause the 2008 crash when those mortgages turned out to be much riskier than people thought industry analyst jay patel warned in 2016 that people who invest in catastrophe bonds may not understand what exactly they are getting themselves into this sounds eerily familiar to the way investors behaved towards another seemingly obscure bond market before the financial crisis catastrophe bond site artemis replied that this is a lazy way to avoid delving into the idiosyncrasies of what is a sophisticated asset class nobody outside the readers of a few arcane industry journals seemed to notice that exchange however there are not many journalists paying any attention to the insurance industry ross hammond who works on the activist campaign insure our future told vice but when insurance insiders are making comparisons to the subprime mortgage crash it s probably worth looking into it blows hammond s mind that industry leaders and our entire society for that matter continue to treat climate change as an easily predictable threat in the case of a category 5 hurricane hitting miami he said that ain t going to be gradual
nobody is going to be ready when a category 5 hurricane slams into southeast florida flattens miami bankrupts insurance companies threatens a foreclosure crisis and sends financial shockwaves across the world mes next will be even more shocking the storm s financial aftermath could spiral outwards from florida creating conditions that inevitably draw comparisons to the 2008 wall street crash the conventional wisdom is that a scenario like this is so unlikely to occur that it s almost not worth discussing the odds of a worst case hurricane making landfall in florida in any given year is low insurance companies have sophisticated strategies for mitigating risk and the financial system by and large is insulated from physically destructive events even 9 11 for instance caused a stock market downturn that only lasted a month yet in recent weeks vice spoke with financial political and scientific experts including a former special assistant to president barack obama the dean of science of a major canadian university and a uk organization on the global vanguard of disaster modeling who believe that conventional wisdom has its limits without wanting to be seen as alarmists by overstating dangers these experts think it s crucial that we question and challenge common assumptions around financial risk they point out that a warmer climate is making hurricanes more severe and destructive above average temperatures are increasing the rainfall of tropical cyclones between 5 to 10 percent while rising seas add to the intensity of flooding at the same time there are structural aspects of the insurance industry that are more opaque and perhaps riskier than the public thinks creating the potential for localized financial damage from a massive hurricane to quickly spread internationally a process similar to what happened during the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008 though even the worst physical disasters have had little impact historically on global markets there is reason to believe that above a certain financial and even psychological threshold natural catastrophes can weaken economies and ultimately lead to damaging recessions given all that the experts vice spoke with think it s reasonable to wonder whether society is massively underestimating the economic dangers posed by rising global temperatures this has disturbing implications for all cities on the front lines of extreme weather and southeast florida in particular it could mean under a specific set of conditions that miami is a ticking financial time bomb waiting any day now to be detonated by climate change one version of a worst case hurricane for florida is a storm that makes landfall just south of miami heads slightly inland then moves steadily up the east coast this is the scenario of maximum devastation explained shahid hamid a finance professor at florida international university s international hurricane research center because part of the hurricane will be able to draw heat from the ocean while slamming miami fort lauderdale palm beach melbourne jacksonville and orlando with the strongest possible winds the hurricane is basically buzzsawing through the cities hamid said if this were to happen it could also create a ten foot storm surge that demolishes homes and blocks the streets with debris south florida is not remotely prepared for a category 3 or higher hurricane bryan norcross who was a tv meteorologist in miami during hurricane andrew which killed 65 people in 1992 warned the washington post in 2017 people will be stuck in buildings with no power no water likely little or no communications and no way to get out or get people in with supplies and aid for an extended time after the storm hamid thinks the probability is very low of this ever happening but he added that the scenario almost became real in 2017 when i saw the track of irma that was being predicted two to three days out it looked similar to the track of our worst case scenario irma killed dozens of people as it ripped through the caribbean but mellowed as it approached florida fortunately the hurricane weakened and moved west to the less populated areas hamid said over 60 percent of homes in florida lost power and ten people died still he added we dodged a bullet this time we may not be so lucky a florida condo building damaged by hurricane andrew in 1992 photo by steve starr corbis corbis via getty when hurricane andrew made landfall in florida it destroyed over 125 000 homes and caused 26 5 billion in damage to this day it s still considered one of the most destructive hurricanes ever but the value of coastal property in florida has grown from 870 billion to more than 3 7 trillion in the intervening years when today s worst case hurricane lands in miami it could cause 150 billion of insured losses according to hamid s estimates that only includes wind damage to people s homes not to structures like strip malls and office buildings nor flooding losses from a storm surge in 2015 boston based catastrophe modelers karen clark and company projected insured damage losses from a massive hurricane striking miami directly at 250 billion but even that number could be low last year the centre for risk studies at cambridge university s judge business school modelled a slightly different catastrophe than the one described by hamid in this one a category 4 hurricane first makes landfall in florida bay slightly south of miami with 147 mph winds it then heads northwest blasting tampa crossing the gulf of mexico and making a second landfall as a category 3 hurricane near pensacola in this scenario most of florida s coastal airports and seaports experience heavy damage further exacerbated by port closures national import and export rates fall by approximately 5 within a fortnight of the disaster writes the centre for risk studies it takes two years to fully rebuild everyone s homes the total physical damage exceeds 1 35 trillion this is an important threshold in disasters we commonly see today you ve got losses in the hundreds of billions of dollars oliver carpenter a research assistant at the centre who studies natural catastrophes and the global economy told vice as financial fallout from the disaster spreads from florida it may put 2 35 trillion of world gdp at risk the 2017 atlantic hurricane season for example caused 282 billion in damage that s relatively fickle in the grand scheme of things he argued for reference about 169 billion was traded each day on the new york stock exchange as of 2013 hurricane katrina which caused 125 billion in losses and may have had a total economic cost of 250 billion had a negligible impact on financial markets even as it caused massive amounts of human misery and death based on historical experience it s reasonable to conclude that even the most destructive catastrophes pose relatively little risk to the wider economy but damage over 1 trillion may challenge that logic that s the threshold when these losses have a noticeable impact and spread to the global economy carpenter explained the centre for risk studies estimated someone with a high quality investment portfolio could see a 6 percent drop in returns following the worst case miami hurricane as financial fallout from the disaster spreads from florida it may put 2 35 trillion of world gdp at risk though this likely wouldn t cause a recession the weakened economies that result would be more vulnerable to any other shocks that could occur coincidentally during the recovery period and make a recession more likely the centre s study reads while discussing catastrophic natural disasters in general it adds that this is thought to be towards the upper end of current scientific constraints but it is plausible that even larger magnitude events could occur flooding in pensacola florida in 2014 photo by marianna massey getty a storm of this size may have dire impacts for insurers hamid estimates florida s private insurers have the capacity to pay about 60 billion in claims following a major catastrophe a category 5 hurricane demolishing miami is way beyond the capacity of the insurance companies hamid argued some of the companies certainly will go under that 60 billion safety net includes something called reinsurance or insurance for insurers knowing that an unexpected disaster could drive them bankrupt insurers pay companies such as munich reinsurance company or berkshire hathaway to take on some of the risk these reinsurers also don t want to be on the hook for a disaster so they trade financial risk among themselves in the retrocession market it s a complicated market and it s very opaque said matt davison the dean of science at ontario s western university and co author of a 2016 bank of canada paper looking at systemic risk in reinsurance sometimes risks are traded and then traded again and then traded again in complicated layers and even the people trading them are no longer quite exactly sure which risk they re buying as long as losses don t exceed a certain threshold the system spreads and dampens financial risk but what we wanted to look at is what happens if one company in the chain fails he said the trigger may be a disaster or more likely a series of them more costly than anything in recent human history there are relatively few such potential events davison s paper argues although one such might be a miami hurricane in the aftermath a reinsurance company could receive a gigantic claim from an insurance company it has trouble paying something like that happens davison said it weakens company a at the same time company a is believing it s going to get a big check from company b through the retrocession market and it doesn t because company b is bankrupt now company a is even weaker it goes down now contracts with company c are in question and the whole thing spins out of control this is similar to what happened in the financial crash of 2008 risky mortgages were bundled into collateralized debt obligations and traded on financial markets led to financial products that were thought to be very safe they turned out to be not safe at all davidson said in some ways the retrocession market has some formal similarities on a financial structure basis davison is quick to add that this on its own doesn t mean the reinsurance sector is unsafe under most circumstances the trading of risk helps prevent a spiraling crisis i don t want to be alarmist here and say oh wow there s going to be another financial crisis coming from insurance i don t believe that s the case for a florida hurricane to pose systemic risk to the sector there kind of needs to be a uniquely bad constellation of events he said yet we re moving into an era of extreme weather that s challenging our ability to assess and manage risk a paper published last year in the academic journal nature climate change noted that warmer atmospheric temperatures are causing multiple stresses at once on our natural and social systems in 2018 for instance heat waves and drought in california led to the worst wildfires in state history and the bankruptcy of utility company pg e that same year hurricane michael became likely the strongest hurricane to hit florida and the us since hurricane andrew disasters will become more interlinked and harder to predict leading one of the paper s authors to describe a future that s like a terror movie that is real but it s an open debate whether the insurance industry or the wider financial system actually faces any near term risk from climate disaster daniel schwarcz a university of minnesota law professor and insurance expert who s testified before us congressional committees told vice most of the risk of climate change really isn t being held by insurers right now policies for property damage are renewed annually insurers are only exposed for the next year and they ve survived things like katrina he noted there could be some terrible storms in a given year and frankly they could really hit the industry hard but they can always recalibrate insurers can leave risky markets or raise prices they understand that there s massive risk associated with climate schwarcz said they re not taking it on that strategy has worked fine in the past but moody s investor service argued last year that climate change is challenging long held assumptions risk modeling and pricing will experience an extra layer of uncertainty since climate change tends to produce an unpredictable environment that makes assessing and pricing risk more difficult it wrote despite that warning berkshire hathaway ceo warren buffett told yahoo finance in 2018 that climate change is not really an insurance risk waterfront property on florida s marco island photo by creative touch imaging ltd nurphoto via getty in an ideal world the insurance industry would help us adapt to a warming planet by informing the public of risks insurers determine the likelihood of disasters using catastrophe models the cost of those disasters is then factored into insurance rates and when rates rise high enough towns and cities relocate away from high risk areas or at least they should that s not what s happening in florida which in recent years has seen a record setting coastal real estate boom even as the risk of flooding and hurricanes intensifies in 2017 for example a florida developer sold over 300 million worth of units in a building called the bristol making it the most expensive condo development in palm beach county history though the boom shows signs of slowing down there are currently homes worth a combined 6 4 trillion at risk of flooding in miami beach alone none of this would likely be possible without state subsidies that reduce the price of insurance and expose florida to huge financial risk if a series of weather events devastates florida losses could leave the state in a financially awkward position wrote storm risk expert lorilee medders in 2017 the state would virtually be forced to tax the business and tourism base more heavily to make up the shortfall a risky option in some worst worst case scenarios florida could face wide scale population emigration sustaining a heavy loss of its tax base michael wara a lawyer and research fellow at stanford s steyer taylor center for energy policy and finance explained to vice in january that if this comes to pass you could easily see the state of florida go bankrupt this increases pressure for a bailout from the federal government one form the bailout could come in is through a huge payout of claims from the national flood insurance program which insures 1 7 million florida households against flood disasters even though the federal program is in over 20 billion of debt it d be extremely difficult to deny aid to people suffering in the wake of a catastrophe it s just too hard for political leaders to say no we re going to stand firm in our fiscal beliefs and not get help to our constituents said alice hill a former special assistant to president barack obama and a research fellow at stanford s hoover institution even with a federal government bailout a severe enough hurricane could cause a psychological tipping point for developers insurers realtors buyers and investors who decide it s just too risky to stay in florida what we want to prevent is that canary in the coal mine effect where insurance companies pull out of the miami market which could have a catastrophic economic impact even before the climactic events miami mayor francis suarez said in february alternately homeowners who face skyrocketing insurance costs in the wake of a disaster may walk away from their mortgages threatening a foreclosure crisis when i was in the white house there was talk of how much do we really want to be widely known hill said you could have a sudden fall in the market prices without a hurricane it could be just a mass realization that all of this property is severely compromised that would be highly destabilizing to real estate markets warnings have gotten louder over time in 2016 sean becketti chief economist at mortgage company freddie mac argued that climate change could trigger financial chaos by destroying coastal property and forcing millions of people from their homes the economic losses and social disruption may happen gradually but they are likely to be greater in total than those experienced in the housing crisis and great recession he wrote the parallels with 2008 don t end there over the past decade there has been a boom in the growth of catastrophe bonds insurance products transferring the risk of hurricanes and other disasters to buyers on wall street and beyond a secondary market that is different from the traditional reinsurance market managers who work in the industry have explicitly compared what they re doing to the creation of mortgage backed securities in the 2000s a financial innovation that transferred mortgage risk to wall street and helped cause the 2008 crash when those mortgages turned out to be much riskier than people thought industry analyst jay patel

for president addo dankwa akufo addo the salient hallmark of a progressive modern state and society is fiscal managerial efficiency and or competence in his third state of the nation address sona 3 nana akufo addo painfully lamented the fact that within the short temporal space of just 62 years or a little over two generations since the country s reassertion of its sovereignty from british colonial imperialism ghana has had to desperately resort to the international monetary fund imf 17 times for fiscal management lectures lessons and financial assistance which pretty much contradicts the smug and sanguine declaration by president kwame nkrumah on the eve of ghana s independence to wit that the african was ready to demonstrate to the rest of the world in particular the white supremacist west that s he was more than capable of managing his her own affairs to this end nana akufo addo more than any other ghanaian leader in recent memory emphasized the imperative need for ghanaians to take effective control of their own fiscal affairs we cannot make the progress that we desire unless we are consistent and disciplined in the management of our economy the yo yo nature of the boom and bust has not helped us achieve our goal of sustained prosperity and lift us out of poverty we have gone through another painful round of impositions to get to where we are today with healthy fundamentals he further announced that ghana was in the process of weaning itself from the excruciating straitjacket of imf world bank conditionalities by april of this year we of course also need to significantly add that most of the 17 times that ghana had to beggarly resort to the imf and the world bank for both basic lessons on how to efficiently manage the country s economy as well as receive loans and financial assistance from these bretton woods institutions occurred under the rawlings led government of the faux socialist national democratic congress and before the latter the provisional national defense council pndc equally important to underscore is the fact that both the provisional national defense council and the national democratic congress doggedly pursued faux socialist agendas because both of these extortionate political machines were far more populist in orientation than they were progressive needless to say nearly every welfare oriented quality of life improvement policy initiative ever implemented in the country over the course of the past quarter century was put in place by the john agyekum kufuor led government of the new patriotic party npp and presently the akufo addo led administration of the new patriotic party nana akufo addo also poignantly observed that bitter complaints of acute hardships and all under his two year old government the fact of the matter is that when he assumed the democratic reins of governance in 2017 ghana s economic growth hovered at a dismal low of 3 4 percent of the country s gross domestic product gdp and this was under the four and half year tenure of the john dramani mahama led regime of the national democratic congress by the close of 2017 or just under a year of his assumption of the country s mantle of leadership economic growth had more than doubled to 8 1 percent what the foregoing glaringly means is that nana akufo addo s immediate predecessor to wit former president mahama had miserably flunked all the lessons taught him by the crackerjack economic mavens of the bretton woods establishment which of course ought to sober up those grossly misguided and fanatical party delegates who recently voted to have according to the national democratic congress own founding father former president jerry john rawlings who reportedly either failed or flatly refused to vote in the ndc s most recent presidential nomination primary the most thoroughgoing corrupt ghanaian leader in the postcolonial era return to the jubilee flagstaff house the nation s deficit or state of indebtedness according to the president has been cut down in half from a relatively staggering 7 3 percent to just under 4 percent the rebasing of the statistical figures reflecting the purportedly real growth of a country s economy is known to be a very controversial issue by critics who suspect a suave and underhanded cooking of the books as it were in order to fudge up a palatable economic development narrative that may not necessarily reflect the practical reality on the ground we must however also quickly point out the fact that it was the john evans atta mills led government of the national democratic congress that first rebased the country s economic growth in 2010 that is shortly after the late president mills assumed the democratic reins of governance from the agyekum kufuor led new patriotic party on the whole it is clearly as if a lot more could be done to significantly bring down the nation s debt to gdp rate from the 56 6 percentage points bequeathed the akufo addo administration by the mahama regime to the present level of 54 8 percent in other words it clearly looks as if ghana has yet to fully recuperate from the economic funk or doldrums in which the country well appears to have been stuck for about a decade now the preceding grim economic picture notwithstanding bearing in mind the massive collapse of mushroom taxpayer scamming banks nearly every single one of which was established with the criminal complicity of the mahama government and the deleterious effect of money laundering which besieged the beginning of the akufo addo administration largely a scorch earth strategy of the departing mahama amissah arthur regime the drop in inflation from 15 4 percent at the end of 2016 to the present level of 9 percent ought to give ghanaians reasonable cause for celebration but of course we are all well aware of the fact that the practical impact of deflation or inflationary reduction must first be palpably felt in a woman s purse passbook and a man

bitcoins and bolivars two hot potatoes it was just a little more than a decade ago when satoshi nakamoto ushered in what has become the era of private cryptocurrencies nakamoto s vision was clearly laid out in a whitepaper bitcoin a peer to peer cash system nakamoto s bitcoin money machine or as larry white refers to it a private algorithmic central bank was going to wipe out the inflation risk and the accompanying loss of purchasing power that plague fiat monies issued by government controlled central banks alas bitcoin s source code that predetermines its supply is set on a fixed quantity path that is unresponsive to changes in demand in consequence bitcoin inhabits a demand supply space in which supply is almost perfectly inelastic so to reach a demand supply equilibrium all the adjustment falls on the back of bitcoin s price read purchasing power as a result bitcoin s price is inherently volatile and unstable indeed small changes in demand in the face of an inelastic supply create a price volatility storm furthermore unless more demand can be attracted to bitcoin there is no reason why its price should trend upwards as many have been led to believe if speculation wanes bitcoin s price could trend downwards indeed bitcoin s design guarantees volatility which inhibits its widespread use in short it is very risky to hold bitcoins or accept them for deferred payments since bitcoin is such an unstable unit of account it should be viewed as a speculative asset not a currency some equally unstable units of account are considered currencies simply because they are issued by central banks and are legal tender the venezuelan bolivar is but one example this raises a question if you had to be paid for a day s hard work in bitcoins or bolivars which would you choose in 2018 that would have been a tough question to answer indeed the value of both assets made a race to the bottom of the barrel twenty years of socialism and scandalous central bank policy in venezuela produced an annual hyperinflation in venezuela of 80 000 yr at the end of 2018 when compared with the u s dollar the bolivar lost 99 87 of its purchasing power in 2018 the bolivar was totally wiped out it is no surprise that venezuelans treat the bolivar as if it were a hot potato bitcoin s decentralized public ledger and leaderless source code were supposed to have solved the problems thrown up by central banks like venezuela s but crazed speculators pumped bitcoin s price up to a high of 20 000 per bitcoin in december 2017 before it plummeted to under 4 000 by the end of 2018 like the bolivar bitcoin was a hot potato too faced with two hot potatoes what would you do in a weekend op ed in the new york times carlos hernández a venezuelan reported that for him the bitcoin has been less hot than the bolivar and he is not the only venezuelan who harbors those sentiments aside from russia venezuela accounts for the second largest volume of bitcoin trading in the world the title of hernández s op ed is can bitcoin save venezuelans to this question hernández answers in the affirmative in doing so hernandez recounts how he uses bitcoins one might ask how does he convert one hot potato bitcoin for another bolivar so that he can buy milk to do this hernández uses a peer to peer electronic trading platform in his case he uses localbitcoins com but there are other platforms such as airtm where i serve as a member of the board of directors what hernández and other crypto enthusiasts miss is that it isn t bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies that are going to save venezuela instead it is peer to peer electronic trading platforms that join buyers and sellers in free exchange that will mitigate the pain of the venezuela s hyperinflation these allow holders of hot potatoes to freely unload them for real money that can be used to purchase real things to demonstrate the value of peer to peer platforms and how they can transform non currency cryptos into real money and increase the demand for cryptos i and my colleagues at airtm have embarked on the airdrop venezuela campaign our goal is to raise 1 million and transfer it to 100 000 qualifying venezuelans the modalities are simple donors gift cryptos to the airdrop these are distributed to the wallets of venezuelans registered on the airtm platform then the venezuelans will have a choice do they speculate on the value of the cryptos and retain them or do they offer them for sale on airtm s platform where they can be exchanged for real money such as u s dollars by steve h hanke www cato

a new economic forecast shows minnesota s revenue is declining and the economic outlook for both the state and nation is weakening a projected state surplus of 1 5 billion has shrunk by a third in less than three months trade disputes retaliatory tariffs and a major overhaul in federal tax policy are all contributing factors so is an aging population both here and across the country minnesota s increasingly tight labor market is beginning to constrain business growth despite the lowest unemployment rate in 18 years there is little evidence of more than nominal wage growth the robust growth washington promised would result from federal tax cuts appears to have been short lived and is already waning the question now before minnesotans and their political leaders is how best to prepare in the face of such disquieting trends gov tim walz left no doubt this week as to the course he will pursue full steam ahead on a proposed 49 5 billion two year budget that includes spending he said would improve schools and roads foster economic prosperity and make minnesota a magnet for the workers it so badly needs his reasoning if minnesota is to continue attracting more residents than it loses reversing an earlier 15 year trend it will need to invest in the very things that grow our economy getting ahead of it he includes in that strategy a bonding proposal of 1 3 billion infrastructure improvements he said are one of the best firewalls against a downturn republicans oppose additional spending saying now is the time for the state to pull the belt tighter and limit spending in the face of potential economic turbulence there is little evidence that government can cut its way to prosperity but they ve made valuable points about the limits of minnesotans pocket books and the need to remain competitive the star tribune editorial board believes the walz budget proposal is overly ambitious and that the forecast should be a big blinking caution sign for both sides the great recession of 2008 showed that economic stimulus can help restart growth but that strategy has its limits and it s arguable whether all the spending served that cause additionally unlike the feds states are not allowed to deficit spend the walz menu of revenue raisers includes a 20 cent per gallon gasoline tax hike that s a regressive tax that will pinch hardest among those who are car dependent and must travel long distances the trade off of course is better safer roads and bridges nevertheless weakening economic growth and slow rising wages should signal to walz that some restraint may be necessary in coming months both in spending and bonding to his credit walz has said that in light of the new forecast his agencies will be looking for new ways to economize republicans too must show caution they are right to watch the bottom line but it s not enough to rail against all new spending their refusal to reconsider the sunsetting of a provider tax that underpins the state s subsidized health care seems less than fiscally responsible because not extending it would blow a 1 billion hole in the budget in coming years and while it s easy to go overboard on bonding their opposition to any bill this year seems ill considered given indications that the window for low interest rates may be closing minnesotans are unlikely to thank them for delaying repairs that like the 600 million of prison repairs will grow only worse over time there s also little hard evidence so far to back up house minority leader kurt daudt s claim that wealthy taxpayers are fleeing the state in large numbers what s known is that lost federal deductions are costing some minnesotans plenty that should get reconsideration in washington finally let s stop talking about even a 1 billion projected surplus it s a chimera the result of a foolish accounting gimmick put into law years ago that has distorted this state s budgeting ever since inflation is real and must be counted when projecting future expenses the forecast shows that continuing the current level of services with inflation factored in would cost wait for it about 1 billion walz has said he wants to factor in inflation and restore transparent budgeting practices we say the sooner the better this state remains in an enviable position with a aaa credit rating ample budget reserves and a still growing albeit more slowly economy democrats and republicans should prepare for any economic turbulence ahead by striking a balance of prudent new spending that keeps this state an attractive place to live and work along with a keen eye for cutting wasteful spending
by charles hugh smith even if the fed hadn t institutionalized perverse incentives to borrow and speculate in asset bubbles the economy would still be generating far fewer winners than losers if we scrape away the shuck and jive a difficult task when the majority of what the media presents is shuck and jive the whole economy boils down to who reaps the gains and who eats the losses while conventional economics focuses on how much the pie is expanding gdp is higher yea the real action is in how the pie is sliced up and distributed since the end of the dot com boom see chart below which actually increased labor s share of the gains the gains have all flowed to those holding assets that have bubbled higher while the losses have been distributed to 95 of those selling their labor for wages and to everyone exposed to high inflation in big ticket expenses such as healthcare insurance rent and college tuition the central bank shenanigans that exacerbated this remarkably unequal distribution were sold as promoting the wealth effect as assets bubbled higher the lucky recipients of this unearned wealth would feel richer and would then start borrowing and spending freely propping up a sickly economy which was no longer expanding organically but since only the top 5 of households own enough assets to matter this amounted to a stealth trickle down policy in which the top slice of asset owners would be so enriched they would spend more and this spending would trickle down to the bottom 95 as this chart shows the spending of the top 5 has far outpaced the spending of the bottom 95 but as the chart of labor s share of the economy reveals very little has trickled down not much trickled down the mercedes salesperson got a commission and the bistros and bars are crowded with free spending top 5ers and wannabes living on debt but this trickle hasn t been enough to push wages higher we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us meanwhile the neofeudal structure of the american economy an economy dominated by state cartels that enforce monopolistic rentier skims on vast swaths of the economy healthcare higher education national defense etc guarantees prices rise while wages stagnate many of us have addressed the reality that official inflation consumer price index doesn t accurately reflect real world price increases especially in big ticket expenses such as healthcare higher education housing rent vehicles services etc also missing in the statistics is the enormous difference between those protected from real world price increases via government employment or subsidies and those fully exposed to the unrelenting leaps in costs the unprotected by reducing interest on safe assets such as savings to near zero the fed has pushed everyone into risk assets this has pushed prices higher as bubbles inflate but it s exposed much of the nation s capital to catastrophic declines as the artificial asset bubbles pop even if the fed hadn t institutionalized perverse incentives to borrow and speculate in asset bubbles the economy would still be generating far fewer winners than losers as i ve described in my books get a job and build a real career money and work unchained and pathfinding our destiny many of the skills and credentials that once had scarcity value no longer have any scarcity value and so the value of those skills and credentials in the marketplace has declined accordingly when only 20 of the working populace had a college diploma that diploma had some scarcity value now that roughly half the working populace has a college diploma or some college the scarcity value of college diplomas has fallen to near zero except in specific fields fields which are quickly inundated with a flood of new graduates once the word gets out reducing the value of that diploma to background noise as a result of these factors the neofeudal economy and an over abundance of normal capital and labor only the top 5 of wage earners have enjoyed real increases in earned income there are no easy answers to these structural realities it s difficult to wean an economy that s dependent on assets bubbles off of asset bubbles and it s difficult to reverse demographic and technological changes our goal should be to eliminate the privileges embedded in neofeudal structures and create structures which open opportunities to get ahead for everyone rather than for just a select few i describe such a system in my book a radically beneficial world doing more of the what s failed is not going to change the structure whose only possible output is more failure

this interview was conducted in french by vie economique and translated to english by space in africa gabon is one of the few francophone countries in africa with a space program in this interview with mr tanguy gahouma bekale the general director of ageos he discussed the formation of ageos funding source and how the agency is capitalizing on space technologies to solve national problems how large is the area covered by your remote sensing centre and what countries are monitored before getting to the details of the subject it is important for me to describe the position of ageos in africa we are talking about the second most important continent in the world after asia sub saharan africa has 85 of the african population and the demography is proving that we will be the most populated continent in the coming centuries gabon is in the centre of this area and ageos covers a radius of 2800km its geographical position is unique and ideal we are on the heart of the congo basin which is the second most important forest around the world after the amazon the ageos monitors integrally 17 countries which are gabon namibia angola rd congo burundi rwanda sudan south sudan center africa republic cameroon congo equatorial guinee nigeria chad niger mali burkina faso ghana togo beni cote d ivoire liberia sao tome and 6 others partly what is the mission of your space program our principal mission is to put in place an infrastructure of satellites data in the space field there is an ecosystem having a base of essential data exploitation we are particularly working on the remote sensing aspect our mission is to support operators from all walks of life and to provide them with information our responsibility is to disseminate the use of satellite images and to do this we regularly take images that we compile put them on a platform with sufficient important data in order to enable users to download them on their smartphones on the national plan and for the government we must propose and follow a space development strategy to get there we went through 3 steps the 1st investment cycle consists of creating infrastructure make it work and to open information into the disposal meanwhile we had to train 20 people to be operational currently we are on a strategical study of the market of the 23 countries we are covering we have confided this investigation to a specialized office which would indicate if it would be convenient to be positioned on other centres of interests in the near future depending on the needs and the markets with strong growth the objective of this study is to analyze the opportunities for the activity of the ageos while qualifying their feasibility this study will distinguish 3 segments the perspectives on the african continent a focus on the sub region ceeac the countries covered by ageos and the relations with the public sector and private actors of the space field out of africa we are also working on the development of a weather station with the pacific africa is one of the two regions not covered by the network service of advanced retransmission of the international weather organization when we examine the contribution of the satellite data in the polar orbit on the model of the international and regional numerical meteorological prevision that gap has an impact on diverse applications in particular on the reduction of the catastrophe risks in the context of the realization of the project of the african network of reception and disposal of satellite data for africa rars a project group was implemented by the ageos between the acmad and the gabon which is part of the 4 countries kenya south africa and niger hosting direct reception antennas of meteorological data on the economic plan on what basis was ageos built ageos was born in 2007 its implementation was initially planned to be in rdc and to be financed by the world bank in 2009 the non realization of the project worried our new president ali bongo ondimba who at the same time was hosting the france president m nicolas sarkozy the donation of 50million euros subtracted from the debt contracted by gabon from france served for 10million euros 4575000m of cfa to lay the first foundation stone of ageos whereas the state was allocating the land for a value of 3 million euros the balance was spent on environmental projects today ageos is a public structure benefiting from the autonomy of administrative and financial management although the annual endowment is important it is not enough to cover the integrality of the fixed charges our economic model is built around public endowments that have to ensure basic functions such as the purchase of data like satellite images software computers etc and we are working on 3 principal financing sources on the first place the sale of services among operators such as comilog fgis for the construction of the kings bay seeg petroleum companies which means purely commercially contributing to the financing of ageos we are having social responsibilities in regard to the importance of our coverage zone we are regularly answering international bids among lessors looking for an investment with environmental goals notably forest protection hydraulic resources monitoring these external financings cost 7 million euro year today finally our last source of financing is really interesting but hard to perceive under the law of finance a fee mechanism was introduced since 2018 aiming to perceive a low percentage of all the activities having an impact on the integrity of the forest exploitation in gabon petroleum mines forests agriculture etc this fee goes from 0 5 to 300 f cfa per hectare in exchange we take in charge the monitoring of the sites and ensure that their exploitation is confirmed we contribute to the fight against illegal deforestation and other practices it was not easy to win acceptance for this contribution request for example olam processes an exploitation license of 150000 hectares to produce palm oil but only uses 50000 in fact consecutively with an arrangement plan that was elaborated after the acquisition of the exploitation license we observe a good part of these spaces protected because of the presence of preserved animal species or preserved vegetal categories we thus contribute to fighting against the illegal deforestation against the illicit gold panning and other practices not admitted if we take the example of the nkok zone some errors of environmental implying a massive replantation of zone initially cleared we are working on the project of expanding zerp zone économique à régime privilégié which integrates the construction of the future airport the cost of our work will be compensated by the value of the data that we provide and its impact on the project gabon is a territory of 267700km2 covered by 80 of forest with a population of 2 million inhabitants with 75 living in libreville our mission enters the strategic plan of gabon emergent which includes economically sustainable development and environmental protection what is the nature of the partnerships signed with the countries you monitor initially the goal of the gabonese authorities was to favour the rise of a new market and new technology in this objective the cost shouldn t have been the barrier we decided that all that ageos had for free should be reallocated for free in the end we only get remunerated for the added value of our services this economic fashion is inspired by the brazilian model we are having 3 types of partnership this is a scientific aspect with nasa esa usgs geo cnes ignfi and ird this type of partnership consists notably with nasa on data exchange between our engineers for 6 months in exchange of technical data and knowledge gathering images gabon does not have a satellite all the observation images with a sensitive character such as military or else are simply collected data supply for example rwanda seeks us to monitor their territory the same way we do with ours you are monitoring a very important zone of the continent are you providing data with a military component ageos is a civil agency that is not implicated in this field however we are concerned by the illicit exploitation of the maritime zones we furnish data about operations such as illegal fishing also the protection of oil hubs illegal transportation of people etc we developed a system for this kind of missions we are covering 5 prior zones around owendo port port gentil the south zone of mayumba in the gabon congo border the tuna fishing zone and the corisco bay islands of equatorial guinea how do you recruit our collaborators are from 3 backgrounds we have a big antenna allowing us to get data to transmit this data we work with telecom engineers we have to put data in disposal in this case we would need data it engineers which administrate the geo portal and monitor the internet capability to make it as optimal as possible and as secured as it can be to keep the confidentiality of the data finally we work with remote sensing engineers they decrypt measures and images back when we created this agency those professions did not exist in gabon our partners were concerned particularly the antenna provider we selected young gabonese graduates bac 5 detainers in engineering and electronics who learned manipulations due to a supplementary training delivered by professionals regarding internship we share public calls in march april of each year and work in partnership with universities in south africa morocco france and the usa we send tens of people holding a bachelor s degree for training to get a master s in 2 years and then they go for trainings at centers we are collaborating with this is efficient because today one of our early students ms vanessa ovono angoue who was trained at nasa delivers a course at crts in rabat while working for ageos what is your background after a bachelor degree in economics and politics from montreal university i went to paris to pursue a master s degree at l institut supérieur de gestion en audit and then worked for 3 years at a consulting office then i decided to invest in an mba in sustainable development and operational management for 2 years before coming back to gabon ageos was being constructed at the same time with a major goal regarding engagements made in the paris act to get to the sustainable development objectives in 2030
starting with trade it remains to be seen whether definitive progress is made on issues beyond tariffs such as the protection of intellectual property and ending regulatory restrictions on us investments robert lighthizer the us trade representative cited real progress last week but he also told a congressional committee that china would need to do more than just buy more us goods before a permanent trade deal could be signed meanwhile it is unwise to take the strong performance of china s equity market so far this year as a sign that trade negotiations will result in a deal that ultimately bolsters global activity to do so is to ignore a couple of important developments beijing s injection of liquidity into the financial system is once more pumping up share prices in a market that has swung markedly over the past decade and today sits about a third below its 2015 peak the return of the retail punter in china has been accompanied by a surge of foreign money into mainland shares ahead of msci the index provider upping the country s equity weighting in its emerging markets equity benchmark advertisement as blackrock reminds us china s economic and earnings momentum are weak and while investors in the firm s view are looking beyond downgraded estimates the asset manager raises a key point fundamentals will need to turn for a sustained rally turning to brexit a delay beyond the march 29 deadline or perhaps an acceptance of theresa may s current deal is certainly better than an abrupt departure but the road remains challenging for the uk particularly if a second referendum becomes a reality that is why the pound will find it tough heading higher than the us1 40 level which used to be a multi decade floor versus the us dollar prior to the uk s vote to leave the eu in 2016 there is little clarity on longer term prospects as brexit drags out weighing on confidence in the economy and in uk companies the wild cards of both trade and brexit certainly resonate with the federal reserve last week chair jay powell cited both issues during his semi annual testimony before congress as reasons why the us central bank should be cautious mr powell s focus on maintaining a supportive tone for markets may be tested should important economic data show signs of resilience a risk flagged to some extent by this week s rise in treasury yields for now the dovishness of central banks led by the fed explains why equity markets are looking beyond the risks posed by a breakdown in trade negotiations or a hard brexit as such outcomes might prompt greater monetary stimulus this insurance wrapper known as a policy put helps explain the current moribund state of implied volatility for equities bonds and currencies advertisement the policy put has other variations there is a market view that the us and china will reach a deal on trade given president trump s desire not to sink the stock market the other side of the haggling is that any failure between china and america to find common ground would be likely to trigger an aggressive response by beijing to fire up the economy which would help spur a rebound in global activity low global sovereign bond yields and slumbering market volatility help offset a moderating pace of growth in the economy and corporate earnings this feeds the view among equity bulls that 2019 will be a year of buying the dips supported by the idea that the dollar will remain steady as the fed stays on hold while economic activity remains resilient albeit at a slower rate of growth importantly a calm march does not imply a trouble free outlook the steady rise in value for risky areas of the market akin to climbing a series of steps has a flip side when the alarm rings equities and credit take the elevator down as seen dramatically last year in february and then again in october and december higher market volatility was sparked last year by the fed s tightening but now the danger is that lacklustre economic growth is not offset by central banks riding to the rescue for investors the current regime of low market volatility provides one silver lining insurance is cheap and worthy of consideration before the next bout of turmoil erupts michael mackenzie ft com financial times

ask artblog scribe beth heinly gets an ambiguous question and answers it her way read beth s take on public charities aka foundations and the problem of foundation funding in the art world a very good read for artists and art lovers alike have a question about the art life for ask artblog email ask theartblog org or submit a google form with your question there s a link to the google form at the bottom of the post below all names kept anonymous anonymous asks what do you think about the art of the steal better or worse than the art of the deal abba is that you seriously i am actually not sure what the question is in this word salad hence my reason for not answering in 3 months but here we are now ______________ i m going to go out on a limb and say that you are not talking about film art of the steal starring kurt russell as crunch calhoun a semi reformed art thief what like i guess he s stealing from small alternative art spaces rather than art museums maybe he s selling bootlegs from experimental sound performances this is the literal description from imdb who agrees to get his gang back together to pull off one last heist and you are referring to the 2009 documentary the art of steal which lays out how exactly the pew charitable trust pretty much stole the barnes foundation collection and moved it to the benjamin franklin parkway hey i m just going off what i learned from the documentary you can read the response from the pew on the topic of the barnes foundation on their website here which i am sure is entirely unbiased and true as for the art of the deal who else can we be talking about except none other than tony schwartz author of said book about donald trump s financial genius let me clarify that even the author of the art of the deal proclaims it s all bullsh t and basically was put in production because conde nast saw trump s face sell magazines on the cover of gq in 1984 gross i believe the art of the steal i do not believe billionaires ever not ever never no i m not opinion ing about which space on the parkway or merion is better for visiting the collection i am however in awe the pew was able to turn from a privately funded organization with billions of dollars into a public charity that is now able to receive donations from the public look i m sure you can talk me into a corner and make my head spin over this but plainly that s not right billionaire is a coined word now it s a political signifier of the neoliberal global capitalist i ran out of asshole words take over and they own the artworld i hit on this topic in a previous article to organize or not to organize an art festival that is the question sorry for the title please go read that as i go on to explain that an art museum near you is funded by billionaires welcome back i see a similarity in the right now art world or artworldwise to what was happening in the united states in the 1960 s 1980 s i mean look dadaism surrealism and the situationists predate this which saw a rise of political art and activism across the country that led to a boom in alternative art spaces and artist collectives throughout inner cities across the united states and that was a criticism of global capitalism the patrons the board of trustees the art institutions where artists were exhibiting the billionaires where today we are in an economic crisis being that the 1 dominate the capitalist market the middle class is disappearing and the other 99 are left struggling to keep up and out of debt or in debt or living in poverty in comes activist art which seems to be primarily on the marxist side of things in the 1960 s the prominent figure of pointed artists protests was that of billionaire john d rockefeller who s wife abby aldrich rockefeller partly established the museum of modern art later numerous rockefeller s served on the board of trustees and the museum today is still largely funded through rockefeller money gaag aka guerrilla art action group staged an action in november 1969 known as bloodbath at the museum of modern art where a number of anonymous persons ripped open concealed blood bags and writhed on the floor of the museum that s awesome manifestos were scattered about the scene with the message immediate resignation of all the rockefellers from the board of trustees of the museum rich people the text contends with a direct financial interest in the business of war control of museums and their policies and sterilize art of any form of social protest i am copying this text from a book i recently read and recommend art gangs protest counterculture in new york city by alan moore now to today as i had mentioned in my previous post we have artists protesting under the title decolonize this place for the removal of warren b kanders as vice chair of whitney museums board of trustees whose company safariland a tear gas manufacturer was used against migrant refugees on the us mexico border in tijuana kanders has responded via art news while my company and the museum have distinct missions both are important contributors to our society this is why i believe that the politicization of every aspect of public life including commercial organizations and cultural institutions is not productive or healthy see now no it is imperative that artists are critical and aware hence politicizing the funding of cultural institutions we already committed to a life of poverty when we decided to be artists so what are we afraid of losing an artist s very nature is to be critical criticizing art institutions from the 1960 s into the 80 s awe institutional critique was born was influential in boosting government funding for alternative artist projects and spaces while shaping conceptually what makes an art museum today p s 1 was founded through the socially conscious curation of alanna heiss part of the new museum s curatorial practice owning and supporting solely contemporary art would not be here today without the action of artists protests of museum standards of practice in collecting art the lack of vigilance on the part of the artist as public activist is what leads to corruption back to today the unionization of employees at the new museum as the museum itself purports via their about page we believe in the essential role of culture to a free and open civil society so pay your employees a living wage free and open civil society includes economic equality speaking of w a g e an organization working today to discuss fair pay for exhibiting artists i ve mentioned them in like every one of my advice column articles nice website am i right now go listen to this podcast from the art newspaper speaking to artist tai shani about arts labour can artists live off art alone short answer is no anon it is better to be critical of our cultural institutions and to hold them accountable artists are foremost responsible in doing so even if you can t understand how painting can be political aesthetically you can protest an institution or the art market through withdrawing your artwork robert morris did this or you don t understand that being political is a trend don t tell morandi but political art is a constant part of all art movements throughout history or maybe you don t get that political art isn t fun it s scary or that being political is intimidating and might make you look naive there s a reason all political arguments go directly to you re stupid how many times have you called me stupid to yourself while reading this article me a lot but as i am writing this now it s as true as it was 50 years ago the corporate interest aka greed is for u s intervention in venezuela as it was for vietnam i m yelling at myself here too critical awareness in corporate non profit or private funding within the arts sector is a dense topic it is a deep well filled with dirty money having been nominated for the pew fellowship i would not like how could i refuse 75 000 if i were to win if i were to win my art practice would be unilaterally funded for a year or two by sunoco a part of the dakota access pipeline through a 20 billion merger with energy transfer partners would you feel partly indebted to the native american protesters at standing rock i m performing at the philadelphia museum of art for local artist night in march yikes i have an iphone i have a macbook which currently has nine applications operating 100 tabs open in my browser and runs like a silent efficient dream full disclosure i was doored riding my bike and bought my computer through pain and suffering money don t allow yourself to be complicit overall on how to in political activism with art as i said in my previous article the essential element is collective organization an artist alone cannot tackle all these multi millionaires and billionaires ocgopf s performances in the past have been merely playful spectacles against authority compared to the serious social impact a unified political front would have artists need to organize collectively and engage with local activist groups alan moore s book art gangs protest counterculture in new york city ends poignantly in 2011 pairing global capitalism with the crisis of global warming predicting artists will be a vital part of civilization visualizing that disastrous combination among many other social wrongs and calls for resistance it s in all the history books the artists are always among the first put in jail no don t get arrested unless you can afford it look at that some advice sincerely beth follower of the church of abba and righteous
