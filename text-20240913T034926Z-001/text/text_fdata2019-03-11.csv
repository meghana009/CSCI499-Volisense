not since the early years of the iraq war has foreign policy dominated american headlines as it does in the age of trump the united states in the 90s enjoyed the narcissism of the new world order and journalistic glances abroad mainly flattered this self conception after bush obama campaigned as an antiwar candidate only to get the country embroiled in at least five additional conflicts all more or less waged sotto voce so as to minimize the tarnish imperial police actions could inflict on his nobel trump is less trusted and manifestly less given to doing things quietly than obama with every gesture he makes to the outside world whether through actual diplomatic summits rhetorical saber rattling or simple racist bluster shithole countries the news is filled with a stream of developments centering on actors elsewhere in the world trade war with china withdrawal from the iran nuclear deal the syrian civil war imprecations of fire and fury for north korea moving the american embassy to jerusalem and the idf s carnage in gaza trump s son in law s romance with saudi prince mohammad bin salman meanwhile has masked the most lethal policy currently being enacted on the face of the earth the saudi led war against the houthis in yemen which has been actively aided by the united states the unmasking of this policy following the murder of jamal khashoggi has only moved foreign policy further into the foreground behind all of this chatter november 8 2016 remains on endless loop in part because russian meddling has been deemed a pearl harbor grade event but while the national security establishment has mobilized these conflicts in hopes of salvaging their preferred militarist approach to globalism a left increasingly vocal about domestic policy medicare for all jobs guarantee green new deal has only recently begun to search for its voice on foreign policy after decades of quiescence that voice is unpracticed when bernie sanders the most successful socialist politician in american history gave a major address in 2017 laying out his international vision it was full of refreshing candor and sound ideas a foreign policy whose objective was dominance he declared had led to coups and military invasions from guatemala in 1953 to iraq in 2003 instead sanders called for a policy of partnerships with governments and peoples in service of democracy human rights social welfare and environmental sustainability just as he sought to make democratic socialism part of the mainstream by connecting it to franklin roosevelt s economic bill of rights sanders alighted on the truman administration s european recovery program more commonly known as the marshall plan as a precedent for his foreign policy vision rather than punish and humiliate the losers we helped rebuild their economies we also provided them support to reconstruct democratic societies for sanders and for most liberals and progressives the marshall plan is a foreign policy object with almost talismanic properties it proves that the united states in the international arena is capable of substituting generosity for retribution cooperation for enmity and economics for military force all in the pursuit of an enlightened self interest the trouble is that this view is a myth it licenses the belief that there was a good cold war and a bad cold war that liberalism was forced to become militaristic against its will and that an exercise in geopolitics was about something other than geopolitics that is a liberal international order to deconstruct this myth requires understanding what exactly the marshall plan was intended to do where it led and what it meant for democratic aspirations at home and abroad at the heart of this ideological complex may lie the reason why the left has so far failed to articulate a foreign policy for our age if the 2016 election marked the end of the cold war consensus in american politics with the open return of socialism and white supremacy to the national stage the traducing of the national security establishment and the embrace of russia by the eventual winner then president trump s inauguration of a trade war with china is one of the more overt signs that we have entered a new era in international politics the return of great power competition 1 navigating this new global configuration of power in which an ascendant china is the key coordinate will require engaging with modes of thought that are currently uncongenial while abjuring sweeping ideological gestures redolent of the thinking typified by the marshall plan that undergirded the last cold war to the extent that sanders speaks of china his rhetoric shares unsettling affinities with this latter approach if the left is serious about contending for power then the statements of its leading figures on such bedrock questions of policy and strategy merit friendly but careful scrutiny before world war ii the united states had interests in the western hemisphere and in the pacific in the former it was effectively hegemonic no foreign power dared engage in diplomatic or military actions against american wishes american interests in the pacific surged when the filibustering of american sugar planters in hawaii and victory in war against spain gave the us a territorial presence in the western pacific celebrated as the springboard for a commercial assault on the vaunted china market recognizing the far greater commercial and military interests of britain russia and japan american strategy in asia was limited to preventing anyone else from establishing hegemonic control 2 these foreign policy interests were large and the united states frequently used military force in defense of them but in comparison to what came after 1941 they appear trifling before then american leaders had been unwilling to wield power to protect interests beyond these two spheres woodrow wilson s decision to enter world war i on the side of britain france italy and russia was seen in the 1920s and 30s as an aberration though the term soon became one of abuse in the hands of advocates of globalism many participants in the america first movement of 1940 1941 were merely giving voice to this longstanding precept of american foreign policy after pearl harbor us presidents easily convinced the public that conditions beyond american borders had implications for national security and that it was better to deal with potential threats where they arose and yet the path from pearl harbor to a sprawling national security state and a globe spanning military commitment was not direct the us cut military expenditures four fold in 1946 in roosevelt s original postwar plans cooperation with the soviet union to prevent future wars was a first order priority europe was to be a vast neutral zone between the ussr and the us with great britain resuming its historical role of offshore balancer to prevent any one power from dominating the continent japan similarly was to be a neutral state ensuring that there would be no hegemon in east asia in roosevelt s view only a restrained posture of this sort would spare the us from massive and permanent military expenditures widely feared as the road to a garrison state by 1948 at least the basis for the rooseveltian framework collapsed and the two superpowers stood on the precipice of war the marshall plan was not just one of several stages on the path from cooperation to cold war it was the decisive break american policymakers decided that the agreements reached between roosevelt and stalin over europe no longer served a new european framework had to be established and the marshall plan was the assault on the status quo that would deliver the desired result a policy that advertised itself as one of peace was in fact a policy of war the central fact undergirding this interpretation of the origins of the cold war exhaustively demonstrated through recent work in soviet and american archives was that in the immediate postwar period joseph stalin s postwar posture was essentially defensive despite the overwhelming military preponderance of the soviet union in europe stalin never once contemplated provoking a war with the united states by pushing the red army further west his fundamental security considerations were that the countries of eastern europe have governments friendly to the soviet union and that germany never be allowed to threaten the soviet union militarily 3 it is true that stalin probed american resolve in turkey and iran in response the us dispatched economic and military aid following senatorial advice to scare the hell out of harry truman announced a new policy the truman doctrine which proclaimed an american policy of containment in george kennan s words the free institutions of the western world would be defended by the adroit and vigilant application of counter force at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points but despite its landmark status from stalin s point of view the truman doctrine was merely a restatement of the american position he backed down in western asia out of an absolute unwillingness to sabotage great power cooperation truman s speech meanwhile was attacked in the united states for being inflammatory and militaristic containment proclaimed a global policy but in fact the conflict of interest between the us and the ussr centered on one place germany over the course of 1946 and 1947 economic conditions in western europe appeared to be worsening auguring political disaster kennan the marshall plan s true author recognized that the war had produced exhaustion and demoralization among the masses and the leaders of western europe a situation that communist parties whose prestige thanks to their wartime resistance to fascism was at its peak were exploiting rather than combat communism directly kennan proposed attacking the conditions that made societies vulnerable to it to save bourgeois political systems in western europe it was above all necessary to revive their economies kennan therefore proposed a program of large scale economic aid whose fundamental purpose was to transform the outlook of european workers capitalists and politicians with america standing behind them kennan hoped they would see it was worth the effort to strengthen european economies and this would inoculate their political systems against communist subversion through the extension of economic aid kennan also believed the us would gain geostrategic advantage without having to take the politically unpopular step of making a military commitment to western european security if belgium france and italy could have been shored up on their own events might have unfolded differently but the americans concluded that there could be no economic recovery for the rest of western europe unless the german economy was revived too the german rhineland was the industrial heart of europe without its factories turning out steel and machines without its mines yielding ton after ton of coal recovery american planners concluded would stall everywhere else the trouble was that economic recovery for germany ran smack into good faith agreements made between roosevelt and stalin only a few years earlier from stalin s point of view to revive germany and german heavy industry no less was to risk a third german invasion of the east in five decades the american plan amounted to a repudiation of the twenty million soviet war dead there was no conceivable way he could consent to it the true genius of kennan s scheme was not that it offered a helping hand to a continent worn down by years of war it was that the plan took an act american leaders knew stalin could only interpret as one of profound hostility and made it look like a gesture of generosity and peace after a generation marking speech at harvard in june 1947 the scheme became forever associated with secretary of state george marshall as american planners expected the soviet union interpreted the offer of aid as an act of war in response stalin pushed french and italian communists to launch strikes to paralyze their economies he cracked down on central european governments that wanted to participate in the program eventually he launched the blockade of berlin when the western allies pushed ahead with the establishment of a west german state stalin was led to conclude not incorrectly that the west was determined to encircle the soviet union with a hostile bloc of capitalist states closely tied to the us now also likely to include japan as the key capitalist states of western europe and east asia respectively germany and japan were menacing enough on their own but as independent centers of power they would at least have been in rivalry with the united states subordinated to the us in a global capitalist bloc they represented an existential threat once the intensity of soviet opposition to the marshall plan became clear western european governments began to argue that economic aid was not sufficient to repel the communist threat kennan s hope that an economic commitment could substitute for a military one proved badly mistaken by ratcheting up us soviet tensions in europe american planners produced the conditions that made a permanent military alliance with european states seem like common sense the marshall plan recast an act of aggression as one of munificence by causing stalin to fear the formation of a cinching asphyxiating capitalist bloc provoking him to fully sovietize most of eastern europe the marshall plan made a propagandistic analogy capitalism is to freedom as communism is to totalitarianism appear substantially closer to the truth the costs to anticapitalist strivings everywhere in the west would be incalculable the marshall plan was one of the crucial pillars of an unprecedented configuration of power a new form of non imperialist empire that today enjoys the euphemistic name the liberal international order from 1952 on all of the world s richest and most technologically advanced countries were in formal alliances with the single most powerful actor in the whole system if all world orders involve some combination of coercion and consent the integration of western europe and japan into a us led order allowed the us to project power everywhere and to do so with a historically unprecedented degree of consent at remarkably low cost by and large these countries quickly returned to self sufficiency requiring essentially no us aid to keep their economies and political systems in robust working order after marshall aid wound down in 1952 until very recently the conviction that this order served us interests was one of the few remaining points of transpartisan consensus in american politics geopolitics is the discourse of the balance of power between leading states on a global scale under modern conditions the sphere of geopolitics is practically unlimited military bases foreign investments communications networks and the ideological leanings of particular peoples all can affect whether one power or another is ascendant in any given part of the world the marshall plan was a fundamentally geopolitical act it was about ensuring american ascendancy in the economically and militarily vital region of western europe it was one of the opening salvos in the unfolding project of containment itself a totalizing principle of postwar american strategy but the plan s economic basis provided a cover for its geopolitical origins and this erasure of geopolitics which might be called the specific character of marshall plan thinking made possible the peculiar way in which american leaders played dumb insisting on their own innocence as they turned a regional military and political rivalry into an all encompassing globe spanning cold war a few years later it was marshall plan thinking that transformed the american involvement in indochina from neocolonial meddling into a full scale military intervention that led to the slaughter and maiming of millions in the vietnam war ironically early us justifications for interfering in vietnam did not hide their rationale eisenhower s domino theory was a forthrightly geopolitical statement however questionable its assumptions by 1965 when lyndon johnson committed us ground forces to the defense of a non communist south vietnam that theory especially the postulate that the health of japanese capitalism rose or fell with south vietnam s membership in the free world no longer held water whereas the marshall planners had given an ideological gloss to a conflict they understood in fundamentally geopolitical terms later american policymakers remembered only the gloss even though the soviet union had no interest in escalating conflict with the us over vietnam johnson and his staff sincerely believed what for their predecessors had been mere rhetoric that communism anywhere was a threat to freedom everywhere just as us economic support had been necessary to put some spine into anticommunist forces in western europe in 1948 us military support in south vietnam was now held to be necessary to persuade anticommunists everywhere that the us would defend its allies at all costs the ideological hypostatization of the conflict ruled out any measured assessment of its chances of success those chances were abysmal in western europe the us provided support to social and political forces that commanded if not necessarily majorities then certainly large swaths of public opinion in south vietnam the us was backing a detested regime against forces most vietnamese considered not foreign puppets but liberation fighters for the sake of credibility the us prosecuted an unwinnable war at unspeakable human cost throughout it all many us policymakers convinced themselves that no amount of their barbarism could ever be worse than communist totalitarianism an outlook that also does much to explain the reagan administration s later sangfroid over cia sponsored central american atrocities however doubling down on marshall plan thinking this at first creative and later self delusional erasure of geopolitics was not the only available path for american foreign policy in the aftermath of world war ii henry wallace roosevelt s second vice president and the most important administration left winger to maintain influence well into the war years articulated an alternative the new deal left s essential conviction was that the long term success of their programs depended on deepening the political transformation that the rise of the cio unions presaged and that roosevelt promised in his famous 1936 attack on economic royalists for them the new deal meant not merely technocratic reforms but open ended class struggle during the war wallace ran the agency that controlled us imports and exports and he concluded that access to important raw materials was hamstrung by the poverty of overseas producers accordingly wallace proposed foreign aid to promote industrialization and increase living standards abroad this precipitated a showdown with the business wing of roosevelt s coalition which prevailed and eventually forced wallace s replacement as vice president by harry truman in 1945 wallace s deposition was metonym for the fortunes of the new deal left after the war wallace emerged as the most prominent political figure opposing the truman administration s drift toward confrontation with the soviet union testifying before congress in february 1948 he denounced the marshall plan his central claim was that beneath the rhetoric of peace and cooperation was actually a new crusading war ostensibly against russia but actually against the march of people everywhere to a new life free of ancient reaction the peoples of europe who had resisted fascist domination catholic labor socialist communist voted after the war for radical reforms to the social economic and political orders of their countries a new deal a square deal that would end the misrule and privation of the old deal in europe with the marshall plan however the us sought to revive germany as the great industrial center of a european military bloc and to restore the power of the european monopolists and landowners over the people of europe in wallace s view it was the monopolists the bankers and the militarists who were dictating us policy towards europe and trimming the sails of the new deal at home the marshall plan and the anti labor taft hartley act were part and parcel of the same counterrevolutionary program which sustained itself on the anticommunist fervor kicked up by both in place of the marshall plan wallace advanced a proposal for genuine international cooperation instead of the us government dictating terms for aid money would go to the newly created united nations which would administer a far larger amount of aid on the basis of economic need not geopolitics the industrial center of germany would be internationalized during world war ii as the historian stephen wertheim has shown advocates of the forward use of american military power to remake world order rebranded their militant interventionism as internationalism and rendered it the conceptual opposite of isolationism now a term of obloquy wallace s internationalism required no such semantic sleight of hand in place of henry luce s american century wallace offered a century of the common man founded on international solidarity between the democratic masses of the world wallace likely knew that his proposals were doomed only if the forces of social transformation in the us itself were ascendant would such a foreign policy find political favor that same year wallace scored only 2 4 percent of the vote in his progressive party candidacy for us president but among that 2 4 percent was another source for a foreign policy based on a worldview distinct from that of the marshall plan the country s black radicals foremost among them w e b du bois these writers placed the us s history of racial slavery and segregation and european imperial rule in the same conceptual and historical universe the close links between imperial rule and capitalist expansion helped make du bois and others into socialists and communists they detected sooner than anyone that the growing centrality of anticommunism in us foreign policy was being accompanied by a pronounced turn away from anticolonialism du bois had been an active supporter of efforts to create the united nations at the end of world war ii working closely with liberals like eleanor roosevelt but as liberals moved right du bois refused to go with them in the stifling political climate of the mid century united states du bois was isolated so much so that he was effectively forced into exile in 1961 at the age of 93 but as american involvement in vietnam escalated attacks on us foreign policy in du bois s spirit exploded the antiwar movement of the 1960s unleashed a torrent of criticism of american imperialism particularly for its racism brutality denial of self determination and complicity with colonialism eisenhower s enigmatic 1961 warning of a growing military industrial complex furnished a summary term for condemning the fusion of capitalism bureaucracy and the means of violence in modern american society anticommunism even briefly lost its ability to shut down debate within the antiwar movement the black panther party for self defense founded in oakland in 1966 represented the vanguard anti imperialism was absolutely central to the bpp s political ideology and practice declaring the us to be an imperial power executing a program of internal colonialism of black ghettos in parallel to the external colonialism of its interventions in southeast asia africa the middle east and latin america the panthers called for domestic and international solidarity in service of a revolutionary overthrow of a racist and imperialist american state in favor of an egalitarian and socialist one the panthers program did not merely condemn us foreign policy the year before nixon met mao zedong in china in 1972 huey newton went there and met zhou enlai panther solidarity with communist governments was reciprocated the north vietnamese army sent letters from american pows home through the offices of the bpp the panthers openly embraced victory for the us s enemies abroad as a means to win a struggle back home and vice versa though they did not speak in the same language as wallace they like him were clear that only social transformation could lead to a redefinition of us interests which in turn could give rise to an anti imperialist us foreign policy this was the last time that the us left articulated a foreign policy that dealt squarely with power in the international system after 1989 and the end of history surviving marshall plan authors like george kennan and paul nitze his more hawkish successor at the state department thought that the demise of the ussr would allow the us to savor the fruits of a world in which everyone wanted to be america s friend but the most feverish cold warriors the so called neoconservatives wondered why they should settle for offering carrots when the joy was in brandishing sticks they quickly put forward a new doctrine known as primacy primacists believe that the us should have such a preponderance of power that it could not only have its way in all questions of international politics but could prevent any country from taking steps that might turn it into a challenger in the future primacy reached its apogee of insanity in the neocon plans for the iraq war whose guiding idea was that the us could reconfigure an entire regional political order to suit its purposes without fear of serious consequences that policy s catastrophic failure lowered american prestige drained the us treasury and hugely diminished popular support for overseas adventurism the biggest shock however was the global financial crisis of 2007 2009 and the extraordinary paralysis of the american state after the tea party wave of 2010 which together revealed the us to be a country fundamentally unfit for global economic and financial leadership since the financial crisis observers have been fitfully waking up to the fact that the us is no longer the only power in the international system that matters it has become increasingly difficult to ignore the presence and relative autonomy of regional powers whether iran and saudi arabia in the persian gulf or india and pakistan in south asia russia has been reasserting itself as an autonomous force in world affairs at least since the conflict with georgia in 2008 the biggest factor though is china china s ascent to great power status mirror s the us s in many ways like the us in the gilded age the basis for china s entrance into the first rank of global powers is its staggering economic growth averaging just shy of 10 percent of gdp growth annually for forty years in a country of 1 4 billion people it is the most spectacular economic feat in the history of capitalism and like the us in the gilded age china has benefited from a favorable international environment in the late 19th century the british empire smiled upon the consanguine rising power enabling the us to attract enormous amounts of foreign capital to its project of continental capitalist development in the case of china the us s strategy of convergence has meant openly supporting and facilitating the country s integration into the circuits of international capitalism especially through endorsing china s entry into the world trade organization in 1999 finally the us s willingness to import hundreds of billions of dollars a year of chinese goods while exporting only a fraction of that to china and to permit us firms to enter into joint ventures with potential chinese competitors have contributed hugely to china s economic growth proponents of convergence were convinced that as china liberalized economically political reforms would inevitably follow as these political reforms took root china would come to share the us s view on things and would happily assume a position as a major power within an overall international order in which the us remained paramount this was a risible belief perhaps the most delusional expression of end of history liberal millenarianism and yet convergence was the consensus position within the american foreign policy establishment for at least two decades there are still many so called liberal internationalists trying desperately to find ways to hold on to this vision but it is now obvious that whatever convergence took place was a function of the us s status as the sole superpower now that some countries are powerful enough to compete at least regionally they want to shape the international order to suit their own interests which they quite understandably do not believe are coterminous with those of the united states sensing that the us is strategically overextended economically battered and politically divided china s leaders have begun to do what any state in control of so vast an economic organism would they have increased military expenditures and gradually sought to assert their prerogatives in east asia china has also begun fashioning a more global footprint very much in the spirit that motivated countries like the us and imperial germany before world war i though to date china s presence in latin america africa the middle east and eastern europe is mainly economic there is little doubt that china s leaders see the country s economic importance to so many other nations as a source of diplomatic strength there is no reason to expect chinese military bases on the pacific coast of south america anytime soon but president xi s belt and road initiative which involves nearly seventy countries and through which chinese firms and chinese capital will be employed on foreign infrastructure projects is shot through with strategic considerations just as the baghdad railway was for germany or the panama canal for the united states the foremost strategic challenge for the united states is that china seeks a hegemonic position in east asia where in effect china would have veto power over the foreign policies of all other countries in the region for the us as the realist international relations theorist john mearsheimer has explained this is certain to be an unacceptable outcome since hegemony in one s home region is the surest footing from which to launch a bid for global supremacy as the us itself did between 1890 and 1945 also troubling will be china s efforts to displace us led international organizations in favor of chinese led ones the first intimations of which can be seen in the asian infrastructure investment bank a multilateral development fund intended to compete with the us led world bank china furthermore harbors ambitions to achieve a greater international role for its currency the economic benefits that accrue to the us on account of the dollar s position as the world s reserve currency are debated but surely immense it will be many decades and a further financial crisis or two before the dollar is in danger of being bumped down to second place in the global currency league tables but us administrations will take measures to delay this eventuality as long as possible looking out a few decades from now china s rise presents the greatest threat to us global ascendancy since its beginnings in the 1890s far greater than the soviet union posed after world war ii when the us alone accounted for 50 percent of the world s total industrial production and essentially all of its advanced technologies if there is a rational kernel to trump s america first foreign policy it is surely that china represents the greatest long term strategic challenge for the united states and that us policy therefore must be reoriented around managing chinese ambitions critically the trump administration is doing what several generations of us administrations have largely disavowed which is to formulate foreign economic policy with an eye towards geopolitics though trump s invocation of national security concerns as a justification for imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum is vaguely ridiculous there are perfectly sensible arguments for taking measures to prevent china from using its enormous leverage over us corporations to get hold of technologies that have military implications while the rational wing of the foreign policy establishment increasingly focuses on china recognizing that the generational war in the greater middle east is draining reserves of us power the left is practically mute on the question at different times the soviet union mao s china ho s vietnam and fidel s cuba appeared to western leftists as instantiations of historical progress worthy of solidarity american leftists could conceive of their responsibility as advocating for a us foreign policy that would enable these societies to develop free of imperialist pressure though there is certainly a measure of historical justice in china s latter day rise it is only by way of a particularly strained sort of campism that one can declare that the position of the us left should be solidarity with the china of xi jinping not that xi s regime is especially bad by global standards but contemporary china s embrace of capitalism suggests that a world in which china is hegemonic is not likely to be all that different from a world in which the us is hegemonic at least measured in terms of the possibilities for transcending capitalist social relations and military conflict though the arrogance of the george w bush administration gave rise to a new global antiwar movement that movement never successfully articulated a tight link between the structure of power in american society and us national interests except for the feeble cry of no blood for oil the left remains adroit at criticizing us foreign policy for its deeply racialized exceptionalism and providentialism for its hypocrisy for its interventionism none of this however is of any use in thinking through the questions thrown up by contemporary china a country that has achieved a degree of power in international politics that makes it immune to almost all forms of us intervention short of direct military conflict between two nuclear powers racism might well affect us attitudes toward china but whatever racial animosity americans harbor towards chinese people can have no impact on american policy towards china except to make it stupider and more self defeating china quite simply does not have to take any shit from the united states what then could an adequate left foreign policy that went beyond familiar critiques of us imperialism look like one that could address the problem of china among the available intellectual resources three strands stand out the first is realism especially as espoused by the university of chicago theorist john mearsheimer and his harvard university colleague stephen walt mearsheimer and walt are advocates of a doctrine known as offshore balancing arguing that the us should forgo ambitious efforts to remake other societies and concentrate on what really matters preserving us dominance in the western hemisphere and countering potential hegemons in europe northeast asia and the persian gulf in practice this would mean doubling down on us alliances with western european countries to prevent russia from achieving preponderance in europe while at the same time refraining from provoking russia by meddling in its near abroad opportunistically supporting whichever of the saudis or the iranians appear weaker at any moment and maintaining a powerful military presence in east asia to deter china from taking any measures to upset the existing regional balance if the focus were only on the middle east and eastern europe many on the left would find much to agree with in mearsheimer and walt s writings the trouble is that both straightforwardly believe that the security of the united states in the last analysis requires preserving us primacy their view is that it was a mistake to admit china to the wto not because this decision led to the outsourcing of us manufacturing jobs but because entry into the wto allowed china to become an economic and therefore a military rival to the us it is not surprising that mearsheimer and walt consider the marshall plan one of the greatest acts in the annals of realist diplomacy for them the only alternative to us primacy is us insecurity a second potential resource for a new foreign policy is republicanism the most articulate and admirable of the republicans is the retired u s army colonel and boston university emeritus professor andrew bacevich a gifted historian and a bracing critic of american militarism bacevich calls for a redefinition of american national interests around sustaining the planet preventing great power war and nuclear disarmament he would eschew humanitarian military intervention by limiting the commitment of military forces to circumstances where genuinely vital us interests are immediately at risk he would limit the president s ability to plunge the nation into wars by restoring some semblance of constitutional balance unafraid to confront trumpism on its terms he supports a more rigorous means ends test for us overseas commitments one could certainly do worse than this honorable and sensible as this approach is bacevich is hindered by his moralistic focus a follower of william appleman williams he extends the wisconsin school historian s argument that empire is a way of life for americans by interpreting it through the lens of consumerism in particular the overconsumption of oil which bacevich believes is responsible for much of contemporary american militarism especially in the middle east in response to this argument some mainstream thinkers have maligned bacevich as an isolationist the real problem though is that while he has savaged american involvement in the middle east he has also remained a committed cold warrior and if the cold war was worthy but the interventionist reflex in american foreign policy is bad bacevich is essentially forced to argue that what drove the disagreeable parts of us policy in the postwar decades was not actually great power rivalry but instead something specific to american culture which following appleman williams he calls acquisitive individualism in calling for an anti exceptionalist foreign policy republican moralists like bacevich ironically end up reinforcing exceptionalist narratives of american power furthermore their republican moralism inevitably leads them to issue bathetic pleas for an armistice in the culture wars in service of national unity a third potential source for a contemporary left foreign policy might be represented by michael lind a co founder of the new america foundation combining a certain sort of republicanism with realism to forge a kind of socialistic nationalism lind s basic idea is that great power rivalry makes class warfare constitutions borrowing here a concept from constitutional scholar and elizabeth warren s policy director ganesh sitaraman more likely that is under conditions of zero sum security cum economic competition the separate ruling classes of nation states have strong incentives to shore up domestic support by offering deals to their national subaltern classes these include limitations on what lind calls labor arbitrage whether through offshoring or immigration less labor arbitrage means tighter labor markets empowering workers to demand higher wages which pushes firms to increase productivity through the invention of labor saving technologies higher productivity makes possible more generous welfare states and helps national industries compete to supply the world with high tech products if technological leadership and a prosperous patriotic citizenry are the surest guarantees of military preponderance such an economic policy represents the best military strategy in an era of great power competition lind thinks this is basically what the us western europe and japan did during the cold war not coincidentally it was both the golden age of capitalism and of us grand strategy the consequence is that lind believes the us in order to confront china needs to return to a bloc approach to foreign policy pursuing deep relations with those countries that fall within its orbit while actively working to reduce intercourse with rival blocs meaning in particular a marked decrease in trade with china as part of this shift the us would offer concessions to the american working class including immigration restrictions american workers would be better off shoring up the popular bases of us foreign policy to prepare for the difficult task of another era of great power rivalry the problem with this formulation is obvious its socialism is a consequence of its nationalism not the other way around lind s brand of class compromise does not assume social transformation only a slightly better deal for the working class us workers on this logic should eat better so that they can more effectively confront chinese workers in a generational struggle but lind s socialistic nationalism offers an important window onto what the contemporary american ceo class must be thinking having championed neoliberal globalization during the era of us unipolarity american capitalists are now confronting the rise of an aggressively mercantilist china the managers of key western firms are extremely exercised that the chinese have used their immense bargaining power to force western companies to give over proprietary technologies to chinese firms many of them state owned as a condition for access to china s domestic market especially for high value capital goods they fear a world historic return of the repressed in which chinese firms benefiting from low wages and backed by the chinese state underbid western competitors in the most lucrative high value added product and construction markets of the globe hence their ambivalence about trump s trade war lind is also almost certainly right that the more powerful china becomes the more vigilant the us government is going to be about denying chinese companies access to technologies that may have national security implications the recent arrest in canada of the daughter of the founder of huawei the chinese giant in the field of cellular infrastructure on charges of circumventing us sanctions against iran is a striking instance of what may well become a general trend if it continues the result will almost certainly be a bloc ification of the world economy as security considerations increasingly insinuate themselves into international economic relations however unappealing lind s vision thus gives a glimpse of what a corporate backed left foreign policy might look like if the american ruling class decides its best option is to exploit the rise of domestic socialism to shore up their own global economic and military hegemony neither realism republicanism nor socialistic nationalism offers a blueprint for a left wing foreign policy in our times realism assumes no change to the definition of national interests and therefore argues unapologetically for a policy of avoiding great power war by courting it republicanism would fix american foreign policy by returning to ancient truths a program which has nothing to say about how america should relate to a country whose ambitions in no way hinge on how the us governs itself and little to say about the fact that those ancient truths were constructed on a foundation of racial slavery and genocidal expansion socialistic nationalism would bolster america s ability to engage in great power rivalry by offering local concessions to american labor but otherwise assumes and favors capitalism s forward march in different ways both henry wallace and the black panther party understood that postwar us foreign policy which the marshall plan exemplified was designed to ensure global capitalism s survival an essential condition for the bedrock national interest of preserving american capitalism changing us foreign policy then required transforming american national interests this could only be done by recomposing the american state on the basis of genuine popular power the alternatives they proposed sought to frame the global conditions that would allow socialism to flourish both abroad and at home the continuing vitality of the political revolution that occupy and black lives matter launched and that bernie sanders injected into mainstream politics represents the most hopeful sign that a political order based on that kind of real democracy could yet be achieved in the heartland of global capitalism sanders s recent statements on foreign policy suggest that he intuitively grasps this central truth in a 2018 essay in the nation sanders pins the worldwide rise of the authoritarian right what his intellectual comrade in arms yanis varoufakis calls the nationalist international on kleptocratic oligarchs who exploit people s legitimate grievances against their political establishments to consolidate political and economic power to fight authoritarian nationalists sanders calls for a global coalition of progressive democrats that will promote unity inclusion and economic social racial and environmental justice yet in listing the oligarchic authoritarians oppressing the peoples of the world sanders includes president xi jinping who has steadily consolidated power as his government clamps down on political freedom and aggressively promotes china s version of authoritarian capitalism abroad this is a grave misjudgment if there is a nationalist international its great power patron is russia not china russia is indeed a kleptocratic state with an economy built on little more than natural resource extraction confronting some aspects of russian foreign policy by using the us s power over the international financial and monetary systems to interrupt the financial machinery that keeps oligarchy grinding might be a reasonable proposition but the chinese party state is not a kleptocracy as for exporting its brand of capitalism it is scarcely imaginable that whatever china is exporting could be worse than what the imf world bank and us treasury did over three decades under the auspices of structural adjustment or in the rearguard of military invasions furthermore china wields far more carrots than sticks in its foreign economic policy and while china is not above bullying its neighbors it has not intervened in their internal affairs to anything like the extent that russia much less the united states has done even in recent years aside from pushing russia and china closer to one another at the us s expense sanders s proposed strategy repeats the error of marshall plan thinking erasing a regionally specific geopolitical conflict by framing it as an all encompassing ideological struggle sanders s comfort with framing the us china conflict in ideological terms even if that ideology is different from recent versions leads in the wrong direction the problem with china from the point of view of us interests is not the country s authoritarianism however unfortunate that may be the problem is that chinese and american interests in east asia directly conflict so much so that they threaten a dramatic ratcheting up of great power rivalry what sanders could have learned from the history of defeats for the us left after world war ii is that great power rivalry is a threat to socialism not a prod to it it strengthens the hands of militarists and enables capitalists to cloak every demand for governmental favor in the garb of national security it fosters chauvinism and offers nationalism s poisoned psychic rewards as an alternative to emancipation declaring ideological war against china is not a substitute for a real war it only makes real war that much more likely the first principle of a left foreign policy must be reducing the scope for the kind of rivalry that bolsters militarism in the us and among the other great powers by expanding the space for constructive international cooperation possibilities include establishing a genuine global commons for natural resources with formulas for sharing that ensure benefits flow to the countries that produce them the us could also use its international power in particular the power of the us dollar to reduce the avenues like tax havens and various forms of money laundering through which oligarchs hold states hostage and vice versa the us could work to bolster the security and independence of smaller countries in order to lessen the extent to which third countries need for economic concessions make them sites for geoeconomic competition between the great powers this would be a welcome alternative to the us s patronizing attitude up until this point which has been to insist that countries attracted to china s offers of aid and investment especially heavily indebted african countries must be getting a raw deal and putting their sovereignty at risk the surest way to reduce the scope for conflict is to center foreign relations on those areas in which there are genuinely common interests along with working to achieve a lasting peace on the korean peninsula through nuclear disarmament and economic cooperation the us and china most urgently need to cooperate over climate change if protecting the planet from catastrophic climate change became the hinge of us strategy american as well as chinese leaders might begin to conclude that cooperation is more in their respective national interests than rivalry both countries might also have an interest in putting checks on the freewheeling and destructive nature of contemporary financial capitalism china s real estate and stock markets are gyrating out of control and could precipitate a global financial collapse some forms of capital controls in the interests of national and international economic stability could be pursued by china and the us working together likewise inequality is a growing social problem in both countries jeopardizing social stability a 21st century bretton woods to create an international environment that refrains from punishing states for pursuing welfarist domestic policies might be in the interests of both countries crises like those befalling the european union and the united states as austerity helped lay the ground for a nativist upsurge work against international stability and cooperation china and the us would both benefit from a program of cooperation in africa the middle east and latin america that helped stabilize political and economic conditions in those places such that the flow of desperate migrants slows even with all that china will still likely decide that it is not willing to tolerate a system of us alliances in east asia that constrains china s freedom of maneuver in the region at a minimum this is a situation that will require careful diplomacy with other countries in east asia to avoid the creation of hostile blocs poised for war the united states whatever its political complexion will have to choose carefully when to contest chinese actions as in the secret construction of naval bases on dredged up islands in territorial waters claimed by other countries that have not consented to them and when to treat them as essentially legitimate under conditions of free international economic intercourse and national sovereignty as with much chinese overseas lending nor may it be possible to hold off forever the day when the chinese currency rivals the dollar in global markets the last time such a change happened when the british navy and the pound sterling lost ground to the us navy and the dollar before during and after world war ii the british tried in vain to persuade the americans to forgo a dollar denominated world economy in favor of a new international currency a contemptuous united states government gave the british the brush off and in fact used its leverage over a weakened britain to hasten that country s postwar decline a more socialist america might wish to consider what measures of monetary internationalization would be in the us s long term interests and which our current position of strength would enable us to implement today none of these suggestions are guarantees against great power rivalry much depends on the leaders of the chinese communist party now increasingly a one man show and their own desire for a place in the sun as the german advocates of weltpolitik once called it one must also hope that the chinese people in particular china s 200 million industrial workers come to recognize that rivalry is very much serving the purposes of china s own rulers and plutocrats just as the vanguard of the european and american workers movements saw in the years before world war i but a us foreign policy that treats china as an ideological foe plays directly into president xi s skillful deployment of the trope of chinese humiliation at the hands of western imperialists meanwhile the great risk of china s rise to the ambitions of the us left is that fear of us relative decline will bolster our own militarists and monopolists the relative decline of us power vis à vis china is well underway and is probably irreversible the historical record provides no clear indication as to whether imperial decline is good or bad for socialist prospects but logically and historically the relative decline of one state means the relative rise of another there are good reasons to welcome the end of us global hegemony and to guard against the return of marshall plan thinking in the guise of global ideological war against china or perhaps a putative russo chinese axis of authoritarian capitalism but there are equally good reasons to hope that the us protects those strategic assets which give it autonomy in international affairs should genuine social transformation within the united states ever appear imminent we certainly do not want it truncated by a hostile capitalist power on the other side of the world
new york march 8 the december jobs report printed this morning at a deeply disappointing 20 000 new jobs the consensus estimate had been just 181 000 revisions for december 5 000 and january 7 000 jobs netted just 12 000 more jobs the revisions resulted in average three months job creation of 186 000 jobs and six months average jobs creation of 188 000 job creation was down a staggering 93 9 percent from the same month last year which had printed at 330 000 the unemployment rate was 3 8 percent down 2 10ths of a percentage point from january and down 3 10ths of a percentage point from february 2018 the u 6 unemployment at 7 3 percent dropped 8 10th of a percentage point from januaryâ s 8 1 percent and down 9 10ths of a percentage point since last year it is the lowest u 6 number since march 2001 nominal average weekly wages increased by 3 10 percent year on year at a rate that is higher than inflation real wages increased by just 1 10 percent assuming the december trimmed mean pce annual inflation rate of 2 0 analysis details and outlook we have been saying since our november jobs report that we see a flashing red light requiring investors and businesses to stop and assess conditions before moving forward the â goodâ jobs reports of december and january were anomalous we anticipate 2019q1 to print at just 2 1 to 2 6 percent down from the 2 3 to 2 8 print we had anticipated just last week in the 2018q4 gdp report that had been delayed by the government shut down let s look at our exclusive jobs creation by average weekly wages for the october jobs report december jobs creation by average weekly wage source the stuyvesant square consultancy compiled from bls data for february 2019 the number of people employed in february increased by 255 000 up from the 251 000 decrease that occurred from december to january some 163 000 individuals joined the workforce down 45 000 from the 163 229 who joined the workforce last month the jolts survey for december the latest available data released february 12th showed 169 000 new job openings from thatâ s an improvement over the 243 000 fewer job openings from october to november itâ s also a huge 1 666 000 jump from december of last year oil pricing and geopolitical concerns we re heartened to see fuel prices continuing below the 3 per gallon threshold gasoline prices for february are 2 3 percent higher than last month but nearly 1 percent lower than last year but oil prices as measured by west texas intermediate crude have climbed 7 14 percent from last month and but are 6 6 percent lower than last year us sanctions against iran will also adversely affect the economy of its neighbor iraq thereby putting pressure on the countryâ s political regime we remain concerned about iranâ s belligerent rhetoric and sanctions against iran precipitating some unforeseen flash point in the region the round of sanctions the white house imposed in november are claimed to be the harshest in our 40 year dealing with the islamic republic iran has said several times that they would cease all flow of oil through the straits of hormuz if iran could not sell oil because of u s sanctions the regime has engaged in more missile testing causing the u s to request even stronger sanctions from the un as of monday the kearsage arg is off the coast of oman relieving carrier group u s s john stennis cvn 74 in the persian gulf it appears the national command authority will continue to deter if not intimidate iranâ s leadership from pursuing misadventures in the straits nevertheless europe is anxious to strengthen the international role of the euro and its ministers would like to undermine the us â exorbitant privilegeâ as the worldâ s reserve currency european allies that supported the joint comprehensive plan of action â jcpoaâ on iranâ s nuclear arms development now have a ready excuse to abandon the usd as the currency for its oil trading as we discussed in greater detail here we think this strategy not an iranian military initiative in the straits of hormuz would have a greater effect to retaliate against the usa but would not amount to an act of war by threatening a vital american interest the effort to â de dollarizeâ oil measure taken by iran together with our putative â alliesâ in the eu who still support the jcpoa â iran dealâ notwithstanding reported violations could greatly diminish the usd status as the worldâ s reserve currency and wreak economic hardship upon the usa a lessening of concerns our earlier concerns about the us possibly sanctioning saudi arabia â ksaâ over the murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi have been largely allayed although some have continued to raise it in senate hearings wednesday on the appointment of general john abizaid us army ret as our ambassador as we have stated since the first reports of the murder implicating the kingdom and possible sanctions retortion might result particularly by ksa repricing its oil in euro yuan or perhaps even some new opec backed currency we think the implications of that upon the usd as the worldâ s reserve currency and on us interest rates would be staggering dollar denominated debt similarly in earlier months we had concerns that higher rates and a stronger dollar impinge developing nations ability to repay dollar and euro denominated debt they owe to american and european banks but those have been largely allayed by the fedâ s more dovish view nevertheless the slowing of the chinese economy continue our concerns about foreign debt held by china it has 750 billion in usd denominated offshore corporate dollar bonds or â ocdbâ toward the end of last year nomura had warned to monitor the situation and expressed concerns about the bond rollovers could be problematic given the decline of the yuan we have similar concerns but mostly related to a weakening chinese economy with other developing economies particularly india where the usd inr exchange rate had ended 2018 at 1 70 we are seeing recovery presumably because the fed has pulled back the inr traded at its lowest point in history in october 1 74 but war tensions with pakistan while allayed for the last week or so should keep investors on razorâ s edge other macro data note that we have substituted the department of transportation statistic the transportation services index or tsi in our model because the data is produced more closely to the monthly jobs report and it has a closer correlation to gdp than the north american trans border freight numbers we had been using source us dot tsi percentage change data chart the tsi printed at 2 percent for december comprised of a 3 1 percent drop in freight and a 0 2 percent increase in passenger transport we continue to be heartened that people are taking home more cash from the tax cut so that debt service will account for a lesser percentage of disposable income data released early last month for 2018q3 continued to support our thesis we have expected since the tax bill passed that together with cheaper gasoline prices should help maintain consumer spending we note these other developments since our last jobs report which had been somewhat data starved because of the government shut down the wholesale trade report for december reported last month showed sales up 1 percent year on year down 1 percent month on month inventories were up 7 3 percent from last year down 1 1 percent month on month the inventory to sales ratio was 1 33 percent up from the 1 25 percent last year building permits for january released this morning increased 1 4 percent from december but down 1 5 percent from last year housing starts increased by 18 6 percent month to month but fell 7 8 percent year on year the ism manufacturing report for february released march 1 showed continuing growth at 54 2 but down significantly from januaryâ s 56 6 the ism non manufacturing report for february the latest available released march 5th printed at 59 7 thatâ s up 3 points from januaryâ s 56 7 but still down from the 59 5 that printed for the same period last year personal income outlays was delayed for the government shut down and january only printed income not outlays for december released march 1st disposable personal income increased by 1 1 percent in current dollars and also up 1 0 percent in chained 2012 dollars those are down from 0 3 and 0 2 percent in november respectively personal consumption expenditures pce for december decreased 0 5 percent in current dollars and 0 6 percent in chained 2012 dollars thatâ s down from 0 6 percent and 0 5 percent increases in november for current and chained dollars respectively for january personal income is down 0 2 percent in current dollars and unchanged in 2012 dollars the ibd tipp economic optimism index released march 5th jumped to 55 7 up 10 7 percentage points anything above 50 indicates growth this and the ism services index are among the few brighter data points in this economy fed normalizing we are heartened by recent fed statements moving away from tightening rates too much too quickly while inflation for personal consumption expenditures less food and energy or real pce had hit the fed s target of 2 percent weâ re seeing that slip somewhat in the last couple of months we continue to believe that moves toward normalization should take place more slowly and only after growth had become decidedly more robust over several more quarters at least four quarters of a consistent 3 percent gdp growth we are only halfway to that goal as of 2018q4 we would also like to see more stable growth in gross domestic investment growth of at least 1 5 percent excluding inventory as we have illustrated in our gdp report for 2018q4 the 2018q3 and 2018q2 the better than expected gdp reports for those quarters included a lot of â shiftingâ from and to earlier or later quarters and as we noted in our 2018q3 report there were signs of slowing with 200 bps of the 3 5 percent gdp growth coming from inventory restocking as with gross domestic investment we would like to see steady consistent growth in each of the four categories of gdp growth we have long held the view that trimmed mean pce produced by the dallas fed is a better measure of inflation in the day to day costs of most americans it is currently around 2 percent but it has been volatile the 3 percent rate the fed adopted in december and the poor top line jobs report from today will likely put a damper on further fed normalizing the yield curve of which we have been gravely concerned in the last several months is now simply dangerous volatile the fed rate hikes which have their greatest effect on short term rates and why we use the 3mo 10yr curve in 2018 premature and outpaced the economy s growth we started 2018 with a spread of the 3 month 10 year yield curve two of nearly 102 bps just half the 200 or so bps that started 2017 starting 2019 the 3 month 10 year yield curve was just 15 bps apart weâ re also seeing repeated yield curve inversions among the shorter term rates the 10 year rate is barely able to sustain 2 70 percent so far in 2019 increasing the fedâ s likelihood that yield curves will invert the 3 month 10 year curve is now just 19 bps we would like to see a minimum of two quarters of at least a 75 bps spread pulling back from the higher 150 bps spread we had cited earlier for what appears between the 3 mo and 10 yr yield before the fed considers another rate increase in what is in our view an increasingly anemic economy we are simply not seeing any holistic appetite among investors for increased risk as signaled by moving away from treasuries and into â risk onâ assets which would tend to drive rates higher treasury yields are inversely proportional to risk appetite so the lower the treasury rate the more dollars invested there and not in risk on assets while we dogmatically prefer a strong dollar from a high demand for us goods and services we re wary of dollar strength that is attributable to the fed s interest rate hikes more than demand for u s goods and services we think a stable or even a lower fed rate would help on a number off fronts not least of which would be relieving foreign debtors of usd debt obligations they might not be able to meet with a strong dollar with asia europe and north america all showing evidence of a slow down we think it is vitally important for the finance ministers and central bankers of all three major economies agree a strategy to address what we foresee as a very challenging time later this year for the global economy we remain unperturbed by the trade dispute with china and by the trump tariffs but weâ re not willing to ignore the â herd instinctâ of ignorant investors who buy into the lie that â tariffs cause or worsen depressionsâ milton friedmanâ s estate has a nobel prize that says otherwise we support the president s more diligent management of trade to defend against cheating and to oppose tariff and non tariff barriers and to protect intellectual property and technology transfers president xi has shown little tolerance for corruption among chinese officials in his efforts to make china a respected member of the family of nations we only hope that he will extend that attitude to end chinaâ s more egregious trade cheating that said we would like to see the president engage americaâ s asian and european allies to step up to join a coalition of the willing to challenge china s decades old unfair trade practices and thefts of intellectual property because the one on one dispute could simply trigger mutual retaliation there is more power in american dealings with xi from a multilateral â weâ than a unilateral â usâ moreover china can t afford a restless or even a rebellious populace being unemployed its leaders need exports to the u s and europe more than the west needs access to chinaâ s markets losing american sales in chinese markets might hurt american and european companies bottom line and anger american farmers losing chinese jobs to american tariffs might collapse chinaâ s government particularly given the chinese firmsâ possible future inability to roll over its usd and eur denominated debt chinaâ s exports dropped over 20 percent y on y so president xiâ s negotiators should have significant motive to achieve a deal with president trump quickly while ceos seem concerned about margins if china manufacturing sites are lost in a trade war we note that contract producers in most businesses are available in other locations and at lower wages than china and that continuing thefts of intellectual property present a longer term threat to us businesses we remain bullish on india and believe it is a much more promising venue for low wage manufacturing investment over the long term than china however the continuing geopolitical issues with pakistan require investors to tread cautiously in one of the worldâ s fastest growing economies weâ re circumspect about the rate of gdp growth reflected in the last three reported quarters we continue to believe the favorable numbers from 2018q1 and 2018q2 arose largely from stacking up gdp from prior and later quarters as discussed here then 2018q3 at 3 5 percent had a huge 2 percent bump from an inventory build we think the 2018q4 gdp of 2 6 percent will likely presage continued lower growth for 2019 our doubts will continue until we see two consecutive quarters of increases in all four categories of gdp i e personal consumption expenditures net exports gross domestic investment and government consumption expenditures we predicted a slowing economy in our november jobs report and we are inclined to continue that view today given the jobs report today and all these shorter term yield curve inversions we expect 2019 q1 to print at 2 1 to 2 6 percent down from the 2 3 to 2 8 percent we predicted just last week in the delayed 2018q4 gdp report todayâ s jobs report a rapidly narrowing yeld curve additional signs that china and europe are slowing the prospect of â no dealâ brexit a failed summit in hanoi and signals that china trade negotiations may not end as we had hoped force us to down play economic growth in all of 2019 we would not be surprised if 2019 yielded growth for the full year at 2 percent or less all things being equal investment summary we urge investors who are at or near retirement to move to at least a 75 percent cash portfolio with growth prospects dim we donâ t think there is sufficient capital growth prospect for equities to justify a sharper market downturn on a grey or black swan event such as a flare up of the pakistan india dispute a resumption of north korean nuclear testing or further political troubles in the us or europe in equities weâ re inclined to mostly stand pat with these sectors from our 2018q4 summary but in less proportion and with some changes as follows
trade tensions brexit crisis present a gloomy outlook for global economy soaring us output thwarts opec s efforts to bolster oil prices kuwait as trade tensions and political uncertainty cloud prospects all around the world the organization for economic cooperation and development released a fairly gloomy report last week regarding its outlook on the global economy weakness in the euro area and china are proving more stubborn while trade growth decelerates severely and the brexit debacle drags on the report downgraded almost every group of 20 nation s economy disappointing hopes that the sources of weakness seen towards the end of 2018 would prove temporary growth in europe was downgraded to 1 percent from 1 8 percent china s growth was lowered to 6 percent from 6 2 percent and for the uk forecast was cut to 0 8 percent from 1 4 percent nevertheless there are some signs that the global economy will soon recover trade tensions between the us and china appear to have thawed in recent months boosting confidence that a truce may be reached soon between the two largest economies us trade deficit soars in a rough setback to us president donald trump s ambitions to reduce the trade imbalance the us trade deficit rose to 621 billion last year the figure marks the largest on record since 2008 when the figure hit 709bn china who is still engulfed in ongoing negotiations with the us after months of tit for tat tariffs accounts for nearly half that total trump s pledge to protect the us from what he describes as the primary threat to the american economy the trade deficit might now prove detrimental to his political vulnerability as he prepares for his 2020 re election bid the durable us economy compared to weakness around the globe is a noteworthy factor contributing to the imbalances as consumers in the us buy more from overseas even as struggling foreign counterparts buy less american goods the continuously strong demand from us consumers seems to have overcome the tariffs imposed by the trump administration while the softer demand from abroad has been more affected by retaliatory tariffs on us goods jobs growth comes to a halt the department of labor reported that non farm payrolls rose just 20 000 the weakest gain in 17 months gravely missing the forecast of 180 000 and marks a severe drop from the strong 311 000 jobs added in january however the disappointing figure was offset by year on year wage growth at 3 4 percent marking its quickest pace since 2009 unemployment dipped slightly from 4 percent to 3 8 percent average hourly earnings rose 0 4 percent in february after gaining 0 1 percent in january raising the annual increase in wages to 3 4 percent the us dollar took a hit following the report however still remains at an over two month high the us kept interest rates on hold in january and pledged to be patient moving forward and the figures are unlikely to put the fed off from its stance as it watches how the domestic economy will handle slowing global growth both industrial production and retail sales unexpectedly reported to the downside in both december and january while the housing sector decelerated equities just this past week we have seen china cut its goal for economic expansion the boc cut its expectations for policy tightening and the oecd lowered its global outlook the tech industry sent us stocks down while the ecb aided in the drop after delivering a grim economic forecast the s p 500 index sank for the fifth consecutive day initially dragged down by amazon microsoft apple and facebook in europe the stoxx europe 600 index sank the most in the month while china s stock market slumped the most since october ecb cuts growth outlook the european central bank s new outlook for annual gdp growth has been revised down substantially as quoted by the president of the ecb mario draghi on thursday the central bank announced it would keep interest rates on hold until at least the end of this year the statement extended the banks previous forecast of holding rates until the summer of 2019 amid concerns regarding eurozone growth and productivity gdp projections this year were downgraded harshly to 1 1 percent from a forecast of 1 7 percent just three months ago and the decision to make a fresh offer of cheap loans to euro zone banks were both signals as to how concerned ecb policymakers have become the bank introduced another program to stimulate bank lending in the euro zone called the targeted longer term refinancing operations or tltro iii which will begin september of 2019 and end in march of 2021 the loans which the ecb will provide at cheap rates to banks in the euro area will provide better credit conditions to customers the aim is to stimulate the economy as the third injection of stimulus mimics the mechanism first introduced in 2014 and for the second time in 2016 inflation forecasts were also cut with prices now set to undershoot the bank s 2 percent aim at 1 2 percent this year against a previous forecast of 1 6 percent the stance follows both the us federal reserve and the bank of england who have also ruled out rate hikes any time soon as global demand wanes the euro fell to the lowest level since 2017 following the announcement dropping to 1 1182 against the us dollar and later recovered slightly draghi acknowledged there were still downside risks to the euro zone economy even with the new policies in place reflecting the limits of the bank s ability to fight a climate of political uncertainty over trade and brexit both of which are out of the ecb s hands the heavily export dependent economy is struggling to counteract effects of global trade battles and brexit aspects which have weighed heavy on the country s economic performance italy is now in recession and germany barely avoided a recession at the end of 2018 nevertheless officials still hope the slowdown will prove temporary pinning their hopes on a strong labor market a slight rise in government spending and a series of factors affecting the german industry last year that are believed to be impermanent brexit uncertainty the uk is due to leave the eu on the 29th of march and with only a few days remaining negotiations are proving tough prime minister theresa may will now have another go at getting her deal through parliament on march 12th which would have to reverse the historic record defeat of 200 votes in january she will now seek legally enforceable changes to the backstop the controversial policy designed to prevent physical checks on the border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland leading brexiteers want insurance that the backstop will not endure indefinitely as it would see the uk aligned with eu customs until alternative arrangements worked out looking forward if the vote next week is rejected a choice will then have to be made on whether to leave the eu without a deal or to defer the exit date such an extension to the article 50 process would need unanimous approval of the eu the sterling has continuously struggled since the 2016 brexit vote and is down more than 11 percent since then canada s weaker first half

expected due to the frail data lower oil prices slowing household consumption and weaker investment spending are all aspects that pushed the economy to a near halt during the last 3 months of 2018

will made in china 2025 succeed in making china the world s leading producer of high value technology is china really a threat to the world s industrialized economies on this episode george magnus discusses four red flags that may complicate china s plans for growth george magnus is an associate at the china centre at the oxford university a research associate at the school of oriental and african studies and a former chief economist for ubs his latest book is red flags why xi s china is in jeopardy you can download the episode by clicking the link above and don t forget to subscribe to my podcast on itunes or stitcher tell your friends leave a review pethokoukis let s start off with the title i have a bad habit of telling authors that their title is wrong and here s what the title should actually be i m not going to say that to you but i think some people here in the united states would wonder if china is in jeopardy because the message that we frequently hear is that china is growing faster than the united states their leaders are geniuses hoovering up all the data for their ai they re spending gobs of money on these emerging technologies and they re sort of doing everything right and it s the united states which is in jeopardy but obviously you re making what to me seems like a contrarian case from an american perspective magnus well it s a good point and in fact i suppose my knee jerk reaction is to say that you shouldn t believe everything you read in the newspapers i m sure we ll get onto a lot of this material shortly but i should explain really that the subtitle of the book about why xi s china is in jeopardy and i do explain this kind of very early on is not to predict the downfall of xi jinping or the end of the communist party s governor and system in china or anything remotely connected with the collapse of the country which others have predicted in years gone by so i m not going there the issue about jeopardy really is that i think policymaking and policy in china is probably more brittle and therefore the survival of the incumbent government shall we say is more brittle than sometimes we think it is we believe nowadays particularly after the 19th party congress in 2017 and the national people s congress in 2018 that xi jinping is omnipotent and all powerful and all he has to do is wave his fingers and magical things will happen in china and everything is hunky dory and i don t think that s quite right and i m sure we ll go into the reasons as to why not as we go through the through the podcast whenever this topic comes up i think back to how the public perception of china changed and how people no longer think of it as just some interesting success story a country that s adopted at least some elements of market capitalism and is advancing and is on the path toward democracy or on a path toward becoming south korea and all the millions of people coming out of poverty to me one of the key moments that influenced perception in the united states was when citizens against government waste put out an ad called the chinese professor ad and it showed a future classroom in beijing maybe 20 years from now where sort of an evil looking chinese professor was telling his students about the fall of the united states and they were laughing and the us had accumulated all this debt and china was now the superpower i think that sort of it got a iot of page views and you saw it all over the place marked a change in how we perceive china certainly not the only thing and certainly there s a different view today where we see china as a threat in the book you mention a number of red flags and it s kind of an obvious place for me to go so i m going to go there let s start working through a few of those red flags that you see one is debt china has a lot of debt some of the china nears point to debt as being a real weakness of the chinese economy how do you see it what i think it is and i think it s just by way of background we should remember that at the time of the financial crisis back in 2007 2008 china s debt its non financial debt was about a 100 120 percent of gdp kind of unremarkable really but if you fast forward 10 years to last year the end of last year the level of debt gdp is up at around 300 percent of gdp maybe a little bit more now what is that what kind of debt is that alright so this includes government debt central government debt which actually is a relatively small proportion of the total as well as a lot of local and provincial government debt and corporate debt which includes non financial companies state owned enterprises private companies although private companies don t really own a lot of debt so a lot of this is in the state sector and household debt households actually have been the most recent debtors well when i say the most recent debtors i mean the rise in debt has been remarkable most recently because of households so household debt to disposable income in china is now about a 120 percent which is bigger than it is in the united states what is remarkable about china s debt story is the speed with which it s accumulated so that s in space of about 10 or 11 years and the levels to which it has risen now we should also say that since the end of 2016 the beginning of 2017 china has been quite rigorous i would say to a degree about trying to contain the growth of debt and trying to deleverage the economy they know that this is a bad thing for the chinese economy and for the outlook for growth in the future therefore they know that this has to be brought under control is that why we re seeing the economy slow now is that the main reason it is the principal reason a lot of people said well china is kind of buckling under the pressure of tariffs in the trade war that s not strictly true although it would be truer if president trump s proposals which are now the subject of negotiations with china if they did actually come to pass then i think china would actually have a very serious issue in 2019 2020 but most of the reason that the chinese economy has been slowing down and looks a little bit fragile i would say is because of the impact of deleveraging policies and the clamp down really on egregious forms of risk taking and financial behavior which is something which we should applaud but there is a cost to it and it s not certain that the chinese leadership are willing to absorb that cost we shall see well that s what i was going to suggest is this a sustained effort and are they willing to accept slower economic growth which has been sort of their main achievement year after year is very high fast rates of growth are they willing to accept maybe a sustained period of slower growth in return for more financial stability yeah so that s the 64 trillion yuan question because on the face of it and the rhetoric from party officials and from the central bank is financial stability is one of our principal objectives and we will not go down this route again of using credit to artificially stimulate the economy because it got a bad ending so on one level i think they understand this all too well on another level though and of course everything in china is nuanced we are seeing the consequences in terms of weaker economic growth and particular in terms of the labor market so labor market statistics in china like in most emerging countries are not really very good but there is quite a lot of anecdotal evidence to suggest that layoffs have picked up that some people are kind of returning to the countryside not in droves as they did in 2007 2008 but there is a sort of a fragility there and we have seen some early signs of pushback against the more stern deliberate deleveraging policies that were being pursued in 2017 and 2018 is there a growth rate that creates extreme political problems for the chinese leadership is a chinese economy that s growing forget about a recession but at 3 or 4 percent does that have wider implications than one which is growing at 6 or 7 percent does that breed any sort of instability is their economy built to run very very fast and if it s not running very very fast the whole thing comes tumbling down yeah i think this is what i would be concerned about and i think others are too is not necessarily that resolving china s debt crisis or debt problem is going to cause banks to go bust and you know a repeat of what we experienced ourselves in the west in 2008 2009 that i think is possible but unlikely right in a state owned banking system no major or even medium sized financial institutions really will be allowed to go bust or to be found to be short of liquidity but i think that resolution of excessive debt and uncommercial debt is the same whether you know the communist party is in charge or a western government is in charge of its own country as we saw 10 years ago and the cost of coming to terms with that kind of policy error is really a protracted period of low growth i think in the next kind of 5 10 years china will slow down to something like 3 or 4 percent and i think the problem there is not necessarily the number but actually what the implications might be for jobs and for the throughput of about 8 million graduates each year who have to find meaningful jobs presumably we want graduates to find meaningful jobs otherwise they can become quite restive and obviously that s got implications for social stability as well so the issue really is whether china can adjust well i think the issue for me is whether china can fulfill its aspirations and do all the things it wants to do and be all the things it wants to be in an environment where growth for a protracted period of time is going to be much lower with consequences for unemployment which have yet to show up so what is the chinese dream what is their goal what do they want that country to look like in 25 years well president xi jinping was quite open about this at the 19th party congress in 2017 so you know by the middle of the century 2049 remember is the centenary of the founding of the people s republic so i mean they don t say it in these words but i think he wants china to be effectively a paid up member of the advanced economies by 2049 but in the process of getting there over the next 32 years or whatever i think they want china to become one of the principal sources of new technologies they ve identified 10 important sectors in a policy document which is known as made in china 2025 which is the bone of contention for the us trade representative and the white house and the us administration so in leading electric vehicles in artificial intelligence in quantum computing in you know you name it in any of the kind of modern technologies that we re all trying to be top dog in china wants to be number one and it wants to not only have a world leadership in these sectors but also obviously use them as the tool with which to propel higher productivity growth in china and bring prosperity to the country in the longer term right well i want to explore that but that also provides a nice lead into another one of the red flags which is the demographic situation if your country is aging and is not having a lot of kids then that future growth needs to come from much faster productivity though china i assume still thinks it can do something on the demographic front to improve sort of current trends well yes they would like to do that and so far i don t think they are being particularly successful and i don t think they will be really there s nothing sort of specific about china there i just think the demographic problem for all of us really is really what to do about fertility it s not really about living longer which is something that we all have to kind of deal with in our individual lives and families but actually the economic problem of aging is really that there aren t enough kids growing up to become workers in the future so there s this squeeze on the working age population which translates percentage point for percentage point into lower economic growth but it also has other issues or other consequences which is the affordability of pensions and health care plans and residential care and so on so china is in kind of a unique situation in the sense that i mean it s the fastest aging country on the planet not the oldest which is probably japan but fastest aging in the sense that china s age structure will shift up in the next 20 or 22 years by as much as it is taken us to do the same sort of shift over the last century and of course they re doing it at much lower levels of income per head than we have experienced so by now when we face our aging problems in the western world we have income per capita of between 40 000 60 000 in most countries china s is about 16 000 and sure in the next 5 10 15 years that ll grow but actually it s not going to grow quickly enough as a benchmark to really compensate for the burden of providing for an aging society which i think is coming at them very very quickly indeed so ideally they should widen deepen make more generous the social safety net particularly for pensions the treatment of migrant workers health care expenditure because a lot of chinese although there is universal health care there are a lot of out of pocket expenses which the typical chinese families have to meet for their health care so this is a charge on growth as well it s another reason why i think china will be challenged in the future to sustain these very very elevated rates of economic expansion which are probably not quite as elevated as official figures would have us believe anyway right could you see a scenario where china becomes as wealthy on a per capita basis as even forget about the united states or scandinavia or canada but let s say the eastern european countries well of course it s fair to point out that there is no such thing as a sort of a black and white picture of china i mean china is a huge country with 1 4 billion people in coastal provinces and big coastal cities income per head is already on par with countries like portugal for example whereas of course in the middle of the country and in the western part of the country and in the northeastern part of the country which is where a lot of china s heavy industries are concentrated income per head is much lower so i can see that there will be provinces or cities maybe in the future which will certainly be also rans you know when it comes to kind of oecd type of comparisons but i must say in the foreseeable future i don t really see parity being reached by the way there s another issue which i think is kind of interesting to bring up here particularly given the sort of narratives that sometimes we are asked to believe about china either being or perhaps within the next 10 years being the biggest economy in the world in us dollar terms and people do this i think partly because it s sort of part of the narrative which i think china would like us to believe and partly because they just use spreadsheets from the last 35 years or 40 years and just project them into the future as if nothing is changing but one of the traps i also talk about in the book actually is the renminbi trap let s suppose that the renminbi devalues some point in the next five years by a meaningful amount so if the peg breaks let s say the history of or the empirical work on pegs suggests that usually when that happens you know you don t get a kind of a 5 or 10 percent depreciation but it can be 20 percent 30 percent sometimes more that impact on the dollar value of china s gdp could well mean that by 2025 or 2030 that china s gdp in dollar terms will not be that much different relative to the united states than it is today so i don t think it s a foregone conclusion at all why would that peg break well because and i think that this hops back to the debt problem in a way one of the phenomena that is continuing in china despite the deleveraging policies is the growth in financial system assets and liabilities so not just banks but also what we call non banking financial institutions so this would include insurance companies trust banks and other institutions that exist within the shadow banking sector shall we say so if you look at the growth of the total assets and liabilities in the financial system they re growing at a pace which is not really compatible with two other phenomena one is the existence of the peg and the other is the limited level of currency reserves now true china does have 3 trillion worth of exchange reserves although not all of those 3 trillion are liquid but let s say two thirds of them are liquid reserves it wouldn t take much in the way of capital flight emanating from the excess growth of financial system assets and liabilities to basically put the peg under pressure if the reserves actually started to fall i think if china were to really clamp down very very seriously on leverage and on the growth of banking or financial system liquidity i think the outlook would be very different in terms of its external stability but of course there would be a cost in terms of domestic growth but failing that i think that there is a kind of an inconsistency between the growth of financial assets and liabilities in renminbi terms at home and the existence of a peg which has got to be very carefully managed in conjunction with a limited level of reserves if the reserves were growing 500 billion a year no problem at all but they re out of kilter so eventually i think it ll be swamped by the outflow of capital despite the existence of capital controls the country is looking to become more technologically advanced and more innovative can china do that from a purely sort of top down government directs where subsidies go sort of growth model or do they need to adapt a more american like growth model granted china has developed some very big sort of global brands but can china get to where it wants to be technologically with a kind of a subsidy and more not to take it too far commanding control model or i ll put this way with a top down model versus a kind of more organic growth like you see in the united states right so here s another 64 trillion yuan question i think it s a question which preoccupies think tanks and policymakers and analysts all over the world which is we know that in the west we re in a bit of a bunker following the crisis 10 or 11 years ago and we are asking questions of our politicians the politicians are certainly asking questions about whether there might be a different way of doing things where the balance between the private sector and the role of government might be different from the way we ve thought about it in the past but by the same token jim i think in china the same issues exist there and in fact despite the fact that we think that the biggest issue in sort of sino western relations nowadays is trade in china they re also having a big discussion about the role of the private sector and about the role of the state so during the last year i think it s kind of interesting because there hasn t really been any opposition or disquiet about xi jinping since he came to power in 2012 but it s no coincidence i think in my mind that during the last 12 to 15 months there have been a number of instances where leading intellectuals and professors who ve had work published long enough for foreigners to translate it before it s been taken down from the chinese web where they ve questioned the path that the communist party is treading down so the party view is that china s success is attributable to the role of the party the role of industrial policy and state direction of the economy and of technology and the dissenting view is that actually this is not the basis for china s success at all and then in fact all the success that china has had over the last 40 years in fact since deng xiaoping came to power in 1978 is basically down to entrepreneurship to what the chinese called marketization which is really the incorporation of market mechanisms into the state system and to learning from the outside world about how to adapt foreign innovation and technology for the domestic chinese economy and markets so this i think kind of an interesting discussion because we think sometimes and obviously the narrative from beijing is that they have a different model which is better to ours and state direction and subsidies and industrial policies is the way to go well it might be in terms of very specific scientific and technological accomplishments let s not be childish about it because you know sending a spacecraft to the dark side of the moon or the far side of the moon and being big in e commerce and quantum computing and biomeds all of these things you know we shouldn t be slouches about this that these are things that the chinese are very good at and are very accomplished but there s more to breaking the technological barriers in the future particularly commercializing the technology establishing brands in technologies using those technologies to spawn multiple innovations across industrial sectors that you can t plan for or determine top down i still think you know i m a western trained economist so i would say this wouldn t i but i still think that this is a strength that we still have and which i think china will find that it runs up short on and i think that the stifling of innovation and the aversion to instability and what we would call creative destruction these kinds of things i think are not necessarily issues that will keep china kind of stuck in the mud as it were but i think that in many respects it will make the lead that western technologies and companies still have over china quite difficult to eradicate all together but is it the case then that beijing believes a more open economy a more entrepreneurial economy a less state directed economy is just fundamentally incompatible with a political system that s authoritarian at best that it sort of needs to believe that their alternate model works because if it doesn t that more open western model inside that model are the seeds for the demise of the chinese communist party as the leading force in that society yeah i actually think that s precisely the point so there have been over the last year sort of party officials that have spoken about the private sector having already accomplished its historic mission which is a sort of a veiled or not so veiled allusion to the fact that they ve done their bit you know that the state sector is really the only thing that s important now there s certainly been no hiding the wishes of the leadership to make the state sector and state enterprises to give them the primacy in the economy and put them in the forefront of leadership when it comes to technological accomplishment and the future prosperity of china i mean i don t think there s any beating around the bush there i think they honestly believe that this is the case and i think as you suggested really implicitly i think they believe that actually if they opened up too far and too fast to what a lot of westerners and governments would like the chinese to do i think they think that that would be existential for them because it would it would start to threaten the basis of the represent d etre for the communist party which is to rule unchallenged and not to have private enterprise or i mean controlled private enterprise but not having you know private initiative and private enterprise challenge the role of the government and of the party but is it equally existential if the west rises to separate itself from china that we have this i think you may have called it this iron curtain of technology where you have these two different tech ecosystems because the west is so worried either about chinese advances for national security purposes worries about the spying on the united states or we just fear an advanced china so we re trying to suppress their technological advance by creating an ecosystem by not letting their companies participate in our economies is that also a threat to chinese advance if we just sort of try to again create this iron curtain or bubble around the chinese economy yeah i mean it s something that i don t kind of think about with any kind of relish at all i think it s sort a lose lose situation i think they relish it in the white house well maybe i mean some may do i think that if the relationship particularly between the united states and china of course is so fundamentally different than it was between the united states and the former soviet union because the levels of interdependence between the economic systems and the trading systems of china and the united states is a different world from what it was with the old ussr so ideally and i suppose i d like to think about this slightly optimistically although maybe naively i m not sure but i think that that level of interdependence is a it s kind of a good thing despite the spat that were all having at the moment about trade and huawei and goodness knows what else but i think it creates a sort of a platform on top of which hopefully the two governments maybe not these governments but future governments as well despite difficult times and sometimes having spats can actually try to figure out kind of some way of living together even if the dearest wishes of both sides can t be fulfilled all together so there are a lot of things for example that i think china could offer to the us and to the european and other western business communities which will not cost the communist party much in terms of its credibility or authority so market access is one of the big issues which figures in negotiation the very very high levels of automobile tariffs are another issue what to do about joint ventures and technology transfer intellectual property protection i mean there are many things that i think that china might do in its own interest provided it could do so without being seen to be succumbing to foreign pressure which of course is very sensitive for them if you were in the white house would you object or try to prevent chinese companies from creating key elements of the internet backbone or of the 5g backbone would you want them not to be involved in those sorts of projects okay so i m not expert enough to know where the dividing line is between genuine threat to security and fear of technological competition i mean if we re trying to stop chinese companies from doing things because we don t think that we can compete with them actually i don t think that s good for either side it s obviously not good for the chinese because they ll be constricted and they ll get quite touchy about it is not good for us because actually we need to be good at things and need to spend resources money education to try to retain the number one position that we think we want but if there are genuine security issues and i think that these have been voiced and aired in conjunction with both the zte corporation which was the subject of dispute last year and with huawei currently then i think we do have to be very careful because you know china is not just kind of any old feisty competitor that we do business with it is an adversary it has a political system that is fundamentally different from one that we believe is acceptable and china is obviously the only major country in the world that can seek to kind of pedal its soft power and influence in foreign countries where we want to compete as well so i think it s a fair point that we should draw the line where we think that unfair advantages are at work which would give a foreign country in this case china an ability to basically evade or undermine things that we think are really valuable but that s a big judgment call

nagaraja a bulk of the 7 billion in worker remittances come from sri lankan women working in the middle east many in unsafe environments women also sew garments which brings in 5 billion to the economy and another 1 5 billion comes from tea which is plucked by women considering sri lanka s import oriented economy and the deficit in the current account the foreign exchange earned by women is helping the country barely keep its head above the water mas supports nine crèches in sri lanka as well as in jordan and india taking care of a total of around 500 children who otherwise might not be able to access early education benefits chief executive officer of mas active trading pvt ltd or mas kreeda sarinda unamboowe says that the biggest benefit for the apparel employer comes from lower turnover costs due to the mas supported crèches generally staff turnover rates for manufacturing are much higher than for service businesses at mas kreeda vaanavil it s at 49 however among the parents who ve enrolled their children in the crèche the annual turnover is just 1 3 now there is a waiting list for enrolling kids at the facility as 238 women and 64 male factory workers have children under six years old mas estimates the return on investment for the crèche in vaanavil at around 4 months of operational costs of mas kreeda with around 70 000 women employed across the entire mas group starting childcare facilities has added up benefits like reducing staff turnover and training costs children too benefit greatly from employer provided childcare only 50 of three to five year old children are enrolled in preschool which constrains early childhood development school readiness and sustainable social and economic development according to the international finance corporation ifc and the united nations international children s emergency fund unicef report tackling childcare the business case for employer supported childcare in sri lanka published in december 2018 childcare also allows women to return to work earlier after childbirth giving their careers a boost unavailability of affordable and quality childcare hampers many parents from entering continuing or returning to paid work the report added a world bank study found that sri lankan women tend to leave employment after marriage and are 7 4 less likely to re join until their children are at least over five years old a joint study by the colombo stock exchange and the ifc shows women representation in boardrooms at just 8 this number is comparatively higher than in more advanced economies such as japan at 3 5 and south korea at 4 1 according to deloitte although lower than australia at 20 1 norway at 46 7 and india at 11 2 international labour organization statistics show that women held only 27 6 of management positions in sri lanka in 2017 although it had increased from 24 8 in 2014 in contrast 59 of managers in laos were women in 2017 51 5 in the philippines and 40 5 in the united states in australia it was 36 6 in 2016 unfortunately many women instead of being empowered to take part in the country s economy are discouraged women are harassed on roads and in public transport the united nations population fund survey in 2018 highlighted that 90 of women in sri lanka have faced sexual harassment while on public transport women not only face challenges commuting to and from work but according to the census and statistics department employers also prefer not to hire females because they think women aren t as committed to a career due to family responsibilities and because employers have to bear the cost of maternity leave the result just 34 of women contributed to the country s labour force in 2018 as opposed to 72 of men according to the gender gap report 2018 women are paid 64 cents to each rupee a man earns for similar work after being ranked the 13th best in the world for the gender gap in the report s inaugural edition in 2006 sri lanka has fallen gradually to 100th place by 2018 in sri lanka female enrolment at secondary and tertiary education is higher than for men and their lower labour force participation keeps its most educated unutilised for economic advancement two actions could be taken to change the situation improve public transport and provide accessibility to quality childcare the government has shown intent to improve transport and childcare facilities however implementation lags perhaps due to the lack of resources to fund all intent the 2018 budget included a rs50 million proposal to introduce childcare facilities at government offices located near each other with at least 500 employees however they have proposed no benefits for private sector childcare if governments can subsidize childcare for pre school children women are more likely to receive wages recent world bank group research covering more than 100 economies suggest that support for parents such as tax credits and early childcare increases women s labour force participation sri lanka is one of the world s lowest spenders on early childhood development lodging just 0 0001 of gdp or 80 000 based on 2017 gdp in expenditure australia on the other hand will be subsidizing aus 37 billion for childcare over the next four years under a policy that makes businesses work around childcare and not vice versa according to the organisation for economic co operation and development nordic countries such as iceland and sweden are some of the best performing spending 1 of their gdp annually on childcare despite lower government spending in sri lanka some companies have pushed strongly for childcare at work to keep themselves at the forefront of the competition harshani rathnayake is lucky to be working at one such firm a mother of two rathnayake is a mat weaver at selyn exporters handloom weaving village in kumbukgete near kurunegala four years earlier rathnayake had worked at an incense stick factory but quit after she delivered her second child but staying home for long was not an option as finances were tight she joined selyn over a year ago and intends to work for as long as possible to support the education of her two daughters rathnayake often checks up on her four year old second child pre schooled at the selyn supported daycare while at work the eldest now in grade 4 arrives at the daycare after school and completes her homework and plays with the other children until rathnayake finishes work mas holdings selyn and standard chartered sri lanka are three companies out of 10 featured in the joint ifc and unicef sri lanka report the report was published under ifc s women in work programme a four year 11 5 million initiative funded by the australian government to help firms create better jobs for women ifc country manager for sri lanka and the maldives amena arif says that employer supported childcare is a win win for children employers and communities as a parent you make many choices having to balance your professional and personal lives can be challenging this is where reliable affordable and quality childcare solutions fit in when companies support their employees in meeting their childcare needs they can hire and retain talent thereby boosting profits and productivity she adds the business proposition for providing childcare is not only valid for large corporates for selyn which employs around 350 of which over 300 are women its daycare and flexible working arrangements have been instrumental in bringing younger talent into a traditional industry the average age in the handloom industry is over 45 so we really needed younger people to come and work at our weaving centres says selyna peiris business development director at selyn exports after childcare was introduced 10 out of 40 weavers in kumbukgete are now young women the firm sri lanka s only fair trade guaranteed handloom company is seeing reduced absenteeism higher staff retention and productivity and lower turnover costs the tackling childcare report has found that there is no one size fits all approach to employer provided childcare the companies featured are from a myriad of industries and diversified holding companies in the case of fairway and hemas located at various locations the nature of the industries and their locations create different childcare needs for parents therefore some of the firms provide emergency backup care some daycare in remote locations and others high quality on site programmes research has found that involving parents in creating the childcare programme was crucial for success the 10 leading employers featured in ifc and unicef s report do not discriminate between men and women providing equal opportunity and ensuring that all employees can benefit from access to childcare support this is true for standard chartered bank in sri lanka as well athula harishchandra a senior manager in operational risk at the bank has been benefiting from employer provided childcare for nearly eight years initially harishchandra tried keeping his son harindu with his parents in galle but this meant seeing his son only during weekends he was relieved when he learnt that he could enrol his son at the standard chartered supported crèche he is impressed with the level of care given to each child including freshly prepared food safety and education breaking the cultural barrier was tough as my parents and in laws were not keen on us enroling my son in a crèche harishchandra says nagaraja at mas kreeda experienced the polar opposite with her friends and family envious of the childcare benefits she receives they had never witnessed such facilities being offered in kilinochchi before harishchandra s family has come around since and even his friends who do not work at standard chartered are inquiring whether their kids can be enrolled at the crèche for the bank the facility has been a boon creating high engagement among employees which has increased focus and productivity according to standard chartered s head of human resources ransi dharmasiriwardhana parents don t have to worry about their child s homework safety and having to manage issues around getting reliable domestic aid as a result they are able to concentrate on work better this has given us access to a mature likeminded talent pool who wish to excel in both their roles as a responsible parent and a high performing employee she says for mas standard chartered and selyn providing childcare translates to further positioning themselves as an employer of choice and better engagement with their clients who value suppliers that take care of their employees the companies have been fortunate to partner with childcare service providers who employ top notch professionals the ifc unicef report suggests that investors could find opportunities to enter the supply side of childcare support investments could be made in childcare providers and entrepreneurs which would help expand the industry and give employers a choice of childcare providers at competitive rates even reputed international childcare providers may find opportunities in sri lanka in addition to funding childcare subsidies the government could also get involved to a greater degree setting up and monitoring standards for training childcare professionals with sri lanka s population ageing rapidly the current labour force would have to work twice as much in the coming decades to keep the economy growing according to unicef sri lanka representative tim sutton therefore engaging a talent pool that is on average more educated than men and currently limited to the household would be essential according to the international monetary fund sri lanka could enjoy up to a 20 increase in gross domestic product if the gender gap is sealed for nagaraja rathnayake and harishchandra these macroeconomic implications are likely in the farthest reaches of their minds one thing they all have in common despite their widely divergent social backgrounds is their relief and satisfaction that their children are getting the best possible care early education and community interaction to grow up to become citizens that would bring good to the world

january this fed hope that german numbers would rebound the median forecast was for a 0 5 gain instead german industrial output fell 0 8 the saving grace was that the december series was revised to 0 8 from 0 4 ironically this produced the expected year over year decline in january of 3 3 though the december pace was revised to 2 7 from 3 6 separately germany report exports were flat in january

is on retail sales although auto and gasoline sales were likely a drag a rebound is expected in the components used for gdp calculations many economists expect that the us economy may have nearly stagnated or worse at the start of the year government shutdown and the bitter cold but the government re opening and more normal weather is likely to see the animal spirits return manufacturing

societies are to a large extent defined by their dominant property relations who owns and controls key resources from land to finance gets to exercise power and agency in both the present and the future ownership of the means of production therefore underpins all other societal values and interactions including our relationships to each other to work to the rest of the world and to nature under global capitalism private forms of ownership are both predominant and driven by the profit motive such that the accumulation of capital on behalf of private individuals works against any semblance of the common good moreover within this system of private ownership a particular form has come to dominate in recent decades the large international corporation with shares traded on stock markets or closely held by a small group of individuals and specifically large corporations that are financial in nature this particular form of ownership is riddled with problematic and destructive behaviour that is at the root of some of our most pressing economic social and ecological challenges this includes prioritising short term profits over longer term investments a relentless drive to reduce labour costs through offshoring internal relocation and hostility to unions efforts to externalise social and environmental costs as much as possible the enshrinement of shareholder value and returns above all other considerations accelerating inequality through both exorbitant salaries for executives and the funnelling of profits to a small group of elite shareholders the decimation of local economies and small businesses the use of off shore tax havens and other tax avoidance mechanisms and the establishment of an incentive structure that promotes financial speculation over productive investment large corporations are even beginning to threaten traditional measures of economic performance for instance recent studies have linked increased market concentration to slowing economic growth reductions in business investment and price rises accompanied by stagnant productivity this form of ownership represents one of the three pillars of the neoliberal version of capitalism that has until recently seemed so dominant and unassailable around the world the others being deregulated unregulated markets and increasingly exploitative precarious employment relations however it is becoming increasingly apparent that this system is failing that we are reaching the point at which the unsustainable social and ecological impacts of neoliberalism push the system up against its limits and a backlash sets in the ubiquity and dominance of the corporate for profit form of ownership in the first decades of the twenty first century makes it difficult for many people to even conceive of an alternative and more socially equitable ways of running the economy yet neoliberalism generally and the corporate form of ownership specifically are relatively new phenomena for most of human existence ownership of the economy was organised along very different although often no less problematic lines in the twentieth century the primary alternative was the traditional top down often large centralised and bureaucratic state owned enterprise this form with variants and embedded in different macro economic structures and relationships has been utilised by everyone from social democrats in western europe to state capitalists in east asia to communists in the soviet bloc get our free daily email get one whole story direct to your inbox every weekday sign up now it has also been used for a wide range of reasons from a purely economic perspective one of the most enduring and important reasons societies have repeatedly turned to public ownership over the years is market failure broadly defined as the inability of markets within a market based economic system to allocate goods or services effectively or at all or to provide collective provision for essential services and social needs from a societal perspective improving distributional outcomes and lessening inequality has been a predominant goal other purposes for state ownership suggested over the years include industrialisation planning regional development technology transfer national security employment maximisation addressing natural monopoly innovation environmental sustainability and accountability contrary to the dominant narrative that emerged during the rise of neoliberalism and the collapse of state communism in the latter quarter of the twentieth century state ownership was often as successful and as efficient as private enterprise decades of studies have yielded no consensus about the relative merits of private over public ownership while there are many cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of the latter for economic development countries as diverse as austria norway south korea and singapore have experienced tremendous economic success with high levels of public ownership furthermore recent studies of the british experience with public ownership offer a much more nuanced picture than the accepted view espoused by margaret thatcher and her successors productivity growth in nationalised british mining utility transportation and communication sectors for instance consistently outpaced similar privately owned industries in the united states yet this model is not without its limitations in the uk for instance the post world war two labour government of clement atlee embraced the so called morrisonian form of top down centralised and bureaucratic public organisation run by an autonomous arms length appointed board this form proved overly managerial with little participation by the public itself whether workers users or the broader citizenry it also proved difficult to defend and easy to privatize when political winds changed and thatcher rose to power in the 1980s elsewhere many state owned enterprises especially those in the extractive sector had poor ecological records and in some places were agents of cronyism and corruption a new vision one result of the epic ideological political and military struggle between capitalism and communism throughout the twentieth century has been to reduce much popular understanding of ownership in the economy to simple binary choices a completely privatised market economy on the one hand or full state ownership on the other this conceptualisation however can obscure as much as it reveals economies especially in the modern era are and will be into the foreseeable future far more complex with a diversity of actually existing ownership forms the challenge for those seeking a more just equitable and sustainable political economic system however is how to articulate an alternative vision of ownership for the common good one that displaces and supersedes the current dominant extractive corporate model the change involves two aspects 1 transitioning ownership from the hands of the few to the many 2 transforming the internal structure of enterprises to enhance genuine democratic participation and control this new vision of ownership has many names public ownership in its widest sense economic democracy collective ownership generative ownership etc however the term democratic ownership is perhaps the most appropriate to indicate the need for a mix of models where ownership is broadly held and or is controlled by democratic means the best models include both forms of democratisation ownership and participation because they combine positive distributional outcomes such as decreased inequality with the individual and societal benefits associated with increased agency and empowerment discussed further below democratic enterprises even though democratic ownership as a whole seeks to supplant the extractive and exploitative corporate model it does not suggest that just one alternative will take its place the importance of tolerance pluralism historical and geographical contingency culture and the environment suggests that there cannot be a one size fits all approach similarly while democratic theory and experience suggests that dispersing rather than centralising ownership and decision making is optimal modern economies are global in scale and increasingly complex thus necessitating certain economic activities that need larger scale and central coordination therefore the principle of subsidiarity generally that decision making should be devolved to the lowest level possible should guide democratic ownership in other words we should aspire towards examples of democratic ownership that are technically necessary at higher levels while devolving control of other activities as far as possible to the local level moreover while a more democratic and egalitarian economy should be largely comprised of democratically owned enterprises some limited forms of small scale individual private ownership should likely continue to exist to promote creativity entrepreneurialism and dynamism the extent to which this is the case will vary from sector to sector and economy to economy small retail and farms for instance additionally there should always be latitude for communities to experiment with different ownership forms and combinations in line with both local needs and desires as well as larger imperatives such as the effects of climate change and global trade therefore what follows is merely an illustrative sketch of what the mix of democratic enterprises might be full state ownership this form most closely approximates the traditional large state owned enterprise although as will be discussed further below in conjunction with all of these models it should be subject to new efforts at internal democratisation fully state owned companies will likely be larger and more centralised than other forms allowing the public to influence key sectors and undertake longer term strategic planning to secure important goals such as dealing with climate change building and maintaining modern electricity or transport systems etc this form most closely approximates the traditional large state owned enterprise although as will be discussed further below in conjunction with all of these models it should be subject to new efforts at internal democratisation fully state owned companies will likely be larger and more centralised than other forms allowing the public to influence key sectors and undertake longer term strategic planning to secure important goals such as dealing with climate change building and maintaining modern electricity or transport systems etc partial state ownership this form resembles many modern state owned companies in which the state sometimes through quasi independent investment vehicles owns shares alongside private investors for the purposes of this sketch partial state ownership refers to a structure in which the state owns at least a controlling interest in other words enough shares that it can prevail in any shareholder vote but not necessarily a majority if organised along similar lines as in contemporary economies where such enterprises are given complete autonomy and charged primarily with commercial purposes partially state owned enterprises could provide some public influence on different parts of the economy but would primarily serve to return profits and dividends to the public the extent to which partial state ownership can be democratic will depend in large part on how the state s ownership share is structured and operationalised this form resembles many modern state owned companies in which the state sometimes through quasi independent investment vehicles owns shares alongside private investors for the purposes of this sketch partial state ownership refers to a structure in which the state owns at least a controlling interest in other words enough shares that it can prevail in any shareholder vote but not necessarily a majority if organised along

influence on different parts of the economy but would primarily serve to return profits and dividends to the public the extent to which partial state ownership can be democratic will depend in large part on how the state s ownership share is structured and operationalised local municipal ownership this form is similar to the types of publicly owned enterprises that are numerically dominant in many countries with more decentralised political systems such as the united states and germany enterprises that are owned by governments or public bodies at the local or regional level are more closely connected to local democratic structures individuals and community based groups and are therefore potentially more accessible participatory and democratically accountable local and municipal ownership provides better opportunities for the economic benefits of public ownership to be felt locally often contributing to a multiplier effect that strengthens local economies and supports vital social services and environmental initiatives this form is similar to the types of publicly owned enterprises that are numerically dominant in many countries with more decentralised political systems such as the united states and germany enterprises that are owned by governments or public bodies at the local or regional level are more closely connected to local democratic structures individuals and community based groups and are therefore potentially more accessible participatory and democratically accountable local and municipal ownership provides better opportunities for the economic benefits of public ownership to be felt locally often contributing to a multiplier effect that strengthens local economies and supports vital social services and environmental initiatives multi stakeholder ownership while all forms of democratic ownership can and should have multi stakeholder internal management processes discussed further below multi stakeholder ownership refers to a form in which various groups and organisations own shares of an enterprise this can include government workers through a trade union or a trust public and worker pension funds resident associations environmental and other non profits etc multi stakeholder ownership ensures both broader representation in ownership decisions and the distribution of profits one example is aguas argentinas sa in the buenos aires region which was founded following a failed water privatisation and whose shares are divided between the local government and the water and sanitation worker s trade union worker ownership broadly workers can own their workplaces in one of two ways 1 either directly on the basis of one worker one vote as in a traditional worker cooperative or 2 through some representative structure such as the retirement trusts known as employee stock ownership plans esops generally individual worker cooperatives are smaller although they can network together into bigger groupings as is the case with the large scale mondragón cooperative corporation in the basque region of spain but tend to be more democratic and participatory while representative structures such as trusts allow worker ownership to thrive at a larger scale and in bigger individual enterprises this is offset by the likelihood of more passive and less participatory organisations the john lewis partnership in the uk would be an example of the latter commercially successful but criticised recently for losing some of its alternative ethos and values consumer cooperative ownership enterprises that are owned by consumer members are one of the most common forms of democratic ownership in contemporary modern economies these include credit unions grocery and retail stores housing schools etc these operate on a one member one vote basis and are usually smaller and geographically anchored however larger scale enterprises can and do exist especially in the retail sector enterprises that are owned by consumer members are one of the most common forms of democratic ownership in contemporary modern economies these include credit unions grocery and retail stores housing schools etc these operate on a one member one vote basis and are usually smaller and geographically anchored however larger scale enterprises can and do exist especially in the retail sector producer cooperative ownership producer cooperatives are organisations that are owned by other enterprises and organisations including but not limited to other cooperatives they exist to support their members with marketing purchasing and other functions so that they can operate at scale while retaining their individual local ownership structures and in the case of cooperatives democratic and participatory governance mechanisms in many countries the farming sector is dominated by such cooperatives that help to protect members from destructive competition while also generating greater market power in their supply relations with retailers producer cooperatives are organisations that are owned by other enterprises and organisations including but not limited to other cooperatives they exist to support their members with marketing purchasing and other functions so that they can operate at scale while retaining their individual local ownership structures and in the case of cooperatives democratic and participatory governance mechanisms in many countries the farming sector is dominated by such cooperatives that help to protect members from destructive competition while also generating greater market power in their supply relations with retailers community ownership another way in which communities can participate in enterprise ownership is through a local non profit organisation community based non profits can and should include direct community representation on their governing boards the broader and more reflective this representation is of community dynamics the more democratic and accountable it is moreover these non profits can also operate for profit subsidiaries called social enterprises that both return revenues to the non profit to support its social betterment mission and employ local residents another way in which communities can participate in enterprise ownership is through a local non profit organisation community based non profits can and should include direct community representation on their governing boards the broader and more reflective this representation is of community dynamics the more democratic and accountable it is moreover these non profits can also operate for profit subsidiaries called social enterprises that both return revenues to the non profit to support its social betterment mission and employ local residents sustainable local private ownership while not necessarily democratic in their ownership structure although some have degrees of worker ownership sustainable locally owned businesses prioritise community the environment and workers alongside profits sometimes called a triple bottom line they are usually small businesses operating in a variety of fields but especially food retail and design if some degree of private for profit ownership is retained in a democratic economy as we believe it must then as much as possible it should take the form of sustainable locally owned enterprises that take a triple bottom line approach between these different categories there are numerous hybrid forms of democratic ownership that could be developed to meet specific needs in particular situations for instance there are emerging experiments around the world with so called public public partnerships whereby governments at varying levels consumers trade unions and or other stakeholders come together to form and reform enterprises and networks in the united states for instance this occurs in the water and electrical sectors with regards to municipal utilities joining in networks with other municipal utilities and national entities to achieve the benefits of scale while retaining a decentralised system with local control similarly varying jurisdictions often come together around the ownership and control of transit systems and infrastructure each form of democratic enterprise has its advantages and disadvantages and the right form or mix of forms will depend on a variety of factors the most important of which is the objective as the economist e f schumacher wrote public ownership gives complete freedom in the choice of objectives and can therefore be used for any purpose that may be chosen while private ownership is an instrument that by itself largely determines the ends for which it can be employed public ownership is an instrument the ends of which are undetermined and need to be consciously chosen the statement holds for most if not all forms of democratic ownership even those cooperatives that are for profit businesses have the freedom to democratically determine how those profits are used they can be reinvested in the business distributed to workers members as dividends donated to charity etc broadly in addition to the general goal of economic viability note that this is a very different objective than traditional conceptions of efficiency focused purely on financial measures that fail to properly account for additional economic social and environmental values and outcomes some broad objectives for democratic ownership are as follows securing public control of the economy s strategic sectors commanding heights to secure the objectives of being able to establish democratic control over key sectors and undertake longer term strategic planning around issues of large scale national or international importance traditional public ownership strategies such as full

and because many are vertically integrated these enterprises can bring significant resources and affect large scale change when oriented in a more ecologically conscious direction while many worker consumer producer and locally owned enterprises are ecologically sustainable and can play a role they tend to be smaller and thus their impact is less moreover to an extent they all face market

strategy and regulatory framework for addressing climate change developing greater participation in decision making and strengthening democracy to the extent that they are organised along the principle of one person one vote worker owned firms and consumer cooperatives score highest in terms of internal democratic participation and engagement moreover there is substantial research on the societal and economic benefits of increasing participation and democracy discussed further below when it comes to the public ownership forms evidence suggests that the closer those enterprises are to community members i e local municipal ownership the greater the possibilities for participation in internal decision making as the scale of such enterprises increases so too does the difficulty of maintaining and encouraging genuine participation and democracy democratising ownership as previously mentioned the second and critical aspect of democratic ownership is internal democratisation all of the forms of democratic ownership previously described are based on real world examples and in contemporary practice have varying degrees of democratic participation and control confronted with the rise of a particularly vile form of right wing populism in recent years many defenders of the established order often professing to be liberals or centrists have rejected economic democracy when it does not deliver their preferred market based outcomes in favour of rule by an international technocratic elite like the american pragmatist philosopher john dewey 100 years ago we reject this approach the flames of right wing extremism masquerading as populism simply cannot be defeated in this way and are only more likely to be fanned by the increased sense of alienation and loss of control instead the answer must include a process of genuine democratic engagement and participation especially in the economic sphere what we need in short is more democracy not less there are at least four fundamental and interconnected reasons why broader and more robust forms of internal participation and democratic governance are desirable democratisation can have wider social and economic effects and benefits the theory that deeper and more direct forms of democratic practice have distinct social advantages has been widely studied especially since the 1960s and 70s these include the individual psychological benefits of empowerment and self development social benefits such increased community cohesiveness and dialogue increased civic participation and engagement reduced inequality and greater productivity the theory that deeper and more direct forms of democratic practice have distinct social advantages has been widely studied especially since the 1960s and 70s these include

inequality and greater productivity democratisation can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the enterprise active and broad based participation of workers community members and other stakeholders can deliver better outcomes by tapping into the practical knowledge of those groups regarding operating conditions on the ground in the us the uk and elsewhere there are examples where enterprises have achieved significant cost savings and avoided layoffs by partnering with their workers and other stakeholders to improve effectiveness and stimulate innovation active and broad based

the us the uk and elsewhere there are examples where enterprises have achieved significant cost savings and avoided layoffs by partnering with their workers and other stakeholders to improve effectiveness and stimulate innovation democratisation of work is a fundamental component and pre requisite of genuine political democracy often referred to as economic democracy there is an understanding among some political theorists especially the prominent us political theorist robert dahl that political democracy cannot truly flourish in a society in which wealth power and decision making is concentrated in a small elite group of private owners who appropriate the labour of the mass of the population for their own ends what starts off as an individual right to ownership of one s labour leads to a fundamental democratic need to have voice in the decision making process in the economy as a whole in 1937 for instance john dewey wrote that unless democratic habits of thought and action are part of the fiber of a people political democracy is insecure it cannot stand in isolation it must be buttressed by the presence of democratic methods in all social relationships often referred to as economic democracy there is an understanding among some political theorists especially the prominent us political theorist robert dahl that political democracy cannot truly flourish in

that unless democratic habits of thought and action are part of the fiber of a people political democracy is insecure it cannot stand in isolation it must be buttressed by the presence of democratic methods in all social relationships democratisation empowers and builds the capacity of groups and individuals that have traditionally been excluded this includes but is not limited to workers in particular enterprises in the uk the us and other advanced economies the employed make up less than half of the total population while workers may have some minimal participatory rights through trade unions or employee ownership schemes retirees students the disabled and the unemployed are all excluded from direct participation moreover racial minorities and women are often under represented in workplace especially at managerial and decision making levels and of course the natural world from which so much is extracted and to which so much harm is done has no representation at all what internal democratisation could look like will vary based on the type of ownership form and likely from enterprise to enterprise given that they are responsible to the community as a whole traditional publicly owned enterprises full state ownership partial state ownership and local municipal ownership should embrace a multi stakeholder structure whereby workers users and or residents and other groups including ngos and other levels of government come together to set the goals and objectives of the enterprise and to hire or fire management alongside robust worker participation in the form of work councils and trade unions multi stakeholder ownership should incorporate more groups in the management and decision making structure particularly groups representing the environment and historically marginalised populations worker owned enterprises should find ways to incorporate the wider community especially consumers of their products or services into their decision making structure beyond this they should embrace methods and structures that incentivise and promote the active participation of workers in decision making and avoid as much as possible relying on non cooperative labour conversely consumer cooperatives should find ways to incorporate workers into their governance structure through co determinationist models or trade unions or both producer cooperatives should on the one hand encourage their member organisations to adopt more participatory internal governance structures and on the other hand include consumers and other groups into their associations community ownership should ensure that the community served is accurately and equitably represented in governance structures especially with regards to race class and geography when such non profits own and operate social enterprises these should include robust worker participation mechanisms and incentives sustainable locally owned businesses should like many have in the united states consider converting to worker ownership through an esop this gives workers ownership rights with limited decision making powers however even if some degree of worker ownership is established more robust forms of worker and community participation can and should also be implemented in every enterprise robust and comprehensive management and participation training programs should be established in order to prepare workers community representatives and other stakeholders for active engagement moreover in the traditional publicly owned enterprises as well as community ownership democratisation should include increased transparency and accountability this goes beyond the simple call for better oversight and reporting standards and rejects efforts to corporatise public enterprises and run them purely on commercial lines it involves the use of not only public meetings and records requirements but also new online and digital tools to ensure the widest access and accessibility including ways to make complex documents and processes understandable to the average resident from here to there strategy and implementation as previously mentioned all of the different forms of democratic ownership articulated in this model exist in the contemporary economic system in one form or another the key question is how collectively they displace over time the extractive corporate model based on historical and contemporary experience we know some of the possible ways of scaling up through state action while not discounting the imperative to also organise from the bottom up in support of expanding such institutions which is briefly discussed below a national or powerful regional government has broad powers available to it to both compel and incentivise changes in ownership through traditional top down nationalisations the central government using its supreme legal authority can bring key sectors into full state ownership as happens regularly around the world including in the us and the uk during the financial crisis ten years ago through various investment vehicles agencies or funds the central government can also purchase ownership shares in enterprises thus converting them to partial state ownership local municipal ownership can be expanded through re municipalisation campaigns often involving coalitions of community groups workers and their unions and local civic leaders that reverse the tide of privatisation and break new ground for public ownership at the local level multi stakeholder ownership can be scaled up through a variety of ways for instance governments could give ownership stakes in publicly owned enterprises to workers and other stakeholders on the one hand and take ownership stakes in cooperatives and other enterprises in return for investment on the other government could also pass legislation that provides preferential tax treatment and other incentives to enterprises that have multi stakeholder ownership structures similarly worker ownership can be enabled through supportive legislation at various levels of government this can include a right to buy for workers when an owner is contemplating selling the enterprise tax incentives to sell to a workers retirement trust public funding in the form of grants and loans for setting up or expanding worker cooperatives investment in technical and training capacity such as state funded worker ownership centres or allocating public procurement contracts to worker owned companies for community ownership consumer cooperative ownership and sustainable local private ownership many of the above public supports also apply especially tax status public contracts and technical assistance however here one of the primary needs is financing governments can create revolving loan funds banks and other investment vehicles to lend to such entities perhaps though a private non profit intermediary and perhaps with preferential rates within all of these ownership forms there are also examples of pathways towards internal democratisation some of these include multi stakeholder processes in north america and elsewhere the multi level democratic processes of the mondragón cooperatives experiments at worker self management in yugoslavia and elsewhere during the twentieth century democratic processes in reclaimed factories in argentina greece and other countries that have experienced neoliberal driven economic crises and the participatory budgeting movement that has spread from brazil to the rest of the world there are of course a variety of challenges to activating these pathways many require enabling legislation at various levels of government in many countries this is a daunting prospect given the political and economic power of large corporations and their entrenched beneficiaries there is also the challenge of the constraints placed upon such activities by the international institutions and agreements of the neoliberal era the world trade organization and the european union for instance in order to actively pursue some of these policies especially around procurement state aid and public ownership in any substantial way other than at the margins governments will have to find ways to either renegotiate their involvement in or extract themselves from such institutions on the other hand given the guiding principle of subsidiarity that underpins the democratic ownership model there will need to be greater processes of political decentralisation in the more centralised and unitary states such as the uk in order to operationalise some of these pathways especially with regards to local municipal ownership and public contracts to local and cooperative enterprises next steps fortunately because the forms of democratic ownership articulated here as well as the means of scaling up are based on real world precedents there is much that can be accomplished now to lay the groundwork for what could and should be done if and when a national government committed to these ideas comes to power these can roughly be divided into three overlapping themes organising in order to take on deeply entrenched vested interests and ultimately displace some of the most powerful economic actors in human history large international corporations popular mobilisation will be crucial organising for democratic ownership at various levels and across multiple sectors is already occurring for instance with re municipalisation campaigns and worker cooperatives but much more can be done to build strong and sustainable coalitions of workers residents consumers trade unionists policy makers environmentalists and others in order to take on deeply entrenched vested interests and ultimately displace some of the most powerful economic actors in human history large international corporations popular mobilisation will be crucial organising for democratic ownership at various levels and across multiple sectors is already occurring for instance with re municipalisation campaigns and worker cooperatives but much more can be done to build strong and sustainable coalitions of workers residents consumers trade unionists policy makers environmentalists and others theoretical development what forms of democratic ownership are most appropriate for particular sectors and industries in a modern economy is at best understudied so too is how best to democratise enterprises internally much still needs to be learned including with regards to trade offs that will need to be made pitfalls that will need to be avoided and challenges that will need to be overcome in order to provide an incoming government with the tools it needs to effectively move in the direction of democratic ownership this includes the detailed legal analysis and policy development that will enable a government to quickly implement wide ranging reform experimentation both the theoretical development and organising work should not occur in a vacuum they should be consciously linked to each other and to an ongoing process of real on the ground experimentation ultimately such experimentation not only provides critical information into what works what doesn t work and what can be improved but it also materially impacts and benefits the lives of people living in the current system and builds a constituency of support for further development the model presented here envisages a mixed economy populated primarily by a diversity of forms of democratic ownership it is in opposition to the increasingly corporatised and financialised system of private elite ownership and control that currently exists a key principle is that of decentring the economy by encouraging a diffusion of economic decision making both across the economy through a variety of different democratic forms of ownership ranging from national and local public ownership to cooperative and worker ownership to multi stakeholder and hybrid forms and within enterprises at all levels there is no one model of democratic ownership applicable in all contexts but distinctive forms will be appropriate in different economic sectors at the model s core is the belief that the concept of ownership and control in the economy needs to be radically rethought to be relevant to the rapidly changing world around us the gap between positive theoretical visions of future alterative institutional arrangements and our terrifying contemporary reality of rising right wing populism on the one hand and impending climate catastrophe on the other must now be closed and quickly now more than ever it is critical that we develop viable and practical expansion and transition strategies for a plausible vision of a more democratic economy capable of attracting real

this article is more than 5 years old over the last several months modern monetary theory mmt has become the progressive left s latest policy darling notwithstanding withering criticism from the center larry summers and the right from figures too numerous to count the basic idea of mmt is that the government should finance big bold spending plans by supplying itself with currency of which it is the monopoly producer if inflation gets out of hand as a consequence the solution is to raise tax rates to mop up the excess dollars that are causing the inflation associated press per mmt economic growth comes through major government spending as much of it as possible directed toward forward thinking projects such as those addressing climate change and inequality the classic side effect of freewheeling money creation price inflation has no purchase since it gets canceled on the implementation of the standby tax increase authority a gordian knot is cut the government arranges for an inflation free boom of an enlightened variety by greatly expanding its reach in both monetary and fiscal policy nathan lewis has asked the question of why the term modern given that there are plenty of examples since ancient times of authorities practicing and rationalizing policies along these lines this is a pointer to a further issue that has not been made clear in the recent discussions this is that mmt has existed per se for quite some time about seventy five years since the 1940s necessarily over that span it was subject to the heat of debate across economics it did poorly in the court of peer review and policy judgment and therefore went moribund a major reason mmt is arising now again is that its experience of acute argumentative and practical failure which dates from some forty to sixty years ago has been forgotten in the 1950s the two primer inter pares of keynesian economics paul samuelson and james tobin outlined what they chose to call the neo classical synthesis which recommended among the four possibilities of the loose tight fiscal monetary policy matrix loose money and high tax rates as tobin and a colleague reflected in the 1980s we saw the desirability of policy mixes that emphasized private and public investment in the future relative to current consumption these mixes would usually entail low interest rates and tight government budgets those budgets were to be tight by virtue of their tax receipts in that the spending side had to be large in order to accommodate public investment in the future such was mmt in bloom intellectually in the 1950s in 1960 tobin spelled it out beyond any question in a new republic column called growth through taxation tobin wrote with admirable if appalling candor in the following extended passage here are some major constituents of a program for growth increased expenditure by federal state and local governments for education basic and applied research urban redevelopment resource conservation and development federal reserve and treasury policy to create and maintain easy money if these measures were adopted a reduction in the basic corporate income tax rate advocated by many as essential to growth would be neither necessary or equitable indeed the strength of these measures might be greater if the rate were increased increase in personal income tax at all levels accompanied by increase in state and local taxes property or sales or income as the case may be to keep pace with the share of these governments in the necessary expansion of the public sector increased taxation is the price of growth it is only superficially paradoxical to combine anti inflationary fiscal policy with an expansionary monetary policy the challenge of the 60s is to bring under public decision the broad allocation of national output our communist competitors have an advantage since they do not pay out such increases in output as personal incomes in the first place they do not have the problem of recapturing them in taxes or saving that problem we cannot escape in a free society unless we master it we shall not fare well in the competition for economic growth and national survival here was mmt at its high intellectual tide in 1960 what happened next is that it got its neck stepped on president john f kennedy brought tobin on as a staff economist in 1961 as he kept samuelson and other neo classical synthesis mmt allies close jfk basically followed their prescription sans tax increase for about a year as he made sure interest rates stayed very low and there was a flurry of new spending when the stock market lost more than 25 in 1961 62 and forecasts of an imminent recession materialized he reversed course on mmt he arranged for the treasury and the fed to support the dollar against its international gold price and in his most striking legislative accomplishment as president he introduced the greatest post world war ii tax rate cut bringing it to the brink of passage won several months after the assassination the long term growth rate doubled as kennedy made his policy switch inflation remained quiet until the spending tax surcharge and labor force starvation i e vietnam war of the johnson administration the full drama of the kennedy moves may be luxuriated over in my and larry kudlow s book of 2016 jfk and the reagan revolution in the offing in the 60s the economics journals were visited by an evisceration of the samuelson tobin consensus in the form of canadian wunderkind robert a mundell whose series of articles on the appropriate use of monetary and fiscal policy for internal and external stability to cite the title of a representative entry proved through prose and especially graphs of extraordinary force that maintaining market control over the dollar in concert with fiscal ease such as provided by tax cuts was the precisely correct remedy to the current disequilibrium situation mundell s articles as the american economic review reflected on it decades later defined what became the workhorse international economic policy model for years to come that model the mundell fleming model referring as well to marcus fleming mundell s supervisor at the international monetary fund imf at the time made clear that if a nation really pushes its claim on monetary sovereignty there is a collapse in international demand for that currency a collapse exacerbated by an increase in rates of domestic taxation which itself discourages such demand given the law of one price in integrated global economies if a currency is shunned internationally that country s inhabitants become impoverished in 2001 mundell whose nobel prize two years before had commemorated this research recalled the episode in a valedictory at the imf with these words his original article provided a new way of thinking about macroeconomic policy at first it wasn t popular this was to be expected because it recommended a complete reversal in the prevailing policy mix the samuelson tobin neoclassical syntheses might have had some merits in a closed economy but it was completely indefensible in an open economy on fixed exchange rates in the meantime the nation had gotten to see how much of a panacea not being on gold or fixed rates could be for the neo classical synthesis mmt after the united states abrogated gold and fixed rates 1971 73 there was such a flight from the dollar into substitutes that through 1980 everything from metals to art to baseball cards skyrocketed in value as the nation inexplicably experimented with currency discretion and effectively surging tax rates the first humiliation care of mundell had been intellectual the second was practical its manifestation stagflation a record of unrelenting spectacular failure makes up the profile of mmt as a phenomenon in both the recent history of economics and economic history not part of this profile is due consideration of the criticisms backing away from being headstrong or resolution to reassess and improve or abandon ship what mmt has on its side today is that when decades pass memories fade
georgia and her husband seb live in a french village along with their darling baby daughter all is wonderful except that they re not quite sure what to do next case studies are financial and life dilemmas that a reader of frugalwoods sends to me requesting that frugalwoods nation weigh in then frugalwoods nation that s you reads through their situation and provides advice encouragement insight and feedback in the comments section for an example check out last month s case study i provide updates from our case study subjects at the bottom of each case study several months after a case is featured you all requested an easier way to track case study updates and i have heard your pleas here s list of all the case studies that currently have an update provided at the end of the post and a hint that if you re a past case study participant who hasn t sent me your update yet send it on over your fans want to hear from you i probably don t need to say the following because you all are the kindest most polite commenters on the internet but please note that frugalwoods is a judgement free zone where we endeavor to help one another not to condemn and a disclaimer that i am not a trained financial professional and i encourage people not to make serious financial decisions based solely on what one person on the internet advises i encourage everyone to do their own research to determine the best course of action for their finances with that i ll let georgia this month s case study subject take it from here georgia s story i m georgia i m 33 my husband seb is 31 and i m a longtime reader and big fan of the frugalwoods i ve been following frugalwoods since before they made the big move and have really enjoyed all of the reader case studies recently i ve been flip flopping on some decisions of my own after reading a case study one afternoon i decided to write one up myself as though i were doing it for the blog it was so helpful i mean the detailed budget alone helped me and my husband see our finances so much more clearly it took me the better part of a week but i m so glad i did it writing it all up helped clarify some stuff but i d still love input from mrs frugalwoods and frugalwoods nation we begin in paris france my husband seb and i met in the summer of 2010 when i was apartment hunting in paris he is from cannes france and i m from florida usa i had just been accepted to le cordon bleu a culinary school in paris there was a huge heat wave and it was all rather exciting i was 23 and a hot mess seb had just met his future girlfriend of several years and we wound up hanging out a lot together in a bar in the 13th arrondissement called la belette qui tete something about a ferret where we drank cheap flavoured beer and talked about camus and our romantic entanglements mostly our romantic entanglements seb and i became good friends and when he later moved to the us to be with his american girlfriend and i moved to australia to be with this random australian man i d met we kept in touch and wrote each other emails as well as actual letters on real paper in which we talked about camus and our romantic entanglements fast forward to 2013 and i m making artisanal ice cream in oakland california and seb is living in versailles france while not working on his phd i emailed him out of the blue because life is less than thrilling when you re making ice cream all day long tasty but underwhelming and i m all hey i need to come back to europe do you have any ideas and he s all yeah come back and sleep on my couch and we ll find somebody to marry you seb and georgia tie the knot approximately four months later seb and i got married his mother literally had to lie down when we told her poor thing and kept insisting that it was all a joke awkward at the time seb was about 9 000 in debt for student loans mostly due to a semester abroad in the us when i tried to be added to his bank account i discovered that i d been blacklisted from all french banks because of an overdraft when i d left france the first time swearing never to return i d forgotten to close my automatically debited movie pass which after three years of negligence and overdraft fees came to 2 000 this is an apt illustration of my previous handle on all things financial by the time we celebrated our first wedding anniversary we d paid off all of our debt seb was finishing up his phd and we d stashed away a few thousand euros in our savings account we re both naturally frugal because we both know what it s like to be stone cold broke after living in the paris area for awhile we decided we d like to move to the countryside because when we visited his dad who lives in said countryside i fell in love with his little town before we d even gotten off the train it was a risky decision and everyone told us how difficult it is to get jobs in the middle of nowhere but i ve always figured there s work for people who are willing to work we moved we both got jobs and everything worked out splendidly living in a french village now that we re installed in our postcard perfect french village in normandy and have been happily puttering along for a few years i am of course brainstorming ways to move someplace else or more precisely ways to be able to live in multiple places at once that do not involve tricks in the space time continuum in short i want to have more control over my time and have the ability to see my us based family more often this deep emotional desire has been heightened by the birth of our most delightful baby alias little pie who just turned five months old we re not planning on having any more children so she is our one and only and is very loved multinational relationships are great but they do involve a lot of tugs at the old heartstrings i want my parents to be able to hang out with their only grandkid and vice versa and i want seb s dad to be able to hang out with his only grandkid basically i want to have my cake and eat it seb and georgia s house we bought our home in 2018 for 147 300 130 000 we paid all of the notary fees in cash about 10 200 9 000 we didn t pay any agency fees as we knew the owner we did pay a courturier fee not sure what this is in english of about 1 700 1 500 the courturier negotiated our bank loan since in france it is very difficult impossible to get a loan for a good rate if you do not have a permanent contract with your work which neither my husband nor i have our total loan from the bank was 151 845 134 027 at a 1 6 interest rate we paid 11 330 10 000 as a downpayment we still owe 144 814 127 821 on the house we ve done about 11 330 10 000 in construction on the house with a friend who charged us a very friendly rate which we paid in cash this was all cosmetic work as the house had no fundamental issues when we bought it we ve also done work ourselves and spent about 2 250 2 000 to install a deck and a pergola paint the interior put up drywall etc i m not sure how much the house is currently valued at but the previous owner s agency provided a quote of 150k 180k 130k 160k which obviously we have to take with a grain of salt however i love obsessively watching the real estate market and am pretty up to date on local housing activity given that i would price the house at around 160k 170k 140k 150k in the current market based on comparable properties although our house is a little exceptional and therefore difficult to price our home is newer in that it was not built in the 1600 s and is located downtown surrounded by older scenic properties we have a large yard three bedrooms and there s no work necessary this type of property is really hard to find in our town which dates to 1100 ad we ve done lots of improvements more or less transformed and updated the interior and exterior and this should add to the value of the house further improvements will probably not add to the value since comparable built circa 1960 s properties don t currently sell for much more than 180k 160k no matter how much bigger or nicer they are in light of that we re not planning on spending any more money on home improvements if we were to move i think we d lean towards renting out this home i estimate we could probably rent it out for about 700 800 per month this is the rental price of comparable properties 3 bedroom non attached houses in town with a garden and new appliances if we were to move our plan is to slightly lower our monthly mortgage payments they re currently 700 to 600 and try to rent out the house for 800 saving the extra 200 for the property s eventual needed repairs emergencies seb s jobs however there is quite a spanner in the works better known as our jobs seb and i are both pretty good at saving money but we certainly don t make much me especially luckily we live in france where life is less expensive and we do not have cars or animals although we narrowly avoided buying chickens to eat our compost and sheep to mow our lawn seb has only ever lived in apartments and when confronted with expanses of green to maintain he tends to have sudden strokes of genius anyhow seb is a high school teacher and also puts in extra hours for extra school related work he teaches french to teenage immigrants who ve recently arrived usually under traumatic circumstances seb loves his job but he has to reapply for it every year which because he is french and used to job contracts that last a lifetime makes him highly nervous seb s professional background is in immigration he did his phd on the subject and has worked for the government with people seeking asylum not for very long but long enough to realize it wasn t the job for him i m glad he s not doing it anymore because having to refuse people papers because their atrocious suffering is not quite as atrocious as that guy over there is a soul sucking activity since it s expected that workers will refuse a certain percentage of asylum candidates it s a tough job seb also taught at the university level in the us and enjoyed that very much he really likes teaching and working with teenage college age people if we moved to the states he d probably pursue teaching at a high school or community college although i know he d be up for something different too he also runs his own independent publishing house teaches philosophy and we both volunteer at a local charity bookshop given his varied talents i m sure something cultural or what have you would work for him okay spoiler alert after completing a detailed budget thank you mrs fw for motivating me to do this very very eye opening i am sad to say that perhaps we are not quite as frugal as we thought whoops georgia s jobs i work part time as a pedagogical assistant at a culinary high school where i teach kids professional english such as i recommend the chablis and help them taste test blue lagoon cocktails at ten in the morning i love my job but i m in year three of a six year contract that cannot be renewed i could leave this position at any time prior to the termination of my contract but for me to give up the advantages of this job i d have to be paid a lot more i walk to work no car work part time have zero work related stress have sixteen weeks of paid vacation to spend with my baby and my man and to travel to the us and i really enjoy my work the downside i don t make very much money i ve considered taking the national exams to become a chef instructor at the high school level which is basically my current job with more responsibility however this would probably mean moving to another town there aren t all that many culinary high schools even in france and once you ve passed these exams the government can send you pretty much anywhere in the country that needs a teacher this position does not pay super super well about 1 600 euros per month starting and the main clincher is that i need to become a french citizen first and thus pass their charming national exam so this idea s on the back burner i do not hold an eu passport but i will be applying for french citizenship this year once we get all the documents together in the meantime i can legally work in all eu countries other than maybe the uk because of brexit as i have a french work visa which is a ten year visa and is renewable i ve also considered getting a united nations job i was shortlisted for a un editing gig in geneva a few years back and would consider doing something similar they offer quite a good deal whereby you work in geneva and live in france we have friends who live in evian and do this the pay for the un jobs is quite peachy and the competition is fierce but i d be willing to move to do something interesting and well paid that would allow me work with words and feel like i m helping people i tallied up the jobs i ve had over the years and the total came to over fifty i used to work several jobs at a time and have had a lot of short term contracts my main areas of focus are were museums i was manager of art education at a fine arts museum in tallahassee for about six years i was also a culinary tour guide in paris when i lived there i was manager of art education at a fine arts museum in tallahassee for about six years i was also a culinary tour guide in paris when i lived there restaurants i ve worked mostly as a pastry chef but also as a cook and server and have had several stints as a caterer for weddings and parties i ve worked mostly as a pastry chef but also as a cook and server and have had several stints as a caterer for weddings and parties education in total i ve been an instructor whether culinary or english language or otherwise for over a decade in total i ve been an instructor whether culinary or english language or otherwise for over a decade miscellaneous i ve done secretarial work worked in universities on the administrative side been a treatment writer for commercials written material for a travel website and took photos worked as an editor for films and books worked in hotels as a bilingual receptionist worked for an event decoration company for eight years and also had a very rewarding job working for a women s charity while i was in college in florida georgia s phd and writing aspirations currently i m getting my phd in english studies at bordeaux university i m in my first year and it s a three year program the big idea is that after graduation i ll try to get a job teaching at the university level in the us where we will go to make big money or at least more than 40k a year then after a handful of years we return to retire early in france this idea is not set in stone nor is it concretely actionable which makes both of us wonder if it s really the best scenario in addition to both being teachers seb and i have a real affinity for school i have a master s degree in english from bordeaux university and a diplôme de cuisine from le cordon bleu paris seb has a phd in sociology and political science from the university of versailles what i d really like to have is lots of time to hang out with my kid and my husband be able to afford both time and money wise to visit my family often and be able to write the undercurrent of all these life choices is my desire to be a published writer with a solid though not necessarily opulent career thus far i ve put in a little over a decade and countless completed manuscripts trying to achieve this dream and have yet to see any offers of representation or publication although i have been published as a translator of poetry which sells like positive hot cakes let me tell you should we move to florida another dilemma for me do i try to make more money now do i start a side hustle and really try to increase my paltry income in order to attain early retirement do i change jobs which would probably involve less time spent with my man and my kid and also my family in pursuit of making that end goal a reality or do i keep on keeping on with the phd and the knowledge that somebody somewhere will probably hire me for more money than i could make doing professional calligraphy or blogging or cat herding or whatever i could do as a side hustle right now seb would be able to work in the us once we got his papers squared away there would probably be about a six month delay before he d be able to work there s also the cost of living to consider in the us which would be higher since we d probably have to get at least one car we d only be willing to move near my parents who live in florida because childcare is too expensive in the us without grandparents the point of moving would be to see them more often and more easily things are in general more expensive in the us i also foresee going out for dinner drinks more if we moved to the us because my brother is a bartender and trying to nail him down for a visit is like trying to part water so it s best to attack him when he can t physically leave the building and suddenly find himself in peru a note on french retirement accounts or lack thereof there s a french national retirement program that neither seb nor i will probably see much of unless we work into our seventies they calculate your retirement based on how long you ve worked in france i have only been working here for a total of seven years and you need forty i am currently 33 which means i d have a very modest retirement pension at 66 years old but only if i never left france and worked elsewhere there are no roth iras or traditional iras or company matched 401k or 403b plans here except perhaps in a few magical unicorn jobs in paris with airbnb or twitter or some other non french company that happens to have offices here where georgia and seb want to be in 10 years 1 finances we d like to be financially independent or close to it so that we can have more control over our time and less stress over our money ten ish years is a steep goal but i think we can do it i guess we d also need to be managing our investments because i m really not sure about the european stock market and i m not sure if i m allowed to have investments in the us stock market if i m living in europe as such we d probably invest in rental properties in france which i m pretty comfortable with as my mom managed hers in the us while i was growing up and i have her example to emulate and i know exactly how much of a pain it can be the only thing is i have to get much more educated on is french taxation as far as investment properties are concerned because i have more than a feeling that they tax heavily on non primary residences 2 lifestyle we d like to be living in france or somewhere else in europe but have plenty of time to visit the us and or enough money to fly people over to visit us our daughter will be ten years old and i d like for her to see her grandparents often attend a public school spend a lot of time outdoors and generally have a fabulous time obviously we would both like to spend lots of time with her too i d also like to live in italy at some point because the food also i hear they pay university professors pretty well over there unlike in france so yeah in ten years it would be cool if all of this was happening trilingual babies unite 3 career seb would like to basically keep doing what he s doing teaching but not have to worry about money and contracts i would like to be writing gardening volunteering and doing some kind of interesting work i m very open to what that might be anything from market gardening to teaching classes someplace to working at a museum basically i want my current life but with more financial elbow room georgia and seb s finances all amounts have been converted from euros into us dollars income item amount net notes seb s income from teaching 2 287 includes french lessons for immigrant students philosophy club extra hours georgia s income from teaching 686 i work part time georgia s government aid 629 social assistance

year fixed rate loan at 1 65 percent interest we are thinking about reducing the monthly payments and increasing the duration what do you think groceries 503 we buy almost entirely organic about 90 and local about 60 but then there s all that chocolate organic and local are important to us i cook everything more or less outside of the occasional frozen pizza plus since we shop for about half our groceries at the market it s less expensive than the grocery store win win income taxes 265 i d like to note here that i love paying my taxes it gives me the warm and fuzzies i know what it s like to not be able to afford health insurance and be in a seriously precarious financial position in the us and if i can spare someone else that kind of day to day wrenching anxiety by sharing some of my surplus with a system that covers people s basic needs such as not dying or going into crazy debt for such exceptional and unheard of circumstances as having a baby i am incredibly happy to do so i know tithing is big on this blog and i like to think of taxation for social equality as a kind of non religious tithing travel annual trip to usa 194 yikes we try to avoid treating travel as a new fancy way to be consumers but it still adds up we visit the same places over and over in order to get to know them stay with friends and try to live once arrived the same way we do at home except with a lot more pizza this trip to the us is one trip per year to visit my family we spend about 500 700e each on airfare then the rest is our spending budget when we arrive we stay with family and borrow a car daycare 170 the cost is 2 hour for twenty hours a week while i m at work and studying papi granddad watches the baby two afternoons a week all by himself something that all the older local ladies find very impressive they were shocked when they discovered that he even changes diapers gender role switcheroo utilities gas 114 we have a gas stove and i cook a lot love the gas also used for radiators heat etc dental bills for georgia 114 teeth i blame this on being a pastry chef and chocolate cake addict and on not having dental coverage when i was living in the us i didn t go to the dentist for a long long time this should go down disappear next year when me teeths is fixed health insurance 97 optional but we like to have the extra cushion this covers all three of us travel annual trips to italy 92 two trips per year airfare and trains are about 70e for each of us then we stay with friends who we try to treat as much as possible in return for their hospitality ain t gonna lie we also eat a lot of pizza and gelato and that delicious smoked provolone potato tomato pasta when we get there to say nothing of the caffes with mineral water and little shell shaped candied orange pastries i die property taxes 69 georgia s phd expenses 69 fees and books might go up considerably next year if the new regulations that require foreign students to pay a higher tuition go into effect if this happens it will be more like 600 per month utilities electric 57 we were thinking about getting solar panels and selling the excess energy to the electric company normandy is cloudy but solar panels have gotten more efficient and there s some financial incentive from the government to invest in them input medical expenses for baby 57 she had a lot of crazy medical visits in the first few months though everything is fine now she still goes to the chiropractor and the physical therapist once every two weeks this should go down soon seb s workday lunches 52 we re going to try to cut this seb eats at school a few days a week and gets a sandwich one day a week house taxes 51 transportation 46 seb borrows a car once a week and puts in gas and takes the train 1 2 times a week as one of his jobs is not in our town we might be able to lower this i walk or bike to work boulangerie 46 this has got to go down it s our saturday pre market treat to buy croissants to eat at the cafe with seb s dad we could absolutely reduce this to one croissant each heh and eliminate the mid week flan and pastry purchases we also buy bread at the boulangerie which is more sensible and oh so tasty although i gotta admit part of me has to acknowledge that i moved to france 99 for the pastries so eliminating this altogether would not be in line with my lifelong goals cafes 46 coffee is cheap at 1 20 a cup we have fallen into the habit of going out for one with friends more often than we probably should travel annual trips to paris 46 we go to paris about three times a year now that we have a baby it used to be more tickets are 20e roundtrip and we stay with friends we do go out to eat a couple of times once there at cheap but delicious places and go out for drinks more often internet and two cell phones 34 seb s is 10 month georgia s is 20 month we broadcast our internet from my phone and i have international calling included baby supplies 34 mostly diapers and cotton wipes i only use water on her for now to protect her skin we don t buy her any clothes because everyone s been generously giving her more clothes than she could ever wear travel annual trip to cannes 34 one trip per year to visit family train tickets are about 100e each the rest is spending we stay with family and borrow a car clothing 29 this is one new pair of shoes each every two years or so plus a few purchases per year could be reduced i thrift shop but am known to splurge on a really nice bathrobe or something equally extravagant every once in a while postal expenses 29 mailing books for seb s publishing house mailing postcards a stamp is more expensive than a cup of coffee here postage for presents house insurance 23 should get a tiny bit cheaper this year as we re switching providers books 23 we love us some books i don t have access to an english language library although i just recently got my mom s us library info and have started checking out kindle books on her account so hopefully this will go down a little gifts 23 seb and i rarely buy each other presents but we do get things for family and friends shrubbery pruning 17 we have ginormous privacy

movies 17 seb goes to about two movies a month he loves this and i occasionally go with him so long as it s nothing too depressing drinks out 17 mostly in the summer at our friend herve s bar gardening 17 this reflects a lot of start up expenses for the new house s new garden should be way less this year i mostly grow veggies paperwork stuff 17 there is always some document to have translated or a passport to renew bank fees 11 this is a mandatory checking account expense they charge for the pleasure in france utilities water 11 medical expenses for seb 11 he s easy occasional pharmacy expense glasses restaurants 11 we almost never eat out but do so occasionally when friends visit from out of town seb s haircuts 5 i cut my own hair seb s hair is hilariously difficult to cut

no iras or company matched retirement funding things here since everyone has a retirement fund there are also no credit cards although i am considering applying for one next time we go to the states

mortgage notes our home 144 814 20 year fixed rate loan at 1 65 percent interest georgia s questions for you 1 should i change jobs or single mindedly focus on finishing my phd and our future plans even if this negatively impacts our savings rate 2 should we move to florida to live near my parents is this a financially viable option 3 or should we stay put and figure out something else what job could i do to make a higher wage with a master s phd in english i would prefer to avoid cooking because it doesn t pay well same story with translation work and those deadlines are crazy making 4 how should we invest stocks real estate 5 should i get a side hustle to boost our income or is this a waste of time we used to do airbnb but can t now because our house is too small which is too bad because we loved having people over i used to be a tour guide and had a great time but we don t live in a big city so it s less viable now also the pay was very irregular 6 how can we save more money i invite any and all suggestions for increased frugality i know our budget has a lot of fat and i d love to see concretely how that money could work towards furthering our financial goals mrs frugalwoods recommendations alright now i want to go to france and eat all the things and drink all the wine georgia and seb s life sounds amazing the boulangerie line item alone has me drooling as i m a world class pastry eater they ve managed to build a charming life that s inventive creative and fulfilling i m delighted georgia and seb came to me for a case study because i think they provide a wonderful example of making it work under many different circumstances i also want to congratulate georgia for her diligence in putting her case study together as she noted it s no small feat but it is a tremendously useful exercise in illuminating your financial life discernment the theme that echoed for me as i read georgia s case study is the need for discernment i get the sense that she and seb are interesting brilliant funny kind people and that because they re smart and good at lots of things they want to do all of the things this isn t bad it just represents a challenge most of us are only good at one or two things and only have one or two driving passions but georgia and seb buck this trend they are good at and passionate about a lot of things that s why i want to start off with an echo of paula pant s advice you can afford anything but you can t afford everything this is apt for georgia and seb because there just isn t a way short of space time tricks for their lives to encompass everything at least not all at once and not without a lot more money the top line advice i want to offer georgia and seb is to spend time discussing and discerning what they want to do most georgia s write up for this case study should provide the foundation for this conversation and i encourage them to go through their potential life plans with a calculating eye i saw a number of competing goals in georgia s writing achieving financial independence in ten years living in the united states living in italy retiring early in france earning more money the ability to travel more and be location independent to work as a university professor to be a published author most of this is achievable but i m hard pressed to figure out how it could all happen at least within the next ten years so let s dig into some specifics that will hopefully help provide a framework for georgia and seb as they go on this journey of discernment georgia s questions 1 and 5 should i change jobs should i get a side hustle georgia noted her desire to earn more money but she also noted that she loves her current job a rarity for most people let me tell you of all the things i hear from readers one of the rarest is what georgia said i love my job for me to give up the advantages of this job i d have to be paid a lot more i walk to work no car work part time have zero work related stress have sixteen weeks of paid vacation to spend with my baby and my man and to travel to the us and i really enjoy my work i realize she doesn t make much money but it is lovely to hear from someone who enjoys her work so very much given that i hope georgia factors in her personal happiness in this decision making process georgia and seb s financial independence goal georgia listed their top line ten year financial goal as achieving financial independence and so i ll address that within the context of her job related questions financial independence is calculated based on two primary factors your spending and your assets the basic premise of financial independence is that you have enough in assets that a safe withdrawal rate will cover your expenses in perpetuity based on georgia and seb s current income expenses and savings they are not on a track to reach financial independence or retire in the next ten years however that s not to say they couldn t radically increase their income and put themselves on this track if that s their primary goal earning a lot of money at a job you don t love can be a means to achieving a very specific end such as financial independence hence we reach georgia and seb s first juncture of discernment would georgia and potentially seb too rather find a different job with longer hours and more pay and potentially more stress less enjoyment in order to achieve financial independence or would she rather continue working a job that brings her daily fulfillment but that isn t going to allow her to reach financial independence anytime soon there s no right answer there are just different scenarios to consider achieving financial independence is a fairly uncommon thing and to do so requires an extraordinary set of circumstances both a moderate high income and low expenses if georgia and seb determine that financial independence is more important to them than any of their other listed goals they can do it but it will entail dramatically increasing their incomes reducing their spending putting some of their other goals on hold possibly permanently disclaimer side note before making such a consequential decision as retiring early anyone including georgia and seb should research from multiple sources run their own numbers and determine a rate of withdrawal that s tenable for them for more on the theories behind withdrawal rates i recommend the following series from early retirement now the ultimate guide to safe withdrawal rates additionally i want to note that in the us most people have the backstop of social security but georgia and seb don t appear to have access to a similar system in france if they retire early it s unclear to me what their pension benefits would be if anything if they retired early which could add another level of risk to this plan higher education jobs in the us i want to address georgia s interest in working as university professor in the us i am not a professor but i know a lot of them and i m pretty certain most of them would say that it s no longer a profession that offers high pay job security or plentiful job opportunities in the past this wasn t the case but increasingly us universities are moving toward fewer tenured faculty members and more adjuncts which usually means no contract no benefits and lower pay according to this article in the new york times tenure track positions are shrinking at colleges and universities as a result people with advanced degrees have found themselves in lower paying adjunct positions indefinitely this appears to be an unfortunate nationwide trend in higher education and so i strongly urge georgia to do more research into the viability of this career path if georgia s 1 goal and desire in life is to be a university english professor then she should do it no matter the pay or the challenges but i don t get the sense that s the case further from the new york times over the past few decades colleges and universities have responded to budget crises by hiring low cost part time faculty to teach core curriculum courses that formerly went to full time tenured professors additionally too many adjunct professors cannot make a living wage through teaching in fact one quarter of part time faculty are on public assistance unfortunately and as an english major myself this pains me to the core but the new york times notes if you have a ph d in accounting you can basically get a job in two weeks but in the liberal arts it s an entirely different story you can receive 100 or more applicants for a single position and that causes a problem sadly this means georgia s outlook with a phd in english is especially grim again there s not a wrong answer here but i don t think based on current trends in us higher education that attempting to go the university faculty route will be lucrative or easy to accomplish additionally georgia noted that if they moved to the us they d only be willing to move near her parents in florida which i think totally makes sense from a family grandkid perspective however most university professors need to move to wherever they re offered a job it s rare that a professor is able to choose where they live it would be a pretty small needle in a haystack for georgia to find a full time faculty position at a university near her parents it could happen but the odds are slim i know there are a ton of frugalwoods readers who work in higher education and i implore you to weigh in with your advice and experience should georgia finish her phd if georgia enjoys the program and has the time then sure the cost at present is quite low 69 per month 828 per year and i don t think presents a barrier however if her program increases to 600 per month 7 200 per year as georgia noted it might then i think she faces a tougher reckoning i m not sure of the utility of the degree see above discussion but that s not the only reason to pursue a phd if georgia derives deep fulfillment from her program then that s a valuable reason to continue her studies if georgia is set on working in a field that requires or rewards a phd in english then i encourage her to research those positions and their anticipated starting salaries georgia s question 2 should we move to florida my immediate reaction to this is no because i can t quite imagine going from bucolic french village where one walks everywhere unburdened by a car to suburban florida where one must drive everywhere this is more of a visceral reaction on my part than one founded on data points but i do encourage georgia and seb to fully consider the ramifications of going from pastoral european village to suburban usa georgia notes that they visit her parents every year and so next time they re there i suggest that she and seb pretend they live there and see how it feels here are a few exercises that might help drive to the grocery store and peruse the options since food is important to georgia and seb it ll be important for them to know what they can expect drive to a potential daycare visit potential daycares and inquire about their prices and waiting lists drive to a potential workplace really lots of driving look at real estate and get a sense for what their monthly rent mortgage would be scope out cultural opportunities bookstores cafes restaurants farmer s markets etc these seem to be important aspects of georgia and seb s life in france and so they d want to explore what options would be available in florida the lifestyle shift would be momentous but it s also true you can t put a price on living near family but i always hesitate when people want to move somewhere solely to co locate with their extended family we analyzed this topic in depth in a previous case study reader case study should we buy a campground and laundromat and here are some of the salient notes from that study reframed for georgia and seb s situation something striking is that georgia and seb didn t identify living in florida as one of their longterm goals in fact georgia specifically said basically i want my current life but with more financial elbow room the underlying message i got from georgia is that they re already living the life they want to live they ve carved out their little corner of the world and truly love how they spend each day that my friends is the ultimate goal of using your money wisely having the ability to enjoy your life every day is why we save money why we invest and why we steward our resources carefully it s entirely possible their quality of life would increase if they lived closer to georgia s parents but it s also possible it wouldn t i can t answer this for them but i encourage them to ask each other the following questions in five years what will you regret more not living near georgia s family or not living in the part of the world you love is it possible you ll feel resentful towards family members if you give up so much in order to live near them if you moved would you feel as though you were just trying to work back to what you have now a home in france tellingly georgia noted that they d like to return to france and so again i m not sure that an interlude in florida is going to make sense will you feel as though your daughter is missing out on the benefits of family if you don t move moving to florida from a financial perspective unless both seb and georgia are able to secure very well paying jobs in florida i m not sure the move would pan out financially georgia is aware of the expenses they d incur in the states including much much much more expensive daycare although it sounds like georgia s parents might be willing to provide some care full time daycare for a baby can be anywhere from 1 000 3 000 per month a car which includes insurance registration maintence repair taxes and gas higher health insurance costs higher living expenses in terms of rent utilities groceries additionally from georgia s research into the rental market it doesn t sound like renting out their home would generate much if any revenue breaking even on a rental isn t awful if their plan is to eventually move back to this house but then again i d question the utility of moving away in the first place since they just purchased their home last year it would be tough to break even or come out ahead if they sold it on such a short timeline i also want to make a note here for georgia and seb to do some research into their mortgage interest rate a 1 65 interest rate is fantastic but it almost sounds too fantastic to be a fixed rate percentage it very well may be but it also might be an adjustable interest rate it caught my eye because it s so phenomenally low so i just encourage georgia to take a quick look at their mortgage paperwork to make 100 certain that it is a fixed rate location independence georgia didn t specifically bring up the idea of location independence but it seems that might be an ideal scenario for them with the possible hitch of ironing out school for their daughter once she s older here are gems that stood out as i read their case study georgia and seb are worldly cosmopolitan bi lingual fascinating people given this they want to experience the world fully they want to live in italy they adore traveling and food i couldn t agree more on both counts they love their french village there wasn t a single negative comment about their current house or hometown they already live close to one family member seb s father who is clearly a very involved granddad they both have multiple interests passions and talents which i think they could easily transmute into careers they are hard workers i think georgia and seb are romantic visionaries with an unusually strong work ethic this is a great combination given all of this i wonder if they ve considered both pursuing mobile careers such that they d be able to live in france for part of the year visit georgia s parents for part of the year and travel about for the rest of the year they ve already successfully run an airbnb out of their home and so perhaps it would be viable to keep their home and airbnb it while they traveled visiting family i don t know if georgia and seb want to be this nomadic but mobile careers would certainly grant them this freedom they d be able to spend quality blocks of time with both seb s dad and georgia s parents and brother without the expenses and upheaval of moving to florida permanently retain their homebase in the french countryside assuming they re comfortable with renting it out airbnb ing it when they re not in town travel extensively for long periods of time each year experience different cultures and foods together as a family remote work is increasingly common my husband and i are both able to work from anywhere with an internet connection and georgia and seb have such a panoply of skills that it seems they d be able to find something satisfactory georgia s question 6 how can we save more money oh i love it when people ask this because i m going to answer it whether you ask or not so it s always nice to be asked what i want to highlight for georgia and seb however is that on balance their issue is much more one of lower incomes georgia is keenly aware of this and while it is possible for them to save more i also want to make sure they keep an eye on increasing their income in every case study i like to point out that what you choose to save or not save is a very personal decision cutting every last expense is not the right answer for everyone and i am not an advocate for making yourself miserable in the process of achieving financial stability i am an advocate for values based goal oriented spending i think it s important to assess whether all of your expenses bring you fulfillment and a good return on your investment i think it s also important to question if your rate of savings will help you to achieve your long term goals but what you spend on that s a very personal choice and one you have to make for yourself my job is to identify areas where you might be able to save but only you can decide what level of savings is right for you if you re struggling with where to save more and how to map out a longterm financial plan i encourage you to take my free 31 day uber frugal month challenge item current amount mrs fw s notes proposed new amount amount saved mortgage 812 this is fabulously low cheers 812 0 groceries 503 this seems pretty reasonable for three people who mostly eat at home 503 0 travel 366 i combined georgia and seb s line items for their annual trips to the usa italy paris and cannes this is a tough one because it represents a significant amount of their spending but it also represents a top priority for them this is an example of values based spending but it s also 4 392 per year it is by far their largest discretionary expense but it s also perhaps what s most important to them my inclination in this category is to encourage georgia and seb to investigate cheaper ways to travel which could include location independent jobs i ve reduced this by deleting their trips to italy 92 per month and paris 46 per month but left in their trips to visit family in the us and in cannes 228 138 income taxes 265 fixed expense no change 265 0 daycare 170 amazingly cheap nothing in the us comes even close to being this

7 452 income vs expenses while georgia and seb do have some room in their budget to save more i think what this spreadsheet highlights is that the real issue impacting their ability to save is their income at a certain point there s just nothing left to frugalize in order to make momentous progress towards their financial independence goal there s no doubt that georgia and seb would need to dramatically increase their income death by 1 000 paper cuts other than their travel line item georgia and seb s spending is a good illustration of death by 1 000 paper cuts they aren t wildly spending in any one area they just have a lot of little expenses that add up each month and gobble the majority of their income i counsel so many people who initially tell me i don t know where the money goes we don t buy expensive stuff this is a very very very common refrain in fact it s verbatim what i said before i started tracking my own spending i m not telling georgia anything new here she shared the following observation after completing a detailed budget thank you mrs fw for motivating me to do this very very eye opening i am sad to say that perhaps we are not quite as frugal as we thought whoops people get tired of hearing me parrot start with tracking your spending because it sounds blah boring rote boring as it may be it provides one of the best and easiest ways to begin understanding your finances yes income is important yes investments are important but none of it matters if you aren t saving any of your money you have to have something to invest if you make 1m per year but spend 1m per year you will obviously have a lower net worth than someone who makes 50k a year and saves half of it the vast majority of folks i work with here on the blog and in person have a budget that resembles georgia and seb s there aren t any massive line items everything looks pretty reasonable an yet there s no money left at the end of the month if you re not tracking your spending i use and recommend the free expense tracker offered by personal capital if you d like to know more about how personal capital works check out my full review savings accounts side note one of the easiest ways to optimize your money is to keep it in a high interest savings account with these accounts interest works in your favor as opposed to the interest rates on debt which work against you having money in a no or low interest savings account is a waste of resources because your money is sitting there doing nothing don t let your money be lazy make it work for you and now enjoy some explanatory math let s say you have 5 000 in a savings account that earns 0 interest in a year s time your 5 000 will still be 5 000 let s say you instead put that 5 000 into an american express personal savings account that as of this writing earns 1 70 in interest in one year your 5 000 will have increased to 5 085 67 that means you earned 85 67 just by having your money in a high interest account and you didn t have to do anything i m a big fan of earning money while doing nothing i mean is anybody not a fan of that apparently so because anyone who uses a low or no interest savings account is not making money while doing nothing don t be that person be the person who earns money while sleeping rack up the interest and prosper more about high interest savings accounts as well as the ones i recommend here the best high interest rate online savings accounts overall asset allocation now that we ve discussed some of the ways in which georgia and seb could save more money every month let s take a look at their overall financial picture the good no debt other than their mortgage hooray and congrats i am so impressed and delighted that they buckled down and paid off all of their debt further they ve managed to stay out of debt perfect job here robust emergency fund fabulous and wonderful an emergency fund is typically three to six months worth of your expenses held in an easily accessible checking or savings account at their current rate of spending 3 336 month that would be 10 008 to 20 016 since they have 33 167 in savings they re in great shape an emergency fund serves as your buffer against financial catastrophe and is a mandatory part of everyone s finances yes everyone the not so good no retirement savings eek this makes me nervous i m very much hoping that french readers will chime in and offer their advice on both this and the below line item investments i am not at all familiar with the french banking system but i encourage georgia and seb to do research into retirement savings vehicles my concern for them is that they won t accrue enough working years in france or the us or any other country to qualify for government supplied retirement social security in the us hence i suggest georgia and seb research if there are any tax advantaged retirement savings vehicles they can avail themselves of in france no investments aside from their primary residence and their savings account similar to the above we re straying into territory i m not versed in and can t offer concrete advice on georgia is aware it s important to have investment elements of her financial portfolio and she s correct that two very common avenues for this both of which i happen to do are rental properties and the stock market as far as i understand it is indeed possible for georgia to invest in the us stock market through a low fee index fund as an american citizen i am pretty sure georgia can hold an american brokerage account through for example fidelity or vanguard however the huge caution with this approach is that an american brokerage account would be denominated in dollars while georgia and seb are living in a country with a different currency in light of this if she did choose to open an american brokerage account she d need to be very careful about currency exchange rates basically the concern is that if the dollar loses value against the euro suddenly your savings are worth less and of course the inverse is also true over time currency exchange rate fluctuations could dramatically impact your net worth in sum a savings account denominated in a currency over than your own can be risky and challenging although not impossible what i encourage here is for georgia and seb to do more research into ex pat investment options from other americans living in france i just don t know enough about this to offer detailed advice what about rental properties georgia also asked my opinion on buying rental properties in france and my answer is that this might be a good idea and it might not be several things in georgia s favor she said she loves tracking the real estate market her mom owns investment properties and so she has a first hand source of information she and seb have dipped their toes into this arena by renting out their place on airbnb there are many factors that go into determining whether or not rental properties are a good idea and it s certainly something georgia and seb should investigate owning a rental property is so heavily location dependent that i really can t advise on whether or not this is a good idea georgia and seb should research purchase prices and rental prices in the area and the return therein the percentage of units that are rented in the area if there are home owners associations and what the rules are governing rental units what sort of mortgage interest rate they can anticipate when buying an investment property taxes and laws surrounding rental properties the rental prices in the area and whether or not these typically include things like utilities snow removal trash etc whether or not they d hire a property manager and how much this would cost if they don t plan to hire a property manager they should assess their diy skills can they re plumb a toilet fix a leaky sink etc etc etc as georgia and seb know repairs are endless in homes calculations for a robust fund to cover vacancy maintenance repairs etc the caliber of tenants in the area and how likely evictions or vacancies are landlord tenant laws in france and in their region summary georgia and seb are in a good position both financially and in terms of life enjoyment and so i think this is an exciting juncture for them they have the opportunity to consider what they truly want to do in life and map out a plan the key for them will be whittling down their many ideas and passions to a simplified core that represents their highest priorities here s my summary of advice to georgia and seb spend time on the topic of discernment quiz each other on what you want most from life and make lists of everything you d love to do narrow it down be honest about what s reasonable and what you can afford identify your top line priorities and then let go of everything that doesn t align with those goals consider the ramifications and realities of moving to florida consider the change in lifestyle the change in expenses and whether or not you d enjoy living there research the job prospects and salaries for georgia as a university professor in the us consider if location independent careers would more nearly meet your goals of traveling seeing family more often earning more money review the above suggested decreases in spending to determine what would be tenable determine if financial independence in ten years is your top priority if so turn your focus to finding higher paying jobs research investment options research the availability of tax advantaged retirement accounts in france research investment options for ex pats living in france research the viability of purchasing rental properties as part of this research double check the fine print details regarding your mortgage interest rate ok frugalwoods nation what advice would you give to georgia she and i will both reply to comments so please feel free to ask any clarifying questions would you like your own case study to appear here on frugalwoods email me mrs frugalwoods com your brief story and we ll talk updated 3 12 19 after many of you commented on how delightful georgia s writing is i begged her to divulge the following after many years of being harassed by her mother to sit down and write it georgia has written a memoir about living and cooking in france from normandy to paris to the french riviera and will soon be shopping it around the literary scene hopefully we can all read it soon update from georgia on 12 10 19
washington the latest report from the international monetary fund s article iv mission to liberia has painted a rather bleak outlook for liberia s economic future liberia s economic situation is challenging and strong policy actions will be required to maintain as favorable an outlook as anticipated at this time last year the team noted in its report released friday the imf team led by mika saito visited monrovia from february 25 march 8 to conduct discussions for the 2019 article iv consultation with liberia and held discussions with president george weah speaker of the house of representatives bhofal chambers minister of finance and development planning samuel tweah governor of the central bank of liberia nathaniel patray minister of commerce and industry professor wilson tarpeh other senior government officials private sector representatives and development partners the team thanks the authorities for their collaboration and fruitful discussions in its report the team reported that macroeconomic stability has proved elusive despite improved revenue collection in the first half of fy2019 while the fiscal stance has loosened significantly said the report with accommodative monetary policy meeting fiscal needs the exchange rate depreciated by 26 percent over the year and inflation accelerated to 28 percent at end december this is detrimental to the living standards of the most vulnerable liberians who earn and spend primarily in liberian dollars and threatens the success of the pro poor agenda growth for 2018 is now estimated at 1 2 percent while the forecast for 2019 on current policies has been revised down to 0 4 percent from 4 7 percent the team reported that discussion with the authorities centered on the policies required to address the current situation and promote strong noninflationary growth over the medium term and noted that the commencement of sales of central bank bills supplemented by the introduction of the standing deposit and credit facilities in the interbank market represent major milestones in modernizing the monetary policy framework with the appropriate preconditions firmly in place a timely reduction of the rate of inflation to single digits appears possible of the necessary preconditions the most critical is that the government refrain from borrowing from the central bank the team noted the imf mission recommended that the budget for fiscal year 2020 be based on realistic estimates of the resource envelope giving ministries and agencies a reliable estimate of the actual resources that will be available to them is critical to improving the quality of public services even if this represents less than the amount budgeted in the past without central bank borrowing financing a sufficient level of public service provision will require policies to prioritize and improve the composition of expenditure enhance its efficiency and expand the resource envelope the mission noted that productive spending is being crowded out by a wage bill including discretionary allowances that totals about two thirds of government funded expenditure this is not a new issue it has been a characteristic of the liberian economy for a number of years however as grants and other external assistance decline this is no longer a tenable situation freeing up resources in an equitable manner for pro poor development will likely require effective actions to reduce the share of government resources devoted to this budget item the mission said improving the efficiency of government spending will be key and stressed that policies should aim at improving the monitoring accountability and transparency of spending intensifying actions to improve governance and fight corruption including through rigorous adherence to existing procurement rules would also be effective according to the imf team revenue reforms have considerable potential to directly expand the resource envelope and facilitate a needed increase in social spending the mission notes the recent finalization of the domestic revenue mobilization strategy the mission recommended that the authorities pursue the envisaged reforms including excise tax tax exemptions and compliance increased uncertainty and volatility in the external environment argues for further measures to safeguarding the foreign exchange reserves of the central bank the mission noted that creation of a well functioning monetary policy framework would reduce the need for foreign exchange intervention acceptance of greater exchange rate flexibility would help preserve reserve stocks and help absorb external shocks in addition reducing the central bank s operational deficit would be vital regarding the investigative reports by the presidential investigative team and by kroll associates the mission stressed that the findings point point to a need for substantial improvements in operational policies guidelines and compliance we encourage the liberian authorities to take advantage of available support from the international community to make much needed remedial actions in these areas the mission notes the need for significant action to improve the business climate and provide the enabling environment required for private sector led growth removing administrative constraints on imports and prices to boost the level of competition while ensuring quality and safety standards should be prioritized liberia should step up efforts to strengthen governance and anti corruption efforts as envisaged in the government s pro poor agenda as it would create an environment conducive to private sector led inclusive growth

the 2019 budget but it s at least 13 billion less than what congress approved it s also about 14 billion less than what lawmakers approved for 2018 the cuts in the new spending plan would come largely

still amount to thousands of dollars for the most expensive medications the actual dollar amount of the cost cap would be determined in conjunction with congress one lawmaker s proposal would set the

cigarette industry to help combat a surge in underage vaping e cigarettes are battery powered devices that typically heat a nicotine solution into an inhalable vapor most experts agree they are less harmful than traditional cigarettes but officials at the food and drug administration and other health agencies were caught off guard last year by an explosion in underage use by teenagers about 1 in 5 high school students reported using e cigarettes last year according to the most recent federal survey data the fees would ensure that fda has the resources to address today s alarming rise in youth

2021 the affordable care act would be replaced with grants that states could use to subsidize private insurance coverage and medicaid would be replaced with a block grant instead of the current open

bimbola oyesola the battle for a new national minimum wage in the country seems far from being won though nigerian workers are anxiously waiting for the senate to pass the bill there appears to be more hurdles to cross besides the president signing it into law while the organised labour had fought vehemently to secure n30 000 monthly wage it is also apprehensive that taxing it further may vitiate the victory won in 2011 when the current n18 000 was approved as minimum wage workers in that income bracket were exempted from paying tax as the deduction would have further reduced the wage below n18 000 also comparing the contentious n30 000 which is about 83 at current exchange with the 11 dollar per hour minimum wage in america shows that the least paid worker in america will earn in a day what a nigerian worker is struggling to earn in a month in the same analysis a worker in indonesia earns 100 dollar as minimum wage but unlike in nigeria where the social safety net is not working in indonesia the worker salary is not expended on health education while gas transport are heavily subsidized and food is very cheap and affordable the opposite is the case here perhaps the reason why organised labour is calling for tax exemption on the proposed new wages in order not to put further pressure on it and thereby making the increase irrelevant the leadership of the nigeria labour congress nlc at its just concluded nlc 12th quadrennial delegate conference raised fresh concerns over the proposed national minimum wage saying there was need for an amendment of the income tax laws to cushion the effect of devaluation that might hit the n30 000 in a petition submitted by the national union of textile garment and tailoring workers of nigeria nutgtwn at the plenary session of the conference in abuja which saw the re election of comrade ayuba wabba as president the union noted that there was a twin assault on the real income of nigerian workers caused by unrestrained devaluation of naira and high rate of inflation general secretary nutgtwn issa aremu said that it was important to put pressure on the federal inland revenue service firs to raise the tax bar in such a way that n30 000 minimum wage would fall below taxable income in the same vein the labour leader made case for tax holidays for some categories of nigerian workers he said now that we have raised the minimum wage to n30 000 we must impress it on the firs to raise tax bar so that the new minimum wage will be protected if you tax minimum wage of n30 000 we may as well go back to n25 000 or n27 000 by default deputy speaker of the house of representatives yusuf sulaiman lasun raised the point and i think labour must push the agenda to protect the new minimum wage the n30 000 monthly income is actually a compromised amount from n56 000 earlier proposed so it must be protected if the federal government can give 10 year tax holiday to companies why not give the same to workers given the collapse of income today nigerian workers deserve tax holidays aremu a gubernatorial candidate of the labour party in kwara state said workers are not asking for this because we consider our job as charitable what workers have in their pocket is what will turn the economy around that is what we will use to purchase goods in the market and pay rent according to him for economic recovery to gain traction it is good for workers to have sustainable purchasing power or disposable income that is off the tax hook arguing in line with aremu s position general secretary of nlc peter ozo eson also expressed that the income tax law should be amended to protect workers purchasing power he reasoned that given that the n30 000 labour agreed as a compromised minimum wage is so low ideally it should not be taxed but i believe that the correct way to do it is to amend the income tax law in order to raise the exemption bar if n30 000 will fall within the law should be amended to ensure that the minimum wage level is below the taxable income under the present law if you earn n18 000 a month your tax is zero there is a tax table but with n30 000 under the existing exemption guideline there will be some little tax because it will be slightly above the exemption tax what needs to be done is to have an adjustment to the schedule so that the exemption is placed above the minimum wage consequently the nlc at the conference has called on the government to exempt the expected new minimum wage from taxation arguements in favour of tax exemption members of the organised private sector ops who are the employers in the private sector likewise shared the view that there is a strong case to be made in favour of the exemption of those earning minimum wage from taxation the director general of the lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci mr muda yusuf said the revenue realised by government by taxing workers in the category is inconsequential such revenue is actually not significant whereas the welfare effect of not taxing them can be quite insubstantial besides such an exemption is in line with the key objectives and principles of taxation which is to redistribute income he said yusuf added that taxation is all about creating an environment which allows the rich to support the poor stating that this same principle could be extended to micro enterprises in the economy such category of business owners should also enjoy tax exemption he stated according to him a minimum wage of thirty thousand naira n30 000 is really not too much to be paid to the lowest staff of an organisation whether in the public and private sector taking into account the cost of living in the nigerian economy he said let us take a scenario of a family man that has to pay school fees for his children provide feeding for the family pay for health care pay for transportation pay house rent and possibly even support some dependants a monthly income of n30 000 certainly cannot cover these basic responsibilities it is therefore even worse when we talk about n18 000 minimum wage however the challenge with many of the state governments is that they have a workforce that is very unwieldy and not sustainable there is also the problem of too many political appointees on the payroll of many of the state governments these appointees are paid huge sum in terms of remuneration the third issue creating sustainability problem is leakages and corruption therefore for the n30 000 to be sustainable some hard choices have to be made and there should be better discipline in the management of government finances speaking in the same vein the director general of nigeria employers consultative association neca mr timothy olawale who led other members of ops to the tripartite committee on the minimum wage and equally stoutly stood behind the organised labour at the hearing s in the lower chamber in the defense of the n30 000 as against n27 000 submitted by the federal government said anything below n30 000 will be inappropriate he said that employers have the responsibility of taking care of their employees before they can increase productivity stating that employers who are not paying good salary are not making life meaningful for their workers he stated we all know the value and worth of money in the present economy the question we should ask ourselves is how far will the n30 000 go in taking care of a worker and his or her entire family by the time a worker go to and fro from his her working place everyday that n30 000 will substantially have gone don t forget that there are also other basic needs like shelter feeding medicals education for the children so when you benchmark all those with the said amount it can t go far and i want to say personally that anything below that is criminal the federal government has presented n27 000 recommended by the council of state in the new minimum wage bill presented to

sustain nigerian families the speaker said a living wage is aptly appropriate for nigerian workers rather than a national minimum wage because of the country s harsh economic reality dogara noted that there were obvious reasons why the house had to give accelerated consideration to the very crucial bill he said it is a bill that is long overdue as the current national minimum wage which was fixed in 2011 has become unrealistic due to supervening developments in the nation let me assure the nigerian workers that the national assembly is aware of and shares in your pains patience and sacrifices as regards the issue of the national minimum wage majority of our members are on your side he said while we are not oblivious of the current economic downturn and the dwindling revenue of government we cannot also be blind to the fact that all economic indices indicate that even the n30 000 minimum wage that labour is asking for is not enough to sustain a small family unit the nation may not have enough to satisfy the minimum demands of the nigerian worker but as a nation we need to set our economic priorities right and ensure that we dignify our worker s by making allowance for their minimum comfort i know of no alternative if we hope to up the productivity level of our workforce the speaker said since underemployment and unemployment were poverty strange bedfellows eliminating them must be the focal point of government s policies he identified corruption as a major factor that continued to fundamentally undermine democratic institutions and values how then do we fight corruption from the roots rather than dealing with its symptoms as is currently the case the answer is for us to begin to pay workers living wage not minimum wage ability to pay at the hearing the finance minister tried to defend government noting that total cost of the salaries paid from january to december 2018 was a total of n2 618tn which he said represents 72 66 per cent of the actual revenue that was generated between january and december to the tune of 3 603tn but organised labour has since refuted the claim that the new wage may put more pressure on the government the secretary general of the ascsn comrade alade bashir lawal said government will not spend above n200 billion to pay salaries of core civil servants taking consequential adjustment into consideration he said that the government could pay workers the agreed n30 000 minimum wage without looking for funds as it said government generate huge funds from the customs stamp duty payment vat treasury single account and many other sources the federal inland revenue service firs says it recorded n5 4 trillion in 2018 and is targeting about n8 trillion in 2019 these are revenue sources which can enable government pay minimum wage so already there is an excess of n3 trillion and 52 percent of this cannot be more than n200 billion for workers salary in a year before the consequential adjustment the impact is not significant as there are no workers anymore on level 1 3 those have been contracted lawal said it was sad that there are leakages through taxes which was the traditional revenue source of government at all level but noted that the federal government could pay minimum wage within the resources it has the nlc president equally dismissed claims that the implementation of the new national minimum wage would lead to inflation in the country ayuba said the central bank of nigeria cbn has also confirmed it that the implementation of n30 000 minimum wage will stabilise the economy adding that other countries such as south africa has recently approved minimum wage for its citizens despite the recession in the country the cbn recently made us to understand that the implementation of n30 000 minimum wage will strengthen the economy because this will empower and put resources in the hands of the working class so who is fooling who ayuba said however as labour awaits the reconvening of the senate it had expressed hope that the senate would concur with the house of representatives for quick passage of the minimum wage bill the nlc president has said we hope they will do what is right and what is expected of them by also concurring with what the house of reps has done so that workers can have a succour because clearly we know as a matter of fact that the current minimum wage cannot even take workers home many workers are finding it very difficult to maintain their families and have a decent life so it is not a decent wage certainly it is a poverty wage and therefore whatever can be done to alleviate the situation of workers will certainly be appreciated

by shadowing the us federal reserve so closely latin american countries are foregoing the policy flexibility that their floating exchange rate regimes are intended to allow they also risk relying too heavily on possible us interest rate cuts to boost their economies and not enough on deeper long term reforms london the united states federal reserve has done it again in 2018 the prospect of higher us interest rates sent emerging markets into a tailspin but so far this year indications of a more relaxed fed stance have boosted emerging market currencies and stock markets despite concerns about a possible us china trade war economic slowdowns in most major economies and rampant populism around latin america currencies and central banks are enjoying a much needed breather markets had been anticipating tighter monetary policy in a number of countries including chile peru and mexico now the talk is of a wait and see approach before withdrawing monetary stimulus even in argentina still battling the twin evils of high inflation and low investor confidence the more benign external scenario allowed for a sharp if short lived reduction in peso interest rates by shadowing the fed so closely latin america s central banks are foregoing the policy flexibility or so called monetary independence that their countries floating exchange rate regimes are intended to allow what s more policymakers risk relying too heavily on possible us interest rate cuts to boost the region s economies and not enough on tougher structural reforms and export promotion measures in theory a country with a floating currency can use local interest rates to smooth domestic inflation and output while letting the exchange rate rise or fall as needed to achieve external balance this is why most emerging markets have moved to floating exchange rates and why the fixed but adjustable pegs once so common in latin america are now mostly a thing of the past the change is broadly considered to have been a success but practice is turning out to be quite different from what theory would predict subscribe to ps digital subscribe to ps digital access every new ps commentary our entire on point suite of subscriber exclusive content including longer reads insider interviews big picture big question and say more and the full ps archive subscribe now when the us raised rates last year latin america was expected to follow now the fed seems to be pausing and so are the region s central banks what is going on what happened to monetary independence weren t local conditions supposed to determine local interest rates not really although currency movements that absorb shocks are a good thing central bankers seem to believe that too much of a good thing can become bad to borrow the memorable title of a paper by guillermo calvo and carmen reinhart nearly two decades ago they suffer from fear of floating so when us rates rise putting downward pressure on local currencies emerging market central banks tend to follow the fed s lead this is partly to limit inflationary pressures because local currency depreciation makes imported goods more expensive emerging market central bankers also want to protect the balance sheets of local banks and companies which tend to borrow in dollars and will face greater difficulty repaying if the local currency falls now that the fed has signaled a loosening of its stance latin american policymakers will probably follow the us lead again for starters most countries in the region are more worried about slow growth than inflation these days and do not want their currencies to appreciate sharply possible fed easing therefore gives policymakers the chance to inject some additional monetary vitamins into latin american economies with little or no risk of higher inflation argentina s recent experience highlights another reason to cut interest rates as soon as the fed does starting in the second quarter of 2018 local rates had increased sharply to contain rising inflation and prop up the plummeting peso but the record rates as high as 60 were causing central bank debt to snowball a phenomenon economists call unpleasant monetarist arithmetic so as soon as the fed began sounding dovish argentina s central bank cut rates hoping to prevent the debt snowball from getting even bigger the view that most countries monetary policies are really made in washington dc has been around for a while hélène rey of the london business school has argued that local financial and credit conditions reflect what the fed does almost regardless of the exchange rate regime this idea of a global financial cycle is plausible but remains controversial the good news is that most latin american economies are better prepared nowadays to deal with us interest rate changes in the past the region s central banks had little choice but to follow fed rate rises because they needed to attract enough foreign funds to finance large current account deficits but nowadays latin america s main economies run much smaller external deficits usually 1 2 of gdp and are therefore far less dependent on foreign finance the bad news is that these smaller latin american deficits reflect relatively low investment rather than high levels of saving growth around the region has been lackluster since the commodity boom ended five years ago and seems likely to remain so for the foreseeable future complacently relying on looser us monetary policy to manufacture the region s next growth spurt will not help the fed s magic punch may be tasty but it is no substitute for the deeper long term economic reforms that latin america urgently needs
while the organised labour had fought vehemently to secure n30 000 monthly wage it is also apprehensive that taxing it further may vitiate the victory won in 2011 when the current n18 000 was approved as minimum wage workers in that income bracket were exempted from paying tax as the deduction would have further reduced the wage below n18 000 also comparing the contentious n30 000 which is about 83 at current exchange with the 11 dollar per hour minimum wage in america shows that the least paid worker in america will earn in a day what a nigerian worker is struggling to earn in a month in the same analysis a worker in indonesia earns 100 dollar as minimum wage but unlike in nigeria where the social safety net is not working in indonesia the worker salary is not expended on health education while gas transport are heavily subsidized and food is very cheap and affordable the opposite is the case here perhaps the reason why organised labour is calling for tax exemption on the proposed new wages in order not to put further pressure on it and thereby making the increase irrelevant the leadership of the nigeria labour congress nlc at its just concluded nlc 12th quadrennial delegate conference raised fresh concerns over the proposed national minimum wage saying there was need for an amendment of the income tax laws to cushion the effect of devaluation that might hit the n30 000 in a petition submitted by the national union of textile garment and tailoring workers of nigeria nutgtwn at the plenary session of the conference in abuja which saw the re election of comrade ayuba wabba as president the union noted that there was a twin assault on the real income of nigerian workers caused by unrestrained devaluation of naira and high rate of inflation general secretary nutgtwn issa aremu said that it was important to put pressure on the federal inland revenue service firs to raise the tax bar in such a way that n30 000 minimum wage would fall below taxable income in the same vein the labour leader made case for tax holidays for some categories of nigerian workers he said now that we have raised the minimum wage to n30 000 we must impress it on the firs to raise tax bar so that the new minimum wage will be protected if you tax minimum wage of n30 000 we may as well go back to n25 000 or n27 000 by default deputy speaker of the house of representatives yusuf sulaiman lasun raised the point and i think labour must push the agenda to protect the new minimum wage the n30 000 monthly income is actually a compromised amount from n56 000 earlier proposed so it must be protected if the federal government can give 10 year tax holiday to companies why not give the same to workers given the collapse of income today nigerian workers deserve tax holidays aremu a gubernatorial candidate of the labour party in kwara state said workers are not asking for this because we consider our job as charitable what workers have in their pocket is what will turn the economy around that is what we will use to purchase goods in the market and pay rent according to him for economic recovery to gain traction it is good for workers to have sustainable purchasing power or disposable income that is off the tax hook arguing in line with aremu s position general secretary of nlc peter ozo eson also expressed that the income tax law should be amended to protect workers purchasing power he reasoned that given that the n30 000 labour agreed as a compromised minimum wage is so low ideally it should not be taxed but i believe that the correct way to do it is to amend the income tax law in order to raise the exemption bar if n30 000 will fall within the law should be amended to ensure that the minimum wage level is below the taxable income under the present law if you earn n18 000 a month your tax is zero there is a tax table but with n30 000 under the existing exemption guideline there will be some little tax because it will be slightly above the exemption tax what needs to be done is to have an adjustment to the schedule so that the exemption is placed above the minimum wage consequently the nlc at the conference has called on the government to exempt the expected new minimum wage from taxation arguements in favour of tax exemption members of the organised private sector ops who are the employers in the private sector likewise shared the view that there is a strong case to be made in favour of the exemption of those earning minimum wage from taxation the director general of the lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci mr muda yusuf said the revenue realised by government by taxing workers in the category is inconsequential such revenue is actually not significant whereas the welfare effect of not taxing them can be quite insubstantial besides such an exemption is in line with the key objectives and principles of taxation which is to redistribute income he said yusuf added that taxation is all about creating an environment which allows the rich to support the poor stating that this same principle could be extended to micro enterprises in the economy such category of business owners should also enjoy tax exemption he stated according to him a minimum wage of thirty thousand naira n30 000 is really not too much to be paid to the lowest staff of an organisation whether in the public and private sector taking into account the cost of living in the nigerian economy he said let us take a scenario of a family man that has to pay school fees for his children provide feeding for the family pay for health care pay for transportation pay house rent and possibly even support some dependants a monthly income of n30 000 certainly cannot cover these basic responsibilities it is therefore even worse when we talk about n18 000 minimum wage however the challenge with many of the state governments is that they have a workforce that is very unwieldy and not sustainable there is also the problem of too many political appointees on the payroll of many of the state governments these appointees are paid huge sum in terms of remuneration the third issue creating sustainability problem is leakages and corruption therefore for the n30 000 to be sustainable some hard choices have to be made and there should be better discipline in the management of government finances speaking in the same vein the director general of nigeria employers consultative association neca mr timothy olawale who led other members of ops to the tripartite committee on the minimum wage and equally stoutly stood behind the

medicals education for the children so when you benchmark all those with the said amount it can t go far and i want to say personally that anything below that is criminal the federal government has

since refuted the claim that the new wage may put more pressure on the government the secretary general of the ascsn comrade alade bashir lawal said government will not spend above n200 billion to pay salaries of core civil servants taking consequential adjustment into consideration he said that the government could pay workers the agreed n30 000 minimum wage without looking for funds as it said government generate huge funds from the customs stamp duty payment vat treasury single account and many other sources the federal inland revenue service firs says it recorded n5 4 trillion in 2018 and is targeting about n8 trillion in 2019 these are revenue sources which can enable government pay minimum wage so already there is an excess of n3 trillion and 52 percent of this cannot be more than n200 billion for workers salary in a year before the consequential adjustment the impact is not significant as there are no workers anymore on level 1 3 those have been contracted lawal said it was sad that there are leakages through taxes which was the traditional revenue source of government at all level but noted that the federal government could pay minimum wage within the resources it has the nlc president equally dismissed claims that the implementation of the new national minimum wage would lead to inflation in the country ayuba said the central bank of nigeria cbn has also confirmed it that the implementation of n30 000 minimum wage will stabilise the economy adding that other countries such as south africa has recently approved minimum wage for its citizens despite the recession in the country the cbn recently made us to understand that the implementation of n30 000 minimum wage will strengthen the economy because this will empower and put resources in the hands of the working class so who is fooling who ayuba said however as labour awaits the reconvening of the senate it had expressed hope that the senate would concur with the house of representatives for quick passage of the minimum wage bill the nlc president has said we hope they will do what is right and what is expected of them by also concurring with what the house of reps has done so that workers can have a succour because clearly we know as a matter of fact that the current minimum wage cannot even take workers home many workers are finding it very difficult to maintain their families and have a decent life so it is not a decent wage certainly it is a poverty wage and therefore whatever can be done to alleviate the situation of workers will certainly be appreciated the battle for a new national minimum wage in the country seems far from being won though nigerian workers are anxiously waiting for the senate to pass the bill there appears to be more hurdles to cross besides the president signing it into law while the organised labour had fought vehemently to secure n30 000 monthly wage it is also apprehensive that taxing it further may vitiate the victory won in 2011 when the current n18 000 was approved as minimum wage workers in that income bracket were exempted from paying tax as the deduction would have further reduced the wage below n18 000 also comparing the contentious n30 000 which is about 83 at current exchange with the 11 dollar per hour minimum wage in america shows that the least paid worker in america will earn in a day what a nigerian worker is struggling to earn in a month in the same analysis a worker in indonesia earns 100 dollar as minimum wage but unlike in nigeria where the social safety net is not working in indonesia the worker salary is not expended on health education while gas transport are heavily subsidized and food is very cheap and affordable the opposite is the case here perhaps the reason why organised labour is calling for tax exemption on the proposed new wages in order not to put further pressure on it and thereby making the increase irrelevant the leadership of the nigeria labour congress nlc at its just concluded nlc 12th quadrennial delegate conference raised fresh concerns over the proposed national minimum wage saying there was need for an amendment of the income tax laws to cushion the effect of devaluation that might hit the n30 000 in a petition submitted by the national union of textile garment and tailoring workers of nigeria nutgtwn at the plenary session of the conference in abuja which saw the re election of comrade ayuba wabba as president the union noted that there was a twin assault on the real income of nigerian workers caused by unrestrained devaluation of naira and high rate of inflation general secretary nutgtwn issa aremu said that it was important to put pressure on the federal inland revenue service firs to raise the tax bar in such a way that n30 000 minimum wage would fall below taxable income in the same vein the labour leader made case for tax holidays for some categories of nigerian workers he said now that we have raised the minimum wage to n30 000 we must impress it on the firs to raise tax bar so that the new minimum wage will be protected if you tax minimum wage of n30 000 we may as well go back to n25 000 or n27 000 by default deputy speaker of the house of representatives yusuf sulaiman lasun raised the point and i think labour must push the agenda to protect the new minimum wage the n30 000 monthly income is actually a compromised amount from n56 000 earlier proposed so it must be protected if the federal government can give 10 year tax holiday to companies why not give the same to workers given the collapse of income today nigerian workers deserve tax holidays aremu a gubernatorial candidate of the labour party in kwara state said workers are not asking for this because we consider our job as charitable what workers have in their pocket is what will turn the economy around that is what we will use to purchase goods in the market and pay rent according to him for economic recovery to gain traction it is good for workers to have sustainable purchasing power or disposable income that is off the tax hook arguing in line with aremu s position general secretary of nlc peter ozo eson also expressed that the income tax law should be amended to protect workers purchasing power he reasoned that given that the n30 000 labour agreed as a compromised minimum wage is so low ideally it should not be taxed but i believe that the correct way to do it is to amend the income tax law in order to raise the exemption bar if n30 000 will fall within the law should be amended to ensure that the minimum wage level is below the taxable income under the present law if you earn n18 000 a month your tax is zero there is a tax table but with n30 000 under the existing exemption guideline there will be some little tax because it will be slightly above the exemption tax what needs to be done is to have an adjustment to the schedule so that the exemption is placed above the minimum wage consequently the nlc at the conference has called on the government to exempt the expected new minimum wage from taxation arguements in favour of tax exemptionmembers of the organised private sector ops who are the employers in the private sector likewise shared the view that there is a strong case to be made in favour of the exemption of those earning minimum wage from taxation the director general of the lagos chamber of commerce and industry lcci mr muda yusuf said the revenue realised by government by taxing workers in the category is inconsequential such revenue is actually not significant whereas the welfare effect of not taxing them can be quite insubstantial besides such an exemption is in line with the key objectives and principles of taxation which is to redistribute income he said yusuf added that taxation is all about creating an environment which allows the rich to support the poor stating that this same principle could be extended to micro enterprises in the economy such category of business owners should also enjoy tax exemption he stated according to him a minimum wage of thirty thousand naira n30 000 is really not too much to be paid to the lowest staff of an organisation whether in the public and private sector taking into account the cost of living in the nigerian economy he said let us take a scenario of a family man that has to pay school fees for his children provide feeding for the family pay for health care pay for transportation pay house rent and possibly even support some dependants a monthly income of n30 000 certainly cannot cover these basic responsibilities it is therefore even worse when we talk about n18 000 minimum wage however the challenge with many of the state governments is that they have a workforce that is very unwieldy and not sustainable there is also the problem of too many political appointees on the payroll of many of the state governments these appointees are paid huge sum in terms of remuneration the third issue creating sustainability problem is leakages and corruption therefore for the n30 000 to be sustainable some hard choices have to be made and there should be better discipline in the management of government finances speaking in the same vein the director general of nigeria employers consultative association neca mr timothy olawale who led other members of ops to the tripartite committee on the minimum wage and equally stoutly stood behind the organised labour at the hearing s in the lower chamber in the defense of the n30 000 as against n27 000 submitted by the federal government said anything below n30 000 will be inappropriate he said that employers have the responsibility of taking care of their employees before they can increase productivity stating that employers who are not paying good salary are not making life meaningful for their workers he stated we all know the value and worth of money in the present economy the question we should ask ourselves is how far will the n30 000 go in taking care of a worker and his or her entire family by the time a worker go to and fro from his her working place everyday that n30 000 will substantially have gone don t forget that there are also other basic needs like shelter feeding medicals education for the children so when you benchmark all those with the said amount it can t go far and i want to say personally that anything below that is criminal the federal government has presented n27 000 recommended by the council of state in the new minimum wage bill presented to the national assembly against the n30 000 resolution of the tripartite committee at the public hearing organised by the house of representatives on the bill two of the three bodies that formed the tripartite committee the organised labour and the organised private sector agreed on n30 000 while the fg and governors forum insisted on n27 000 the neca director general explained that members of the ops supported labour on the issue of new minimum wage because it came out as a result of process in which they were actively involved we are actively part of the discussion decision and we agreed and believed in the discussion of the tripartite committee with every sense of responsibility and with the fact that we believe in corporate responsibility he said though the minister of labour and employment senator chris ngige said the constitution of the committee which he said was in consonance with the provisions of the international labour organisation ilo convention on nos 26 99 and 131 was only to recommend other members of the committee believed that governnent has no right to change the figure the president of the nlc comrade ayuba wabba said it was out of place and procedure for the figure to be reduced to n27 000 going by the convention of the international labour organisation the figure that was agreed by the tripartite committee cannot be changed by any of the parties except through a process government as an employer cannot unilaterally change the figure he insisted minimum wage living wagelast year nigeria was declared as world poverty capital by the brooking institute with the number of nigerians in extreme poverty increasing by six every minute new data gathered for the world employment and social outlook trends 2019 weso also show that a majority of the 3 3 billion people employed globally in 2018 had inadequate economic security material well being and equality of opportunity the report published by the ilo cites the persistence of a number of major deficits in decent work warning that at the current rate of progress attaining the goal of decent work for all as set out in the sustainable development goals sdgs particularly sdg 8 seems unrealistic for many countries sdg 8 is not just about full employment but the quality of that employment deborah greenfield ilo deputy director general for policy said equality and decent work are two of the pillars underpinning sustainable development being in employment does not always guarantee a decent living said damian grimshaw ilo director of research for instance a full 700 million people are living in extreme or moderate poverty despite having employment in nigeria workers in the country are presently considered among the poorest in the world by their present earning the nlc boss said with the falling value of the naira workers were forced to insist that the minimum wage must be upwardly reviewed wabba said when we signed the 18 000 minimum wage it was equivalent to 150 today 18 000 is less than 50 the association of senior civil servants of nigeria ascsn also submitted that nigeria has become the poorest country in the world it regretted that nigerian workers are the least paid in africa despite enormous petroleum resources that have continued to be siphoned into private pockets by the political elites for instance nigeria national minimum wage stands at 50 per month while that of libya is 325 algeria 155 chad 110 morocco 310 south africa 232 seychelles 304 etc list of minimum wages by countries of the world1 nigeria 50 n18 000 2 algeria 175 n83 000 3 belgium 1 738 n810 000 4 cameroon 36 270cfa 75 n38 000 5 chad 120 n60 000 6 denmark 1 820 n900 000 7 libya 430 n190 000 8 japan 1000 n450 000 9 cote d ivoire 36 607cfa 72 10 new zealand 3 187 n1 4m 11 luxemburg 2 500 n1 1m 12 spain 760 n300 000 13 switzerland 5 620 n2 5m 14 usa 11 per hour the union posited that former presidents ex military heads of state and governors who receive millions of naira monthly are pained that nigerian workers want to receive n30 000 monthly which amounts to n1 000 per day how can a worker live on n1 000 per day let alone fend for his or her spouse four children and dependants by insisting on n27 000 as a minimum wage for states and private sector employees the members of the national council of state have shown how insensitive and heartless they are the union said it lamentef that instead of approving a living wage for workers the presidency is hiding under the national council of state to subvert n30 000 monthly national minimum wage recommended by the tripartite committee after extensive consultations and deliberations including touring of the six geo political zones of the country before it arrived at that figure indeed by recommending two parallel minimum wage one for federal workers and the other for state governments and private sector employees members of the national council of state made up of former presidents and ex military heads of state as well as state governors have given the impression before the international community that their knowledge of the global concept of a national minimum wage in a country is suspect it is this type of decision that continues to make nigeria a laughing stock before the comity of nations the union lamented according to the ascsn the international labour organisation convention 131 of 1970 stressed that the purpose of a national minimum wage is to protect workers against unduly low pay and help to ensure a just and equitable share of progress to all and a minimum living wage to all who are employed and in need of such protection while passing the bill at the lower chamber yakubu dogara speaker of the house of representatives says n30 000 as national minimum wage is not enough to sustain nigerian families the speaker said a living wage is aptly appropriate for nigerian workers rather than a national minimum wage because of the country s harsh economic reality dogara noted that there were obvious reasons why the house had to give accelerated consideration to the very crucial bill he said it is a bill that is long overdue as the current national minimum wage which was fixed in 2011 has become unrealistic due to supervening developments in the nation let me assure the nigerian workers that the national assembly is aware of and shares in your pains patience and sacrifices as regards the issue of the national minimum wage majority of our members are on your side he said while we are not oblivious of the current economic downturn and the dwindling revenue of government we cannot also be blind to the fact that all economic indices indicate that even the n30 000 minimum wage that labour is asking for is not enough to sustain a small family unit the nation may not have enough to satisfy the minimum demands of the nigerian worker but as a nation we need to set our economic priorities right and ensure that we dignify our worker s by making allowance for their minimum comfort i know of no alternative if we hope to up the productivity level of our workforce the speaker said since underemployment and unemployment were poverty strange bedfellows eliminating them must be the focal point of government s policies he identified corruption as a major factor that continued to fundamentally undermine democratic institutions and values how then do we fight corruption from the roots rather than dealing with its symptoms as is currently the case the answer is for us to begin to pay workers living wage not minimum wage ability to payat the hearing the finance minister tried to defend government noting that total cost of the salaries paid from january to

a number of leading us progressives who may well be in power after the 2020 elections advocate using the fed s balance sheet as a cash cow to fund expansive new social programs especially in view of current low inflation and interest rates prominent supporters of this idea which is often referred to as modern monetary theory or mmt include one of the democratic party s brightest new stars congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez although their arguments have a grain of truth they also rest on some fundamental misconceptions just as the us federal reserve seems to have beaten back blistering tweets from president trump the next battle for central bank independence is already unfolding and this one could potentially destabilize the entire global financial system advertisement fed chair jerome powell could barely contain himself when asked to comment on this new progressive dogma the idea that deficits don t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency i think is just wrong powell insisted in us senate testimony last month he added that us debt is already very high relative to gdp and worse still is rising significantly faster than it should powell is absolutely right about the deficit idea which is just nuts the united states is lucky that it can issue debt in dollars but the printing press is not a panacea if investors become more reluctant to hold a country s debt they probably will not be too thrilled about holding its currency either if that country tries to dump a lot of it on the market inflation will result even moving to a centrally planned economy perhaps the goal for some mmt supporters would not solve this problem on powell s second point that us debt is already high and rising too fast there is far more room for debate true debt cannot rise faster than gdp forever but it may do so for quite a while today s long term inflation adjusted interest rates in the us are about half their 2010 level far below what markets were predicting back then and far below fed and international monetary fund forecasts at the same time inflation has also been lower for longer than virtually any economic model would have predicted given current robust us growth and very low unemployment advertisement what s more despite being at the epicenter of the global financial crisis the us dollar has become increasingly dominant in global trade and finance for the moment the world is quite content to absorb more dollar debt at remarkably low interest rates how to exploit this increased us borrowing capacity is ultimately a political decision that said it would be folly to assume that current favorable conditions will last forever or to ignore the real risks faced by countries with high and rising debt these include potentially more difficult risk return trade offs in using fiscal policy to fight a financial crisis respond to a large scale natural disaster or pandemic or mobilize for a physical conflict or cyberwar as a great deal of empirical evidence has shown nothing weighs on a country s long term trend growth like being financially hamstrung in a crisis the right approach to balancing risk and reward is for the government to extend the maturity structure of its debt borrowing long term instead of short term this helps to stabilize debt service costs if interest rates rise and if things get really difficult it is far easier to inflate down the value of captive long term debt provided it is not indexed to prices than it is to inflate away short term debt which the government constantly has to refinance advertisement true policy makers could again resort to financial repression and force citizens to hold government debt at below market interest rates as an alternative way of reducing the debt burden but this is a better option for japan where most debt is held domestically than for the united states which depends heavily on foreign buyers having the fed issue short term liabilities in order to buy long term government debt turns policy 180 degrees in the wrong direction because it shortens the maturity of us government debt that is held privately or by foreign governments contrary to widespread opinion the us central bank is not an independent financial entity the government owns it lock stock and barrel unfortunately the fed itself is responsible for a good deal of the confusion surrounding the use of its balance sheet in the years following the 2008 financial crisis the fed engaged in massive quantitative easing whereby it bought up very long term government debt in exchange for bank reserves and tried to convince the american public that this magically stimulated the economy qe when it consists simply of buying government bonds is smoke and mirrors the fed s parent company the us treasury department could have accomplished much the same thing by issuing one week debt and the fed would not have needed to intervene advertisement perhaps all the nonsense about mmt will fade but that s what people said about extreme versions of supply side economics during ronald reagan s 1980 us presidential campaign misguided ideas may yet drag the issue of us central bank independence to center stage with unpredictable and potentially serious consequences for those bored with the steady employment growth and low inflation of the past decade things could soon become more exciting kenneth rogoff a former chief economist of the international monetary fund is professor of economics and public policy at harvard university copyright 2019 by project syndicate www

home news trump s tax bill has the stock market reached the high water mark for the trump era last week the s p 500 stock index fell 5 9 the week s losses wiped out the year to date gains in the market stocks started 2018 on a tear following the enactment in december of the trump tax cuts there was a sharp rise in the market in january this was followed by a blip in february brought on by concerns that inflation and interest rates might be rising too quickly strong employment data quickly restored confidence that the economy was on the right path and stock prices resumed their rise until last week get our latest news for free subscribe to get daily weekly email with the top stories plus special offers from the christian post be the first to know subscribe as the tag line for a disaster recovery firm says it s like tax cuts never even happened pundits like to have an explanation for everything and this week there are explanations everywhere here are a few candidates high level personnel changes in the white house the latest rumors and activities in the never ending but going nowhere mueller probe of alleged russian trump collusion a new chairman at the fed a quarter point rise in short term interest rates announcements by the trump administration of new tariffs on goods from china announcements by china of new tariffs on goods from the usa and finally the passage and signing of a massive new deficit spending bill depending on your own confirmation biases any one of these could be the explanation you are seeking for the market s behavior for me the explanation is the passage and signing of the deficit spending budget bill milton friedman the great 20th century economist said i heartily agree with this and if my hunch is correct many market participants agree with this analysis too i believe they saw the passage and signing of the spending bill last friday as the reversal of the trump tax cuts of last december even worse they realized that the republicans threw away whatever remained of their reputation as the fiscally sound party sure president trump tried to deflect blame for the spending excesses on the democrats who were celebrating their wins but it was the republicans who passed the bill and the president who signed it they own it and they will have to defend it at the midterms i think that is the reason the stock market fell 5 9 last week and why i think the worst is not over what is objectionable in the deficit spending budget just enacted simply put spending that is out of control there is no mechanism to reign in government spending who is willing to stand up and say that trillion dollar deficits in the ninth year of an expansion is simply economic lunacy there is no economic discipline in congress and the hoped for stable cleaning by president trump did not happen perhaps i am wrong perhaps the markets were spooked not by trillion dollar deficits but instead they reacted to president trump s tariffs and a possible trade war this would be a serious problem if it were allowed to get out of hand but if president trump really wants to reduce trade deficits he needs to reduce budget deficits it is a little known and even less understood fact that budget deficits and trade deficits are tightly linked when the government borrows a trillion dollars where does the money come from from savers of course but the us savings rate is not high enough to finance the government deficit and to finance new economic investments something has to give investment in business development gets crowded out in economic jargon deficits starve companies of investor s savings and put their plans for expansions on the back burner unless that is unless foreign savers are willing to make up the shortfall which they have been willing to do especially since the bank of japan and the european central bank have been even more forceful than the fed in suppressing interest rates the us is the best house in a bad neighborhood when it comes to buying government bonds foreigners who sold us imports we paid for with us dollars have dollars to spend but they are not buying us made goods or services instead they are buying us government bonds to finance the debt or us companies securities to finance business development hence a large budget deficit crowds out us export goods and services the result is a large trade deficit one way to reduce the trade deficit is to reduce the budget deficit but the spending bill president trump just signed will work to increase the trade deficit just the opposite of his stated objectives but perhaps both of these explanations are wrong perhaps the real culprit in last week s market swoon was the fed action to raise interest rates with a promise to raise rates another quarter point three more times this year certainly that would change the valuation algorithms and reduce prices but the move was well signaled by the fed so there was no surprise in the fed statements or in any of the remarks by new fed chairman jerome powell it is still a good candidate for the explanation as to what caused prices to fall if this is the real explanation for the market reaction last week then we should see markets get back on their feet quickly since the new level of interest rates is now factored into price valuations we can only hope this is the explanation i suspect not so what you might be asking what should we be doing well about your 401 k or your savings now might be a good time to be more conservative with your investments sell any shares in companies that you don t want to be owning for a long time raise cash for possible opportunities down the road evaluate your personal budget are you living within your means make changes to your personal spending to prepare for the future adjust your giving to give even more it s a great way to celebrate your blessings and despite the chaos around us we are blessed dr gordon boronow is a professor at nyack

turkey s economy fell into its first recession in a decade official data showed on monday just weeks before president recep tayyip erdogan s government faces local elections when growth and inflation will be key issues for voters economic output contracted by 2 4 percent in the final three months of the year compared to the third quarter on a seasonally and calendar adjusted basis the turkish statistics institute tuik said that followed a contraction in the third quarter two consecutive quarter on quarter contractions in economic output is widely considered to be the definition of a recession the flagging economy coupled with a currency crisis last year that battered the lira are sensitive issues for erdogan and his ruling justice and development party akp before the municipal vote on march 31 the turkish leader in power since 2003 first as prime minister and then as president has often boasted of the country s strong growth during his time in government erdogan is frequently credited for the economic turnaround after the 2001 financial crisis and the far reaching reforms spearheaded by a former economy minister after turkey sought credit from the international monetary fund growth came in at 2 6 percent for 2018 overall but that was still much lower than the 7 4 percent recorded in 2017 a turbulent period following the 2016 failed coup and terror attacks the economy shrank by 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the same period the previous year inflation still high inflation has also remained high it struck a 15 year peak in october at 25 24 percent before falling below 20 percent in february with food prices hit particularly hard erdogan s government has sought to curb consumer prices especially for produce consumed everyday in turkish households turkish authorities last month set up their own vegetable stands in a bid to force markets to lower food prices but analysts said economic data showed inflation was still weighing on household consumption and domestic demand was weak before the local elections erdogan is trying to keep food prices in check but after the elections food inflation will probably rise further nora neuteboom economist at abn amro told afp turkish finance minister berat albayrak who is also erdogan s son in law said on twitter the data was as expected but the worst is behind us that analysis was shared to some extent by the london based capital economics research firm but they offer cold comfort for turkey s economic outlook while the worst of the downturn may now have passed the weak carryover means that we expect gdp to decline by 2 5 percent this year said jason tuvey senior emerging markets economist at capital economics albayrak blamed the recession on speculative attacks and the current global economic slowdown subdued growth neuteboom said abn amro expected the turkish economy to contract in the first three quarters of 2019 before showing positive growth in the last quarter but we cannot really say that the worst is behind us as turkey enters a long period of subdued economic growth she said the last time turkey entered a recession was in 2009 after the global economic crisis hit foreign and domestic demand neuteboom said it will take a rather long time for turkey to get back to trend growth turkey s economy was hit hard when us president donald trump doubled tariffs last year on turkish steel and aluminium during a bitter row over a detained american pastor the lira plummeted in value in august reaching a record of 7 against the dollar the turkish currency lost nearly 30 percent against the us dollar in 2018 despite rallying especially after the pastor s release in october while an aggressive interest rate hike in september helped brake its fall economic activity stalled while prices of goods shot higher
last week in is capital creation beating capital consumption we asked an important question which is not asked nearly often enough perhaps that s because few even acknowledge that capital is being consumed and fewer tie it to the falling interest rate perhaps that is because the fact of the falling interest rate is itself controversial at any rate we showed a graph of marginal productivity of debt click to enlarge we said that this shows that the consumption of capital is winning the race and promised to introduce another new concept to explain why money has a dual nature money or even an irredeemable currency has a dual nature in this article we will do something we have never done before except where specifically said otherwise we will treat money and currency the same and when we say money in this article we also mean that the same applies to the dollar too we assume that readers are familiar with the income side of the duality one earns x one can spend up to x dollars the purchasing power paradigm is based on this side of money s nature it even goes so far to think of all assets in terms of their liquidation value and hence purchasing power the reason is simple if the central bank has a mandate to devalue then one would be a fool to hold a significant money balance for a long period of time there is an expression that fits this idea perfectly you put your money into something it could be stocks real estate crude oil bitcoin etc whatever you expect will go up in purchasing power we get comments all the time asserting that the point of owning gold is that it will go up you guessed it in terms of purchasing power whether one is earning or whether one is spending this is the income side of money everyone knows the income side as they know the sun rises in the east and as they know about gravity related facebook labeled digital gangsters by uk politicians on the other side of the duality money is a capital good or to be more precise money is readily exchangeable for any capital good and money is the measure of all capital goods when one earns money one receives income one may spend that income though it is prudent to save some of it the moment that the money is deposited or otherwise saved it flips to the other side of the duality it is not now your income but your capital we have written about consuming your capital of eating your seed corn that is not our focus today instead we want to look at the parallel between diminishing marginal productivity of debt and rising capital asset prices the former says you have to borrow more and more dollars to add one dollar to gdp the latter says that it takes more and more dollars to buy a capital asset that generates one dollar of income money is a capital asset whether it is a borrowed dollar or an owned dollar whether it is a money balance in a bank or bond or whether it is a farm or factory or hamburger restaurant one needs more and more dollars to generate a dollar of revenues or profits why would this be what would have to be occurring to drive the price of a dollar of revenue up revenue generating capital assets are becoming scarcer it fits either way you look at it if you buy a capital asset you have to pay more to get it or if you sell you get a higher price and the yield generated on a constant dollar value capital asset is less clearly something is dissipating the evil genius of keynes the scarcer capital assets become the higher their prices let s something john maynard keynes said in the general theory of employment interest and money if i am right in supposing it to be comparatively easy to make capital goods so abundant that the marginal efficiency of capital is zero this may be the most sensible way of gradually getting rid of many of the objectionable features of capitalism for a little reflection will show what enormous social changes would result from a gradual disappearance of a rate of return on accumulated wealth a man would still be free to accumulate his earned income with a view to spending it at a later date but his accumulation would not grow he would simply be in the position of pope s father who when he retired from business carried a chest of guineas with him to his villa at twickenham and met his household expenses from it as required let s get one thing out of the way first keynes was wrong also take note of keynes explicit discussion of spending capital accumulating capital in his backwards book is one of the objectionable feature of capitalism however consuming capital is declared to be good keynes is right there with the prehistorical peoples and animals subsistence is the preferred way of life now let s tackle the meat of his claim it may be easy as keynes said for the government to make the rate of return on capital fall to zero but of course government has no power to make anything abundant if it could then venezuela would be the richest country in the world although perhaps it would lag behind cuba north korea and zimbabwe more cargo cult thinking the government may not have the power to create capital goods or cargo out of thin air however it does have power it can destroy it cannot will anything into existence but it can shove a gun in the face of a producer to make him stop or to take away his means of producing which is the same thing many economists write about how the government taxes and regulates and how it sets price caps and price floors we write mostly about how it manipulates the producer by more subtle means the interest rate related u s political discourse could boost safe haven demand for gold the falling interest rate is the same thing as the rising asset price the government can perversely incentivize you to consume by raising the liquidation price of capital assets notice that liquidation reverses what we described above when you earned a dollar and set it aside it became capital now when you liquidate a capital asset it turns back into income to be spent which the government incentivizes by driving up asset prices i e driving down yields some propagandists call this the wealth effect keynes got it exactly backward government has not made capital assets abundant it has perversely incentivized everyone to consume them and as they become scarcer their price rises we see this in the falling marginal productivity of debt that is the economic growth created by an additional dollar of capital supply and demand fundamentals the weekly closing prices of the metals were up 5 and 11 but this does not tell the full story of the trading action the price was dropping until friday more precisely friday 8am in new york or 1pm in london at that moment a light cabal conspiring to jack the price struck traders began buying the end result was the prices especially of silver rose on the day and the week and it happened at the end of a weak with stock market selling interesting and a week where the junk treasury spread widened and treasury yields fell and even the bulls favorite commodity to tout copper dropped a bit last week we quipped that this is how the system is supposed by our central planners to work more borrowing of more dollars to buy all assets including other currencies well this week the magic wasn t working anyways let s look at the only true picture of the supply and demand fundamentals of gold and silver but first here is the chart of the prices of gold and silver click to enlarge next this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio see here for an explanation of bid and offer prices for the ratio it was down a bit this week click to enlarge here is the gold graph showing gold basis cobasis and the price of the dollar in terms of gold price click to enlarge the price of the dollar is down inverse of the price of gold in dollars which is up and we see a rising scarcity i e cobasis at least in the april contract the gold basis continuous is basically flat this makes sense the price is not moving much either and it means that there is not some kind of magical demand for phyz coming out of nowhere the monetary metals gold fundamental price made another new high up now to 1 437 now let s look at silver click to enlarge silver shows the rise in price and rise in scarcity including of the silver basis continuous here is a graph of the silver price and basis intraday on friday click to enlarge the big price move was about 25 there is a basis move upward along with it but the basis move is muted for a price move of this size the basis had been humming along around 5bps to 10bps after the price jumped basis is 15bps to 20bps and it s interesting that before the price moves the basis drops to around 10bps that was a surge of buying of physical metal about 30 minutes later the price begins rising then it s another 30 minutes before the basis begins rising which means that futures buyers are beginning to react it s about 90 minutes before the basis returns to its starting point but by then the price of silver is 15 28 compared to 15 10 previously this zoom in to the details confirms why our calculated fundamental price rose on friday it will be interesting to see if there is follow through buying of metal the monetary metals silver fundamental price is down another 6 cents to 16 10 though it was down more and then rising the second half of the week by keith weiner more top reads from safehaven com

central banks hint at policy shift amid weaker growth signals mixed news for gcc private sector activity kuwait the strong start to the year in financial markets extended into february with global equities rallying further despite continued signs of slowing growth in major economies including the us europe and china the rise partly reflects a rebound after december s heavy sell off but also optimism on an end to the us china trade dispute after the us agreed to postpone tariff hikes scheduled for march signaling that a deal was inching closer there was also growing confidence that policymakers are moving to support growth with central banks in the us and europe adopting less hawkish stances and china announcing fresh stimulus measures and in positive news for the gulf region oil prices have hit three month highs boosted by signs that opec is delivering on output cuts agreed last december us growth slows the first estimate of 4q18 gdp delayed by a month due to the government shutdown showed growth at an annualized 2 6 percent slightly above the consensus of 2 2 percent but nevertheless slower than the 3 4 percent recorded in q3 consumer spending worth around 70 percent of the economy grew a solid 2 8 percent though slower than in q3 while net exports remained a drag on growth due to export softness the figures meant that growth in 2018 overall reached 2 9 percent up from 2 2 percent in 2017 but slightly below the 3 percent targeted by president trump despite a large fiscal stimulus earlier in the year as this stimulus continues to fade and the lagged impact of earlier interest rate hikes feeds through growth is seen slowing further going into 2019 nowcasts by both the atlanta and new york federal reserve banks point to growth of below 1 percent in 1q19 indeed as data releases begin to return to normal following delays due to the shutdown evidence of moderating growth has continued to build retail sales growth dropped to a more than two year low in december as households rebuilt savings while personal incomes in january fell month on month for the first time since late 2015 the housing market also continues to suffer with home prices rising more slowly in december 4 2 percent a six year low and existing home sales down 8 5 percent y y in january consumer confidence bounced back in february following the end of the shutdown but remains well below its peak of last year still with the labor market in decent shape unemployment at 4 percent and wage growth above 3 percent any downturn in consumer spending seems unlikely to be severe away from the household sector business activity is also decelerating though from levels that pointed to overheating through much of last year the downturn is most pronounced in manufacturing often considered a lead indicator of overall economic health amid softer global growth and concerns over the us china trade dispute the ism manufacturing index for example hit a more than two year low of 54 2 in february and signaled that cost pressures are easing service sector growth is also trending lower though the surprisingly robust ism non manufacturing index score of 59 7 in february points to a gentler pace of deceleration than in industry optimism in both sectors would be boosted by a us china trade deal signs of a slowdown together with tame inflationary pressures appear to vindicate the fed s recent decision to pause further monetary tightening as well as holding off from hiking the federal funds interest rate above its current 2 25 2 50 percent range it now plans to end its quantitative tightening or balance sheet reduction program sometime later this year sooner than previously expected more details of the plan are expected to be announced following the fed s meeting on 19 20th march with markets likely to pay close attention to complex questions over the targeted end size and structural composition of the fed s holdings once it has finished running down its balance sheet the central bank may still look for example to continue to reduce its 1 6 trillion holdings of mortgage backed debt thereby implying greater purchases of us treasuries eurozone manufacturing concerns over growth in the eurozone persist also with particular worry over the region s important manufacturing sector which is exposed to the global slowdown and heightened trade tensions february s eurozone composite pmi score of 51 9 points to economic growth of around 0 2 percent q q in 1q19 unchanged from q4 though did at least edge up for the first time in six months suggesting a degree of economic stabilization the manufacturing component fell to below 50 signaling contraction with new orders declining by their most in six years and the closely watched german ifo index points to a steep decline in business investment ahead however the relative strength of both the services sector and the labor market unemployment remained at a decade low of 7 8 percent in january provide some grounds for optimism that the region will avoid a recession having ended its asset purchase stimulus program in december and signaled possible rate hikes in 2h19 the european central bank like the fed appears to be shifting in a more dovish direction its growth forecasts for the region are expected to be revised down at its march meeting and it looks likely to discuss restarting its program of offering cheap long term loans to banks tltros to support credit growth also important is the persistent weakness in inflation core inflation fell back to 1 0 percent y y in february well below the ecb s below but close to 2 percent target just weeks ahead of its scheduled exit from the eu the uk has yet to agree the terms of its departure prime minister theresa may is seeking improved terms with the eu following the overwhelming rejection of her negotiated deal by parliament in january but the chances of securing satisfactory changes to the contentious backstop component currently look slim assuming that any new deal is again voted down parliament looks likely to press for an extension to the uk s exit date this would have to be agreed by the eu and is complicated by the uk s uncertain participation in the eu parliamentary elections in may it is also unclear what any extension would achieve brexit uncertainty is not helping the uk economy with the pmi index showing growth in the dominant services sector at 51 3 in february consistent with near stagnation in 1q19 japanese exports japan s external sector continues to face headwinds exports registered their largest decline at 8 4 percent y y in over two years in january mainly on the back of weaker chinese demand imports also fell by 0 8 percent y y reflecting continued softness in domestic demand retail sales and industrial production growth also remained subdued during the same period at 0 6 percent y y and 0 0 percent respectively with core inflation which excludes food costs holding steady at 0 8 percent y y in january far below the central bank s target of 2 percent and economic activity remaining weak this further reaffirms the bank of japan s ultra loose monetary policy stance china lowers growth target in a bid to prop up its slowing economy amid weaker external demand and the ongoing trade dispute with the us china has vowed to cut taxes and fees boost infrastructure investment and up its lending efforts to small firms during its annual congress meeting the government announced that it is penciling in a slower growth target range of 6 0 6 5 percent versus reported growth of 6 6 percent in 2018 indeed factory activity continues to struggle to eke out gains according to the official pmi factory activity was at it is weakest in three years in february and fell for the third consecutive month meanwhile consumer price inflation continued to decelerate slowing from 1 9 percent y y in december to 1 7 percent in january while producer price inflation slowed to a multi year low of just 0 1 percent paving the way for further government policy stimulus brent crude oil continued its early year rally last month closing february up 7 percent m m at 66 bbl following a 15 percent rise in january the rise has been driven primarily but not exclusively by the efforts of opec and its vienna agreement partners to drain excess supplies from the market by the end of 1h19 opec 11 compliance hit 85 percent in january thanks to saudi arabia and kuwait who quickly pared back production to within quota levels oil s rise prompted us president trump to tweet that prices were getting too high and that opec should relax and take it easy the imposition of us sanctions on venezuela in january the impending expiry of the 180 day us sanctions waivers on iran in may and crude rationing in canada due to pipeline bottlenecks also supported prices as has the seemingly improving prospects of a us china trade deal mixed news for gcc business it was a mixed bag for gcc private sector activity in february while the saudi non oil economy continued to gain traction with the pmi rising to a 14 month high of 56 6 on stronger domestic business the uae pmi retreated to a more than

and subsidiaries supplemental information the impact of foreign exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict the company uses a constant currency basis to show the impact from foreign exchange rates on current period financial information compared to prior period financial information using the prior period s foreign exchange rates in order to properly understand the underlying business trends and performance of the company s ongoing operations management believes that investors may find it useful to consider the impact of excluding changes in foreign exchange rates from the company s net operating revenue earnings from operations and net earnings loss attributable to century casinos inc shareholders constant currency results are calculated by dividing the current quarter or year to date local currency segment results excluding the local currency impact of foreign currency gains and losses by the prior year s average exchange rate for the quarter or year to date and comparing them to actual u s dollar results for the prior quarter or year to date the average exchange rates for the current and prior year are reported in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii item 8 financial statements and supplementary data of the company s annual report on form 10 k the average exchange rates for the three months ended december 31 2018 and

loss on disposition of fixed assets discontinued operations gain loss on foreign currency transactions cost recovery income and other gain on business combination and certain other one time items such

the presentation of net earnings loss and adjusted ebitda reported for each segment not all of the aforementioned items occur in each reporting period but have been included in the definition based on historical activity these adjustments have no effect on the consolidated results as reported under gaap adjusted ebitda is not considered a measure of performance recognized under gaap management believes that adjusted ebitda is a valuable measure of the relative performance of the company and its properties the gaming industry commonly uses adjusted ebitda as a method of arriving at the economic value of a casino operation management uses adjusted ebitda to compare the relative operating performance of separate operating units by eliminating the above mentioned items associated with the varying levels of capital expenditures for infrastructure required to generate revenue and the often high cost of acquiring existing operations adjusted ebitda is used by the company s lending institution to gauge operating performance the company s computation of adjusted ebitda may be different from and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies within the gaming industry please see the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net earnings loss attributable to century casinos inc shareholders above the company defines adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted

pushing back against such tendencies a central aim of a wpp would be to nurture positive learning that creates a public more receptive to pluralist cosmopolitanism this requires strategies for shaping the economic and social conditions that support individual and collective learning and improving the skills and knowledge required for effective participation in the learning process educating the public about global affairs is essential for developing a collective democratic culture and deeper engagement in the global public realm much of our thinking is unconscious which further complicates learning processes thinking is based on prototypes framings and metaphors that are seldom explicit this background is the source of common sense views of how we connect and interact and what our expectations are of one another and outsiders underlying normative ideas and images generate manifold stories about who we are where we come from and where we are heading a problem for a global political party is that compared to the rich poetics of national myths and narratives cosmopolitan prototypes metaphors framings and stories remain rather thin a promising way to counter parochial ideologies is to situate the contemporary problematique within a macro view of cosmological biological and social evolution this big history approach both expands our understanding of where we are and visions of where we want to go a sweeping narrative can motivate transformative and progressive politics in the twenty first century 7 the point of departure of big history is that our common human capacities have emerged from the evolution of life itself an emergent layer of cosmological unfolding a sweeping framework puts into context and underscores the import of the anthropocene the new geological age defined by the human impact on the whole earth big history encourages narratives and values with a sense of global belonging the earth as our common home in the cosmos this broad panorama suggests a new slogan think cosmically act globally diem25 a seed crystal can we see rumblings of a wpp today perhaps future historians will look back to many precursors now in play one promising contemporary initiative is the democracy in europe movement 2025 diem25 established in early 2016 in the aftermath of the euro crisis diem25 has assumed many of the characteristics of a wpp as such it offers an invaluable testbed for cultivating transnational ethical and political consciousness deploying new technologies to enable widespread participation overcoming legal obstacles to a supranational political party and transcending identity political fragmentation following the 2015 defeat of the greek left wing party syriza in its struggle against the troika the international monetary fund european central bank and eu commission greek minister of finance yanis varoufakis resigned subsequent political meetings in france and germany convinced him of the need to band together regardless of nationality and transcend the divide between debtor and creditor countries the solution was clear a new pan european political movement to prevent a descent into a post modern 1930s 8 to advance this aim diem25 s strategy is to convene a constitutional assembly that would reflect a genuine european democracy it intends to have a draft constitution prepared by 2025 that if adopted would replace all existing european treaties beyond this process the movement strives to overcome austerity and harmful competition in europe with concrete policy proposals including the dedication of 500 billion euros per year to green investment and industrial conversion a european anti poverty plan a universal basic income financed by a public percentage of companies profits and a common and humane migration policy 9 rather than adhering to a single political ideology diem25 is resolutely pluralistic aiming to attract a broad spectrum of progressives whether leftists social democrats greens or liberals participants are united in their dissatisfaction with europe s economic and political establishment and in their advocacy for a government by the people of europe in contrast to the authoritarian nationalistic populisms on the rise throughout europe diem25 exemplifies a form of democratic transnational populism its concept of we is a pan european demos that transcends national identity diem25 s inclusionary transnationalism manifests in the common front it is building for political activism but the movement enacts transnationalism in another sense its commitment to helping the most vulnerable people in the global political economy especially refugees 10 as stated in its manifesto diem25 aspires to an open europe that is alive to ideas people and inspiration from all over the world recognizing fences and borders as signs of weakness spreading insecurity in the name of security 11 the movement thus offers a clear alternative to fortress europe not surprisingly given diem25 s expansive political philosophy its participants are not exclusively european joining many well known european intellectuals are visible international figures such as julian assange and noam chomsky the members of the coordinating collective that organizes and integrates diem25 s actions have wide international experience including in the peace movement the icc campaign occupy and the world social forum diem25 has some 100 000 members mostly in europe but from other continents as well along with eight national collectives and a hundred ad hoc collectives around the world although more a movement than a political party for now it will be presenting a list for the 2019 european parliament elections dubbing the effort the european spring this first progressive transnational list ever includes both candidates directly chosen by diem25 and candidates nominated by diem25 to appear on the slates of conventional parties this selection process as with all diem25 s work relies on modern it technology to facilitate discussion among dispersed members in parallel with in person meetings and events across europe in spite of such mobilization diem25 has yet to become a high profile actor in european politics its membership and budget remain small compared to those of the major national political parties and the mainstream media largely ignores its activities and positions even after years of decline germany s christian democratic union for instance commands a budget of tens of millions of euros per year while diem25 s is less than a half million given its limited resources diem25 s near term electoral success will likely be modest at best nevertheless as it evolves and grows it could become a model or beyond a seed germinating future world political parties where we are while we live longer and value life more highly than ever the world as a whole faces decades of unprecedented problems the global economic crisis of 2008 2009 and the subsequent euro crisis are only one indication of how the fates of different countries and regions have become more and more intertwined the conditions of everyday activities of all people are directly or indirectly affected by how the world economy works or does not work the next global crisis will have far reaching consequences the challenge then how to reach the teacher textile worker and janitor to name a few with the vision and message to convey how a wpp can serve their needs and interests perhaps the most serious immediate threat concerns the danger of global war and especially nuclear war both the escalation of the conflict between russia and the west and the confrontations in the south china sea show that questions of global political economy and security have still not been answered on a sustainable footing similarly climate change is a key part of a new geological era the anthropocene in which human action is transforming the composition and processes of the biosphere the expansion of human society has led among other things to the mass destruction of habitats species and whole ecosystems this devolution continues at an accelerating pace carrying threats to global civilization the concept of world risk society helps situate our task 12 the current epoch in this conceptualization is the second phase of modernization in which actors and movements begin to respond to the problems generated by the consequences of the first phase the primary feature of this new phase is the emergence of a common world with no outside and no exit societal risks demand that we acknowledge the real dangers and threats we confront at the same time these risks contain a collective condition and power that creates new ethical political and technological opportunities for shaping futures to sustain us and new modernities to dream by as humankind is thrilled by scientific discoveries of new planets with the possibility of extraterrestrial life we become increasingly aware of the peril our technological civilization poses for the future of life right here on earth human curiosity about our place in the cosmos and the awareness of the great ethical political choices before us demand a new phase of collective learning and promotion of practices and institutions matched to our common challenge our ability to secure a sustainable global future depends on a fundamental shift from the currently dominant national mythos to a global imaginary the mechanisms and processes of collective learning through institutional change differ from those of individual growth collective learning and institutional change require politically capable transformative actors practical and political problems can be overcome by building better common institutions the world political party envisaged in this essay embraces this grand task 13 as wells proclaimed almost a century ago way ahead of his time the alternative before man now is either magnificence of spirit and magnificence of achievement or disaster the choice could not be clearer today the future we want is one that removes constraints on human well being and enables human flourishing navigating history towards collective self determination on this planet and one day perhaps beyond it will take bold transformative practice in our troubled world the need for global transformative agency is greater than ever the future is not yet settled and the path there depends on the choices we make our expectations become a feedback loop in the making of the future pessimists argue that a series of limited scale crises or wars or a full global catastrophe must erupt before a significant force can coalesce for rational peaceful and democratic transformations of global governance however likely that view we cannot stand passively by until crises explode before working for social transformation if and when a window of opportunity opens the capacity for such action must already have been established the time has come then to devote our efforts to building a world party as an overarching organizational expression of global citizens power references colin crouch post democracy cambridge polity 2004 for

rttnews the major u s index futures are pointing to a mixed opening on monday following the pullback seen by the major averages last week a steep drop by shares of boeing ba is likely to weigh on the dow as the aerospace giant is plunging by more than 10 percent in pre market trading boeing is under pressure following the crash of ethiopian airlines flight 302 which is the second crash in five months involving the company s 737 max 8 model meanwhile the broader nasdaq and s p 500 may move to the upside following the release of a report from the commerce department showing an unexpected uptick in u s retail sales in january after an initial move to the downside stocks staged a few recovery attempts over the course of the trading session on friday the major averages rallied going into the close of trading but still ended the day modestly lower the dow edged down 22 99 points or 0 1 percent to 25 450 24 the nasdaq dipped 13 32 points or 0 2 percent to 7 408 14 and the s p 500 slipped 5 86 points or 0 2 percent to 2 743 07 with the drop the major averages extended the pullback seen over the past few sessions for the week the dow and the s p 500 both slumped by 2 2 percent while the tech heavy nasdaq tumbled by 2 5 percent the initial weakness on wall street came after a report from the labor department revealed job growth nearly ground to a halt in february after soaring in january the labor department said non farm payroll employment edged up by 20 000 jobs in february after jumping by an upwardly revised 311 000 jobs in january economists had expected employment to increase by about 180 000 jobs compared to the spike of 304 000 jobs originally reported for the previous month the much weaker than expected job growth in february represented the worst month since the loss of 18 000 jobs in september of 2017 when employment was impacted by hurricanes harvey and irma however ftn financial chief economist chris low said the stark contrast between the january and february data suggests a seasonal adjustment breakdown rather than a change in economic performance the three month average 186k is respectable and far more realistic than either the 311k rise in january or the 20k rise in february low said the report also showed the unemployment rate dropped to 3 8 percent in february from 4 0 percent in january while the annual rate of wage growth accelerated to 3 4 percent from 3 1 percent the jobs data largely overshadowed a separate report from the commerce department showing a substantial rebound in housing starts in january the report said

illinois gov j b pritzker has proposed a fair tax plan he claims would cut taxes for 97 percent of illinoisans but his proposed tax rates would raise only 1 4 billion less than half of the 3 4 billion the governor has projected the tax hike would bring in or the 3 3 billion required to close the current structural deficit and even pritzker s revenue overestimate is far short of the 14 billion to 19 billion required to meet the governor s spending promises if pritzker is serious about his proposed spending these initial tax rates would have to be increased across the board with the typical middle income family seeing a tax hike of up to 3 500 pritzker called his first budget proposal a bridge budget claiming it was austere compared with the spending he would like to propose 1 pritzker confirmed his spending priorities from the campaign trail by proposing new spending for education social services and public safety 2 according to pritzker s budget speech and accompanying budget documents he won t be able to spend as much as he would like to without revenue from a progressive income tax hike 3 raising enough revenue to meet the governor s spending priorities while maintaining the same level of progressivity as his proposed rate schedule would require higher rates for everyone see appendix a for a detailed cost estimate of pritzker s spending proposals even after accounting for other sources of new revenue from tax and fee hikes in his fiscal year 2020 proposed budget pritzker would need to raise between 14 3 billion and 19 4 billion4 from a progressive tax hike to fully implement his promised spending in fiscal year 2022 the first full fiscal year for which a progressive income tax could generate revenue 5 under the tax rates necessary to raise this amount of revenue the typical illinois family would pay between 2 425 and 3 508 more in income taxes even closing the structural deficit with a progressive tax hike similar to what pritzker proposed would require hiking taxes on the average middle class family by nearly 270 even if pritzker were to fall short of the full spending promises made during his campaign the governor has made clear he wants to significantly increase spending beyond what current fiscal constraints allow on all levels of education various social services and infrastructure billions of dollars of additional spending cannot be financed with the tax rates currently proposed by pritzker s administration and his proposed constitutional amendment would give middle class taxpayers no guarantees that these tax rates would be adopted much less that they would stay at the same levels in the future in short to the extent that pritzker s first budget proposal is a bridge it is likely to be a bridge to future middle class tax hikes this resembles what happened in the last state to switch to a progressive income tax connecticut initial tax hikes led to persistent budget shortfalls so in an effort to raise more revenue connecticut hiked income tax rates on the average middle income earner by 13 percent not only would a progressive income tax hike end up taking more money directly from all taxpayers pockets but it would also have negative economic effects on jobs growth after tax income adjusted for cost of living and overall economic output economic effects of the progressive tax hike the massive tax hikes resulting from a progressive income tax to fund pritzker s spending promises would wreak havoc on illinois fragile economy economic modeling shows a tax hike of this size could eventually cost the state between 33 3 billion and 43 2 billion in forgone economic activity see appendix b for full methodology not only would the tax hike inflict billions of dollars worth of economic damage but it would cost the state thousands of jobs paying for pritzker s spending promises through his preferred progressive income tax could eventually cost illinois between 208 000 and 286 000 forgone jobs illinois is already lagging the nation on most economic indicators the land of lincoln only added 71 000 new private sector jobs in 2018 among the bottom five states in the nation on that key measure the losses inflicted by a progressive income tax high enough to pay for the governor s promises would wipe out all of these gains many times over this is consistent with what happened in the last state to adopt a progressive income tax in 1996 connecticut became the last state to adopt a progressive income tax and the policy change cost the state s economy more than 10 billion and 360 000 jobs ultimately shrinking the labor force by an estimated 362 000 workers the tax also didn t fix any of the state s budgetary issues connecticut has run state budget deficits in 12 of the past 15 years and is holding more debt per capita than almost any other state the failure of the progressive income tax has left the typical connecticut household with an income tax rate increase of more than 13 percent since 1999 at the same time property tax burdens property taxes as a share of income rose by more than 35 percent the graduated income tax also didn t help to combat income inequality connecticut had the second highest income inequality measured by the gini coefficient of any state in 2017 there were 277 000 unemployed illinoisans in december 2018 and evidence from connecticut reveals that a progressive income tax will only extend unemployment duration and make it difficult for struggling families to make ends meet efficiency losses progressive income taxes are more harmful than flat taxes dollar for dollar progressive income taxes are worse for the economy than flat income taxes if pritzker s goal is to raise revenue while doing the least amount of damage to the economy a flat tax is a more efficient way to raise revenue a flat tax that would raise the governor s desired revenue would inflict less than half the damage that the graduated income tax would u s states provide ample empirical evidence that higher marginal tax rates harm output growth progressive income taxes have a worse effect on the economy because they 1 lower the return on new physical capital investments and 2 deter investment in human capital education and skills that boost individuals productivity and earning potential progressive income taxes also distort the labor supply decision this is because a progressive income tax system leads to lower net income per hour for someone who decides to work more when additional output is rewarded with a lower net wage higher earning workers exert less effort to create additional wealth investments in human and physical capital have large positive effects on economic growth because investment grows the size of available capital this makes workers more productive and raises living standards across the board meanwhile if individuals are taxed at a lower rate while less skilled and at a higher rate when they become more skilled the returns to becoming skilled will be diminished as a result skill accumulation and economic growth will be negatively affected progressive income taxes deter investment more than equivalent flat taxes this is because top earners who have a higher propensity to invest are also more responsive to tax policy changes the decline in new investments negatively affects labor demand that means fewer jobs for everyone and a decline in economic growth because progressive income taxes have such a negative effect on the economy they tend to make everyone worse off even those who may see a tax cut while a progressive income tax may offer some residents a lower tax burden the negative effects of the tax job losses and decreased productivity from a reduction in all forms of investment cause incomes adjusted for the cost of living or real purchasing power to decline this leaves everyone worse off than they would be under a flat tax system that raises just as much tax revenue pritzker s progressive income tax hike is a bad deal for all illinoisans the large negative effects of the tax hike on the economy will lead to a reduction in living standards for everyone even those who may receive a temporary tax cut this is why illinoisans should protect their flat income tax the progressive income tax is a poverty trap the progressive income tax traps individuals at the bottom of the income distribution this could explain why the last state to adopt a progressive income tax connecticut saw large increases in the state s poverty rate when the incidence of poverty was falling in most u s states higher progressivity in the income tax schedule causes a slowdown in aggregate economic activity and a reduction in living standards for everyone including those at the bottom of the income distribution even when large swaths of the population get a tax break disposable income adjusted for the cost of living still falls because of a decrease in production that results in lower aggregate output individuals at the bottom of the income distribution have less incentive to move up the income ladder because additional income is taxed at a higher rate the progressive income tax traps individuals at the bottom of the income distribution why a graduated income tax hike will hurt the economy since the seminal work of diamond and mirrlees 1971 the trade off between equity and efficiency of progressive tax systems has received considerable attention on the one hand progressive taxation is intended to give rise to more equitable allocation of income but it does so at the cost of distorting the labor supply decision by lowering after tax wages higher taxes on labor reduce work incentives also known as the substitution effect at the same time a decrease in income from a tax hike can also induce an increase in market activity also known as the income effect the net effect on labor supply depends on which effect dominates the substitution effect or the income effect graduated income taxes aim to transfer benefits to those at the bottom of the income distribution the result of this policy is a positive income effect for the bottom of the income distribution which leads to a reduction in paid work hours for lower income individuals meanwhile those at the top of the income distribution have less incentive to expend extra effort to earn a greater income or to grow the capital stock research and development purchases of new machinery or other equipment that improves labor productivity this results in less income generation and lower living standards for everyone and demonstrates why marginal tax rates should not increase with earning ability diamond and mirrlees 1971 gruber and saez 2002 this theory is consistent with the bulk of empirical evidence suggesting that higher taxes deter people from actively engaging in the market causing a reduction in investment and output that lowers living standards
despite multiple issues facing the political economy there is a consensus among businessmen and economists alike that pakistan s economic future is very bright that the country s unrealised economic growth potential is huge waiting to be realised by improved governance right policies and deep going reforms the businessmen are however not so optimistic about the short to medium economic outlook to renew business confidence prime minister imran khan and his economic team have been holding intensive consultations with representative of various trade bodies on march 4 khan again invited trade leaders to islamabad for seeking their input on various issues facing the business community and how to push up economic growth he advised them to give practical suggestions to introduce a new amnesty scheme so as to remove flaws in the previous ones says karachi chamber of commerce and industry president junaid ismail makda the participants suggested that tax cases being pursued by the federal board of revenue and notices issued by national accountability to businessmen should be withdrawn the government has underperformed as an enabler for the private sector it is still trying to grapple with issues like electricity and gas supplies to sezs the prime minister informed the meeting that the government was working on a comprehensive plan to encourage non taxpayers and informal sectors to join the documented economy the domestic private sector has been complaining of harassment of tax authorities and corruption investigating agencies that is stated to be shattering business confidence their view has also found some support in the judiciary who will make investment in the country if businessmen face harassment remarked justice farrukh imran khan of lahore high court while ordering removal of the name of shahzad saleem ceo nishat chunian power from the exit control list by all means take swift action against those guilty says businessman shabir ahmed but dragging businessmen through the slime of accusation on the flimsiest grounds he argues is neither fair nor just it merely makes businessmen question if it is worth their while to invest and create jobs they look for other options ahmed points out that the multiplicity of taxes and collectors over regulation and the excruciatingly long response time taken by government agencies have led that to speed money becoming the currency of business the latest american business council s abc perception survey carried out in current fiscal year shows that 100pc of respondents indicated optimism about economic environment for the long term but for the short to medium term the perceptions differed 80pc of the respondents felt there was no change in the ease of doing business since the pti led government assumed office abc president jamal mir says the country s 200 million people are mired in debt with deep seated and dire economic political and social issues thus change will take time and there is no quick fix he acknowledges that the government is trying to delve deeper and solve problems in an effort to bring about lasting change according to a similar survey carried out by overseas investors chamber of commerce and industry oicci in december 2018 the overall business confidence plunged to negative 12pc compared to the positive ranking of 14pc held in may more marked downward trend was witnessed in services sector particularly in wholesale and retail sectors the perceptions of oicci members representing multinationals may have been influenced by declining repatriation of earnings in terms of dollars when their devalued rupee earnings were converted into greenback thus return on investments made by parent companies shrank the repatriation of profits and dividends fell by 33pc to 918 million during first seven months of this fiscal year from 1 34 billion in the corresponding period of last fiscal year according to central bank data simultaneously the outflow of dividends from foreign portfolio investment fell to 142m from 170m the government has under performed as an enabler and facilitator for private sector development it is still trying to grapple with issues like electricity and gas supplies to special economic zones sezs under cpec for example the economic coordination committee of the cabinet has now decided that the cost of provision of gas and electricity to sezs will be financed under the federal public sector development programme psdp however the space for investment and business is being squeezed by cuts in the psdp in the first six months of the current fiscal year it was down by 37pc to rs328bn from rs520bn a year ago policy issues are also affecting investment outlook finance minister asad umar is reported to have told a foreign investment advocacy body that the government is interested in attracting foreign direct investment in export or and import substitution projects but not in consumer items sector the trade related investment policy to reduce trade and current account deficit is yet to be announced meanwhile fdi continues to decline some development economists stress that there is a need to discipline both the private sector as well as the state if their governance and performance have to be improved the interactions between the two sides do produce some short term positive outcome but they fall short of long term

published monday 11 march 2019 print disqus this is a pair of photographs taken by keith weiner for a high school project it seemed a fitting picture for the dual nature of money the dual nature of wood both as logs to be consumed and dimensional lumber to be used to construct buildings last week in is capital creation beating capital consumption we asked an important question which is not asked nearly often enough perhaps that s because few even acknowledge that capital is being consumed and fewer tie it to the falling interest rate perhaps that is because the fact of the falling interest rate is itself controversial at any rate we showed a graph of marginal productivity of debt we said that this shows that consumption of capital is winning the race and promised to introduce another new concept to explain why money has a dual nature money or even an irredeemable currency has a dual nature in this article we will do something we have never done before except where specifically said otherwise we will treat money and currency the same and when we say money in this article we also mean that the same applies to the dollar too we assume that readers are familiar with the income side of the duality one earns x one can spend up to x dollars the purchasing power paradigm is based on this side of money s nature it even goes so far to think of all assets in terms of their liquidation value and hence purchasing power the reason is simple if the central bank has a mandate to devalue then one would be a fool to hold a significant money balance for a long period of time there is an expression that fits this idea perfectly you put your money into something it could be stocks real estate crude oil bitcoin etc whatever you expect will go up in purchasing power we get comments all the time asserting that the point of owning gold is that it will go up you guessed it in terms of purchasing power whether one is earning or whether one is spending this is the income side of money everyone knows the income side as they know the sun rises in the east and as they know about gravity on the other side of the duality money is a capital good or to be more precise money is readily exchangeable for any capital good and money is the measure of all capital goods when one earns money one receives income one may spend that income though it is prudent to save some of it the moment that the money is deposited or otherwise saved it flips to the other side of the duality it is not now your income but your capital we have written about consuming your capital of eating your seed corn that is not our focus today instead we want to look at the parallel between diminishing marginal productivity of debt and rising capital asset prices the former says you have to borrow more and more dollars to add one dollar to gdp the latter says that it takes more and more dollars to buy a capital asset that generates one dollar of income money is a capital asset whether it is a borrowed dollar or an owned dollar whether it is a money balance in a bank or bond or whether it is a farm or factory or hamburger restaurant one needs more and more dollars to generate a dollar of revenues or profits why would this be what would have to be occurring to drive the price of a dollar of revenue up revenue generating capital assets are becoming scarcer it fits either way you look at it if you buy a capital asset you have to pay more to get it or if you sell you get a higher price and the yield generated on a constant dollar value capital asset is less clearly something is dissipating the evil genius of keynes the scarcer capital assets become the higher their prices let s consider something john maynard keynes said in the general theory of employment interest and money if i am right in supposing it to be comparatively easy to make capital goods so abundant that the marginal efficiency of capital is zero this may be the most sensible way of gradually getting rid of many of the objectionable features of capitalism for a little reflection will show what enormous social changes would result from a gradual disappearance of a rate of return on accumulated wealth a man would still be free to accumulate his earned income with a view to spending it at a later date but his accumulation would not grow he would simply be in the position of pope s father who when he retired from business carried a chest of guineas with him to his villa at twickenham and met his household expenses from it as required let s get one thing out of the way first keynes was wrong also take note of keynes explicit discussion of spending capital accumulating capital in his backwards book is one of the objectionable feature of capitalism however consuming capital is declared to be good keynes is right there with the prehistorical peoples and animals subsistence is the preferred way of life now let s tackle the meat of his claim it may be easy as keynes said for the government to make the rate of return on capital fall to zero but of course government has no power to make anything abundant if it could then venezuela would be the richest country in the world although perhaps it would lag behind cuba north korea and zimbabwe more cargo cult thinking the government may not have the power to create capital goods or cargo out of thin air however it does have power it can destroy it cannot will anything into existence but it can shove a gun in the face of a producer to make him stop or to take away his means of producing which is the same thing many economists write about how the government taxes and regulates and how it sets price caps and price floors we write mostly about how it manipulates the producer by more subtle means the interest rate the falling interest rate is the same thing as the rising asset price the government can perversely incentivize you to consume by raising the liquidation price of capital assets notice that liquidation reverses what we described above when you earned a dollar and set it aside it became capital now when you liquidate a capital asset it turns back into income to be spent which the government incentivizes by driving up asset prices i e driving down yields some propagandists call this the wealth effect keynes got it exactly backward government has not made capital assets abundant it has perversely incentivized everyone to consume them and as they become scarcer their price rises we see this in the falling marginal productivity of debt that is the economic growth created by an additional dollar of capital supply and demand fundamentals the weekly closing prices of the metals were up 5 and 11 but this does not tell the full story of the trading action the price was dropping until friday more precisely friday 8am in new york or 1pm in london at that moment a light cabal conspiring to jack the price struck traders began buying the end result was the prices especially of silver rose on the day and the week and it happened at the end of a weak with stock market selling interesting and a week where the junk treasury spread widened and treasury yields fell and even the bulls favorite commodity to tout copper dropped a bit last week we quipped that this is how the system is supposed by our central planners to work more borrowing of more dollars to buy all assets including other currencies well this week the magic wasn t working anyways let s look at the only true picture of the supply and demand fundamentals of gold and silver but first here is the chart of the prices of gold and silver next this is a graph of the gold price measured in silver otherwise known as the gold to silver ratio see here for an explanation of bid and offer prices for the ratio it was down a bit this week here is the gold graph showing gold basis cobasis and the price of the dollar in terms of gold price the price of the dollar is down inverse of the price of gold in dollars which is up and we see a rising scarcity i e cobasis at least in the april contract the gold basis continuous is basically flat this makes sense the price is not moving much either and it means that there is not some kind of magical demand for phyz coming out of nowhere the monetary metals gold fundamental price made another new high up now to 1 437 now let s look at silver silver shows the rise in price and rise in scarcity including of the silver basis continuous here is a graph of the silver price and basis intraday on friday the big price move was about 25 there is a basis move upward along with it but the basis move is muted for a price move of this size the basis had been humming along around 5bps to 10bps after the price jumped basis is 15bps to 20bps and it s interesting that before the price moves the basis drops to around 10bps that was a surge of buying of physical metal about 30 minutes later the price begins rising then it s another 30 minutes before the basis begins rising which means that futures buyers are beginning to react it s about 90 minutes before the basis returns to its starting point but by then the price of silver is 15 28 compared to 15 10 previously this zoom in to the details confirms why our calculated fundamental price rose on friday it will be interesting to see if there is follow through buying of metal the monetary metals silver fundamental price is down another 6 cents to 16 10 though it was down more and then rising the second half of the week 2019 monetary metals digg this article published monday 11 march 2019 e mail print source

exchange rates on current period financial information compared to prior period financial information using the prior period s foreign exchange rates in order to properly understand the underlying business trends and performance of the company s ongoing operations management believes that investors may find it useful to consider the impact of excluding changes in foreign exchange rates from the company s net operating revenue earnings from operations and net earnings loss attributable to century casinos inc shareholders constant currency results are calculated by dividing the current quarter or year to date local currency segment results excluding the local currency impact of foreign currency gains and losses by the prior year s average exchange rate for the quarter or year to date and

the presentation of net earnings loss and adjusted ebitda reported for each segment not all of the aforementioned items occur in each reporting period but have been included in the definition based on historical activity these adjustments have no effect on the consolidated results as reported under gaap adjusted ebitda is not considered a measure of performance recognized under gaap management believes that adjusted ebitda is a valuable measure of the relative performance of the company and its properties the gaming industry commonly uses adjusted ebitda as a method of arriving at the economic value of a casino operation management uses adjusted ebitda to compare the relative operating performance of separate operating units by eliminating the above mentioned items associated with the varying levels of capital expenditures for infrastructure required to generate revenue and the often high cost of acquiring existing operations adjusted ebitda is used by the company s lending institution to gauge operating performance the company s computation of adjusted ebitda may be different from and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies within the gaming industry please see the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net earnings loss attributable to century casinos inc shareholders above the company defines adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted

exchange rates on current period financial information compared to prior period financial information using the prior period s foreign exchange rates in order to properly understand the underlying

company s net operating revenue earnings from operations and net earnings loss attributable to century casinos inc shareholders constant currency results are calculated by dividing the current quarter or year to date local currency segment results excluding the local currency impact of foreign currency gains and losses by the prior year s average exchange rate for the quarter or year to date and

historical activity these adjustments have no effect on the consolidated results as reported under gaap adjusted ebitda is not considered a measure of performance recognized under gaap management believes that adjusted ebitda is a valuable measure of the relative performance of the company and its properties the gaming industry commonly uses adjusted ebitda as a method of arriving at the economic value of a casino operation management uses adjusted ebitda to compare the relative operating performance of separate operating units by eliminating the above mentioned items associated with the varying levels of capital expenditures for infrastructure required to generate revenue and the often high cost of acquiring existing operations adjusted ebitda is used by the company s lending institution to gauge operating performance the company s computation of adjusted ebitda may be different from and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies within the gaming industry please see the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net earnings loss attributable to century casinos inc shareholders above the company defines adjusted ebitda margin as adjusted

there is a reason investors investing in startups are called angels the capital and the support that they empower startups with is a form of trust in the ability of the founders which can go a long way for the ecosystem hence angel taxes of a country are one of the most significant factors that attract investment in that country s startup ecosystem read more why tech needs its own mythology now more than ever the indian government recently found itself in the eye of a storm when over 2 000 startups which had raised capital since 2013 started receiving notices for angel tax according to quartz market valuations of most of these startups had decreased after the initial round of fundraising feeling unfairly taxed startups and concerned organizations took up the issue on twitter which steadily caught on until the government eased up angel tax norms for some of them angel investors are not just wealthy entities hungry for profits they are also smart about their money qualified to advise startups about management and contacts and often do provide on the job assistance such characteristics separate them from regular investors and they can be of great help in building job markets knowledge economies and overall economic strength read more how gender lens investing is becoming a roaring business trend the angel tax policy of a country can encourage or discourage investors from backing entrepreneurs so what is this angel tax and how does it impact the startup ecosystem of a country what is an angel tax angel tax is the income tax that has to be paid on the capital that unlisted companies raise by issuing shares where the share price is seen in excess of the fair market value of the shares sold this excess amount is treated as income and hence taxed confused let s try again a startup is legally responsible to pay angel tax when it gathers an equity infusion in excess of its fair valuation still iffy let s look at an example let s assume a startup raises capital from five investors at 1 000 each that means it has raised 5 000 however the startup s fair value in the market does not exceed 2 000 that means the startup exceeds the fair value by 3 000 since this amount is income above the fair value of the startup it will be taxed this tax is the angel tax better for those who are new to this fair valuation of a company is the sale price agreed upon by a willing buyer and seller assuming both parties enter the transaction freely and knowledgeably 30 angel tax is the most common amount charged in countries around the world the regulations differ from ecosystem to ecosystem which in turn determines the health of that very ecosystem why call them angels calling an investor an angel began when patrons of broadway theater in the 1920s were called so since they came to the financial rescue of theatrical productions on the verge of shutdown the term made a reappearance when in 1978 william wetzel a professor at the university of new hampshire and founder of its center for venture research conducted a study on how american entrepreneurs raised seed capital borrowing the term from broadway wetzel described private individuals supporting entrepreneurs in need of capital as angels the name stuck around the practice of charging angel tax came into being as a means of curbing money laundering and funding of fake or shell startups angel tax incentives around the world it goes without saying that business angel activity tends to get interesting wherever there are tax incentives eastern european countries are driving a strategy of economic development through a competitive tax policy seeking foreign investment in their countries that is why their taxes are the lowest in europe particularly for individual tax rates in western european countries the general corporate rate on income lies between 25 and 30 only belgium france germany luxembourg depending on municipality tax rate italy including the regional rate and spain have tax on income equal to or above 30 ireland has one of the lowest tax rates with a corporate tax on income of 12 5 for trading income startups hubs of europe namely belgium france ireland italy germany luxemburg portugal and the uk tend to receive support from their governments in the form of government guarantees reductions on tax rates or tax credits hence these countries have fiscal incentives specifically available for venture capital private equity and startup angels china s preferential tax policies for startups and individual angel investors has been expanded since 2017 according to which 70 of the total investment can be deducted from taxation two years after the investment for high tech startups to motivate more individuals towards choosing entrepreneurship singapore s tax exemption scheme for newly registered startups has been in place since 2005 qualified startups can enjoy up to around 150 000 tax exemption on its first three consecutive years of assessment yas that means an eligible startup can get a full tax exemption on its first 75 000 chargeable income and also a 50 tax exemption on the next 150 000 normal chargeable income in 2015 the australian government announced au 100 million around us 70 46 million angel investor tax incentives which meant a 20 tax offset on investment capped at au 200 000 around us 140 000 per investor including a 10 year capital gains tax exemption the incentives came into effect in 2016 gaps in the system strong economies like the us have been built on angel investment which is why its significance is immense it is no wonder that public policy makers around the world have started paying attention to it by studying and implementing tax incentives it is directly related to the supply of early stage venture capital in an economy however designing angel tax policies can be challenging and many initiatives often miss the mark a study conducted on angel tax by two scholars from the center for interuniversity research and analysis on organization cirano found that the most popular angel tax incentives such as upfront credit capital gains deduction and loss deductions can have drawbacks while analyzing the main programs devoted to business angels in the us europe asia and canada the study found that policy makers around the world have not considered this risk the study observes that while initiatives in angel tax incentive policy making are supposed to target business angels most are kept open to all informal investors without considering whether they will even provide advice and guidance to startups also often initiatives do not focus on quality high growth entities which are the catalysts for job creation and economic growth effects for example the minnesota angel tax credit can be applied online by foreigners and qualified investors don t have to be accredited such gaps will ensure that the programs will attract numerous unqualified investors who are just seeking tax relief allowing such investors to enter the ecosystem will then increase the stock s valuation decreasing the expected returns of business angels the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd says that just giving lucrative incentives to high net worth individuals does not necessarily produce angel investors while it might bring about an increase in the number of financial investors it might not increase entities that provide expertise and contacts apart from money which might well be the difference between just an investor and an angel investor for a startup ecosystem to become and remain healthy long term planning with deeper thought can feed angel tax policies better hasty decisions can allow quality of investors to suffer to that effect well regulated and thoughtful angel tax rebates can truly give entrepreneurs the wings the need to soar high
if the drastic measure of central bank intervention was acceptable for developed countries there is no reason why it shouldn t be appropriate for a developing country such as sri lanka where the economic problems are far greater while this column has recommended an expansion in budget deficit the question arises how would the expanded deficit be financed it would be interesting to note the strategies adopted internationally during times of economic challenges the famous quantitative easing of the developed world during the global financial crisis in 2008 2009 the developed world resorted to what is called quantitative easing to prevent a total economic collapse and to revive the economies in the usa the federal reserve started buying treasury notes mortgaged backed securities and bank debt in late 2008 the size of the fed s balance sheet expanded beyond 4 000 b by end 2014 when the purchases were halted similarly in uk bank of england purchased government bonds and a smaller amount of high quality debt issued by private companies from 2009 to 2016 the balance sheet of bank of england expanded by well over 350 b a similar program was undertaken in the eurozone as well the european central bank s assets grew beyond 30 of gdp japan was the first to use this strategy way back in 2001 and intensified it further during the global financial crisis while the reasons and the execution would have been slightly different from country to country broadly it was a mechanism used to revive the economies through purchasing of government bonds and other assets by the respective central banks the case for a similar program in sri lanka undoubtedly sri lanka s current economic situation and the challenge that was faced by the developed countries during the global financial crisis is not the same while there is no apparent economic crisis in sri lanka there is no threat of low inflation or deflation however clearly sri lanka s growth at 3 is anaemic and need to be revived in a sustainable manner secondly if the drastic measure of central bank intervention was acceptable for developed countries there is no reason why it shouldn t be appropriate for a developing country such as sri lanka where the economic problems are far greater therefore one could propose the sri lankan central bank to engage in a similar program of purchasing long term government bonds with a tenor of 20 30 years as we propose to expand the government budget by rs 175 200 b p a over the next five years the program could be to purchase long term bonds worth close to rs 10 b per month over the next five years even at the completion of the program the expansion in the central bank s balance sheet would be around 5 of gdp rs 600 b as economic growth could easily reach 6 7 or even more this is significantly less than what was experienced by the developed countries of around 20 30 of gdp only for long term structural development initiatives clearly it is not an inflationary money printing exercise for consumption purposes the expansion of the government budget should be only for structural long term sustainable economic development initiatives therefore this program would only be a catalyst to set sri lanka on a high sustainable growth path once the country is steadily in that path the balance sheet could be reduced gradually i e the central bank holdings in government bonds could be sold in the secondary market for investors and or it could be allowed to mature without rolling over as these would be long term bonds with a tenor over 20 years the country has ample time to reach a stable economic condition by the time the repayments are due also as these would be long term bonds it wouldn t affect the short term interest rates this program is not intended to artificially control market interest rates it is simply a mechanism to fund long term structural changes needed to develop the country which are long overdue in fact if economic growth picks up substantially inflation need not rise as the increase in supply would meet the increase in demand caused by increased money supply although it s likely that inflation could rise at least slightly in the coming years similarly there could be depreciating pressure on the rupee in the coming years although once the structural measures are in place which should significantly reduce the external current account deficit the rupee would stabilise during the course of the five year program should central bank be completely independent as it is relevant to what is proposed one needs to address the topic of central bank s independence logically if a government president comes to power proposing a certain methodology which means the people have approved it there s an obligation for the central bank to facilitate such methodology clearly there should be controls to ensure that it is not exploited but it is essential that central bank actions don t become a hindrance to rational long term development initiatives approved by the people practical plans should identify opportunity costs expanding fiscal deficit increasing inflation or depreciation of the rupee are not the most critical problems faced by sri lanka the most critical problems are the anaemic growth and high external current account deficit therefore the focus should be to address those problems even if the earlier mentioned factors deteriorate slightly in the short term the attempt to improve all factors simultaneously has resulted in little improvement in almost all factors as we have realised in our history any practical plan would identify opportunity costs which are the factors that may deteriorate in the quest to rectify the most critical factors therefore it is time that we come up with practical plans which addresses the burning issues in a sustainable way while accepting some level of deterioration in lesser important factors such factors could be addressed once the more critical problems are addressed to a sufficient extent the writers can be contacted via
turkey s economy fell into its first recession in a decade official data showed on monday just weeks before president recep tayyip erdogan s government faces local elections when growth and inflation will be key issues for voters economic output contracted by 2 4 percent in the final three months of the year compared to the third quarter on a seasonally and calendar adjusted basis the turkish statistics institute tuik said that followed a contraction in the third quarter two consecutive quarter on quarter contractions in economic output is widely considered to be the definition of a recession the flagging economy coupled with a currency crisis last year that battered the lira are sensitive issues for erdogan and his ruling justice and development party akp before the municipal vote on march 31 the turkish leader in power since 2003 first as prime minister and then as president has often boasted of the country s strong growth during his time in government erdogan is frequently credited for the economic turnaround after the 2001 financial crisis and the far reaching reforms spearheaded by a former economy minister after turkey sought credit from the international monetary fund growth came in at 2 6 percent for 2018 overall but that was still much lower than the 7 4 percent recorded in 2017 a turbulent period following the 2016 failed coup and terror attacks the economy shrank by 3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared with the same period the previous year inflation still high inflation has also remained high it struck a 15 year peak in october at 25 24 percent before falling below 20 percent in february with food prices hit particularly hard erdogan s government has sought to curb consumer prices especially for produce consumed everyday in turkish households turkish authorities last month set up their own vegetable stands in a bid to force markets to lower food prices but analysts said economic data showed inflation was still weighing on household consumption and domestic demand was weak before the local elections erdogan is trying to keep food prices in check but after the elections food inflation will probably rise further nora neuteboom economist at abn amro told afp turkish finance minister berat albayrak who is also erdogan s son in law said on twitter the data was as expected but the worst is behind us that analysis was shared to some extent by the london based capital economics research firm but they offer cold comfort for turkey s economic outlook while the worst of the downturn may now have passed the weak carryover means that we expect gdp to decline by 2 5 percent this year said jason tuvey senior emerging markets economist at capital economics albayrak blamed the recession on speculative attacks and the current global economic slowdown subdued growth neuteboom said abn amro expected the turkish economy to contract in the first three quarters of 2019 before showing positive growth in the last quarter but we cannot really say that the worst is behind us as turkey enters a long period of subdued economic growth she said the last time turkey entered a recession was in 2009 after the global economic crisis hit foreign and domestic demand neuteboom said it will take a rather long time for turkey to get back to trend growth turkey s economy was hit hard when u s president donald trump doubled tariffs last year on turkish steel and aluminum during a bitter row over a detained american pastor the lira plummeted in value in august reaching a record of 7 against the dollar the turkish currency lost nearly 30 percent against the u s dollar in 2018 despite rallying especially after the pastor s release in october while an aggressive interest rate hike in september helped brake its fall economic activity stalled while prices of goods shot higher

development by about 24 percent but congress has twice rejected the trump administration s attempts to slash the foreign affairs budget and is likely to do so again trump s 2020 budget proposal seeks 43 billion for the state department and the u s agency for international development that s roughly 726 million more than the administration sought in the 2019 budget but it s at least 13 billion less than what congress approved it s also about 14 billion less than what lawmakers approved for 2018 the cuts in the new spending plan would come largely from sharp reductions in funding to international organizations like the united nations global health and refugee programs and a reorganization of usaid __ 2 30 p m the white house s top budget official is defending the trump administration s economic forecasts acting budget director russell vought briefed reporters monday on president donald trump s 2020 spending blueprint he said gross domestic product grew by 3 1 percent in the 2018

surely you ve noticed it dangerous domestic and global events have become the rule rather than the exception unstable governments are printing worthless money left and right u s gdp growth is on the verge of going negative for the first time in 60 years china s economic deceleration has reached a shocking magnitude apple stock plunged 30 without warning in fact 2020 started as the most volatile year for the s p since the 2009 economic crisis these and more signs have become a wake up call for americans who haven t effectively diversified their retirement portfolios in an effort to protect their assets and legacies many are scrambling for protection from the ravages of dollar devaluation market collapse or any other type of cataclysmic economic occurrence that may result from the current unstable conditions with warning signs suggesting trouble could strike the american economy at any moment many americans are turning to gold iras gold is frequently recommended by top financial advisors for portfolio diversification but given current economic conditions it s more important than ever that every american considers its benefits when planning for the future global tensions an oversold stock market and skyrocketing u s debt are weighing heavily on the global economic condition all this pressure has created the potential for dramatic financial loss at a moment s notice even greater than the more protracted 2008 correction it s always critical to diversify a portfolio but in this difficult financial environment the need has become urgent and many experts are claiming the protections provided by a gold ira could shine as the most brilliant solution goldco the leading gold company in the us is offering free gold ira eligibility checks to jp readers it s never been easier to find out if you qualify for a 100 tax free gold ira transfer 4 reasons to consider gold in 2019 here are just 4 of the largest current threats to the global economy which all point to the viability of a gold ira to diversify your retirement portfolio 1 global tensions and conflicts north korea s disarmament plans have ground to a halt the u s decision to renege on the iranian nuclear deal has tensions high and the recent u s backing of jerusalem as israel s capital has further fanned the growing flames of perceived u s mideast interference another group of foreign diplomats are uneasy about u s support for venezuela s opposition leader juan guaido and today s lower oil prices could become a distant memory if a host of middle east relations do not improve and quickly all of these factors can cause sudden chaos in the stock market but rarely impact gold prices heavily 2 u s national debt it s not only concerning that we ve passed the 22 trillion deficit mark but even more concerning is the fact that the last 1 trillion was added in less than a year for the first time ever 22 trillion is more than the entire u s economy this condition is not only unsustainable there appears to be no planned end in sight erosion of the dollar s value continues as baby boomers continue to file for social security from a fund that s been hemorrhaging for decades china and russia are lobbying and eager to fill a void being created by a continuing decline of the dollar s value 3 banking blunders and bail ins a big part of the 2008 financial meltdown had to do with a bank s misuse of derivatives which in 2018 achieved heights exponentially greater than 2008 levels and for all the complaining about dodd frank the one thing that no one seems to be aware of is actually the most important fact all bank deposits immediately become bank assets in the event of insolvency this means taxpayers are no longer a bank s first line of defense instead that privilege has been quietly dumped onto depositors your checking or savings accounts can now legally and without recourse be commandeered for the bank s own financial needs 4 an oversold stock market top analysts have been warning about the growing possibility of a market crash even greater than the one experienced during the great depression they hurry to point out the suspicious lack of significant corrections during the recent bull market which became the longest in our history last year just one factor in their concerns is the fact that public companies borrowed 1 1 trillion in cheap fed money made available by the fed s notorious quantitative easing program which was earmarked for wage increases infrastructure and expansion then they spent 1 2 trillion on stock buyback programs that inflated stock prices but did virtually nothing beneficial for the company particularly in potential growth or even maintenance these warnings signs have led analysts predict a 70 correction this year in fact the cia s financial threat advisor jim rickards even stated on money morning that he believes a 70 drop is the best case scenario it s never been a better time in history to consider holding physical gold why gold and why now you don t need to be a history buff to realize that gold has been universally accepted as a revered and valuable asset for centuries gold has never been negatively affected by the collapse of any country s fiat currency and can readily be converted to any other currency or asset companies can go bankrupt and stocks can go to zero value but gold has a brilliant history of retaining value especially during turbulent economic times gold has attributes desired by a growing list of new technologies within the computing electronic and medical fields many of these technologies consume or utilize gold thereby generating an even greater demand gold has a history of long term appreciation as well as maintaining or growing in value especially when other traditional financial instruments falter or collapse entirely in addition gold prices skyrocketed after the 2008 collapse meaning those who invest early could be in for the same rewards as those who invested in 2005 and 2006 the ounce price back then was as low as 417 73 today that number has tripled time may be running out a gold ira has proven the ideal choice for many americans who don t want to worry about losing everything due to factors outside their control however those who wish to diversify with a gold ira are smart to act quickly to gain maximum protection and even potential rewards in a worst case scenario a market crash combined with dollar devaluation could quite literally wipe out practically any portfolio without appropriate protection top financial advisors agree that gold is a necessary ingredient for providing appropriate protection for financial portfolios today primarily because it has the ability to respond in opposition to other financial instruments during a crisis what are the specific advantages of a gold ira today not every american with a retirement portfolio knows this but they ought to the taxpayer relief act of 1997 and section 408 of the irs code identifies and permits qualified americans to utilize a specialized self directed ira in order to put a variety of irs approved physical precious metal products into a tax advantage account this means a traditional gold ira allows americans to invest up to age based annual limits on a tax free basis even though a roth gold ira requires taxes to be paid on investment funds up front it also permits unlimited growth without taxation upon distribution in addition to the potential tax advantages mentioned based on the type of gold ira there are more important reasons to include physical precious metals in your retirement portfolio in spite of excitement over the longest bull market in american history since the start of the millennium gold appreciation has outperformed the djia stock market by more than 4 to 1 210 to 51 gold shines brightest during economic and geopolitical uncertainty domestic and global recession and any other type of monetary or market decline gold is wealth insurance because it stores value while acting as a currency hedge and safe haven asset gold mitigates investment risk and puts you in control of your own portfolio security gold is not an iou fiat currency or promissory note gold is a physical asset that can provide peace of mind to those concerned with market and banking operations experts say add gold to your retirement portfolio even the most renowned financial experts in the world rarely agree on the best way to grow a retirement account however those same experts do manage to agree on the need for gold and other precious metals to be held within a retirement portfolio regardless of your investment preference whether it s bonds stocks or real estate as the 2008 economic decline will attest an appropriate percentage of physical gold in a gold ira or retirement portfolio can protect from the negative and dangerous effect of falling values currency devaluations and inflation can also be detrimental to a retirement account but gold holds its own and can even thrive in those conditions how you can get your gold ira americans have three choices when it comes to gold iras 1 you can create an entirely new gold ira account 2 you can transfer and convert your existing ira 3 you can rollover the account if you have funds from a qualified retirement plan such as a self employed pension thrift savings plan 401 k or other qualified plan early

chemicals segment in both the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 and various income tax expense benefit items in both 2017 and 2018 as discussed below the chemicals segment s net sales of 349 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 103 9 million or 23 lower than in the fourth quarter of 2017 the chemicals segment s net sales of 1 7 billion in the full year of 2018 were 67 1 million or 4 lower than in the full year of 2017 the chemicals segment s net sales decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 due to the unfavorable effects of lower average tio 2 selling prices and lower sales volumes the chemicals segment s net sales decreased in the full year of 2018 compared to the full year of 2017 due to the net effect of higher average selling prices and lower sales volumes the chemicals segment s average tio 2 selling prices were 2 lower in the fourth quarter of 2018 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 and were 13 higher in the full year of 2018 as compared to 2017 the chemicals segment s average selling prices at the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 were 4 lower than at the end of the third quarter of 2018 and were 3 lower than at the end of 2017 lower prices in the european latin american and export markets were partially offset by higher prices in north america at the end of 2018 as compared to the end of 2017 tio 2 sales volumes in the fourth quarter of 2018 were 22 lower as compared to the record fourth quarter sales volumes of 2017 primarily due to lower sales in the european and export markets reflecting the effects of reduced shipments as customer inventory levels continued to return to more normal levels partially offset by higher sales in the north american market the sales volumes in the full year of 2018 were 16 lower than the same period in 2017 primarily due to a combination of factors including i lower sales in all major markets resulting from a controlled ramp up in january 2018 as the chemicals segment brought the second phase of its new global enterprise resource planning system online ii inventory management to assure adequate supply to our customers during the spring and summer necessitated by the lower production volumes in the first three months of the year as discussed below iii product availability in the second quarter and iv customer inventory level changes in the second third and fourth quarters as discussed above fluctuations in currency exchange rates primarily the euro decreased net sales by approximately 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and increased net sales by approximately 49 million in the full year of 2018 as compared to the same periods in 2017 the table at the end of this press release shows how each of these items impacted the overall change in net sales the chemicals segment s operating income in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 47 7 million as compared to 123 8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year of 2018 the chemicals segment s operating income was 342 9 million as compared to 358 5 million in 2017 the chemicals segment s operating income decreased in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the 2017 period primarily due to the unfavorable effects of lower average tio 2 selling prices lower sales and production volumes and higher raw materials and other production costs the chemicals segment s operating income decreased in the full year of 2018 compared to the full year of 2017 primarily due to the net impact of higher average tio 2 selling prices lower sales and production volumes and higher raw materials and other production costs the chemicals segment s tio 2 production volumes were 8 lower in the fourth quarter and 7 lower in the full year of 2018 as compared to the same periods in 2017 the chemicals segment s production facilities operated at 95 of average practical capacity utilization rates in 2018 95 97 92 and 95 in the first second third and fourth quarters of 2018 respectively compared to full practical capacity utilization rates for the comparable periods in 2017 the decrease in tio 2 production volumes in the 2018 periods compared to the production volumes in the comparable 2017 periods was primarily due to increased maintenance activities at certain facilities in 2018 and the implementation of a productivity enhancing improvement project at the chemicals segment s belgian facility in the first quarter of 2018 fluctuations in currency exchange rates also affected operating income comparisons which increased segment profit by approximately 7 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and by approximately 33 million in the full year of 2018 as compared to the same periods in 2017 the component products segment s net sales increased 9 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 6 in the full year of 2018 compared to the respective periods of 2017 the component products segment s net sales increased over both the comparable 2017 periods primarily due to higher marine component sales volumes to manufacturers of ski waterboard boats and larger center console boats and to a lesser extent higher security products sales to certain markets particularly transportation and office furniture the component products segment s operating income was comparable in the fourth quarter of 2018 to the fourth quarter of 2017 for the full year of 2018 component products segment s operating income increased primarily due to improved fixed cost leverage facilitated by higher production volumes for both security products and marine components the real estate management and development segment had fourth quarter 2018 sales of 11 9 million including 9 0 million in revenue on sales of land held for development compared to sales of 17 5 million in the fourth

million in revenue on sales of land held for development compared to sales of 38 4 million in the full year of 2017 including 29 9 million in sales of land held for development the real estate management and development segment had operating income in the fourth quarter of 2018 of 2 1 million a decrease of 1 4 million compared to operating income of 3 5 million in the 2017 period consistent with lower land sales revenues due to relative changes in the amount of development activities in the fourth quarter of 2018 the real estate management and development segment had operating income of 10 0 million in the full year of 2018 compared to 6 6 million in the same period of 2017 also due to relative changes in the amount of development activities for the full year of 2018 land sales revenue is generally recognized over time based on costs inputs and land sales revenues are dependent on spending for development activities as we balance development requirements with home builder outputs during the year land sales revenues are also impacted by the relative timing of when new land parcel sales are closed operating income in the full year of 2018 also includes 3 1 million of income in the first quarter related to the recognition of tax increment reimbursement note receivables corporate expenses were 20 higher in the fourth quarter of 2018 compared to the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily due to higher administrative costs and litigation fees and related costs in 2018 offset in part by lower environmental remediation and related costs in 2018 corporate expenses were 22 higher in the full year of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 primarily due to higher administrative costs and litigation fees and related costs somewhat offset by lower environmental

adds details analyst comments updates markets retail sales increase 0 2 percent in january december retail sales drop revised to 1 6 percent core retails rise 1 1 percent december revised down by lucia mutikani washington march 11 reuters u s retail sales rose modestly in january after a december drop that was even larger than originally estimated but the recovery was not seen strong enough to alter the course of a u s economy that was losing momentum in early 2019 the report from the commerce department on monday was welcome news for the economy after a raft of weak december data as well as a sharp moderation in the pace of job growth in february still january s increase in retail sales recouped only a fraction of december s plunge leaving expectations for a slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter intact sales managed only a tepid reversal in january from december s deep freeze said douglas porter chief economist at bmo capital markets in toronto while we expect some further comeback in the next couple months the big story is that the economy s big engine is cooling retail sales rose 0 2 percent as increased purchases of building materials and more discretionary spending offset the biggest decline in motor vehicle sales in five years data for december was revised to show sales tumbling 1 6 percent instead of decreasing 1 2 percent as previously reported the drop in december was the biggest since september 2009 when the economy was emerging from recession economists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales to be unchanged in january sales in january increased 2 3 percent from a year ago the january retail sales report was delayed by a 35 day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on jan 25 february s retail sales report which was scheduled for publication on thursday will be released on april 1 excluding automobiles gasoline building materials and food services retail sales rebounded 1 1 percent in january after a downwardly revised 2 3 percent plunge in december the largest drop since 2000 these so called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product story continues they were previously reported to have decreased 1 7 percent in december consumer spending accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity coming on the heels of a deterioration in the trade deficit in december and weak construction spending the downward revision to the core retail sales suggested gross domestic product growth slowed more than the government initially estimated in the fourth quarter the government reported last month that the economy grew at a 2 6 percent annualized rate in the october december quarter after expanding at a brisk 3 4 percent in the third quarter economists now expect gdp growth will be lowered to a 2 1 percent pace when the government publishes its revision later this month fading fiscal stimulus the weaker december core retail sales also set consumer spending on a weaker growth path in the first three months of the year leading the atlanta federal reserve to cut its january march quarter gdp growth forecast by three tenths of percentage point to a 0 2 percent rate goldman sachs lowered its first quarter growth estimate by four tenths of a percentage point to a 0 5 percent rate consumer spending which increased at a 2 8 percent rate in the fourth quarter is seen rising modestly in the first three months of the year as the stimulus from a 1 5 trillion tax cut package fades in addition 2018 tax refunds have on average been smaller than in the previous years but spending remains supported by strong wage growth and higher consumer confidence the government reported on friday annual wage growth increased 3 4 percent in february the biggest gain since april 2009 from 3 1 percent in january slowing economic growth supports the federal reserve s patient approach toward further interest rate hikes this year fed chairman jerome powell reiterated the u s central bank s stance on sunday in a wide ranging interview with cbs s 60 minutes news show powell said the fed did not feel any hurry to change the level of interest rates again weak first quarter gdp will be another factor that keeps the fed patient at the march meeting and beyond said andrew hollenhorst an economist at citigroup in new york the dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies while u s treasury prices fell stocks on wall street rose after five straight sessions of declines but a sharp drop in boeing co

december 2017 sales at building material stores increased 3 3 percent the most since september 2017 but receipts at auto dealerships tumbled 2 4 percent in january the largest drop since january 2014 after gaining 0 3 percent in the prior month receipts at service stations fell 2 0 percent reflecting cheaper gasoline prices there were also declines in sales at clothing and furniture stores as well as electronics and appliance shops discretionary spending rose in january with sales at restaurants and bars advancing 0 7 percent and purchases at hobby musical instrument and book stores jumping 4 8

u s president donald trump proposes a record 4 7 trillion us federal budget for 2020 relying on optimistic 3 1 per cent economic growth projections alongside accounting shuffles and steep domestic cuts to bring future spending into promised balance in 15 years the deficit is projected to hit 1 1 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year the highest in a decade the administration is counting on robust growth including from the republican tax cuts which trump wants to make permanent to push down the red ink some economists though say the bump from the tax cuts is waning and they project slower growth in coming years the national debt is 22 trillion even with his own projections trump s budget would not come into balance for a decade and a half rather than the traditional hope of balancing in 10 presidential budgets tend to be seen as aspirational blueprints rarely becoming enacted policy and trump s proposal for the new fiscal year that begins oct 1 sets up a showdown with congress over priorities including his push for 8 6 billion to build the u s mexico border wall titled a budget for a better america promises kept taxpayers first trump s proposal embodies fiscal responsibility said russ vought acting director of the office of management and budget despite the large projected deficits vought said the administration has prioritized reining in reckless washington spending and shows we can return to fiscal sanity president trump s fy 2020 budget is available online now pic twitter com akwrnrg1rr usgpo perhaps most notably among spending proposals trump is reviving his border wall fight fresh off the longest government shutdown in history his 2020 plan shows he is eager to confront congress again over the wall the border wall remains a signature issue for the president and is poised to stay at the forefront of his agenda even though congress has resisted giving him more money for it leading democrats immediately rejected the proposal congress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government the same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again said house speaker nancy pelosi of california and senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york they said the money would be better spent on rebuilding america maryland democrat steny hoyer a house rep since 1981 said the budget reflected the administration s separation from reality the trumpbudget reflects the admin s separation from reality it puts our country at risk of a another shutdown by demanding border wall proposes repealing the aca uses gimmicks that make it harder for the military to engage in long term planning leaderhoyer in seeking 8 6 billion for more than 480 kilometres of new border wall the budget request would more than double the 8 1 billion already potentially available to the president for the wall after he declared a national emergency at the border last month in order to circumvent congress although there s no guarantee he ll be able to use that money if he faces a legal challenge as is expected the standoff over the wall led to a 35 day partial government shutdown the longest in u s history senate vote on emergency declaration imminent along with border wall money the proposed budget will also increase funding to increase the manpower of immigration and customs enforcement officers and customs and border patrol at a time when many democrats are calling for cuts of those areas the budget also proposes policy changes to end sanctuary cities the administration said the budget arrives as the senate readies to vote this week to terminate trump s national emergency declaration the democratic led house already did so and a handful of republican senators uneasy over what they see as an overreach of executive power are expected to join senate democrats in following suit congress appears to have enough votes to reject trump s declaration but not enough to overturn a veto republican senators have a very easy vote this week it is about border security and the wall stopping crime drugs etc not constitutionality and precedent it is an 80 positive issue the dems are 100 united as usual on a 20 issue open borders and crime get tough r s realdonaldtrump trump invoked the emergency declaration after congress approved nearly 1 4 billion for border barriers far less than the 5 7 billion he wanted by doing that he can potentially tap an additional 3 6 billion from military accounts and shift it to building the wall that s causing discomfort on capitol hill where even the president s republican allies are protective of their power to decide how to allocate federal dollars lawmakers are trying to guard money that s already been approved for military projects in their states for base housing or other improvements a wall with mexico played a big part in trump s campaign for the white house and it s expected to again be featured in his 2020 re election effort he used to say mexico would pay for it but mexico has refused to do so as trump has reacted with alarm to caravans heading toward the southern border critics have the administration on doing enough to provide aid to the countries that are the primary source of the migrants seeking asylum in the u s migrants walk up a riverbank at the mexico u s border last november after getting past a line of mexican police at the chaparral border crossing in tijuana as they try to reach the u s trump has been alarmed by recent migrant caravans but his administration has continued to propose steep cuts in foreign aid for developing countries ramon espinosa associated press the budget proposal calls for a 23 per cent decrease for the state department and the u s agency for international development usaid the administration proposed steep cuts in aid to latin america and the caribbean in its very first budget ranging from 20 to 40 per cent for most countries but congress rejected the plan keeping funding relatively stable compared to previous years an administration official said trump s budget proposes increasing defence spending to 750 billion and building the new space force as a military branch while reducing non defence accounts by five per cent with cuts recommended to economic safety net programs used by many americans the 2 7 trillion in proposed spending cuts is higher than any administration in history they say the budget includes work requirements for those receiving food stamps and other government aid as part of the 2 7 trillion in non defence cuts over the decade greater opioid resources proposed the plan sticks to budget caps that both parties have routinely broken in recent years to stay within the caps the budget shifts a portion of the defence spending some 165 billion to an overseas contingency fund which some fiscal hawks will view as an accounting gimmick conservatives railed for years against deficits that rose during the first years of barack obama s administration as tax revenue plummeted and spending increased during the great recession by refusing to raise the budget caps trump is signalling a fight ahead the president has resisted big bipartisan budget deals that break the caps threatening to veto one last year but congress will need to find agreement on spending levels to avoid another federal shutdown in the fall the democratic chair of the house budget committee congressman john yarmuth of kentucky called the proposed cuts to essential services dangerous he said trump added nearly 2 trillion to deficits with the republican s tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations and now it appears his budget asks the american people to pay the price the democrat said learn about our proposed 1 billion in grants to spur innovation in the child care sector increase the supply of high quality affordable child care to underserved populations potusbudget ivankatrump while pushing down spending in some areas including the environmental protection agency the proposal will seek to increase funding in others to align with the president s priorities according to one official the administration will invest more than 80 billion for veterans services a nearly 10 per cent increase from current levels including significant investments in rehabilitation employment assistance and suicide prevention it will also increase resources to fight the opioid epidemic with money for prevention treatment research and recovery the administration said and it seeks to shift some federal student loan costs to colleges and universities the proposal will also include 1 billion for a child care fund that would seek to improve access to care for underserved populations a white house official confirmed the one time allocation is championed by the president s daughter ivanka trump who has focused on economic advancement for women in her role as a white house adviser

note this report was originally published on march 11 2019 based on the information in governor j b pritzker s fair tax a tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local state and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services goods and activities for illinois presentation delivered on march 7 2019 the report has been updated to reflect the rates as adopted in public act 101 0008 which will take effect if a constitutional amendment is approved by voters on election day allowing a graduated rate income tax key findings introduction heading into election day the illinois legislature and governor j b pritzker d are trying to convince illinois voters to scrap a key constitutional feature of illinois tax system a provision in the state constitution that prohibits a graduated rate income tax in a state where taxes tend to be high this constitutional provision has been crucial to keeping one tax the individual income tax an individual income tax or personal income tax is levied on the wages salaries investments or other forms of income an individual or household earns the u s imposes a progressive income tax where rates increase with income the federal income tax was established in 1913 with the ratification of the 16th amendment though barely 100 years old individual income taxes are the largest source of tax revenue in the u s highly competitive because there are practical and political limits on just how high a rate can go when it is applied uniformly the constitutional amendment gov pritzker is championing the illinois allow for graduated income tax amendment would change all that and under the rates and brackets that were proactively adopted by the legislature illinois would have some of country s highest income taxes individual and corporate particularly on businesses that s of particular concern in a state that has struggled to stem the tide of business departures as the governor himself has noted but it s only one of many issues raised by the proposal all told the rates adopted in senate bill 687 public act 101 0008 would result in a 10 49 percent combined rate on corporate income and a 9 49 percent rate on about half the state s pass through income including the personal property replacement taxes the state tacks onto rates discussed later it is important to note that the proposed rates and brackets as enacted are separate from the actual constitutional amendment on which illinois residents will vote the amendment which was referred to the november ballot with passage of senate joint resolution constitutional amendment no 1 by a supermajority vote in both chambers in may 2019 simply lifts the constitution s prohibition on a graduated rate income tax leaving this and subsequent legislatures to adopt rates of their choosing as such in the spring of 2019 the illinois general assembly proactively passed and gov pritzker signed s b 687 which establishes the tax rates that would take effect on january 1 2021 should the constitutional amendment be approved by voters this election day under this law the current 4 95 percent flat individual income tax would be transformed into a six rate tax with rates ranging from 4 75 to 7 99 percent a recapture provision means that filers with income in the top bracket will have their entire income not just their marginal income subject to the top rate of 7 99 percent meanwhile the base corporate rate would increase from 7 to 7 99 percent 10 49 percent counting the personal property replacement tax in a misguided and miscalculated effort to match the new top rate on individual income the plan also includes an increase in the value of the property tax a property tax is primarily levied on immovable property like land and buildings as well as on tangible personal property that is movable like vehicles and equipment property taxes are the single largest source of state and local revenue in the u s and help fund schools roads police and other services credit from 5 to 6 percent of the taxes paid on one s primary residence and a new 100 per child tax credit a tax credit is a provision that reduces a taxpayer s final tax bill dollar for dollar a tax credit differs from deductions and exemptions which reduce taxable income rather than the taxpayer s tax bill directly which phases out beginning at 40 000 in income 60 000 for joint filers the following table shows the rates and brackets that would take effect should the constitutional amendment be ratified by voters table 1 illinois individual income tax rates current and proposed current single married 4 95 0 4 95 0 proposed single married 4 75 0 4 75 0 4 90 10 000 4 90 10 000 4 95 100 000 4 95 100 000 7 75 250 000 7 75 250 000

that subjects all taxable income to the 7 99 percent rate removing the benefit to those taxpayers of the lower marginal rates rates shown do not include the additional 1 5 percent personal property replacement tax pprt paid by partnerships s corporations and trusts on the same income base source public act 101 0008 stay informed on the tax policies impacting you subscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox subscribe many things could be said about this proposal but here are twelve points that should be part of any consideration 1 the proposal would create some of the highest rates in the country when illinois lawmakers repealed the state s taxes on tangible personal property forty years ago they paid for the repeal by creating a second set of taxes on both pass through and corporate income confusingly termed personal property replacement taxes pprts the name references the tax they replaced rather than the nature of the taxes themselves which are nothing more than additional income tax levies of 2 5 percent on corporate income and 1 5 percent on the income of partnerships s corporations and trusts with revenue devoted to local government the income of pass through businesses including partnerships and s corporations passes through to their owners individual income tax returns hence the name personal property replacement taxes included the top rate on partnerships s corporations and trusts would be 9 49 percent and the new rate on corporate income would be 10 49 percent this would represent the second highest corporate rate in the country lower than only new jersey whose top corporate income tax rate increased to 11 5 percent effective october 1 2020 but higher than iowa whose top corporate income tax rate will drop from 12 to 9 8 percent effective january 1 2021 it also represents the sixth highest rate on pass through income nationwide after california 13 3 percent hawaii 11 0 percent new jersey 10 75 percent oregon 9 9 percent and minnesota 9 85 percent the 7 99 percent rate on nonbusiness income would be the eighth highest state rate in the country 2 illinois neighbors are making their tax rates more competitive not less if illinois were to raise its rates it would be moving in the opposite direction of its neighbors indiana has reduced its top corporate income tax rate from 8 to 5 25 percent and is on track to bring it down to 4 9 percent by 2022 while its individual income tax rate has gone from a flat 3 4 percent to 3 23 percent over five years policymakers in indiana have consciously positioned themselves as a more competitive alternative to illinois and they aren t alone in missouri a set of bills in 2018 reduced the state s corporate and individual income tax rates the individual income tax rate reduced from 5 9 to 5 4 percent in january 2019 and subject to revenue availability that rate is set to continue phasing down to 5 1 percent similarly the corporate rate was reduced from 6 5 to 4 percent effective january 2020 meanwhile in iowa a package of reforms adopted in 2018 will ultimately bring the top individual income tax rate to 6 5 percent from 8 98 percent and the top corporate income tax rate will drop from 12 percent to 9 8 percent on january 1 2021 in addition kentucky recently replaced its graduated rate individual and corporate income taxes with single rate taxes of 5 percent even in minnesota legislators adopted individual income tax cuts to offset additional revenue from tax conformity in short illinois would be raising its tax rates at a time when its neighbors are headed in the opposite direction 3 these higher taxes would have a significant impact on illinois businesses while 1 million is undoubtedly a lot of money over half of all pass through business income is reported on returns with more than 1 million in business income alone to say nothing of other income sources and almost 72 percent comes from returns of 500 000 or higher under s b 687 taxes would be higher on all income above 250 000 which accounts for the overwhelming majority of net business income from pass throughs in illinois while the internal revenue service does not maintain data using a 250 000 inflection point we know that more than 93 percent of all pass through income is on returns claiming more than 200 000 in pass through income see table below in other words while those paying these higher taxes may be well to do the proposal represents a significant new tax on illinois employers while not all pass through businesses are small businesses it s worth noting that small businesses are responsible for 45 1 percent of illinois employment in a state already suffering from an outmigration of businesses and high earners a tax increase of this size could do real damage table 2 pass through businesses by agi range note in aggregate businesses with less than 25 000 in agi post negative income sources irs statistics of income

sector job growth in 2018 policymakers should be exceedingly careful about adopting policies that make it harder to do business in the state 4 the cost of high rates has never been higher with the new 10 000 cap on the state and local tax salt deduction high earners in high tax states no longer receive a generous federal tax subsidy to offset their state and local tax liability under the old law where state income taxes were deductible on federal returns a rate of 9 49 percent on pass through business income or 7 99 percent on other income would reduce federal tax liability to the point that net amount paid on the marginal dollar of income was really 5 73 or 4 83 percent respectively under the new law high earners no longer have the dubious luxury of enjoying the benefits of a high service state while exporting a significant share of their tax burden to non itemizers or taxpayers in other states that represents good policy but it also means that all illinois taxpayers will feel the brunt of any substantial rate increase with all that entails such high rates could accelerate migration out of illinois which is already a major concern it s a concern in fact that the governor acknowledged in a news conference albeit in an effort to dispute it now there are those who want to scare people by claiming that this proposal will cause residents and businesses to flee illinois said pritzker they couldn t be more wrong they ignore the fact that people and businesses are fleeing our state now under our current regressive tax a regressive tax is one where the average tax burden decreases with income low income taxpayers pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden while middle and high income taxpayers shoulder a relatively small tax burden system yet states with fair tax systems on average grow faster and create more jobs than illinois this is a curious statement individuals and businesses are already fleeing illinois higher taxes aren t going to turn things around especially if the tax increase does nothing to address illinois unpaid bills pension debt or other fiscal challenges 5 business rate parity makes little sense there is no real reason why corporate and individual income tax rates should be aligned absent a much broader structural integration of business entity types since they are not meaningfully comparable while many small businesses pay through the individual income tax because they are organized as pass through entities traditional c corporations are double taxed paying taxes at both the entity level and again at the ownership level so an attempt to keep the corporate rate aligned with the top individual rate only exacerbates an existing disparity the pprt on corporate income moreover is one percentage point higher than the pprt on pass through income leading to a higher combined rate on corporate 10 49 percent than pass through 9 49 percent income under the proposal furthermore under the new law the corporate rate would remain flat albeit at a much higher rate so this does not in fact represent a true attempt to align the rates 6 the new rates include a highly unusual recapture provision tax rates are typically marginal which is to say that they are imposed on marginal income for instance under s b 687 the first 10 000 in taxable income taxable income is the amount of income subject to tax after deductions and exemptions for both individuals and corporations taxable income differs from and is less than gross income would be taxed at a rate of 4 75 percent and someone earning 11 000 would only pay the higher rate of 4 9 percent on the additional 1 000 not the whole 11 000 under s b 687 however once income reaches 750 000 single filers or 1 million joint filers that taxpayer s entire income would be taxed at the proposed 7 99 percent rate in other words the entire benefit of the lower rates on income below 750 000 or 1 million worth 8 465 and 8 965 respectively disappears for filers with income above that threshold and their top marginal rate is converted into a flat rate of 7 99 percent this is highly unusual similar rate recapture provisions exist in only two other states connecticut and new york additionally arkansas has different tax schedules for different income classes such that people with higher incomes still face a graduated rate schedule but a different schedule than one that a middle or low income filer would face under the federal income tax and the income tax rate schedules as they exist in all other states rates are imposed on marginal income with no recapture provision this creates a significant tax cliff where a person making 1 million pays 70 935 in taxes while someone earning one dollar more pays 79 900 a difference of 8 965 on a single dollar of income 7 the proposal creates a significant marriage penalty a marriage penalty exists whenever two earners owe more tax filing jointly than they would if they filed separately the penalty can emerge when any part of the tax code brackets deductions or exemptions does not increase for joint filers but bracket widths under a graduated rate income tax are particularly important many states double their bracket widths for married couples to avoid the penalty but the illinois proposal envisions brackets for joint filers that differ only slightly from those that apply to single filers imagine a two earner household where both partners make 100 000 in taxable income if taxed separately under the proposed rates they would both owe 4 885 for a combined tax bill of 9 770 each having their first 10 000 taxed at 4 75 percent and their next 90 000 at 4 9 percent but as a married couple filing jointly the first dollar of the second earner s income is taxed at 4 95 percent the rate for income above 100 000 they would face a marriage penalty small in their case but much larger as earners get into higher brackets one might be tempted to say that we need not be concerned about a modest marriage penalty on dual income professionals or a higher penalty on wealthier taxpayers but bad policy like this is not easily reversed and there is no guarantee that the rate structure will remain the same forever if a marriage penalty is accepted from the outset it may hit far more families down the road the next time illinois faces a revenue shortfall 8 tax burdens will rise due to bracket creep within a graduated rate structure inflation inflation is when the general price of goods and services increases across the economy reducing the purchasing power of a currency and the value of certain assets the same paycheck covers less goods services and bills it is sometimes referred to as a hidden tax as it leaves taxpayers less well off due to higher costs and bracket creep while increasing the government s spending power can impose a hidden tax increasing the taxpayer s liability as a greater share of their income is taxed even if that income has not increased in real terms since bracket kick in thresholds are fixed to avoid this bracket creep most states with graduated rate structures index bracket widths and other features of the income tax to inflation under the rate structure set forth in s b 687 the marginal income levels are not indexed for inflation meaning that over time taxpayers will pay an increasing amount of taxes as a percentage of income even if their income has not increased in real terms 9 there is no guarantee that rates will not rise in the future the rate structure set forth in public act 101 0008 is only a starting point if voters grant approval for a graduated rate income tax nothing prevents the legislature from adopting higher taxes than those proposed now or a future legislature from raising rates even under a single rate tax rates have risen twice in the past decade from 3 percent to the current 4 95 percent rate and a graduated rate income tax would make future rate increases much easier the governor implicitly acknowledged this when he dismissed the alternative of a 5 95 percent flat tax an income tax is referred to as a flat tax when all taxable income is subject to the same tax rate regardless of income level or assets when most or all taxpayers share in a tax increase there is substantial political pressure to balance revenue needs with tax competitiveness the ability to single out select taxpayers for higher rates which will also fall on many small businesses would make future tax increases easier in a state where lawmakers have already demonstrated a willingness to countenance unusually high rates even higher taxes as high as 11 25 percent on small businesses have been contemplated in illinois in recent years as part of prior graduated rate income tax proposals such rates would be unthinkable in a single rate system but could easily reemerge if the single rate requirement is repealed 10 the numbers do not add up this proposal is estimated to increase revenues by roughly 3 6 billion per year starting in 2021 that figure was originally closely aligned with the structural deficit as estimated by the governor s office in 2019 gov pritzker presented the tax increase as the alternative to significant cuts for that tax year even though it was set to end and since has before any new taxes could go into effect between the state s tradition of not paying its bills unpaid bills currently stand at 7 3 billion and the effects of the covid 19 pandemic the looming gap between revenues and collections is now higher still that is not an argument for doing nothing but it does mean that other steps would have to be taken as well and it also means that all of the new revenue and then some would presumably pay for existing government programs the governor campaigned on increasing school funding improving infrastructure expanding social services and reducing pension debt and none of those things would be covered by the proposed tax increases that may be a compelling reason to believe that these rates as high as they are will not be the last increases should voters approve a graduated rate income tax if that is the case however eventually rates will have to rise on middle class families as there is only so much additional revenue at the top the rate schedule in s b 687 avoids a tax increase for most of these filers but how long will that last 11 the proposal eliminates the best feature of illinois tax code the state s relatively low single rate individual income tax has historically been one of the few saving graces in a state with otherwise high and economically inefficient taxes high taxes on income are generally among the least desirable taxes because they discourage wealth creation a comprehensive review of international econometric tax studies found that individual income taxes are among the most detrimental to economic growth outstripped only by corporate income taxes the literature on graduated rate income taxes is particularly unfavorable with substantial evidence that higher marginal tax rates reduce gross state product growth even after adjusting for overall state tax burdens plenty of states with graduated rate income taxes have better tax codes than illinois overall but illinois policymakers have shown little ability to keep taxes or spending in check and tax burdens are high throughout the rest of the system illinois has the 11th highest state and local tax collections per capita at 5 764 despite a relatively competitive flat income tax absent the existing constitutional constraints illinoisans have every reason to fear that their income tax burdens will continue to rise a child tax credit or an expansion of the property tax credit that provides less than 50 in tax relief for the median homeowner may come to seem like a very small inducement for the income tax burdens to come 12 illinois business competitiveness will decline every year the tax foundation publishes an updated edition of the state business tax climate index a measure of state tax structure illinois ranks 36th overall on the forthcoming 2021 edition with its competitive income tax balancing out poor tax structure elsewhere if however the state were to adopt the graduated rate structure under s b 687 with top rates of 9 49 percent on pass through income and 10 49 percent on corporate income while creating a marriage penalty and forgoing inflation indexing the state s overall rank would plummet from 36th to 47th ahead of only new jersey california and new york table 3 current and projected index rankings current projected

real and economically meaningful the competitiveness or lack thereof of the state s overall tax structure were the proposed graduated rate income tax adopted illinois would trail its peers in just

president trump likes to tout big numbers but here s one new figure he won t enjoy 891 billion the united states record breaking trade deficit in goods last year it s the biggest ever recorded and even if you add in services shrinking 2018 s trade deficit to 621 billion that s still the largest gap since 2008 trump points to the trade deficit as evidence america is getting ripped off he s boasted he can close the divide and launched a multi front trade war to that end but while a trade deficit is never a good thing it is something we can live with and handle on our own subscribe to the week escape your echo chamber get the facts behind the news plus analysis from multiple perspectives subscribe save sign up for the week s free newsletters from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox from our morning news briefing to a weekly good news newsletter get the best of the week delivered directly to your inbox sign up the basic problem with a trade deficit is it means demand from american consumers is going overseas creating jobs in other countries instead of here at home when america is at full employment when there are more jobs than there are workers to take them families and communities have more security workers have leverage to demand bigger pay hikes and better conditions inequality falls and the economy as a whole is more productive when we chronically fail to hit full employment and we have failed for decades we get rising inequality and income stagnation in isolation a trade deficit makes full employment harder to reach but in reality the trade deficit never exists in isolation even as it drains demand from the economy other policies can stimulate demand to offset that loss with the right strategy we could reach and maintain full employment even with persistently large trade deficits what sort of policies fit the bill anything that either hires more americans directly or gives them more money to spend we could simply expand america s welfare programs things like medicaid food stamps and housing assistance or add new programs but you can t always control how americans spend the money they receive a more certain approach would be something like direct industrial policy left leaning democrats are already talking about a jobs guarantee a public option for living wage employment designed to push us to full employment for good this category could also include the 1 trillion or more that should be spent revamping the country s infrastructure the massive public works and investment that would come with a green new deal or even medicare for all which would free up lots of consumer spending currently going to private insurers granted these programs would be heavily deficit financed but that s necessary taxes do the same thing trade deficits do pull demand out of the domestic economy so by fully paying for these programs we d defeat their purpose critics might worry we d go too far in the opposite direction and overheat the economy but after decades of undershooting full employment overshooting it would be a nice change of pace why go this route why try to offset the harms of trade deficits rather than reducing the deficits themselves for one thing these programs are all things america can do on our own while closing the trade deficit would almost certainly require other countries cooperation in the form of currency policy changes trump s trade war could certainly push other nations to the bargaining table but china and our other trading partners may decide not to play ball realistically it doesn t look like the trump administration has the strategic acumen or policy know how to pull this off and even if we did fix the international currency imbalance that might not solve the problem america s economy is doing relatively well while other major economies are not as long as that s the case we will buy more of their stuff than they buy of ours trump cannot unilaterally solve china s economic woes nor can he force the eurozone to finally start running sane domestic macroeconomic policy the best fixes for trade deficits are ones we can do solo that s not all the u s dollar is still used for settling almost all international trade and financial obligations but only america can actually create fresh dollars for all other countries if they run out they run out that can devastate an economy if paired with an international debt payment crisis or a desperate need for more imports that s why most other nations try to stockpile dollars for a rainy day they do so by exporting to america and getting dollars in exchange for their goods and services if they can import less from us than they sell to us they re left with the desired surplus of dollars this means if the u s ever did completely balance our trade flows other countries would have to give back all their dollars our trade parity would deprive the rest of the world of its dollar reserves moreover the way countries stockpile dollars is by investing them in an assets increasing u s deficit spending would flood global markets with more u s treasuries the epitome of safe risk free investment without that supply of treasuries countries might invest their dollar reserves in other riskier assets like mortgage backed securities for example we all know how that turned out by running big deficit financed domestic industrial policy america can plug the demand hole created by our trade deficit we would do the rest of the world a kindness in the process

civilians or to be suspended from the grouping the tmc took over after president omar al bashir was ousted on april 11 any suspension of sudan s au membership could affect the tmc s efforts to win

run the transitional period the tmc has resisted pressure to hand power to civilians but has said it was ready to accept a civilian government of technocrats to run the country during an interim

the turkish economy has fallen into recession for the first time in a decade according to data released on monday the timing could not be worse for president recep tayyip erdogan with critical local elections scheduled for the end of the month according to state figures the gross domestic product shrank by 2 4 percent in the last quarter a sharper contraction than most predictions the previous quarter saw a 1 6 percent decline heralding two successive quarters of negative growth the definition of a recession the turkish economy is still reeling from the aftermath of last year s currency collapse triggered by u s president donald trump hitting ankara with sanctions over the detention in turkey of american pastor andrew brunson who has since been released while the sanctions lasted only a few weeks the currency crashed by around 30 percent unleashing a wave of inflation still running at around 20 percent to stabilize the lira turkey s central bank increased interest rates to 24 percent one of the highest rates in the industrial world strangling economic activity turkey now faces stagflation recession and surging inflation this comes at an inopportune time with erdogan seeking to maintain ruling party control of turkey s largest cities in local elections on march 31 opinion polls indicate the economy is the no 1 concern for voters an indication that the ruling akp could face major losses across the nation berat albayrak turkey s economy czar and erdogan s son in law sought to put a positive spin on the latest economic data maintaining that the worst was over the problem has been successfully dealt with in a very short space of time tweeted albayrak while in the past turkey s economy has been resilient by recovering quickly from shocks analysts warn this time it may be different the biggest challenge is the extent of the debt buildup in the run up to the exchange rate shock in august said economist inan demir of nomura securities this is a key difference compared to the past shocks added demir when the private debt burden was much lower the deleveraging pressures i e pressures to pay down debt accumulated earlier will slow the pace of recovery taking advantage of worldwide low interest rates and unprecedented levels of liquidity turkey s corporate sector and consumers have built up massive liabilities over the past 10 years the economy surged on debt fueled growth in 2017 the economy grew at a rate of 7 percent one of the strongest in the world now turkey s construction sector is among the most heavily indebted according to the latest figures it contracted by 8 7 percent in the last three months the industry which is closely linked to erdogan is among the most labor intensive and a critical driving force behind the country s unprecedented period of economic growth turkey s economic woes could worsen over renewed diplomatic tensions with the united states washington is warning of sanctions if ankara goes ahead with the procurement of russian missiles which nato warns is a threat to their weapons systems unfortunately we see the makings of a new brunson scale crisis in the clash over turkey s determination to purchase russian made s 400 anti missile systems said atilla yesilada of global source partners the u s and nato ratchet up the pressure now essentially threatening erdogan with another currency meltdown added yesilada erdogan however is refusing to heed washington s warnings insisting on continuing with the s 400 purchase analysts say standing up to america plays well with voters and erdogan is likely banking on his relationship with trump to avoid a crisis i would think these are significant risks that could generate significant currency volatility again said demir but my impression is that the markets are not focusing on these issues currently perhaps relying on the assumption that an agreement can be found between presidents trump and erdogan the apparent belief in the trump erdogan relationship by international markets is seen as a key factor in why the lira has remained relatively stable despite rising u s turkish tensions the turkish public however appears less certain selling lira for foreign currency in the year through march 1 they public appear to have built up some 6 billion in f x foreign exchange deposits in total which suggest among other things they see relative lira stability to date as a temporary phenomenon said yesilada with nearly three weeks left to election day and the polls indicating all of turkey s main cities hang in the balance analysts say erdogan is likely to continue to ramp up populist rhetoric since he has been denied his usual economic prosperity card economists warn such a strategy carries with it the threat of further economic pain the main vulnerability is to another external shock such as geopolitical or a surge in dollar vis a vis all currencies said demir in the case of another major fall in the currency the economic downturn will be prolonged
how much longer will the middle class politely tolerate its own destruction by robert gore march 10 2019 information clearing house a middle class that outnumbers the combined poor and aristocracy is a relatively new phenomenon dating back to around 1900 the rise of the middle class was the result of industrial revolution capitalism it has been one of the most significant and epochal developments in history yet the intellectual reaction for the most part has been to either ignore it or treat it with disdain now the project to destroy the middle class is well under way with unpredictable and uncontrollable consequences that promise to be just as epochal as its creation intellectual condescension towards the middle class is so common it s a cliché what s rare are attempts to go back in history and see things through the perspectives of that despised group and its progenitors the poor in 1800 virtually everyone was poor living under conditions of deprivation and grinding poverty even being wealthy was no picnic present day poverty line americans live better life expectancy was an estimated twenty nine years farming the occupation of most was dangerous backbreaking labor from dawn to dusk most of those so engaged eked out a tenuous subsistence there was no electricity no running water primitive sanitation and health care and none of the machinery gadgets and appliances we take for granted only a few wealthy poets who didn t have to wrest a living from nature waxed euphoric about its joys as the nineteenth century progressed primitive factories mostly in cities began producing goods of better quality in more quantity and at lower cost than had been possible by artisans handcrafting their wares no doubt conditions in those factories were abysmal long hours pittance pay child labor dangerous and filthy conditions and horrible accidents and injuries all that has been well chronicled and dramatized but an important point gets overlooked bad as they were the factories were a better option for those who worked in them than the farms from whence many of them came or they would have stayed there are you tired of the lies and non stop propaganda get your free daily newsletter capitalism requires capital and early industrialization provided profits to capitalize more factories further innovation new inventions and industries and eventually the astonishing burst of dynamic energy that became the industrial revolution each new generation of mines factories ships trains farms and other productive assets became less labor intensive produced higher average real wages had lower percentages of child labor and were less dangerous than their predecessors again by present day standards most working conditions were still abysmal but less so than what had preceded them that was the relevant consideration for the millions of people who worked in dickensian conditions it was their best option and better than anything they had previously known the nineteenth century produced more technological and scientific innovation that all the centuries before it combined societies don t go from poor to rich overnight however real world conditions opportunity income wealth health and overall quality of life steadily improved by 1900 life expectancy in the us was 46 years for males and 48 years for females an unprecedented one century increase those who throw rocks at the industrial revolution the period when america approached laissez faire capitalism have to minimize or ignore one simple fact millions of people braved the dangers of travel the uncertainties of life in a new land the difficulties of learning a new language the prejudice and hostility they knew they would encounter the daunting challenges of starting at the bottom and the absence of government giveaways and freely chose to immigrate to the united states sometimes the payoff was huge andrew carnegie really did get off the boat with eleven cents in his pocket cyrus mccormack john d rockefeller thomas edison henry ford and other success stories came from impoverished or modest backgrounds and made multimillion dollar fortunes the self made businessman became the american archetype fueling countless aspirations the emergent middle class was a cohesive force for political stability the immigrants passed their memories of what they had escaped to their children and grandchildren they embraced the reality and the promise of america based on their own fruitful experience life was good and would get even better why rock the boat few noticed the thunderhead on the horizon that thunderhead was hate directed not at america s flaws and weaknesses but at its virtues and strengths the sacrifice hard work thrift and ingenuity that had lifted millions from poverty was condemned as selfishness blind ambition and greed the middle class that didn t exist a century ago was materialistic anti intellectual and spiritually impoverished the unprecedented wealth america was producing was wrong because it was unequally distributed or the most philanthropic and charitable people in history weren t giving enough away you can guess where the hostility came from the intellectuals who found what they peddled commanded little attention or respect and would be rulers in a nation with little desire to be ruled the desire for autonomy to be left alone to be free to make one s own decisions and live one s own life are the benchmarks of well adjusted normalcy the desires to tell or force other people what to do are the opposite wellsprings of hate which are depending on their intensity and quality neurotic sociopathic or psychopathic that the middle class is now fighting for its life reflects two intellectual failures in the late 1800s and early 1900s the intellectuals political class and many of the tycoons were pressing for expanded government the income tax central banking and american interventionism and imperialism the truisms that any expansion of the government s power and resources would only reduce the people s liberty and be funded with money stolen from them was overwhelmed by what s become the standard propaganda coercion is necessary to address some risk danger or unacceptable condition there were no prominent voices connecting the prevalent peace prosperity and optimism with the era s unprecedented personal freedom nor arguing their essential inseparability the other failure most average americans simply couldn t comprehend or even conceive of the hatred directed against them statism whatever its variations is never about doing something for people it s about doing something to them even now with virulent vitriol and hatred on full display much of it is minimized or rationalized by people who should know better the corruption of the middle grounders may run deeper than the statists and the collectivists who at least no longer try to hide their agenda and acknowledge that freedom cannot coexist with the unlimited governmental power they covet when somebody claims that your life is their property they re telling you that they have the right to do with it what they will which includes killing you all manner of statist belladonna reached full florescence in the twentieth century socialism communism nazism fascism welfare statism cronyism kleptocracy kakistocracy and the murder genocide and war have been orders of magnitude greater than anything that preceded it you shall know them by their works the thing that statism does best to people is kill them the record is clear and unmistakable anyone now promoting more of the same is simply evil only unmitigated hatred accounts for the particular antipathy directed towards the middle class their values their prosperity and their predominate race white and religion christianity the middle class being a relatively new phenomenon nobody can say what the consequences of the all out war against it will be it is the bedrock of modern economies and its destruction will take out most of the developed world s productive capacity and consumer markets that doesn t seem to bother the statists how they plan to free themselves from the economies that sustain them is a question they ignore it calls to mind ayn rand s atlas shrugged observation the deaths they desire the most are their own that has to be the true definition of insanity truer even than einstein s repeatedly doing the same thing and expecting a different result the notion that our rulers are insane has slipped loose from the alternative media where it was once confined certainly us foreign policy meets einstein s definition repeated regime changes in the name of democracy promotion that promote only carnage and chaos endlessly inconclusive interventions war profiteering terrorism and intense hatred of the american people and its government around the world donald trump questioned those repeated failures and that provided his margin of victory in 2016 to this day nobody can explain the logic behind the bailouts during the last financial crisis and what ensued the world s central banks monetizing massive government debt and pushing interest rates below zero the high and mighty pretend this is all normal but for normal people buying a bond with a guaranteed loss is insane microscopic rates force them against their better judgment into a stock market that s crashed twice since the turn of the century decimating their savings and now sits at historically sky high valuations here is the investment landscape you re supposed to embrace lose money or put it on the pass line and hope the wall street roll of the dice doesn t once again come up craps keep spending money you don t have and inevitably you ll go broke keep making promises you can t fulfill and inevitably you ll break them there are hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of claims on the future out there that have no chance of ever being redeemed yet the pile continues to grow the mathematical outcome is as straightforward and devastating as playing russian roulette with all the chambers loaded obamacare is the latest insane gift from the government that keeps on giving it s an obvious failure but it s a foaming at the mouth murderous pit bull that from some deranged concept of mercy or an appalling lack of fortitude nobody will put out of its misery medical care stands in a long line of industries that malevolence masked as good intentions has destroyed as the middle class watches the america it once knew and cherished collapse and comes to understand why it realizes its head is on the chopping block a bright middle schooler can see that the green new deal will bring the economy to a shuddering stop and plunge many who have managed to escape so far into poverty yet the democrats leading lights rush to praise the imaginary raiment of would be empress ocasio cortez the middle class has always aspired to better things the american dream talk of 70 percent or higher tax rates and wealth taxes capitalizes on hatred of the rich it s open season why work and sacrifice to get rich if the government gets it all take away middle class dreams and you may well be taking away the last thing that keeps them paying their taxes observing the law supporting the troops and police in short everything that from the vantage point of the ruling class keeps them in line what began as a gentle squeeze a century ago has become python like constriction government has drained economic vitality and shuttered opportunity as the once politically stable prosperous and optimistic middle class dwindles a few still reach the upper echelon but most are consigned to creeping poverty blunting the economic consequences with credit and the personal consequences with cannabis alcohol opioids pornography and promiscuity it s only going to get worse as debt grows massive unfunded medical and pension liabilities come due taxes rise economies shrink and promises are broken the ruling class has backed the middle class into a corner shoving them into poverty and vanquishing their dreams amounts to an unprecedented and dangerous experiment aristocratic arrogance condescension exclusivity and isolation add to the combustibility yet they remain steadfastly oblivious to the rising anger and the risks they don t even recognize the danger of billing the governments they control or the global one they want to create as the solution to all problems who s going to get the blame when things fall apart the potentates may find their nuclear arsenals and well armed militaries and police forces comforting however their experiment confronts unanswered questions what if a substantial portion of the population has taken to the streets and far outnumbers the praetorians what if praetorian sentiment is with the protestors and insurrectionists are the rulers really prepared to use tanks heavy artillery bombs and even nuclear weapons on their own population will the people charged with pressing those buttons actually press them for america s ruling class failing policies looming insolvency rising awareness via the alternative media their own hypocrisy and corruption political polarization and a well armed populace are a stairway to hell what happens when the disaffected many who will have nothing to lose try to reclaim their lives and liberty and upend the political order that has roadblocked their pursuit of happiness disaffection is a battalion righteous moral certainty an army the latter has moved the world and will do so again victor hugo said that nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come here s an idea so powerful yet so simple it fits on a bumper sticker fight for your life it s megatons of tnt the fuze has run and the explosions have started there s no way to predict or control the consequences the only certainty is that anyone who thinks they can do so will be proven disastrously wrong this article was originally published by straight line logic
what s the worst thing the government does that s a difficult question to answer i ve argued that giving u s tax dollars to the oecd is the worst item in the budget on a per dollar spent basis and i ve expressed scathing disdain for the horrid practice of civil asset forfeiture there are also really destructive features of the tax system such as fatca and the death tax but you could make a strong case for fannie mae and freddie mac as well these two government created corporations not only reduce long run growth by distorting the allocation of capital they also bear considerable responsibility for last decade s financial crisis since they played a major role in fueling the housing bubble the u k based economist describes america s interventionist regime as a form of socialism the mortgage system is largely nationalised and subject to administrative control america s mortgage finance system with 11 trillion of debt is probably the biggest concentration of financial risk to be found anywhere the supply of mortgages in america has an air of distinctly socialist command and control about it the structure of these loans their volume and the risks they entail are controlled not by markets but by administrative fiat the subsidy for housing debt is running at about 150 billion a year or roughly 1 of gdp a crisis as bad as last time would cost taxpayers 2 4 of gdp not far off the bail out of the banks in 2008 12 the securitisation of loans most of which used to be in the private sector is now almost entirely state run there are at least 10 000 relevant pages of federal laws regulatory orders and rule books in the land of the free where home ownership is a national dream borrowing to buy a house is a government business for which taxpayers are on the hook in other words our system of housing finance is mucked up by government intervention very much akin to the way healthcare is a mess because of government that s the bad news the good news is that fannie and freddie have been in conservatorship every since they got a big bailout last decade and that means the two cronyist firms are now somewhat constrained they can t lobby for instance though republicans and democrats still seek to expand subsidies in response to campaign cash from other housing related lobbyists but the worst news is that there are people in the trump administration who want to go back to the bad ol pre bailout days the wall street journal opined on the issue as trump prepared to take office the editorial noted that the implicit government guarantee for fannie mae and freddie mac led to an explicit bailout fan and fred s owners feasted for decades on an implied taxpayer guarantee before the housing crisis since everyone knew the two government created mortgage giants would receive federal help in a crisis they were able to run enormous risks and still borrow cheaply as they came to own or guarantee 5 trillion of mortgage paper when the housing market went south taxpayers had to stage a rescue in 2008 and poured nearly 190 billion into the toxic twins as part of that bailout and the subsequent conservatorship fannie and freddie still get to operate and they still have a big implicit subsidy that allows near automatic profits at least until and unless there s another big hiccup in the housing market but the treasury department gets those profits needless to say this upsets the shareholders they bought stock so they could get a slice of the undeserved profits generated by the fannie freddie cronyist business model they claim going back to the pre bailout days would be a form of privatization but the wsj editorial correctly warns that it s not pro free market to allow these two government created companies to distort housing markets with their government granted favors preferences and subsidies the expectation that treasury secretary nominee steven mnuchin is going to revive the beltway model of public risk and private reward private shareholders of these so called government sponsored enterprises keep pretending that something other than the government is responsible for their income streams as if anyone would buy their guarantees or give them cheap financing if uncle sam weren t standing behind them what they really want is to liberate for themselves the profits that flow from a duopoly backed by taxpayers we re all for businesses getting out of government control unless they re playing with taxpayer money americans were told that fannie and freddie were safe for years before the last crisis the right answer is to shut them down amen not just shut them down dump them in the potomac river the wall street journal then revisited the issue early last year once again expressing concern that the treasury secretary wants to go back to the days of unchecked cronyism fannie mae is again going hat in hand to taxpayers washington should take this news as a kick in the keister to finally start winding down the mortgage giant and its busted brother freddie mac but the trump administration seems to be moving in the opposite direction the pair now in conservatorship were left in limbo hedge funds bought up their shares betting they could pressure washington into bringing back the old business model of public risk and private reward treasury secretary steven mnuchin told the senate banking committee i think it s critical that we have a 30 year mortgage i don t believe that the private markets on their own could support it but many countries have robust housing markets and ownership rates without a 30 year mortgage guarantee mr mnuchin sounds like his predecessor democrat jack lew wasn t donald trump elected to eliminate crony capitalism this issue is now heating up with reports indicating that the treasury secretary is pushing to restore the moral hazard based system that caused so much damage last decade the trump administration is at war with itself over who should take the lead in the reform of the government backed mortgage companies fannie mae and freddie mac the battle centers on whether the treasury department should continue to advocate what it views as a plan for the future of the mortgage companies or cede control of those efforts to the incoming chief of the federal housing financial agency fhfa economist mark calabria the good news is that trump has nominated a sensible person to head fhfa which has some oversight authority over fannie and freddie and it s also good news that some of the economic people at the white house understand the danger of loosening the current limits on fannie and freddie white house economic officials are seeking to prevent a repeat of the risk taking activities by the companies that contributed to the mortgage bubble leading to its 2008 collapse and 200 billion government bailout these officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity also say any reform must have the blessing of calabria a long time libertarian economist and frequent critic of the outfit s pre crisis business model he is also wary of returning fannie and freddie to their previous incarnations as private companies that have shareholders but also receive backing from the federal government if they get in trouble as they did in 2008 but it seems that the treasury department has some officials who just like their predecessors in the obama administration learned nothing from the financial crisis they want to give fannie and freddie free rein perhaps in order to help some speculator buddies treasury secretary steve mnuchin and his top house advisor craig phillips have so far taken the lead in january acting director of the federal housing agency joseph otting privately told employees about plans referring to mnuchin s past statements on the matter mnuchin also has business ties with at least one of the major investors in the gse s stock that has benefited amid the speculation paulson who has stakes in the gse s preferred class of stock has also submitted a proposal a key feature of the framework touted by mnuchin phillips otting and paulson is that both fannie and freddie would have some backing from the federal government in times of emergency while remaining public companies a business model similar to the one the gses operated with before 2008 given the treasury department s bad performance on other issues i m not surprised that they re on the wrong side on this issue as well tobias peter of the american enterprise institute outlines the correct approach the gses however do very little that cannot be done and is not already done by the private sector in addition these institutions pose a significant financial risk to u s taxpayers weighing this cost against the minimal benefits makes the case that the gses should be eliminated regulators have tilted the playing field in favor of the gses gse borrowers can thus take on more debt to offset higher prices with inventories lower than ever this extra debt ends up driving prices even higher creating a vicious cycle of more debt higher prices greater risk and ironically more demand for the gses what keeps the gses in business are the same failed housing policies that brought us the last financial crisis the gses are not needed in the housing market and they have become detrimental to the market s long term health they could be eliminated this would create space for the re emergence of an active private mortgage backed securities market that ensures a safer and more stable housing finance system with access for all while letting taxpayers off the hook mr peter is correct here s a flowchart that shows what happened and the choice we now face at the risk of stating the obvious real privatization is the right approach this would mean an end to the era of special favors and subsidies no taxpayers guarantee for mortgage backed securities no special exemption from complying with sec red tape no more special tax favors such as special exemptions sadly i m not holding my breath for any of this to happen the real battle in dc is between conservatorship and fake privatization which really should be called turbo charged and lobbyist fueled cronyism and if that s the case then the obvious choice is to retain the status quo p s this is a secondary issue but it s worth noting that fannie and freddie like to squander money here are some excerpts from a report published by the washington free beacon fannie mae is charging taxpayers millions for upgrades to its new headquarters including 250 000 for a chandelier the inspector general for the federal housing finance agency fhfa which acts as a conservator for the mortgage lender recently noted 32 million in questionable costs in an audit for fannie mae s new headquarters in downtown washington d c the inspector general reported that costs for the new headquarters have risen dramatically to 171 million up from 115 million when the consolidated headquarters

nation states are back at center stage as a unifying european idea that means political forces pejoratively branded as nationalists and populists could have a fair showing in european parliamentary elections next may meanwhile germany could do a lot to calm the european political scene by leading the continent out of an incipient recession l europe l europe l europe was how an irritated french president charles de gaulle decried in december 1965 the idea that a european integration was the answer to all of the continent s problems de gaulle approved of the european customs union and an economic and political cooperation of nation states he thought that closer economic relations could eventually lead to some sort of european confederation but he rejected the idea of europe s federal super state that means that in today s post modern europe de gaulle voted by the france in 2005 as the greatest frenchman of all time could be considered a nationalist and a populist demagogue when i recently mentioned that to a french political commentator he uncomfortably skirted the question with a cop out that the idea of a united europe has changed since de gaulle s time brexit however is a vivid example of the opposite the majority of british voters cast their ballots in a 2016 referendum that the united kingdom should not cede its sovereignty to an unelected european commission and that it should not have to defend its political governance with opt outs from an increasingly federalist european union but the u k is quite willing to participate in a european free trade area that does not infringe upon its own sovereign decisions as a nation state don t divide europe and that is not the proverbial europe à la carte ridiculed by the governing elites in france and germany who bear an enormous responsibility for mismanaging the european union they now see as the only way of clinging to power story continues the british for example refused to join the euro because they did not want to give up their monetary sovereignty for the sake of being part of a genuine european customs union and its single market a reminder any exchange rate change violates the customs union because it is technically equivalent to an import tariff and an export subsidy another example is the czech republic s steadfast decision to manage its own monetary policy even though prague s budget deficit of 1 3 percent of gdp gross public debt of 42 percent of gdp and an inflation rate of about 2 percent would make it a stellar member of the monetary union and just like the british the czechs fully realize that by maintaining their own currency the koruna they are missing some trade and investment advantages of the european single market the czechs are being left alone but the brexiters and the italy hungarian and poland governments are attacked as nationalists and populists predictably french president emmanuel macron is leading the charge against the nationalists and their alleged populist deceptions he recently proposed a european renaissance no less around three main themes freedom protection and progress the sad truth is that macron s appeal to eu audiences is just his own party s electoral platform for the next european parliamentary elections on may 23 26 2019 unable to calm down the social unrest in france and fighting low opinion polls macron is using europe to attack his domestic opponents all branded as nationalists and populists by extolling the protective power of european sovereignty a mysterious constitutional category of his own invention germany should keep eu out of recession macron s appeal like his earlier reform proposals is dead on arrival in germany a country he needs to reconcile different national interests within the european union some german social democrats are politely suggesting that macron s latest effort merits attention but germany s center right circles are less inclined to listen to his ideas in the article making europe right the leader of germany s governing center right christian democratic party annegret kramp karrenbauer roundly rejected most of macron s reform ideas she argued that europe should be less centralized and more market driven with no european minimum wage and no collective european responsibility for individual countries public debts instead of the french fetish of a euro area common budget she wants a european fund to invest in development projects and new technologies all that is music to the ears of macron s political opponents they will now be exulting at the idea that he got nothing in return for what they see as an excessive rapprochement with germany meanwhile as a practical matter immigration policy remains the eu s main bone of contention that is where germany stands on thin ice in its strained relations with hungary italy poland the czech republic and slovakia those countries are rejecting mandatory immigration quotas germany wants to use to get rid of migrants refugees it cannot handle and quite unfairly that seems to be the complaint germany is using to attack those countries alleged failure to live up to european values investment thoughts the nation state is back at center stage as a unifying european idea expect agreements to complete the banking union within the euro zone and to build firmer borders to protect the intra european visa free area schengen countries apart from that further eu integration reforms will be on the back burner for the foreseeable future kramp karrenbauer is on her way to head germany s current governing coalition in france macron will remain in office but he will most probably have to run the country with a hostile government after the european parliamentary elections next may those political changes will calm down the elites versus nationalists and populists squabbles but the economic policy clashes will remain as vivid as ever germany for example with its gigantic trade surpluses and overflowing public sector coffers should be leading the euro area out of an incipient recession but true to form berlin is deaf even to the idea of a self interested european solidarity those german economic policies are what the european central bank is fighting with its ultra loose credit stance and a large bank lending washington and the international monetary fund should take a closer look at german trade and economic policies for the u s it s a question of protecting nearly one fourth of american exports destined to europe commentary by michael ivanovitch an independent analyst focusing on world economy

it is a sign of true political power when a great people can determine of its own will the vocabulary the terminology and the words the very way of speaking even the way of thinking of other peoples carl schmitt wrote in 1932 at the wick s end of the weimar republic schmitt the most formidable legal and strategic mind in germany who would join the nazi party the following year was thinking of america the us was already the unrivalled hegemon of its hemisphere schmitt admired its ample living space and its protected position between two oceans americans had cleared out the native populations and intervened as they pleased in the latin south it would be harder going for the germans in europe for schmitt what was extraordinary about the american empire was the way it added to its geographical advantage by continually refiguring the nature of its triumph us imperialism would go by other names manifest destiny greater america the american century the free world internationalism colonies and dependencies were rarely declared outright americans knew how to conceal an empire territorial or otherwise who made a fuss in the 1950s when the us continued to add stars to its flag while europe started disgorging its colonies or noticed that until the decolonisation of the philippines in 1946 the number of us subjects overseas exceeded the number of black americans on the mainland schmitt found the sharpest expression of america s imperial precociousness in the monroe doctrine a quasi legal fiat issued in 1823 from a position of relative weakness the us decreed that european powers were barred from meddling in its zone of influence inside that zone it would decide what was peace what was intervention and what was security for national socialists in the 1930s the power to make all legal questions of sovereignty answer to political exigency was a tantalising prospect as a german making remarks about american imperialism schmitt wrote i can only feel like a beggar in rags speaking about the riches and treasures of foreigners the problem for the germans was that just as they were trying to make their own grossraum a reality hitler called it a monroe doctrine for europe the americans were dreaming of becoming a global power this step was not as obvious or inevitable as it may now appear americans before the second world war spoke less of the country s exceptional primacy than of its exceptional aloofness from european style power politics they prided themselves on being above espionage diplomatic intrigue and standing armies they preferred to speak of international legal solutions and courts of arbitration the possibility of a german controlled europe made such detachment harder to sustain as the liberal historian john thompson shows in a sense of power it was neither the threat that the germans and japanese posed to the us mainland that drove the country into the war nor the imperative to secure international markets since the us economy in the 1940s was overwhelmingly based on domestic growth and consumption the chief motive behind america s entry into the war thompson argues persuasively was that its leaders realised that it would cost them relatively little to bend the world in the political direction they wanted to justify intervention roosevelt had to tack between security concerns and economic ones which he exaggerated for effect wages and hours would be fixed by hitler he told the public on the radio while the american farmer would get for his products exactly what hitler wanted to give and in an age of air power the us could no longer set faith in the oceans protection not to mention the threat that a german invasion of brazil posed to america s supply of the minerals and metals it needed for its weaponry do we want to see hitler in independence hall making fun of the liberty bell william bullitt roosevelt s ambassador to france asked a year before pearl harbor us war planners were already envisioning the utopia to come its premise was the defeat of germany and japan but also the break up of european empires into a world of discrete nation states each with its own liberal multi party system and regular elections and each umbilically connected to the dollar the trusteeship system of the united nations would serve as an incubator for premature nations coaxing them from colonial rule into statehood or in the case of some american holdings towards a convenient grey zone between colony and military base in this utopia the us was to be at once the summa of world history never to be equalled and the model that would have to be followed the planners drafted blueprints for the united nations as a way to package internationalism for an american public assumed to be reluctant to prolong its global mission as the historian stephen wertheim has recently found isolationism wasn t a word with much currency before the war new dealers fashioned it into a term of abuse to tar dissenters from us globalism including those at home who were still committed to the equal legal status of all nations there is literally no question military or political in which the united states is not interested roosevelt told a weary stalin in 1944 the kremlin would have been more comfortable keeping to some form of a zones of influence system for a while longer a wish shared by many wise men of the west from alexandre kojève to george kennan who preferred a world of bounded empires to one of nation states but by war s end no one was in a position to gainsay the broad shape of the pax americana perry anderson in american foreign policy and its thinkers his first sustained critique of us power concentrates on two unstable compounds in the empire s image of itself both of which crystallised in the decisive postwar years when it was still unclear how american utopianism would adjust to postwar realities the first such compound is made up of two elements exceptionalism and universalism which anderson treats as analytically distinct impulses providential exceptionalism came first originating in the puritans attempt to build a city upon a hill that would impress the england they had left behind at least in theory anderson suggests american exceptionalism could be modest here he is on firm ground one of the most forceful denunciations of american expansionism was made eight years before the expression manifest destiny first appeared in print when the leading unitarian preacher william ellery channing warned that america s sublime moral empire should diffuse freedom by manifesting its fruits since there is no fate to justify rapacious nations any more than to justify gamblers and robbers in plunder american universalism in anderson s view is more dangerous it was effectively propagated by woodrow wilson who saw the entire world as a receptacle for america s values lift your eyes to the horizons of business anderson quotes him telling american salesmen and with the inspiration of the thought that you are americans and are meant to carry liberty and justice and the principles of humanity wherever you go go out and sell goods that will make the world more comfortable and more happy and convert them to the principles of america on the face of it the message sounds like channing s call to spread american values through non forcible means but the circumstances had changed in 1910 the country s economic output was higher than that of germany france and japan combined by the middle of the first world war it had surpassed that of the british empire the country s excess material power opened fresh possibilities for what anderson calls messianic activism the second of anderson s unstable compounds is the tension between the needs of american supremacy and the needs of global capitalism for much of the postwar era us leaders rarely bothered to distinguish between the two the build up of us power and capitalist husbandry went hand in hand when they were forced to prioritise american leaders tended to privilege political military global leadership over the needs of capital with the expectation that this would be better for capitalism in the long run at bretton woods the us triumphantly established the dollar as the world s reserve currency and created supporting institutions including the world bank and the imf over the cries of wall street banks which demanded a much less constricting set of controls and were privately exploring the idea of lending europeans reconstruction funds the truman administration embarked on a programme dedicated to economic stability the reconstruction of japan and europe which american historians persist in presenting as unique acts of beneficence was undertaken to ensure the bedrock of the world capitalist system even if that meant keeping the european empires on their feet a bit longer the us state anderson writes would henceforward act not primarily as a projection of the concerns of us capital but as a guardian of the general interest of all capitals sacrificing where necessary and for as long as needed national gain for international advantage in the confidence of ultimate pay off the drama of us foreign policy for anderson comes in the way the country and its policy elite balance the requirements of global capitalism with what they perceive as the national interest from the 1940s to the 1970s these interests were blurred sometimes more than washington could tolerate truman complained that the first draft of his doctrine for containing communism in europe read too much like an investment prospectus anderson s survey doesn t parse the different types of us intervention in the global south but these could be roughly plotted along his axes of global capital and national interest us backed coups in guatemala and grenada were salves for regional irritants but the meddling in iran and congo was undertaken in the general interest of global capital and the us led world order at large by the early 1970s it was apparent that global capital wasn t serving the us as effectively as the us was serving it the remit of the imperial state beyond the requirements of national capital anderson writes was for the first time under pressure since the war the us had privileged the economic self interest of its recovering allies accepting their protectionism and an overvalued dollar as the price to be paid for its political hegemony but the vietnam war had depleted the treasury escalated inflation and upset the balance of payments which only worsened when nixon removed controls on us corporate investment abroad the total value of dollars outside the country soon exceeded the government s gold reserves france under de gaulle attacked the greenback with purchases of bullion sending a cruiser to new york to pick up its share describing nixon as the only president with an original mind in foreign policy anderson counts his decision to sever gold from the dollar and his declaration of the end of the bretton woods system as a remarkable coup de main the principles of free trade the free market and the solidarity of the free world he writes could not stand in the way of the national interest or as john connally nixon s militantly economic nationalist treasury secretary put it the foreigners are out to screw us it s our job to screw them first but as the historian daniel sargent notes in his shrewd reconstruction of this episode the tactic was less purposeful than ironic nixon had intended to threaten europeans with a dollar devaluation that would improve the us trade balance restore american employment and better his chances of re election the plan was to embark on a temporary period of floating currencies before a return to the status quo no one in the nixon administration wanted to give up control of the monetary order to market forces no one that is except for connally s successor george shultz a university of chicago economist who beat kissinger in the bureaucratic turf war and committed the country headlong to floating currencies and the free flow of capital without national controls kissinger worried that the policy shultz called for would encourage a hostile bloc of western european economies to form shattering the atlantic alliance nixon s economic demarche had begun as an attempt to protect us markets and insulate them from capital flows but it turned out in anderson s telling to be a boon for both capital markets and us power which could now manipulate world currency valuations by means of federal reserve interest rate adjustments wall street sceptical at first of a departure from fixed exchange markets learned to love the new order it is a sign of the limited intellectual range of american diplomatic historians that when anderson s critique first appeared in the pages of new left review they detected an update of william appleman williams s new left classic the tragedy of american diplomacy 1959 but anderson s picture of american imperialism departs from several presuppositions of new left historiography he salutes williams and the wisconsin school the prairie populist tradition associated with him but he also makes a point of distancing himself from it in particular williams s contention that american imperialism was grounded in the ideology of the open door which began with the us s determination to be granted equal access and fair treatment in china s european dominated port cities and the continuous extension of american capitalism towards ever larger markets first across the continent then across the pacific and beyond doesn t square with anderson s view of a predominantly protectionist united states before the second world war the republican party having long equated the conspiracy of free trade with british imperial interference with growing american industry what for williams is a story of continuous american economic expansion is for anderson a story of the way americans came to conflate the global capitalist system with the projection of their own national power continually looking past the fissures in their own ideology and interests anderson s interpretation has more in common with the swedish left historian anders stephanson along with several putatively conservative critics of american empire among them chalmers johnson who argued in his blowback trilogy that us imperialism breeds some of the most important contradictions of capitalism not the other way round and that much of post 1989 us policy from the inflicting of the 1998 financial crisis on the asian tigers to the current push for the ttp and ttip has been aimed at prying open markets that the us was content during the cold war to give leave to be protectionist and heterodox unlike johnson however anderson doesn t chase down equivalences between the soviet union and the us with the eastern european nations mirroring the us s satellites in east asia japan figuring as america s east germany and the kwanju massacre as america s more murderous version of tiananmen square the competition was never close to equal in anderson s telling which finds support in rich new archival studies such as oscar sanchez sibony s red globalisation which shows how desperate the soviet bloc was to participate in western markets as early as the 1950s and jeremy friedman s shadow cold war which lays out the immense cost of the soviet union s revolutionary posture in the third world a beleaguered and misguided attempt to maintain radical credibility against the allure of maoism anderson s critique of american power is also distinctive in a more basic sense many of the most prominent american critics of us imperialism came to their positions while serving as spear carriers of empire in johnson s phrase williams s thinking grew out of the racism he witnessed as an ensign in the us navy and his narrow escape from taking part in the nuclear tests on bikini island johnson himself a us navy veteran of the korean war was a consultant to the office of national estimates in the cia and a longtime academic cold warrior along with perhaps the most prominent contemporary conservative critic the former us army colonel andrew bacevich johnson expected us globalism to readjust after the downfall of the soviet union when no such adjustment came in fact the number of bases expanded these critics began to question whether american globalism really grew out of the need for soviet containment their scepticism was bolstered by first hand disgust with imperial practices in johnson s case the rape culture and environmental devastation he witnessed at us bases in okinawa in bacevich s the hubris and technological utopianism of the no fault operations of the persian gulf war the anti imperial passion shared by bacevich johnson and williams issues from their belief that us foreign entanglements especially in service of the maintenance of global capitalism threaten a truer version of american republican principles each of them has a commitment to what williams called an open door to revolutions his term for a world order where the us doesn t impose its own economic hegemony and different peoples are able to pursue their own forms of social life anderson entertains no such possibility of redemption there s no better republic to go back to no way to roll back the messianism though he doesn t endorse it the version of us globalism that seems to interest anderson most is that of the mid century émigré geostrategist nicholas spykman who in america s strategy in world politics 1942 perhaps the most striking single exercise in geopolitical literature of any land anderson says spared his readers the dogmas of liberal democracy and the free market instead he advised his adopted country to face up to the realities of class warfare the increasing concentration of wealth and the coming race for resources the more clear eyed the us was about its interests in other words the less savagery it would perpetrate in the name of idealism carl schmitt counselled something similar in his retirement when in 1958 he published a platonic dialogue in which an american called macfuture interrupts alcibiades like a conversation between two german thinkers about geopolitics macfuture believes the us has a duty to submit the entire galaxy to a monroe doctrine and that the conquest of space will be a repeat of the conquest of the new world the germans feebly try to interest their guest in the notion of limits anderson doesn t mention another tradition of domestic us anti imperial critique black internationalism which bridged the distance between black american intellectuals and their african counterparts in the colonial world seeking to solder their cause together with appeals to colour blind communism and pan africanism as robert vitalis notes in his book white world order black power politics black internationalism was born alongside the white chauvinist version of international relations at the end of the 19th century when international relations meant race relations the academic field of ir was focused more on the study of global racial hierarchies and the problems of colonial administration than on the abstract interplay of nation states vitalis shows just how preoccupied american ir thinkers were in maintaining white dominance and purity in the colonial world which of course included their own colonies foreign affairs still the house ir journal of the us foreign policy establishment began its life in the 1920s as the journal of race development the tragedy of black internationalism is that some of its most radical advocates ralph bunche at the united nations for example became moderates in their attempt to reform american globalism from within meanwhile some of the most stubborn figures rayford logan alain locke merze tate were institutionally and financially isolated in the black academy outside of which their work was ignored they were nearly forgotten by the following generation of black radicals who had to cut their anti imperial critiques from whole cloth in the 1960s and 1970s if anderson s analysis does have a precursor it is in the work of gabriel and joyce kolko two radical historians of the 1960s gabriel kolko s the politics of war 1968 now forgotten but recognised in its time by hans morgenthau and other conservatives as a scathing and persuasive revision of orthodox cold war history showed how us policy following the second world war was dedicated to eradicating the threat of the anti fascist left which was poised to sweep elections across the world especially in europe and korea for the kolkos it was this more or less internal threat to the global capitalist system rather than any possible communist takeover that washington couldn t tolerate but where the kolkos found a concerted coherent strategy among us postwar planners anderson sees american strategists cobbling together an ideology that s less a cover than part of the substance of american imperialism itself instead of peeling back american rhetoric to reveal imperial intentions anderson examines the way the rhetoric contributes to and shapes those intentions the second part of american foreign policy and its thinkers plunges into the contemporary american dreamworld of empire anderson has always been attracted to those who speak of the world without euphemism and he appraises the recent offerings of american grand strategists with sardonic respect however rabid or fantastic their conceptions these are writers who take in the whole globe and describe it in a lucid register aimed at a wide audience they don t much condescend to election cycles party affiliation or the preoccupations of american political science the two boldest thinkers anderson treats have much in common ideologically but have very different strategies in 2014 robert kagan published an essay entitled superpowers don t get to retire what our tired country still owes the world in the new republic partly a policy memo directed at the president obama promptly called kagan in for lunch it was also pitched at american millennials who grew up in the shadow of afghanistan and iraq and have little trust in the efficacy of american power in kagan s world authoritarianism is the default human condition which only america stands capable of pushing back iran russia china all of these form a new authoritarian front every bit as dangerous as the ussr what gives the united states the right to act on behalf of a liberal world order kagan asks in truth nothing does nothing beyond the conviction that the liberal order is the most just the liberal order kagan goes on was never put to a popular vote it was not bequeathed by god it is not the endpoint of human progress so then what does justify it its enemies kagan declares which are worse than itself just as liberal capitalism s foes wish to impose their worldview so america must impose a liberal world order and as much as we in the west might wish it to be imposed by superior virtue it is generally imposed by superior power the planet s silent majority is grateful for this service imagine strolling through central park kagan writes and after noting how much safer it had become deciding that humanity must simply have become less violent without thinking that perhaps the new york police department had something to do with it what kagan calls for is what schmitt thought impossible a monroe doctrine for the world which kagan speaks of as a heavy moral burden in the international sphere americans have had to act as judge jury police and in the case of military action executioner he writes so it has been since 1945 so it must be for ever at the opposite end of the strategy spectrum from kagan anderson has found a curious specimen thomas barnett is a former naval academy instructor and a self declared economic determinist who delivers ted talks to the military top brass about the limits of american power his work anderson writes is not unlike a materialist variant from the other side of the barricades of the vision of america in hardt and negri s empire america needs to ask itself barnett writes in great powers 2009 is it more important to make globalisation truly global while retaining great power peace and defeating whatever anti globalisation insurgencies may appear in the decades ahead or do we tether our support for globalisation s advance to the upfront demand that the world first resembles us politically for barnett the answer is clear america must trust in the market which will solve all strategic problems russia it is experiencing its gilded age and will come around in fifty years china already capitalist anyway and xi is just china s version of teddy roosevelt trying to root out corruption and make markets more functional iran proceed with every deal possible let the market penetrate and stop threatening it with military strikes tell israel to back off iran will take the position in the middle east to which its culture and educated population entitle it north korea first let beijing extract from it all the minerals it needs then when it reaches rock bottom the chinese will invite the south koreans in to clean up the mess in a world so tilted in the us s favour barnett calls for drastically reducing the military to a small force with only a handful of bases that will be used to handle terrorist pin pricks in every other respect the time has come for stay at home capitalist husbandry what strikes anderson about the collection of american strategists he s assembled is how despite their radically different worldviews they all agree that the us will and must remain the supreme world power in walter russell mead s eyes america s genius with its special british lineage is simply too difficult to replicate in john ikenberry s the world is already signing up to mimic america s image to kagan american dominance is simply a matter of political will as barnett sees it the us is already so ahead in world history it s almost unfair as the strategist christopher layne one of the rare dissenting voices in anderson s account points out when american foreign policy pundits speak of the post american world what they really mean is the now and forever american world the presidential candidates who tend to win are those who most seamlessly embody the contradictory calls for more vigorous projection of american power on the one hand and more aggressive globalisation on the other this is something the clintons have always understood
fair enough president trump s heartless and whackadoodle budget released on monday will never actually become law even when his party had unified control of government he couldn t get capitol hill to take major portions of his budget terribly seriously still a president s budget plan is a statement of his priorities and based on this latest statement trump s priorities continue to be redistributing wealth ever upward from poor to rich and selling the public more fantasies and lies federal deficits have widened immensely under trump s leadership this is striking not only because he promised fiscal responsibility at one time even pledging to eliminate the national debt within eight years but also because it s a historical anomaly deficits usually narrow when the economy is good and we re not engaged in a major war advertisement trump s own policies are to blame for this aberration specifically the 2017 tax law which gave two thirds of its benefits to the top income quintile last year added 1 9 trillion to deficits over the coming decade a grand bargain spending bill last year that increased funding for both defense and nondefense programs here the democrats deserve a share of the blame also spilled plenty of red ink trump s plan for addressing these issues extend the plutocratic tax cuts currently slated to partially expire in 2025 which would add 1 trillion to deficits double down on defense spending increases and money for his border wall and then balance the budget on the backs of the nation s most vulnerable follow this author catherine rampell s opinions follow the president s 2020 budget proposal would slash government spending pretty much across the board on entitlements and other nondefense spending that includes programs such as food stamps low income housing assistance and social security disability insurance advertisement among the biggest spending categories on the chopping block is health care even though most americans want government to do more to improve access to affordable care not less despite campaign promises to the contrary trump s plan would slash hundred of billions of dollars from medicare over the next decade his budget also endorses enactment of the final and arguably worst affordable care act repeal bill that failed to make it out of the senate in 2017 known as cassidy graham this would lead to sharp cuts to medicaid and the subsidies for insurance purchased on the individual market exchanges the administration would also mandate that all states impose work requirements on medicaid a policy that has been disastrous in the first state to attempt it arkansas last year it resulted in more than 18 000 people getting kicked off benefit rolls with no evidence that it actually promoted work advertisement altogether the budget would make poverty deeper and more widespread increase the ranks of the uninsured exacerbate inequality and racial disparities and shrink opportunities for those trying to get ahead said robert greenstein president of the center on budget and policy priorities the trump administration says such tough choices will lead to a balanced budget which it claims it would achieve by 2034 but even that is untrue in fact the only way you end up with anything approximating balanced budgets even with some of these draconian cuts is by making delusional predictions about economic growth or put another way lying to the american people buried in the new budget is a table with the administration s forecasts for the economy according to the white house we should expect gross domestic product growth of about 3 percent as far as the eye can see advertisement unfortunately every independent forecaster or scorekeeper including the congressional budget office federal reserve international monetary fund and legions of private sector analysts says otherwise they all predicted that the u s economy would experience a short term burst of growth from trump s fiscal stimulus in 2018 and possibly for a year or so after eventually alas the sugar high will wear off and we ll return to our longer term trend of about 1 8 to 2 percent annual growth if the track record of recent forecasts is any guide even those estimates may be too optimistic in any case it s no accident that the white house s predictions are so far outside the consensus trump needs to promise magical levels of growth to get his math to work as i ve said before a good rule of thumb is that the more economic growth a politician promises the worse his or her economic proposals probably are advertisement now you could argue that the big lessons of this budget that trump cares little about the little guy and appears generally unconstrained by reality are things we already knew still every now and then it is useful to see the president lay it all out so clearly

our results calculated under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap in this earnings release we also present adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are non gaap measures and have been presented in this earnings release as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap we calculate adjusted ebitda as net income loss before net interest expense depreciation and amortization income tax expense benefit and before loss gain on sale of property plant and equipment impairment and exit charges transaction costs inventory step up impacting margins loss on business divestitures non cash compensation and certain other income and expenses such as the change in the tax receivable agreement liability adjusted ebitda margin represents adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales prior period amounts have been adjusted to reflect the current period calculation of adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are presented in this earnings release because they are important metrics used by management as one of the means by which it assesses our financial performance adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are also frequently used by analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our industry we use adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as supplements to gaap measures of performance to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies to make budgeting decisions to allocate resources and to compare our performance relative to our peers adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are also important measures for assessing our operating results and evaluating each operating segment s performance on a consistent basis by excluding the impacts of depreciation amortization income tax expense interest expense and other items not indicative of ongoing operating performance additionally these measures when used in conjunction with related gaap financial measures provide investors with additional financial analytical framework that management uses in addition to historical operating results as the basis for financial operational and planning decisions and present measurements that third parties have indicated are useful in assessing the company and its results of operations adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin have certain limitations adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to consolidated net income loss and in the case of our segment results adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to ebitda which the codm reviews for purposes of evaluating segment profit or in the case of any of the non gaap measures as a substitute for any other measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap similarly adjusted ebitda margin should not be considered as an alternative to gross margin or any other margin calculated in accordance with gaap these measures also should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items for which these non gaap measures make adjustments additionally adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not intended to be liquidity measures because of certain limitations such as i they do not reflect our cash outlays for capital expenditures or future contractual commitments ii they do not reflect changes in or cash requirements for working capital iii they do not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on indebtedness iv they do not reflect income tax expense or the tax necessary to pay income taxes and v although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and these non gaap measures do not reflect cash requirements for such replacements other companies including other companies in our industry may not use such measures or may calculate one or more of the measures differently than as presented in this earnings release limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure in evaluating adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments made in the calculations below and the presentation of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin should not be construed to mean that our future results will be unaffected by such adjustments management compensates for these limitations by using adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin as supplemental financial metrics and in conjunction with results prepared in accordance with gaap

the mekong river is often depicted as originating in the qinghai tibet plateau maps show it flowing downstream through china s southwest and then forming the borders of or flowing through laos myanmar and thailand before bisecting cambodia and vietnam s mekong delta on its 4 500 kilometre journey from the himalayas to the sea however the mekong has another point of origin the tonle sap lake in cambodia each year life springs from the lake mostly in the form of a massive fish population that migrates to the far reaches of the mekong system both upstream and downstream this annual migration provides tens of millions of households throughout the mekong basin with regular protein while the total catch from wild fisheries in all of north america s lakes and rivers is 160 000 tons each year the mekong system produces 2 6 million tons the tonle sap alone provides around 500 000 tons comprising 75 of cambodians protein intake and making it the world s largest freshwater fishery but this rich resource is threatened by upstream dam construction overfishing unregulated agricultural practices and climate change the problem of dams the stimson center recently published a report that explores the impact of human activities from a broader perspective it offers alternative development pathways to optimise trade offs between water energy and food production these approaches include basin wide water and energy planning and a deeper incorporation of non hydropower renewable energy sources into cambodia s future power mix these approaches can avoid upstream fragmentation between the tonle sap and the rest of the mekong system this way the monsoon pulse which each year reverses the direction of the river draining the lake and sending 70 times more water organic material and fish back into it can be preserved the annual flooding and draining of the lake acts as a heartbeat pumping life throughout the mekong basin this process is threatened by the construction of and future plans for hydropower and irrigation dams upstream of the tonle sap in cambodia laos vietnam and china dams and other built structures block or reduce flows in the mekong which reduces the amount of water fish and nutrients going into the tonle sap each year and also constricts the ability of fish to find upstream habitats in cambodia alone the connectivity of the country s 11 000 kilometres of the mekong tonle sap river system has already been reduced by 31 by the construction of two hydropower dams and six irrigation reservoirs the connectivity of the tonle sap and mekong tributaries in cambodia one of those hydropower dams the 400 megawatt lower sesan 2 located just below the confluence of the sesan and srepok rivers cut off more than 3 300 kilometres of tributaries to the rest of the mekong system and the tonle sap when it was completed in 2017 the fish ladders incorporated by the dam developer chinese state owned enterprise huaneng hydrolancang are unlikely to accommodate a meaningful quantity of fish in a system that is known to have as many as thirty tons swimming through in one hour during peak migration season further even if some fish do make it past the ladders to spawn upstream the eggs and fish larvae washed back downstream towards the tonle sap by the annual mekong flood pulse will likely sink and perish behind the dam as the river slows on its approach a 2013 peer reviewed article by guy ziv and colleagues which examined the impacts of tributary dams on the mekong system claims the lower sesan 2 dam will reduce the mekong s fish population by more than 9 our study finds that the cambodian tributaries of the mekong are being dammed one project at a time with no comprehensive plan damming tributaries rather than the mainstream could reduce connectivity between the tonle sap and the rest of the mekong system by 60 further building the controversial mainstream dams at sambor and stung treng would effectively annihilate tonle sap connectivity terminating the lake s rhythm many of the dams in cambodia s inventory are poised for development through memoranda of understanding or concession agreements with chinese dam developers how these chinese investments play out in the coming years could make or break cambodia s mekong the viability of the tonle sap and the tens of millions of people it supports only building dams in cambodia s portion of the mekong basin above the lower sesan 2 dam could be a pragmatic option that protects the tonle sap our study shows how this could result in the generation of more than 1 000 megawatts additional capacity whilst potentially having zero net effects on tonle sap connectivity and fisheries productivity compared to the status quo however such development should not be considered unless the resettlement needs of cambodia s upland and ethnic communities upstream of the lower sesan 2 dam can be met cambodia s track record on resettlement is inadequate villagers in northeastern cambodia affected by the lower sesan 2 dam celebrate international day of action for rivers image international rivers the region s solar belt alternatively the expansion of hydropower above the dam could be reduced or augmented by tapping into robust solar and wind endowments in cambodia s mondulkiri and ratanakiri provinces or exploiting wind solar and biomass capacity across the kingdom cambodia has some of the highest power prices in the whole of southeast asia as high as us 0 25 per kilowatt hour in urban areas whereas rural residents have often paid more than 80 cents much of the country still runs on diesel generators or imports power from vietnam or thailand pressures to lower electricity prices which would spur economic development have set cambodia on new pathways to expand its power generation mix the greatest opportunity for diversification of cambodia s energy mix and shifting away from over development of hydropower lies in non hydropower renewables on 65 of cambodia s land solar irradiation levels are above 1 800 kilowatt hours per square metre this offers a total solar potential of 8 000 megawatts which is significant given the country s 10 000 megawatts of hydropower potential cambodia s wind potential could be as high as 6 500 megawatts according to an asian development bank study in 2017 the asian development bank announced its support for the first 10 megawatt commercial scale solar farm in cambodia and then continued in june 2018 with the announcement of a 100 megawatt solar farm tender since then solar investment has become a hot topic in january 2019 prime minister hun sen visited beijing and met with the dam developer huaneng hydrolancang instead of signing agreements for new hydropower projects he inked deals for solar power the role of non hydro renewables in improving ecosystem services and the availability of natural resources such as water and freshwater fish catches is still undervalued while cambodia has yet to set hard targets for solar development new regulations and guidelines provide clarity for investors for example heavy consumers such as large apartment buildings factories and other large compounds can install solar above five megawatts while maintaining connections to cambodia s national grid the chip mong insee cement factory in kampot recently installed 9 8 megawatts of solar across its rooftops and in floating solar installations on its property cambodia s sole utility company electricity du cambodge is also moving toward the purchase of solar power from private producers this could lead to high levels of distributed generation across the country and encourage individual investments in solar development of a national environmental code is also expected to support household solar systems and provide tax breaks for companies that utilise solar power aside from regulation the major challenge to developing more solar power is land issuing economic land concessions to foreign developers most of them chinese has long been tied to land grabbing efforts some of these land concessions have been revoked due to lack of development and the government s redistribution processes others still lie fallow because of low agricultural commodity prices in recent years a portion of these deserted concessions if properly utilised could be used for solar farms especially those close to areas of high demand the map below shows that most land concessions are within the areas that receive the high solar radiation favourable to solar photovoltaic deployment cambodia s economic land concessions and solar potential with the help of foreign investors and development partners most countries in the mekong region are considering a greater role for solar and other non hydro renewables while the importance of renewables in reducing carbon emissions is increasingly understood the role that non hydro renewables can play in improving ecosystem services and the availability of natural resources such as water and freshwater fish catches is still undervalued our report demonstrates how cambodia can develop its power sector with a basin wide vision that not only conserves the fisheries of the tonle sap lake but also provides a pathway for the country to rise as a leader in sustainability and conservation efforts
there is precedent thailand s infamous tiger temple operated for years under the guise of tourism selling selfies with sedated big cats and breeding tigers for sale until 40 dead cubs were found in a freezer by wildlife investigators in june 2016 by september 2016 laos announced that it would phase out tiger farms within a year that failed to materialise and the situation remained in limbo until last may when laos prime minister thongloun sisoulith banned the construction of new tiger farms and recommended existing ones be turned into zoos or safari parks we definitely do not think that they should be converted into tourist attractions says debbie banks it will just be thailand s tiger temple all over again in may a cites conference to be held in sri lanka will set out plans to tackle the crisis particularly given how the landscape of the illegal trade has been altered in recent years online markets are playing a more and more important role in illegal trade of wild animals said a spokesperson for the united nations office on drugs and crime but inaction has stoked serious concerns within the wildlife community to the extent that international donors are funding an audit of tiger farms in laos one of the facilities the vinasakhone tiger farm close to the vietnam border can t account for the disappearance of about 300 tigers between 2016 and 2018 delays mean that the audit has not yet taken place but the hope is that it will finally apply proper scrutiny and transparency onto the facilities locals in the remote village of vannseng two hours drive from the capital vientiane spoke with excitement at mention of a nearby farm there are a lot of tigers there we can hear more than before he said a deep mournful roar rang out in the distance under the scorching midday sun this article was originally published by wired uk
in assessing last week s european central bank ecb monetary policy u turn in response to a weakening european economy two basic questions should be asked is there reason to expect that the ecb s policy measures will do very much to arrest the european economic slowdown might the ecb s move not have the unwelcome effect of weakening the euro and of thereby increasing trade tensions with the united states the most likely answers to those two questions would suggest that a far more appropriate economic policy response to the european economic slowdown than ecb loosening would have been a fiscal policy stimulus from those european countries like germany that have the fiscal space to loosen their budgets in response to the marked downgrade of its eurozone economic growth forecast to around 1 percent in 2019 the ecb announced a monetary policy loosening it did so by indicating that interest rates would not be raised until 2020 and that the ecb would not begin reducing the size of its balance sheet this year the ecb also announced a new targeted long term refinancing arrangement for the banks in an effort to induce them to increase their lending sadly the ecb s own recent experience with easy money would give reason to think that the latest monetary policy package will not do much to turn the european economy around this would especially seem to be the case at a time that the european economy is already slowing down markedly and at a time that it could soon be hit by a brexit or a us automobile import tariff shock over the past few years in response to the eurozone debt crisis the ecb resorted to a highly unorthodox monetary policy that included more than eur 2 trillion in quantitative easing negative deposit rates and multiple bank subsidies yet despite all of that monetary policy stimulus the european economic recovery proved to be both lackluster and short lived this being the case why should one now expect that a very much more limited set of ecb policy loosening measures would have much positive economic effect one thing that the ecb s move to an easier monetary policy stance must be expected to do is to further weaken the euro this risks opening up europe to further charges by the trump administration that the ecb is manipulating its currency with a view to gaining an unfair european competitive advantage that would hardly be helpful in improving us european trade relations at a time when the trump administration is already expressing displeasure with a strong dollar and when it is considering the desirability of imposing import tariffs on european automobiles in contrast to the ecb s policy loosening one would think that a well targeted fiscal policy stimulus by those european countries with the fiscal space to do so would have a salutary and meaningful effect on the european economic outlook at the same time unlike ecb policy loosening a german fiscal stimulus is likely to boost the euro by creating the conditions for european monetary policy to be less out of sync with that of the united states a german fiscal stimulus would also help improve us european trade relations by holding out the prospect of reducing the german current account surplus which at almost 8 percent of gdp substantially exceeds that of china it would do so by reducing german s large savings investment imbalance that underlies its very large external current account surplus all of this is not to say that the ecb loosening is not to be welcomed at a time that the italian economy is already in recession and that the german economy is on the cusp of a recession rather it is to suggest that the more appropriate policy response to the european economic slowdown would have been a german fiscal stimulus this is especially the case considering that such a stimulus might have helped reduce the large german external current account surplus that underlies the present poor state of us european trade relations

the 2019 budget but it s at least 13 billion less than what congress approved it s also about 14 billion less than what lawmakers approved for 2018 the cuts in the new spending plan would come largely

2021 the affordable care act would be replaced with grants that states could use to subsidize private insurance coverage and medicaid would be replaced with a block grant instead of the current open ended federal commitment future federal spending increases would be tied to the rate of general inflation which is lower than health care inflation ___ 12 25 p m president donald trump is seeking just over 93 billion for the department of veterans affairs in his budget proposal for 2020 an increase of 6 5 billion from the year before the president s request would support the implementation of a

washington ap proposed a record 4 7 trillion federal budget for 2020 on monday relying on optimistic 3 1 percent economic growth projections alongside accounting shuffles and steep domestic cuts to bring future spending into promised balance in 15 years the deficit is projected to hit 1 1 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year the highest in a decade the administration is counting on robust growth including from the republican tax cuts which trump wants to make permanent to push down the red ink some economists though say the bump from the tax cuts is waning and they project slower growth in coming years the national debt is 22 trillion even with his own projections trump s budget would not come into balance for a decade and a half rather than the traditional hope of balancing in 10 still trump contended the nation is experiencing an economic miracle he said in a letter to congress accompanying the plan that the country s next step must be turbocharging the industries of the future and establishing a new standard of living for the 21st century presidential budgets tend to be seen as aspirational blueprints rarely becoming enacted policy and trump s proposal for the new fiscal year which begins oct 1 sets up a showdown with congress over priorities including his push for 8 6 billion to build the u s mexico border wall titled trump s proposal embodies fiscal responsibility said russ vought the acting director of the office of management and budget despite the large projected deficits vought said the administration has prioritized reining in reckless washington spending and shows we can return to fiscal sanity the budget calls the approach maganomics after the president s make america great again campaign slogan some fiscal watchdogs though panned the effort as more piling on of debt by trump with no course correction in sight maya macguineas president of the said trump relies on far too many accounting gimmicks and fantasy assumptions and puts forward far too few actual solutions she warned the debt load will lead to slower income growth and stalled opportunities for americans perhaps most notably among spending proposals trump is reviving his border wall fight fresh off the longest government shutdown in history his 2020 plan shows he is eager to confront congress again over the wall trump s budget proposes increasing defense spending to 750 billion and building the new space force as a military branch while reducing nondefense accounts by 5 percent with cuts recommended to economic safety net programs used by many americans the 2 7 trillion in proposed spending cuts over the decade is higher than any administration in history they say the budget imposes work requirements for those receiving food stamps and other government aid as part of the cutbacks the department of housing and urban development faces a 16 percent cut and for education a 12 percent reduction trump s budget would re open two health care battles he lost in his first year in office repealing obamacare and limiting future federal spending on medicaid for low income people under the budget both programs would be turned over to the states starting in 2021 the plan sticks to budget caps that both parties have routinely broken in recent years to stay within the caps the budget shifts a portion of the defense spending some 165 billion to an overseas contingency fund which some fiscal hawks will view as an accounting gimmick conservatives railed for years against deficits that rose during the first years of barack obama s administration as tax revenue plummeted and spending increased during the great recession but even with republican control of congress during the first two years of the trump administration deficits were on a steady march upward the top democrat on the appropriation committee said the budget is not a serious proposal by refusing to raise the budget caps trump is signaling a fight ahead the president has resisted big bipartisan budget deals that break the caps threatening to veto one last year but congress will need to find agreement on spending levels to avoid another federal shutdown in the fall the democratic chairman of the house budget committee called the proposed cuts to essential services dangerous he said trump added nearly 2 trillion to deficits with the gop s tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations and now it appears his budget asks the american people to pay the price the democrat said while pushing down spending in some areas including the environmental protection agency the proposal will seek to increase funding in others to align with the president s priorities according to one official the administration would boost veterans affairs funding by 6 5 billion or 7 5 percent and says reducing veteran suicides would be a top priority the budget provides 291 million to defeat the hiv aids epidemic with hopes of eliminating 90 percent of new infections within 10 years it would also increase resources to fight the opioid epidemic with money for prevention treatment research and recovery the administration said it provides 500 million in new spending over the decade on child cancer research the proposal will also include 1 billion for a child care fund that would seek to improve access to care for underserved populations a white house official confirmed the one time allocation is championed by the president s daughter ivanka trump who has focused on economic advancement for women in her role as a white house adviser it also provides 200 billion toward infrastructure much lower than the 1 trillion plan trump once envisioned the plan says that money would be leveraged with private dollars but congress has largely panned that approach white house economic adviser larry kudlow said trump s budget points a steady glide path toward lower spending and borrowing as a share of the nation s economy he also told fox news sunday there was no reason to obsess about deficits and expressed confidence that economic growth would top 3 percent in 2019 and beyond others have predicted lower growth the border wall remains a signature issue for the president and is poised to stay at the forefront of his agenda even though congress has resisted giving him more money for it leading democrats immediately rejected the proposal congress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government the same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again said house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and senate democratic leader chuck schumer of new york they said the money would be better spent on rebuilding america in seeking 8 6 billion for more than 300 miles of new border wall the budget request would more than double the 8 1 billion already potentially available to the president for the wall after he declared a national emergency at the border last month in order to circumvent congress although there s no guarantee he ll be able to use that money if he faces a legal challenge as is expected along with border wall money the proposed budget will also increase funding to increase the manpower of immigration and customs enforcement officers and customs and border patrol at a time when many democrats are calling for cuts or even the elimination of those areas the budget also proposes policy changes to end sanctuary cities the administration said the budget arrives as the senate readies to vote this week to terminate trump s national emergency declaration the democratic led house already did so and a handful of republican senators uneasy over what they see as an overreach of executive power are expected to join senate democrats in following suit congress appears to have enough votes to reject trump s declaration but not enough to overturn a veto the standoff over the wall led to a 35 day partial government shutdown the longest in u s history the wall with mexico played a big part in trump s campaign for the white house and it s expected to again be featured in his 2020 re election effort he used to say mexico would pay for it but mexico has refused to do so ___ associated

in assessing last week s european central bank ecb monetary policy u turn in response to a weakening european economy two basic questions should be asked is there reason to expect that the ecb s policy measures will do very much to arrest the european economic slowdown might the ecb s move not have the unwelcome effect of weakening the euro and of thereby increasing trade tensions with the united states the most likely answers to those two questions would suggest that a far more appropriate economic policy response to the european economic slowdown than ecb loosening would have been a fiscal policy stimulus from those european countries like germany that have the fiscal space to loosen their budgets in response to the marked downgrade of its eurozone economic growth forecast to around 1 percent in 2019 the ecb announced a monetary policy loosening it did so by indicating that interest rates would not be raised until 2020 and that the ecb would not begin reducing the size of its balance sheet this year the ecb also announced a new targeted long term refinancing arrangement for the banks in an effort to induce them to increase their lending sadly the ecb s own recent experience with easy money would give reason to think that the latest monetary policy package will not do much to turn the european economy around this would especially seem to be the case at a time that the european economy is already slowing down markedly and at a time that it could soon be hit by a brexit or a us automobile import tariff shock over the past few years in response to the eurozone debt crisis the ecb resorted to a highly unorthodox monetary policy that included more than eur 2 trillion in quantitative easing negative deposit rates and multiple bank subsidies yet despite all of that monetary policy stimulus the european economic recovery proved to be both lackluster and short lived this being the case why should one now expect that a very much more limited set of ecb policy loosening measures would have much positive economic effect one thing that the ecb s move to an easier monetary policy stance must be expected to do is to further weaken the euro this risks opening up europe to further charges by the trump administration that the ecb is manipulating its currency with a view to gaining an unfair european competitive advantage that would hardly be helpful in improving us european trade relations at a time when the trump administration is already expressing displeasure with a strong dollar and when it is considering the desirability of imposing import tariffs on european automobiles in contrast to the ecb s policy loosening one would think that a well targeted fiscal policy stimulus by those european countries with the fiscal space to do so would have a salutary and meaningful effect on the european economic outlook at the same time unlike ecb policy loosening a german fiscal stimulus is likely to boost the euro by creating the conditions for european monetary policy to be less out of sync with that of the united states a german fiscal stimulus would also help improve us european trade relations by holding out the prospect of reducing the german current account surplus which at almost 8 percent of gdp substantially exceeds that of china it would do so by reducing german s large savings investment imbalance that underlies its very large external current account surplus all of this is not to say that the ecb loosening is not to be welcomed at a time that the italian economy is already in recession and that the german economy is on the cusp of a recession rather it is to suggest that the more appropriate policy response to the european economic slowdown would have been a german fiscal stimulus this is especially the case considering that such a stimulus might have helped reduce the large german external current account surplus that underlies the present poor state of us european trade relations
