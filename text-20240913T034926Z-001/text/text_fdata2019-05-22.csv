published wednesday 22 may 2019 print disqus by gary christenson how many times have you heard you can t eat gold as a reason not to own gold it is nonsense you can t eat gold either during good times or after an economic collapse but neither can you eat dollar bills euros bolivars or hundreds of other devaluing paper currencies in good times and in bad times gold is necessary for wealth protection a gold market will always exist and you can exchange your gold or silver for the items you need try exchanging confederate money yugoslavian dinars hungarian pengos weimar reichsmarks or hundreds of other failed currencies for food in 2019 you might starve with any currency or substitute sanctioned by a government or not ask yourself can you buy what you need with that currency dollars probably gold and silver yes either as barter or after an exchange will the currency retain value gold certainly paper dollars no is the currency recognized accepted and appreciated dollars are accepted in some countries gold and silver are accepted globally gold is eternal beautiful special and valuable paper currencies are not have you heard someone proclaim the streets of heaven are paved with federal reserve notes there is no fever like euro fever that software is the yen standard in the industry i thought not gold held a unique place throughout history until the banking cartel usurped control of money you know the drill bankers formerly loaned paper and demanded gold in return they know what is valuable print currency units donate to congresspersons and government leaders purchase favorable legislation and increase controls encourage sovereign corporate and private debt collect the interest expand influence and demand the masses work longer and harder to pay debts print paper currencies and buy real goods with those created from thin air currencies the swiss central bank bought billions of american stocks other central banks purchased gold with newly created paper currency units central banks demand secrecy and independence for obvious and nefarious reasons quote from a big box store employee in march 2019 everything is going up in price except our wages yes wages for most people flatlined even when adjusted by low ball inflation statistics since the 1970s however income and wealth for the political and financial elite grew rapidly central banks over print and devalue fiat debt based currency units prices rise faster than wages the rich get richer another perspective a gold coin in your hand inspires a sense of beauty value and wealth a piece of paper issued by a corrupt central bank mandated by an insolvent government and called a dollar yen euro or pound does not inspire a sense of beauty value or wealth we spend currency units knowing they decline in value every day we can buy overpriced stocks or underpriced silver but don t stuff paper dollars into a safe because they have a limited life expectancy and are a wasting asset debts even those from central banks and sovereign governments have counter party risk if the turkish economy collapses what are the paper currency units worth if xyz corporation files for bankruptcy what are its bonds worth if comex can t deliver the gold it has promised what are its paper gold contracts worth paper assets such as currencies stocks and bonds include currency risk if you deposit one million euros in a spanish bank a liability of the bank what is the value of your deposit if the bank fails what happens if the euro declines in purchasing power to a small fraction of its 2019 value you may receive 100 of your euros but enjoy only a small percentage of the value you entrusted with the bank would you prefer to be a millionaire when measured in venezuelan bolivars zimbabwe dollars turkish lira or polish zloty the big picture the world has chosen to use debt based currencies instead of gold and silver there are consequences debt has counterparty risk and currency risk gold does not debt fails when the full faith and credit narrative is no longer believable creditors of sovereign nations should realize they will be repaid only if the debtor nation borrows even more this is a flawed system history shows that out of control spending excessive debt and government corruption create consumer price inflation currency devaluation and wealth inequality at the extreme the value of your savings and retirement denominated in fiat currency units diminishes or vanishes question if perpetual borrowing is so bad why is it still working answer the world is 250 trillion in debt from too much borrowing if you jump off the empire state building it might seem like an enjoyable journey as you pass the 40th floor on the way down just because you and your currency have not yet crashed into the concrete does not mean either of you will survive question if debt based fiat currencies are so bad why do we use them answer we use them because they are convenient and dishonest why dishonest currency units enable bankers and politicians to manipulate and counterfeit them for their benefit this is less true with gold backed currency units question will nations return to fiscal and monetary sanity and a modified gold standard soon answer sadly no sanity will return only when other options fail look forward to more qe zero interest rates wealth taxes negative interest rates confiscations higher taxes and more nonsense question must all fraudulent ponzi systems including sovereign debt and currencies crash or reset answer yes question when will the crash or reset occur answer the crash is on going plan for additional fireworks in may and june 2019 originally written in march expect 2019 and 2020 to be difficult unless you own gold jim sinclair says the party is over mid 2019 from bill holter subscription service the economy is grossly slowing and may already be in reverse and this is important why because the huge bubble in debt from an already over levered position must be serviced by cash flow and cash flow can only be created by economic activity qe to infinity is now the reality that markets will need to understand and deal with from bill bonner rather than satisfy themselves with what they can squeeze out of the turnips in honest taxation the feds borrow from the future and then they bend the financial system by suppressing interest rates for example to make it

without an effectively functioning economy such objectives as fairness cannot be realised and political extremes flourish what britain needs to prosper socially and financially in the 2020s is a longer term strategy for sustainable growth which addresses the country s deep failings in respect of skills short term financial horizons and housing and now those of us who oppose brexit and economic nationalism generally face the challenge to say how we would improve the functioning of an economy damaged by the financial crisis and then again by brexit good economic management will be more critical than ever in the late 1960s and 1970s britain suffered from stagflation rates of inflation well above historic trends and occasionally reaching double figures leading to a balance of payments crisis under a fixed exchange rate system combined with slow growth relative to developed country comparators what followed was a revolution in policy terms which came to be known as thatcherism with similar reactions elsewhere notably the us a fundamental switch from state ownership and controls to much greater faith in private ownership and market freedom and with it toleration of greater inequalities independence for central banks to control inflation fiscal rules to stop the build up of unsustainable deficits and debt and full blooded engagement with an open globalised economy through trade financial markets international investment and to a degree migration the blair brown era of labour government cemented this transformation
treasuries kept their gains and the dollar was little changed following the release of the fomc minutes rate cut expectations are lower with the september meeting pricing in a 38 6 chance of a rate cut rates are going nowhere for some time balance sheet normalization participants resumed their discussion of issues related to balance sheet normalization with a focus on the long run maturity composition of the system open market account soma portfolio the staff presented two illustrative scenarios as a way of highlighting a range of implications of different long run target portfolio compositions in the first scenario the maturity composition of the u s treasury securities in the target portfolio was similar to that of the universe of currently outstanding u s treasury securities a proportional portfolio in the second the target portfolio contained only shorter term securities with maturities of three years or less a shorter maturity portfolio the staff provided estimates of the capacity that the committee would have under each scenario to provide economic stimulus through a maturity extension program mep the staff also provided estimates of the extent to which term premiums embedded in longer term treasury yields might be affected under the two different scenarios based on the staff s standard modeling framework all else equal a move to the illustrative shorter maturity portfolio would put significant upward pressure on term premiums and imply that the path of the federal funds rate would need to be correspondingly lower to achieve the same macroeconomic outcomes as in the baseline outlook however the staff noted the uncertainties inherent in the analysis including the difficulties in estimating the effects of changes in soma holdings on longer term interest rates and the economy more generally the staff presentation also considered illustrative gradual and accelerated transition paths to each long run target portfolio under the illustrative gradual transition reinvestments of maturing treasury holdings principal payments on agency mortgage backed securities mbs and purchases to accommodate growth in federal reserve liabilities would be directed to treasury securities with maturities in the long run target portfolio under the illustrative accelerated transition the reinvestment of principal payments on agency mbs and purchases to accommodate growth in federal reserve liabilities would be directed to treasury bills until the weighted average maturity wam of the soma portfolio reached the wam associated with the target portfolio depending on the combination of long run target composition and the transition plan for arriving at that composition the staff reported that in the illustrative scenarios it could take from 5 years to more than 15 years for the wam of the soma portfolio to reach its long run level in its statement regarding monetary policy implementation and balance sheet normalization the committee noted that it is prepared to adjust the size and composition of the balance sheet to achieve its macroeconomic objectives in a scenario in which the federal funds rate is constrained by the effective lower bound against this backdrop participants discussed the benefits and costs of alternative long run target portfolio compositions in supporting the use of balance sheet policies in such scenarios in their discussion of a shorter maturity portfolio many participants noted the advantage of increased capacity for the federal reserve to conduct an mep which could be helpful in providing policy accommodation in a future economic downturn given the secular decline in neutral real interest rates and the associated reduced scope for lowering the federal funds rate in response to negative economic shocks several participants viewed an mep as a useful initial option to address a future downturn in which the committee judged that it needed to employ balance sheet actions to provide appropriate policy accommodation participants acknowledged the staff analysis suggesting that creating space to conduct an mep by moving to a shorter maturity portfolio composition could boost term premiums and result in a lower path for the federal funds rate reducing the capacity to ease financial conditions with adjustments in short term rates a number of participants noted however that the estimates of the effect of a move to a shorter maturity portfolio composition on the long run neutral federal funds rate are subject to substantial uncertainty and are based on a number of strong modeling assumptions for example estimates of term premium effects based on experience during the crisis could overstate the effects that would be associated with a gradual evolution of the composition of the soma portfolio in addition a shift in the composition of the soma portfolio could result in changes in the supply of securities that would tend to offset upward pressure on term premiums nonetheless other participants expressed concern about the potential that a shorter maturity portfolio composition could result in a lower long run neutral federal funds rate moreover while a shorter maturity portfolio would provide substantial capacity to conduct an mep some participants raised questions about the effectiveness of meps as a policy tool relative to that of the federal funds rate or other unconventional policy tools these participants noted that in a situation in which it would be appropriate to employ unconventional policy tools they likely would prefer to employ forward guidance or large scale purchases of assets ahead of an mep in the view of these participants the potential benefit of transitioning to a shorter maturity soma composition in terms of increased ability to conduct an mep might not be worth the potential costs in their discussion of a proportional portfolio composition participants observed that moving to this target soma composition would not be expected to have much effect on current staff estimates of term premiums and thus would likely not reduce the scope for lowering the target range for the federal funds rate target in response to adverse economic shocks as a result several participants judged the proportional target composition to be well aligned with the committee s previous statements that changes in the target range for the federal funds rate are the primary means by which the committee adjusts the stance of monetary policy in addition several participants noted that while the staff analysis suggested a proportional portfolio would not contain as much capacity to conduct an mep as a shorter maturity portfolio it still would contain meaningful capacity along these lines some participants noted that a proportional portfolio would also help maintain the traditional separation between the federal reserve s decisions regarding the composition of the soma portfolio and the maturity composition of treasury debt held by the private sector however a number of participants judged that it would be desirable to structure the soma portfolio in a way that would provide more capacity to conduct an mep than in the proportional portfolio in addition a couple of participants noted that a shorter maturity portfolio would maintain a narrow gap between the average maturity of the assets in the soma portfolio and the short average maturity of the federal reserve s primary liabilities participants also discussed the financial stability implications that could be associated with alternative long run target portfolio compositions a couple of participants noted that a proportional portfolio could imply a relatively flat yield curve which could result in greater incentives for reach for yield behavior in the financial system that said a few participants noted that a shorter maturity portfolio could affect financial stability risks by increasing the incentives for the private sector to issue short term debt a couple of participants judged that financial market functioning might be adversely affected if the holdings in the shorter maturity portfolio accounted for too large a share of total shorter maturity treasury securities outstanding in discussing the transition to the desired long run soma portfolio composition several participants noted that a gradual pace of transition could help avoid unwanted effects on financial conditions however participants observed that the gradual transition paths described in the staff presentation would take many years to complete against this backdrop a few participants discussed the possibility of following some type of accelerated transition perhaps including sales of the soma s residual holdings of agency mbs in addition several participants suggested that the committee could communicate its plans about the soma portfolio composition in terms of a desired change over an intermediate horizon rather than a specific long run target several participants expressed the view that a decision regarding the long run composition of the portfolio would not need to be made for some time and a couple of participants highlighted the importance of making such a decision in the context of the ongoing review of the federal reserve s monetary policy strategies tools and communications practices some participants noted the importance of developing an effective communication plan to describe the committee s decisions regarding the long run target composition for the soma portfolio and the transition to that target composition developments in financial markets and open market operations the manager of the soma reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period in the united states prices for equities and other risk assets reportedly were buoyed by perceptions of an accommodative stance of monetary policy incoming economic data pointing to continued solid economic expansion and some signs of receding downside risks to the global outlook treasury yields declined over the period adding to their substantial drop since september and the expected path of the federal funds rate as implied by futures prices shifted down as well market participants attributed these moves in part to fomc communications indicating that the committee would continue to be patient in evaluating the need for any further adjustments of the target range for the federal funds rate softer incoming data on inflation may also have contributed to the downward revision in the expected path of policy nearly all respondents on the open market desk s latest surveys of primary dealers and market participants anticipated that the federal funds target range would be unchanged for the remainder of the year in reviewing global developments the manager noted that market prices appeared to reflect perceptions of improved economic prospects in china however investors reportedly remained concerned about the economic outlook for europe and the united kingdom the manager also reported on developments related to open market operations in light of the declines in interest rates since november last year principal payments on the federal reserve s holdings of agency mbs were projected to exceed the 20 billion redemption cap by a modest amount sometime this summer as directed by the committee any principal payments received on agency mbs in excess of the cap would be reinvested in agency mbs the desk planned to conduct any such operations by purchasing uniform mbs rather than fannie mae and freddie mac securities consistent with the balance sheet normalization principles and plans released following the march meeting reinvestments of maturing treasury securities beginning on may 2 would be based on a cap on monthly treasury redemptions of 15 billion down from the 30 billion monthly redemption cap that had been in place since october of last year the deputy manager reviewed developments in domestic money markets reserve balances declined by 150 billion over the intermeeting period and reached a low point of just below 1 5 trillion on april 23 the decline in reserves stemmed from a reduction in the soma s agency mbs and treasury holdings of 46 billion reducing the soma portfolio to 3 92 trillion and from a shift in the composition of liabilities predominantly related to the increase in the treasury general account tga the tga was volatile during the intermeeting period in early april the treasury reduced bill issuance and allowed the tga balance to fall in anticipation of individual tax receipts as tax receipts arrived after the tax date the tga rose to more than 400 billion resulting in a sharp decline in reserves over the last two weeks of april against this backdrop the distribution of rates on traded volumes in overnight unsecured markets shifted higher the effective federal funds rate effr moved up to 2 45 percent by the end of the intermeeting period 5 basis points above the interest on excess reserves ioer rate several factors appeared to spur this upward pressure tax related runoffs in deposits at banks reportedly led banks to increase short term borrowing particularly through federal home loan bank fhlb advances and in the federal funds market although some banks continued to hold large quantities of reserves other banks were operating with reserve balances closer to their lowest comfortable levels as reported in the most recent senior financial officer survey this distribution of reserves may have contributed to somewhat more sustained upward pressure on the federal funds rate than had been experienced in recent years around tax payment dates in addition rates on treasury repurchase agreements repo were in part pushed higher by tax related outflows from government only money market mutual funds and a corresponding decline in repo lending by those funds elevated repo rates contributed to upward pressure on the federal funds rate as fhlbs reportedly shifted some of their liquidity investments out of federal funds and into the repo market in addition some market participants pointed to heightened demand for federal funds at month end by some banks in connection with their efforts to meet liquidity coverage ratio requirements as contributing to upward pressure on the federal funds rate the deputy manager also discussed a staff proposal in which the board would implement a 5 basis point technical adjustment to the interest on required reserves iorr and ioer rates the proposed action would bring these rates to 15 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate and 10 basis points above the bottom of the range and the overnight reverse repurchase agreement on rrp offer rate as with the previous technical adjustments in june and december 2018 the proposed adjustment was intended to foster trading in the federal funds market well within the target range established by the fomc a technical adjustment would reduce the spread between the ioer rate and the on rrp offering rate to 10 basis points the smallest since the introduction of the on rrp facility the staff judged that the narrower spread did not pose a significant risk of increased take up at the on rrp facility because repo rates had been trading well above the on rrp offer rate for some time however if it became appropriate in the future to further lower the ioer rate the staff noted that the committee might wish to first consider where to set the on rrp offer rate relative to the target range for the federal funds rate to mitigate this risk the manager concluded the briefing on financial market developments and open market operations with a review of the role of standing swap lines in supporting financial stability he recommended that the committee vote to renew these swap lines at this meeting following the usual annual schedule the committee voted unanimously to renew the reciprocal currency arrangements with the bank of canada and the bank of mexico these arrangements are associated with the federal reserve s participation in the north american framework agreement of 1994 in addition the committee voted unanimously to renew the dollar and foreign currency liquidity swap arrangements with the bank of canada the bank of england the bank of japan the european central bank and the swiss national bank the votes to renew the federal reserve s participation in these standing arrangements occur annually at the april or may fomc meeting by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period staff review of the economic situation the information available for the april 30 may 1 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product gdp increased at a solid rate in the first quarter even as household spending and business fixed investment rose more slowly in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter of last year consumer price inflation as measured by the 12 month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce declined on net in recent months and was somewhat below 2 percent in march survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations were little changed total nonfarm payroll employment recorded a strong gain in march and the unemployment rate held steady at 3 8 percent the labor force participation rate declined a little in march after having risen on balance in the previous few months and the employment to population ratio edged down the unemployment rates for african americans asians and hispanics in march were at or below their levels at the end of the previous economic expansion though persistent differentials in unemployment rates across groups remained the share of workers employed part time for economic reasons edged up in march but was still below the lows reached in late 2007 the rate of private sector job openings in february declined slightly from the elevated level that prevailed for much of the past year while the rate of quits was unchanged at a high level the four week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through mid april was near historically low levels average hourly earnings for all employees rose 3 2 percent over the 12 months ending in march a somewhat faster pace than a year earlier the employment cost index for private sector workers increased 2 8 percent over the 12 months ending in march the same as a year earlier industrial production edged down in march and for the first quarter overall manufacturing output declined moderately in the first quarter primarily reflecting a decrease in the output of motor vehicles and parts outside of motor vehicles and parts manufacturing production was little changed mining output declined on net over the three months ending in march automakers assembly schedules suggested that the production of light motor vehicles would move up in the near term and new orders indexes from national and regional manufacturing surveys pointed to modest gains in overall factory output in the coming months however industry news indicated that aircraft production would slow in the second quarter consumer expenditures slowed in the first quarter but monthly data suggested some improvement toward the end of the quarter real pce increased at a robust pace in march after having been unchanged in february perhaps partly reflecting a delay in tax refunds from february into march that was due in part to the partial government shutdown similarly sales of light motor vehicles rose sharply in march although the average pace of sales in the first quarter was slower than in the fourth quarter key factors that influence consumer spending including a low unemployment rate ongoing gains in real labor compensation and still elevated measures of households net worth were supportive of solid near term gains in consumer expenditures in addition consumer sentiment as measured by the university of michigan surveys of consumers edged down in april but was still upbeat the staff reported preliminary analysis of the levels of and trends in average household wealth by racial and ethnic groups as measured by the federal reserve board s distributional financial accounts initiative real residential investment declined at a slower rate in the first quarter than it did over the course of 2018 after an appreciable uptick in january starts of new single family homes fell in february and were little changed in march meanwhile starts of multifamily units rose in february and stayed at that level in march building permit issuance for new single family homes which tends to be a good indicator of the underlying trend in construction of such homes declined a little in february and march sales of both new and existing homes increased on net over the february and march period growth in real private expenditures for business equipment and intellectual property slowed in the first quarter reflecting both a slower increase in transportation equipment spending after a strong fourth quarter gain and a decline in spending on other types of equipment outside of high tech nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were little changed on net in february and march but they rose for the quarter as a whole forward looking indicators of business equipment spending pointed to sluggish increases in the near term orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased noticeably in march but were only a little above the level of shipments and readings on business sentiment improved a bit but were still softer than last year real business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector increased somewhat in the first quarter after having declined for several quarters investment in drilling and mining structures moved down in the first quarter and the number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector declined on net from mid march through late april total real government purchases increased in the first quarter real purchases by the federal government were unchanged as a relatively strong increase in defense purchases was offset by a decline in nondefense purchases stemming from the effects of the partial federal government shutdown real purchases by state and local governments increased briskly payrolls of those governments expanded solidly in the first quarter and nominal state and local construction spending rose markedly the nominal u s international trade deficit narrowed significantly in january and a touch more in february after declining in december the value of u s exports rose in january and february however the average dollar value of exports in the first two months of the year was only slightly above its fourth quarter value imports fell in january before edging a touch higher in february with the average of the two months declining relative to the fourth quarter the bureau of economic analysis estimated that the contribution of net exports to real gdp growth in the first quarter was about 1 percentage point total u s consumer prices as measured by the pce price index increased 1 5 percent over the 12 months ending in march this increase was somewhat slower than a year earlier as core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices slowed to 1 6 percent consumer food price inflation was a bit below core inflation and consumer energy prices were little changed the trimmed mean measure of pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas was 2 0 percent over that 12 month period the consumer price index cpi rose 1 9 percent over the 12 months ending in march while core cpi inflation was 2 0 percent recent readings on survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the michigan survey the survey of professional forecasters and the desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants were little changed foreign economic growth in the first quarter was mixed among the emerging market economies emes real gdp contracted in south korea and mexico but activity in china strengthened supported by tax cuts and the easing of credit conditions in the advanced foreign economies economic indicators were downbeat in japan but elsewhere pointed to some improvement from a weak fourth quarter gdp growth rebounded in the euro area and also appeared to pick up in canada and the united kingdom foreign inflation slowed further early this year partly reflecting lower retail energy prices staff review of the financial situation investor sentiment continued to improve over the intermeeting period broad equity price indexes rose notably and corporate bond spreads narrowed amid a decline in market volatility and financing conditions for businesses and households also eased market participants cited more accommodative than expected monetary policy communications coupled with strong u s and chinese data releases and positive sentiment about trade negotiations between the united states and china as factors that contributed to these developments communications following the march fomc meeting were generally viewed by investors as having a more accommodative tone than expected the market implied path for the federal funds rate shifted downward modestly on net resulting in a flat to slightly downward sloping expected path of the policy rate over the next few fomc meetings market participants assigned greater probability to a lower target range of the federal funds rate than to a higher one beyond the next few meetings yields on nominal treasury securities declined modestly on net during the intermeeting period investors cited larger than expected downward revisions in fomc participants assessments of the future path of the policy rate in the summary of economic projections recent communications suggesting a patient approach to monetary policy and weaker than expected euro area data releases early in the period among factors that contributed to this decrease these factors reportedly outweighed stronger than expected economic data releases for the united states and china and optimism related to trade negotiations between the two countries later in the period measures of inflation compensation based on treasury inflation protected securities were changed little on net and remained below their early fall 2018 levels major u s equity price indexes increased over the intermeeting period with the s p 500 equity index returning to the levels it reached before its decline in the last quarter of 2018 following the march fomc meeting bank stock prices declined reportedly on concerns about the potential effects of a flat or inverted yield curve on bank profits bank stocks subsequently retraced this decline partly in response to strong first quarter earnings at some of the largest u s banks ending the period a bit higher on net option implied volatility on the s p 500 the vix decreased to a low level last seen in september 2018 yields on corporate bonds continued to decline and spreads over yields of comparable maturity treasury securities narrowed conditions in short term funding markets remained stable during the intermeeting period the effr rose to 5 basis points above the ioer rate after the federal income tax deadline on april 15 while a similar dynamic occurred around previous tax dates the magnitude of the change was larger than in previous years spreads on commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposits changed little across the maturity spectrum global sovereign yields declined along with u s treasury yields following the march fomc meeting foreign equity prices increased on balance amid optimism around trade negotiations between the united states and china stronger than expected chinese data and accommodative communications from some foreign central banks pronounced political and policy uncertainties led to a significant tightening of financial conditions in turkey argentina and to a lesser extent brazil but spillovers to other emes were limited and eme credit spreads were generally little changed on net the broad dollar index increased modestly supported by the strength of u s economic data relative to foreign data and the accommodative tone from foreign central banks the british pound declined over the intermeeting period amid protracted discussions ahead of the original brexit deadline which was extended to october 31 financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses remained generally accommodative during the intermeeting period gross issuance of corporate bonds was strong against a backdrop of narrower corporate spreads and improved risk sentiment issuance of institutional leveraged loans increased but refinancing volumes were low and loans spreads remained somewhat elevated respondents to the april 2019 senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices sloos reported easing some key terms for commercial and industrial c i loans to large and middle market firms for instance banks reported narrowing loan rate spreads easing loan covenants and increasing the maximum size and reducing the costs of credit lines to these firms c i loans on banks balance sheets grew at a robust pace in the first quarter of 2019 gross equity issuance edged up later in the period and the volume of corporate bond upgrades slightly outpaced that of downgrades suggesting that credit quality of nonfinancial corporations on balance improved financing conditions for the commercial real estate cre sector remained accommodative and issuance of agency and non agency commercial mortgage backed securities grew steadily cre loans on banks balance sheets continued to grow in the first quarter albeit at a slower pace than in previous quarters banks in the april sloos reported weaker demand across all major types of cre loans however they also reported tightening lending standards for these loans financing conditions in the residential mortgage market also remained supportive over the intermeeting period home mortgage rates decreased about 5 basis points to levels comparable with 2017 consistent with lower mortgage rates home purchase mortgage originations increased reversing a yearlong decline consumer credit conditions remained broadly supportive of growth in household spending with all categories of consumer loans recording steady growth in the first quarter according to the april sloos commercial banks left lending standards for auto loans and other consumer loans unchanged in the first quarter however credit card interest rates rose and standards reportedly tightened for some borrowers the staff provided an update on its assessments of potential risks to financial stability the staff judged asset valuation pressures in equity and corporate debt markets to have increased significantly this year though not quite to the elevated levels that prevailed for much of last year the staff also reported that in the leveraged loan market risk spreads had narrowed and nonprice terms had loosened further the build up in overall nonfinancial business debt to levels close to historical highs relative to gdp was viewed as a factor that could amplify adverse shocks to the business sector and the economy more broadly the staff continued to judge risks associated with household sector debt as moderate both the risks associated with financial leverage and the vulnerabilities related to maturity transformation were viewed as being low as they have been for some time the staff also noted that the sustained growth of lending by banks to nonbank financial firms represented an increase in financial interconnectedness staff economic outlook the projection for u s economic activity prepared by the staff for the april may fomc meeting was revised up on net real gdp growth was forecast to slow in the near term from its solid first quarter pace as sizable contributions from inventory investment and net exports were not expected to persist the projection for real gdp growth over the medium term was revised up primarily reflecting a lower assumed path for interest rates a slightly higher trajectory for equity prices and somewhat less appreciation of the broad real dollar the staff s lower path for interest rates reflected a methodological change in how the staff sets its assumptions about the future path for the federal funds rate in its forecast real gdp was forecast to expand at a rate above the staff s estimate of potential output growth in 2019 and 2020 and then slow to a pace below potential output growth in 2021 the unemployment rate was projected to decline a little further below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate and to bottom out in late 2020 with labor market conditions still judged to be tight the staff continued to assume that projected employment gains would manifest in smaller than usual downward pressure on the unemployment rate and in larger than usual upward pressure on the labor force participation rate the staff s forecast for inflation was revised down slightly reflecting some recent softer than expected readings on consumer price inflation that were not expected to persist along with the staff s assessment that the level to which inflation would tend to move in the absence of resource slack or supply shocks was a bit lower in the medium term than previously assumed as a result core pce price inflation was expected to move up in the near term but nevertheless to run just below 2 percent over the medium term total pce price inflation was forecast to run a bit below core inflation in 2020 and 2021 reflecting projected declines in energy prices the staff viewed the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years the staff also saw the risks to the forecasts for real gdp growth and the unemployment rate as roughly balanced on the upside household spending and business investment could expand faster than the staff projected supported by the tax cuts enacted at the end of 2017 still strong overall labor market conditions favorable financial conditions and upbeat consumer sentiment on the downside the softening in some economic indicators since late last year could be the leading edge of a significant slowing in the pace of economic growth moreover trade policies and foreign economic developments could move in directions that have significant negative effects on u s economic growth risks to the inflation projection also were seen as balanced the upside risk that inflation could increase more than expected in an economy that was still projected to be operating notably above potential for an extended period was counterbalanced by the downside risks that recent soft data on consumer prices could persist and that longer term inflation expectations may be lower than was assumed in the staff forecast as well as the possibility that the dollar could appreciate if foreign economic conditions deteriorated participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook participants agreed that labor markets had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a solid rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had stayed low participants also observed that growth in household spending and business fixed investment had slowed in the first quarter overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy both measured on a 12 month basis had declined and were running below 2 percent on balance market based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months and survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed participants continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity with strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes participants noted the unexpected strength in first quarter gdp growth but some observed that the composition of growth with large contributions from inventories and net exports and more modest contributions from consumption and investment suggested that gdp growth in the near term would likely moderate from its strong pace of last year for this year as a whole a number of participants mentioned that they had marked up their projections for real gdp growth reflecting in part the strong first quarter reading participants cited continuing strength in labor market conditions improvements in consumer confidence and in financial conditions or diminished downside risks both domestically and abroad as factors likely to support solid growth over the remainder of the year some participants observed that in part because of the waning impetus from fiscal policy and past removal of monetary policy accommodation they expected real gdp growth to slow over the medium term moving back toward their estimates of trend output growth in their discussion of the household sector participants discussed recent indicators including retail sales and light motor vehicle sales for march which rose from relatively weak readings in some previous months taken together these developments suggested that the first quarter softness in household spending was likely to prove temporary with the strong jobs market rising incomes and upbeat consumer sentiment growth in pce in coming months was expected to be solid several participants also noted that while the housing sector had been a drag on gdp growth for some time recent data pointed to some signs of stabilization with mortgage rates at their lowest levels in more than a year a few participants thought that residential construction could begin to make positive contributions to gdp growth in the near term a few others were less optimistic participants noted that growth of business fixed investment had moderated in the first quarter relative to the average pace recorded last year and discussed whether this more moderate growth was likely to persist a number of participants expressed optimism that there would be continued growth in capital expenditures this year albeit probably at a slower pace than in 2018 several participants observed that financial conditions and business sentiment had continued to improve consistent with reports from business contacts in a number of districts however a few others reported less buoyant business sentiment many participants suggested that their own concerns from earlier in the year about downside risks from slowing global economic growth and the deterioration in financial conditions or similar concerns expressed by their business contacts had abated to some extent however a few participants noted that ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector including those associated with trade uncertainty and low prices had been exacerbated by severe flooding in recent weeks participants observed that inflation pressures remained muted and that the most recent data on overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had come in lower than expected at least part of the recent softness in inflation could be attributed to idiosyncratic factors that seemed likely to have only transitory effects on inflation including unusually sharp declines in the prices of apparel and of portfolio management services some research suggests that idiosyncratic factors that largely affected acylical sectors in the economy had accounted for a substantial portion of the fluctuations in inflation over the past couple of years consistent with the view that recent lower inflation readings could be temporary a number of participants mentioned the trimmed mean measure of pce price inflation produced by the federal reserve bank of dallas which removes the influence of unusually large changes in the prices of individual items in either direction these participants observed that the trimmed mean measure had been stable at or close to 2 percent over recent months participants continued to view inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcome but in light of recent softer inflation readings some viewed the downside risks to inflation as having increased some participants also expressed concerns that long term inflation expectations could be below levels consistent with the committee s 2 percent target or at risk of falling below that level participants agreed that labor market conditions remained strong job gains in the march employment report were solid the unemployment rate remained low and while the labor force participation rate moved down a touch it remained high relative to estimates of its underlying demographically driven downward trend contacts in a number of districts continued to report shortages of qualified workers in some cases inducing businesses to find novel ways to attract new workers a few participants commented that labor market conditions in their districts were putting upward pressure on compensation levels for lower wage jobs although there were few reports of a broad based pickup in wage growth several participants noted that business contacts expressed optimism that despite tight labor markets they would be able to find workers or would find technological solutions for labor shortage problems participants commented on risks associated with their outlook for economic activity over the medium term some participants viewed risks to the downside for real gdp growth as having decreased partly because prospects for a sharp slowdown in global economic growth particularly in china and europe had diminished these improvements notwithstanding most participants observed that downside risks to the outlook for growth remain in discussing developments in financial markets a number of participants noted that financial market conditions had improved following the period of stress observed over the fourth quarter of last year and that the volatility in prices and financial conditions had subsided these factors were thought to have helped buoy consumer and business confidence or to have mitigated short term downside risks to the real economy more generally the improvement in financial conditions was regarded by many participants as providing support for the outlook for economic growth and employment among those participants who commented on financial stability most highlighted recent developments related to leveraged loans and corporate bonds as well as the current high level of nonfinancial corporate indebtedness a few participants suggested that heightened leverage and associated debt burdens could render the business sector more sensitive to economic downturns than would otherwise be the case a couple of participants suggested that increases in bank capital in current circumstances with solid economic growth and strong profits could help support financial and macroeconomic stability over the longer run a couple of participants observed that asset valuations in some markets appeared high relative to fundamentals a few participants commented on the positive role that the board s semi annual financial stability report could play in facilitating public discussion of risks that could be present in some segments of the financial system in their discussion of monetary policy participants agreed that it would be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1 4 to 2 1 2 percent participants judged that the labor market remained strong and that information received over the intermeeting period showed that economic activity grew at a solid rate however both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and were running below the committee s 2 percent objective a number of participants observed that some of the risks and uncertainties that had surrounded their outlooks earlier in the year had moderated including those related to the global economic outlook brexit and trade negotiations that said these and other sources of uncertainty remained in light of global economic and financial developments as well as muted inflation pressures participants generally agreed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate remained appropriate participants noted that even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve a patient approach would likely remain warranted especially in an environment of continued moderate economic growth and muted inflation pressures participants discussed the potential policy implications of continued low inflation readings many participants viewed the recent dip in pce inflation as likely to be transitory and participants generally anticipated that a patient approach to policy adjustments was likely to be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective several participants also judged that patience in adjusting policy was consistent with the committee s balanced approach to achieving its objectives in current circumstances in which resource utilization appeared to be high while inflation continued to run below the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective however a few participants noted that if the economy evolved as they expected the committee would likely need to firm the stance of monetary policy to sustain the economic expansion and keep inflation at levels consistent with the committee s objective or that the committee would need to be attentive to the possibility that inflation pressures could build quickly in an environment of tight resource utilization in contrast a few other participants observed that subdued inflation coupled with real wage gains roughly in line with productivity growth might indicate that resource utilization was not as high as the recent low readings of the unemployment rate by themselves would suggest several participants commented that if inflation did not show signs of moving up over coming quarters there was a risk that inflation expectations could become anchored at levels below those consistent with the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective a development that could make it more difficult to achieve the 2 percent inflation objective on a sustainable basis over the longer run participants emphasized that their monetary policy decisions would continue to depend on their assessments of the economic outlook and risks to the outlook as informed by a wide range of data committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for the period ahead members judged that the information received since the committee met in march indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had risen at a solid rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low growth of household spending and business fixed investment had slowed in the first quarter on a 12 month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and were running below 2 percent on balance market based measures of inflation compensation had remained low in recent months and survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed in their consideration of the economic outlook members noted that financial conditions had improved since the turn of the year and many uncertainties affecting the u s and global economic outlooks had receded though some risks remained despite solid economic growth and a strong labor market inflation pressures remained muted members continued to view sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes for the u s economy in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures members concurred that the committee could be patient as it determined what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support those outcomes after assessing current conditions and the outlook for economic activity the labor market and inflation members decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 1 4 to 2 1 2 percent members agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to the committee s maximum employment and symmetric 2 percent inflation objectives they reiterated that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments more generally members noted that decisions regarding near term adjustments of the stance of monetary policy would appropriately remain dependent on the evolution of the outlook as informed by incoming data with regard to the postmeeting statement members agreed to remove references to a slowing in the pace of economic growth and little changed payroll employment consistent with stronger incoming information on these indicators the description of growth in household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter was revised to recognize that incoming data had confirmed earlier information that suggested these aspects of economic activity had slowed at that time members also agreed to revise the description of inflation to note that inflation for items other than food and energy had declined and was now running below 2 percent members observed that a patient approach to determining future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate would likely remain appropriate for some time especially in an environment of moderate economic growth and muted inflation pressures even if global economic and financial conditions continued to improve at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma

hostilities although security issues are at stake both the zte case and now huawei is intricately related to trade as well there is some thought that trump would lift the ban if it ensured a comprehensive trade agreement meanwhile reports suggest that the us is considering banning as many as five chinese firms that provide surveillance products e g hikvision and dahua at the same time china reiterated its willingness to address the bilateral trade imbalance by buying more us products and services this has been a chinese offer since the us backed out of the trade agreement struck by treasury secretary mnuchin a year ago between the trade tensions between the us and china the slowing of the chinese economy and widespread weakness in semiconductors and autos continues to take a toll on the region yesterday s news of a steep 11 7 decline in exports in the first 20 days of may followed news of a decline in singapore s non oil exports and has been echoed today by the fifth

cutting rates we expected the minutes to show that their rhetoric is serious and sincere after being surprised by the strength of q1 gdp officials can look past what appears to be a soft q2 pace less than 2 however even the dovish contingent like bullard is content with the status quo he may be the first fed official to say that the central bank may have slightly overdone it with the december hike

recent us media reports claim china may depreciate its renminbi to cope with shrinking exports yet economic realities are precisely the reverse worse trade wars are about to hit american consumers recently the white house lifted tariffs to 25 from 10 on 200 billion of chinese goods while targeting another 300 billion worth of chinese imports for potential punitive tariffs as was to be expected the renminbi depreciated from 6 7 to more than 6 9 against the us dollar mainly on renewed trade tensions china retaliated by imposing duties on 60 billion of us goods starting june 1 china could have retaliated hard but opted for a mild response that highlights the importance of talks i love the position we re in president trump said recently yet the movement of the renminbi may not be to the liking of the white house since it is likely to offset the tariff impact trump tariffs impact on chinese and asian currencies until trump s tariff escalation chinese renminbi was around 6 80 against the us dollar that however was predicated on the expectation that cooler heads would prevail in the white house and a broad scale trade war was avoidable when president trump opted for tariff escalation markets reacted quite expectedly for now the chinese currency has only reversed its appreciation year to date as trump prepares to raise and broaden us tariffs even more chinese renminbi could depreciate more but that is the white house s choice not beijing s preference indeed trump s tariffs have paced the renminbi fluctuations ever since the start of his trade wars see figure figure how trump tariffs reverberate in renminbi movements in light of these facts the claim that china is depreciating the renminbi is simply flawed depreciation is precisely what china seeks to avoid when exports shrink a light depreciation of the currency is of no help and if the renminbi would depreciate significantly in a short period of time it would foster worries about capital flight that s why chinese government has done precisely the reverse to avoid steeper depreciation and capital outflows the people s bank of china pboc recently set a stronger than expected daily fixing of the exchange rate the central bank is likely to try to keep the renminbi below 7 per dollar the depreciation of the renminbi is in line with that of other emerging asia currencies that have taken hits including indonesian rupiah singapore dollar malaysian ringgit the indian rupee and the exhausted south korean won by the same token trump s tariff escalation is likely to cause a negative spillover effect among the same currencies ironically those countries that may suffer most of the pain taiwan south korea and vietnam are closest us allies in asia but also targets for next tariff wars in the future trump seems intent to target europe japan south korea and emerging southeast asia tariff wars collateral damage in the us a year ago larry kudlow trump s director of national economic council was still gung ho about us supremacy in the tariff war recently he admitted that american consumers will pay for the trump trade wars in the us his reversal is seen as betrayal of american public and rightly so as washington post put it trump s own top economic adviser gives lie to his trade war rhetoric here are the inconvenient truths a broad scale trade war could penalize 0 5 to 0 8 off real us gdp growth while earnings growth could be shaved off by 3 or more effectively halving the figure auto sales are a barometer of what s to come in 2019 chinese auto sales could decline by 3 but in the us by almost 4 in 2020 us sales could remain in the red but chinese sales could increase according to us data unsurprisingly several us lawmakers are finally slamming trump s tariff increase on china in just a year or two the trump administration has committed some of the worst trade policy mistakes in the postwar us history the resulting economic pain will spread in america as products shipped from china arrive in about three weeks the fantasy about a renminbi plaza hotel accord for a decade or two washington has periodically used chinese renminbi as a scapegoat to distract public spotlight away from rising economic challenges in the us yet the renminbi has been largely in line with fundamentals since the mid 2010s as the international monetary fund imf has affirmed however trump has a more intimate interest in currency manipulation before his firm bought the plaza hotel in new york city he monitored closely the talks that led to the 1985 plaza accord the controversial pact led the us france west germany the uk and japan to depreciate us dollar relative to the japanese yen and deutsche mark by intervening in the currency markets it was that exchange rate manipulation that played a key role in japan s subsequent containment asset bubbles deflation and secular stagnation and it is the same dream that seems to fuel the trump trade hawks fantasies about china s containment and stagnation yet china is not japan dreams are just dreams and the white house is in for an awakening dr dan steinbock is an internationally recognized strategist of the multipolar world and the founder

china bonds suffer the escalating trade war between the u s and china has put a spotlight on the asian nation s currency and while the yuan has depreciated this month perhaps the real focus should be on china s 13 trillion bond market the bloomberg barclays china aggregate index is already down 2 03 this month the most in the world and poised for its worst showing since june 2018 that follows a 1 01 slump in april the declines are a bit jarring given that april 1 was the day that some of china s onshore government and policy bank bonds were eligible to be included in the benchmark bloomberg barclays global aggregate total return index after a phase in period of 20 months some 364 chinese securities will ultimately account for 6 1 of the 55 trillion of debt covered by the index this change was supposed to make it easier for global investors to access china s bond market while improving liquidity while that still might be the case the recent action suggests capital may be fleeing china s bonds after all nobody wants to own bonds in a depreciating currency citing chinabond data bloomberg news reports that monthly inflows have averaged 6 8 billion yuan 984 million this year versus the 44 4 billion yuan seen in 2018 global investors are concerned the yuan may weaken past 7 per dollar for the first time since the financial crisis it was at 6 9211 on tuesday a breach of that level could cause capital to flee the country resulting in financial instability and a deterioration in china s balance of payments
nearly everyone wonders why is donald trump crazy enough to impose tariffs on imports from other countries how could this possibly make sense as long as the world economy is growing rapidly it makes sense for countries to cooperate with each other with the use of cooperation scarce resources can become part of supply lines that allow the production of complex goods such as computers requiring materials from around the world the downsides of cooperation include a the use of more oil to transport goods around the world b the more rapid exhaustion of resources of all kinds around the world and c growing wage disparity as workers from high wage countries compete more directly with workers from low wages countries these issues can be tolerated as long as the world economy is growing fast enough as the saying goes a rising tide lifts all boats in this post i will explain what is going wrong and how donald trump s actions fit in with the situation we are facing strangely enough there is a physics aspect to what is happening even though it is likely that donald trump and the voters who elected him would probably not recognize this in fact the world economy seems to be on the cusp of a shrinking back event with or without the tariffs adding tariffs is an indirect way of allowing the us to obtain a better position in the new shrunken economy if this is really possible the upcoming shrinking back event is the result of too little energy consumption in relation to total world population most researchers have completely missed the possibility that energy limits could manifest themselves as excessive wage disparity in fact they have tended to assume that energy limits would manifest themselves as high energy prices especially for oil the world s networked economy doesn t work in the simple way that most researchers have assumed too much wage disparity tends to lead to low energy prices rather than high because of increasing affordability issues the result is energy prices that are too low for producers rather than too high for consumers producers such as opec nations willingly cut back on production in an attempt to get prices back up the resulting shortage can be expected to more closely resemble financial collapse than high prices and a need for rationing trump s tariffs may provide the us a better position if the world economy should partially collapse let me try to explain some pieces of this story 1 energy is needed to power the world economy this fact has been missed by politicians and most economists economist steven keen recently developed a graphical explanation of the role energy plays in the world economy in his graphic he shows that workers need food an energy product just as machines need some sort of energy product to operate in steve keen s words labor without energy is a corpse capital without energy is a sculpture in fact there is a physics reason why energy consumption is needed in the economy energy dissipation is needed for the physical actions underlying gdp for example transportation requires a physical movement of people or objects this can only happen with the use of energy even the use of heat or of electricity requires energy dissipation 2 china s huge growth in energy consumption since it joined the world trade organization wto in december 2001 is truly amazing it has changed the world order in a few years china s energy consumption ramped up very quickly after joining the wto in late 2001 at the same time the energy consumption of the us and the eu stagnated as manufacturing moved to china and other emerging markets as the shift in energy consumption occurred jobs shifted elsewhere also the competition with china and other low wage countries tended to hold down wages of workers whose jobs could be shifted overseas when we look at labor force participation rates for the us we see that these seem to have turned down about the same time that china joined the wto this suggests that workers started leaving the workforce about the time competition with china ramped up 3 china is now facing a problem with peak coal its level of coal production is barely sustainable because of depletion and low coal prices if china is to manufacture goods and services for the world economy as well as its own people it needs a growing supply of cheap to produce energy china s largest source of energy is coal china s coal production hit a peak in 2013 and has been on a bumpy plateau or falling since the problem has been a combination of a a higher cost of coal production because existing mines are depleting combined with b coal prices that do not rise high enough to make production from these mines profitable of course if coal prices were to rise higher china would have a different but equally serious problem the cost of finished goods created for the world marketplace would be quite a bit higher making it difficult to export them profitably if customers wages rose at the same time coal prices rose there would be no problem the problem could be described in some sense as growing mining inefficiency because of coal depletion unfortunately the world economy does not reward a shift toward inefficiency 4 with peak coal occurring in china it makes little sense for the united states the european union and others to depend as heavily on china as in the past the economy of every country today is built on debt if the world economy is growing this debt pile can rise higher and higher if interest rates can be brought ever lower this also helps the pile of debt rise higher and higher china s economy also uses increasing debt to sustain its economic growth if the economy of china should slow down or start shrinking because of energy limits debt defaults could start overwhelming the system uprisings from laid off workers might become difficult to quell the situation could easily spiral out of control economies around the world depend on china for many manufactured goods in fact for many minerals china s usage amounts to over half of the world s consumption this arrangement doesn t really make sense because a china cannot really be depended on for the long term because of coal depletion b jobs that pay well in advanced economies are being lost to china and other emerging markets and c the level of concentration of manufacturing in china puts the world system at risk if china has any kind of adverse shift in its economy 5 the whole idea of buying fuels from other countries only works as long as there is enough to go around many people are of the opinion that if there is not enough fuel of a particular kind fuel prices will rise and the market will continue to operate normally there are at least two reasons why this doesn t make sense reason 1 the issue underlying rising costs of fossil fuels is nearly always depletion for example with coal mines the coal closest to the surface in the thickest seams is extracted first as this is depleted deeper coal in thinner seams can also be extracted but the cost tends to be higher when depletion takes place it is nearly always possible to extract more of the given fuel if some combination of more human labor and more technology powered by energy is used of course adding labor and or technology leads to a higher cost of production but the prices of commodities are not determined based on the cost of production prices are determined in the marketplace they reflect the quantity of finished goods and services made with these commodities that consumers in the aggregate can afford extracting coal or another fuel in what is essentially a less efficient manner doesn t add to what consumers can afford the combination of flat prices and higher costs leads to unprofitable producers precisely china s problem producers tend to cut back on production we can see that higher energy prices don t lead to higher wages by looking at what happened when oil prices rose a few years ago in the us we see that higher oil prices led to lower average wages because of recession reason 2 if we look back at the timing of peak coal in the uk and in germany it looks very much as if depleting coal supply was one of the causes of both world war i and world war ii governments know that energy supplies are required to operate their economies if they cannot get enough energy products internally or through trade they will fight other countries for access to supplies economists sitting in their ivory towers have not stopped to think through the obvious their standard supply and demand curve does not work for energy because an adequate supply of cheap energy is needed for both the demand for goods and services coming from wages workers earn and the supply of goods and services once affordability becomes a problem because too many people have low wages the prices of fuels stop rising it is the fact that prices don t rise high enough that causes the peaking of oil natural gas and coal production extraction stops even though there seem to be plenty of resources still available with current technology 6 a major energy issue today is the fact that china and india have run through their own energy supplies and now need to import energy from outside their countries to supplement domestic supplies as shown in figure 4 above china s coal production stopped rising in 2013 keeping the total amount of energy it produces close to flat to compensate for this shortfall china has started to import oil coal and natural gas the difference between the thick black line and the top of the stack of types of energy produced in china in figure 7 below represents the quantity of fuel that it has needed to import clearly this quantity has been increasing india s coal supply is not yet decreasing but it is running into a similar problem it needs to import more and more energy products from abroad as its energy consumption thick black line rises above its energy production stack 7 worldwide there is a growing need for imported fuels of many kinds figure 9 shows the imports needed for five major areas of the world in this analysis the european union is treated as a single unit thus in this analysis the imports it receives are only those from outside the european union taken as a whole we can see from figure 9 that the european union and japan have been major importers of fuels for a very long time india and china have only in recent years become energy importers at the same time the us is becoming more and more energy sufficient with its own fuel production figure 10 shows the ratio of imported energy to total energy consumption for these five areas the us is clearly in a better position than other countries groups shown with a smaller share of energy imported in figure 10 and a declining trend in imported energy in figure 9 japan the eu and india are all subject to substantial risk if available imports should fall 8 the ramp up of clean energy to date has proven to be a major disappointment the quantities added are far below what the iea believes is needed partial confirmation of this statement can be seen by observing the tiny orange other ren bands on figures 4 7 and 8 for china and india which include wind solar and other non hydroelectric renewables china is the largest user of wind and solar in the world yet its use of these devices provides only a tiny portion of its total energy consumption we have known since the 1950s that fossil fuel supply would eventually become a problem academics with their focus on making models have been able to come up with hypotheses regarding what might act as substitutes but these models tend to miss a lot of things including the following adverse events such as fukushima for nuclear the need for electricity storage and extra long distance transmission lines as wind and solar usage are ramped up the cost benefit analysis is much less favorable with these added issues that affect only some installations such as workarounds to keep long distance transmission lines from starting fires in dry areas or the high cost of underground transmission lines the best sites are taken early it is not until the actual experience arrives that we see how these substitutes are working in practice if we think back the nuclear promise of producing electricity that was hoped to be too cheap to meter hasn t really panned out in fact many advanced economies are cutting back on their use of nuclear with respect to renewables including hydroelectric wind solar and others the amount of new generation added each year seems to have hit a plateau it may be that the additional need for storage and transmission lines are already slowing the growth of renewables the iea has started pointing out that far more energy investment is needed if sustainable development goals are to be met about 300 gw per year instead of the current 177 per year in additions on average between 2018 and 2030 9 donald trump and his advisors have sensed that the current economic system is not working because of too much wage disparity if the economic system is destined to break in one way or another trump can influence which way the break will occur by the imposition of tariffs trump and his advisors no doubt recognize the importance of a cheap available energy supply they also realize that energy is an important enough factor of production to fight over furthermore many past wars have been resource wars tariffs are in some sense a step toward a resource war one of the immediate problems at hand is too much wage disparity strange as it may seem excessive wage disparity can be a sign of inadequate energy supply because in a networked economy high prices of commodities and low wages of workers are almost mirror images of each other high commodity prices tend to cut off consumption of commodities such as oil or coal by prices of finished goods that are too high for consumers excessive wage disparity works in reverse it sends prices of commodities such as coal and oil too low cutting off production because prices fall too low for producers of these commodities production falls because producers cannot make a profit when wage disparity is very high a large share of workers have very low wages leaving them unable to purchase more than a small amount of high priced goods such as cars and homes made with commodities it is this low demand that holds down commodity prices figure 10 shows that wide income disparities were issues both at the time of the great depression and in recent years commodity prices have been relatively low each of these times the problems didn t look like shortages they looked like gluts because of issues related to lack of affordability the us has raised tariffs in the past one time was immediately before the us civil war tariffs were again raised in 1922 and 1930 when wage disparities were at a high level unfortunately there is a significant chance that major parts of the world economy will start collapsing with or without trump s tariffs and the trade war because energy supplies worldwide are not growing sufficiently in fact some of these energy supplies are purposely being removed by producers such as saudi arabia because prices are too low by putting tariffs on some goods trump is providing a substitute for the missing high oil prices needed to slow the growth of globalization if the issue of ever increasing wage disparity is to be solved the tariffs tend to raise the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies making the cost of commodities including fossil fuels cheaper for us consumers than for other consumers around the world the tariffs tend to encourage new investment in us production of many types at the same time that they make investment in other countries such as china less appealing all of these changes indirectly give the us an advantage if there should be a partial collapse of the world economy with the benefit of the tariffs perhaps the partial collapse would leave some combination of countries including the us and canada mostly unaffected there might be other groups remaining as well weak economies such as venezuela cuba and haiti would likely be pushed aside even europe and japan would likely have major problems conclusion most observers have missed the point that excessive wage and wealth disparity can be a sign of serious energy problems just as high prices can be a sign of short supply they have also missed the point that coal supply is very important just as oil supply is very important in the real world when there is not enough to go around wars are a definite possibility a trade war is a somewhat reduced version of a war trump and his advisors whether or not they understand the real situation seem to be trying to guide the us to as good an outcome as possible in the current situation of excessive wage disparity the underlying issue is likely the limits to growth problem modeled in the 1972 book the limits to growth by donella meadows et al as resources become depleted it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain economic growth industrial output per capita for example the number of new cars or number of smartphones per 1000 people starts falling the 1972 computer simulations did not consider wages or prices only physical quantities of various items now as we can see how the limits are playing out in the real world it appears that the most prominent manifestation of the world s low resource problem is excessive wage disparity an issue most people have never considered as being related to shortages of resource supplies few people have stopped to think that goods made with energy products are equally unaffordable whether the problem is prices being too high or wages of most people being too low share this email print reddit facebook twitter x linkedin
speech new zealand government thank you to craigs investments for hosting us today im excited to be here a week out from this years budget the wellbeing budget hon grant robertson minister of finance speech 23 may 2019 good morning thank you to craig s investments for hosting us today i m excited to be here a week out from this year s budget the wellbeing budget this morning i want to offer some comments on the economic outlook in new zealand and overseas and to talk about the government s economic strategy i also want to set out for you how this year s wellbeing budget supports that strategy and our overall policy agenda global economic outlook as a small open economy located in the south pacific the global economic environment will always have a significant impact on our fortunes the living standards and wellbeing of new zealanders are intertwined with the economies and the politics of the rest of the world i recently attended the spring meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund in washington dc where the slowing global economy was the dominant topic of conversation at those meetings the imf downgraded its global economic forecasts for 2019 after having downgraded them only six months earlier global growth is now expected to be 3 3 for the year with advanced economies growing 1 8 according to imf head christine lagarde the global economy is still growing but it is growing more slowly there are significant challenges in the international environment the tariff war between the us and china was and still is a major issue for those i met in washington it has flared up again in the last couple of weeks with the us increasing tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports and china retaliating with tariffs of its own the us has not ruled out further tariffs which would place further pressure on a softening chinese economy in turn the us economy is also showing signs of slowing uncertainty in europe due in large part to brexit is ongoing this further adds to the global economic headwinds we face all of this adds up to a global environment in which new zealand exporters operate that is both unstable and uncertain domestic outlook new zealand is well positioned to face this instability and uncertainty but we are not immune from its impacts growth rates are set to be lower than we have seen in recent years the imf projections for new zealand are that we will grow at around 2 5 in 2019 and 2 9 in 2020 which is ahead of our peers we are projected to grow faster than the us the uk japan canada the eurozone and australia just recently the reserve bank of australia further lowered its growth forecast for the australian economy the oecd this week has also released new forecasts for the global economy in their comments about new zealand they expect growth again ahead of our peers with business investment expected to grow we know that the fundamentals of our economy are strong we continue to have historically low unemployment and stable low inflation we are running budget surpluses and have low public debt due to our government s responsible fiscal management we are holding up well and are well positioned to deal with the global situation consumer confidence export and commodity prices and building consents and are all up last week s performance of manufacturing index lifted capacity constraints particularly in a tight labour market do remain a challenge the need for skilled staff is the most common refrain i hear from business and we still have our entrenched levels of productivity but overall we have a solid base to see new zealand through this challenging period in addition to the volatile global environment there are the mega trends that we have to keep in mind the full effect of the rapidly changing nature of work driven by forces such as automation and globalisation is not yet known but we do know from developments like cloud computing 3d printing uber and even netflix that these mega trends already are and will continue to be disruptive to the status quo the recent report by mckinsey s for the prime minister s business advisory council noted that around 21 of work activities in the new zealand economy have the potential for automation by 2030 this requires a significant shift in how we think about and plan for work and then there is the challenge of climate change that effects every aspect of our economy the urgency of our response has never been clearer and new zealand with our reliance on a stable climate for a strong primary sector has to move now to get ahead of the challenge these issues and others provide us with both challenges and opportunities going forward and how we respond will shape the future of new zealand at the same time we need to move away from the main factors driving economic growth in the recent past namely housing and population growth the benefits of growth based on these factors has failed to translate into meaningful improvements to the living standards of many new zealanders buying and selling houses to one another and adding more people to the economy is not the basis of a sound economic strategy economic strategy in the face of this environment it is important to be clear about our economic strategy and plan so we are in a transition phase for our economy the core aim of our government is to improve the living standards and wellbeing of all new zealanders our success in achieving this will largely be determined by how adaptable and resilient we are to these challenges in short our government s vision is for a modern economy that is productive sustainable and inclusive what do i mean by that productive means doing more with what we have moving our products up the value chain and producing things in new and innovative ways sustainable means meeting the needs of the present without compromising our ability to do so in the future both in an environmental sense and in an economic and fiscal sense inclusive means ensuring that all new zealanders get a fair go have a chance to contribute to our economy and get to share in the benefits of growth when the prime minister outlined the government s priorities last year she identified four economic objectives that will help deliver on this vision these are to grow and share new zealand s prosperity more fairly support thriving and sustainable regions transition to a clean green and carbon neutral new zealand and deliver responsible governance with a broader measure of success one way to think about this is the six i s we need to develop more transparent and enduring institutions and enhancing our social partnership we are making good progress here through for example reform of the reserve bank the introduction of the zero carbon bill and establishing the climate change commission and the establishment of the tripartite future of work forum bringing business workers and government to the table our investment priorities need to change new zealand s capital markets need to encourage more productive and sustainable investments we have established green investment finance restarted contributions to the super fund and set about updating our overseas investment regime we need to do more with innovation and our innovative industries to drive productivity and shift from volume to value we are leading the world with our work on a just transition towards a low carbon economy highlighted by the recent summit in taranaki we have already made significant investment in research and development including support for business r and d through the r and d tax credit and more is to come as we move towards our goal of two percent of gdp from our position below the oecd average improving our international connections has become more important we are diversifying and deepening new zealand s international connections to lift exports and deliver fairer free trade for the benefit of all new zealanders the latest export data shows that we have lifted from 26 6 percent of gdp to 28 8 percent this comes after several years of a downward trend having concluded the cptpp we are deep in negotiations for an eu free trade agreement and just last week the prime minister formally signed a refreshed economic cooperation agreement with singapore i think that we must modernise and adapt our infrastructure we are expanding investment in the infrastructure necessary to support a more modern economy that can meet challenges like climate change a major step forward in giving certainty on the pipeline of infrastructure is the recent establishment of te waihanga the infrastructure commission this is backed by record levels of investment in critical infrastructure including transport schools and hospitals we are also developing new infrastructure funding and financing tools to leverage more private sector capital in infrastructure provision and finally we need to deliver inclusive work by ensuring the labour market education and welfare systems support opportunities for high quality and fair work this does include lifting the minimum wage but also more active labour market policies to ensure that we take on the number one issue raised with me by business access to skilled labour there is of course much more to the government s work programme than i have time to talk about today but it needs to be clearly focused on seeing new zealand through our current global headwinds and towards a modern economy that gives our businesses and our people confidence to face the future budget 2019 economic priorities in next week s budget you will see investments to support our economic strategy this year s budget is different there are three fundamental elements to the wellbeing budget first a whole of government approach this is about stepping out of the silos of agencies and working together to assess develop and implement initiatives to improve wellbeing secondly a wellbeing approach means looking at intergenerational outcomes we have to focus on the long term thinking about the impacts of policy on future generations as well as thinking about meeting the needs of the present thirdly we need to move beyond narrow measures of success this can be seen through the development of the living standards framework dashboard and from the indicators aotearoa new zealand work led by statistics new zealand we have developed our budget priorities on the basis of a wellbeing analysis we looked at the evidence and got expert advice to assess where we have the greatest opportunities to make a difference to new zealanders wellbeing we have focused our efforts on those opportunities this approach has led to some significant and different programmes like the 320 million investment announced last weekend to address domestic and sexual violence this is the wellbeing approach in action the evidence shows the long term impact that domestic violence has especially on children we are taking a joined up government response to start addressing this long term challenge we have brought together eight government agencies working with the community to take on this scourge that has such massive social and economic consequences from an economic perspective our wellbeing analysis showed that we have some way to go in achieving our vision of a productive sustainable and inclusive economy productivity growth is a key driver of incomes both at a household and country level despite working longer hours on average than workers in many developed countries new zealanders incomes have for some time remains in the bottom half of the oecd in addition the government has set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets to meet the 2015 paris agreement goal of keeping temperature rise to no more than 1 5 degrees as a result two of the priorities in this year s budget are creating opportunities for productive businesses regions iwi and others to transition to a sustainable and low emissions economy and supporting a thriving nation in the digital age through innovation social and economic opportunities come budget day you will see targeted investments in these areas to support more productive sustainable and inclusive economic growth fiscal sustainability of course fiscal sustainability is an inherent part of maintaining and improving intergenerational wellbeing and a sustainable economy that s why this government made a commitment to our budget responsibility rules when we came into office these include delivering a sustainable operating surplus across the economic cycle the key word here is sustainable that means our surpluses will exist after we have funded our policy objectives so that issues are not kicked further down the road for the next government or generation to deal with as i discovered after coming into my role as finance minister we are reducing the level of net core crown debt to 20 percent of gdp within five years of taking office new zealand has low levels of government debt by international standards but we remain vulnerable to shocks that are beyond our control such as earthquakes and other natural disasters we have made our commitment to keeping debt under control to ensure that future generations of new zealanders are in a position to be able to respond effectively to any such shock thirdly this government will prioritise investments to address the long term financial and sustainability challenges facing new zealand this is apparent in the intergenerational wellbeing priorities we have identified in this year s budget and restarting contributions to the nz superfund and our focus on issues such as climate change fourthly we will maintain government expenditure within the recent historical range of spending to gdp which has averaged around 30 percent over the past 20 years we are also focussed on the quality of spending with ministers running prioritisation exercises across their portfolios to identify spending that doesn t fit with the coalition government s priorities i am pleased to announce today that on the 30th of may the budget will show that we are meeting these rules again as we did in last year s budget i know there has been some criticism of this approach particularly around the debt target for me it is a question of balance we have made and will continue to make significant investments in our future but we also know that the volatility of the world be it economically or through natural disasters biosecurity incursions or unexpected events is never far away the public finance act obliges governments to outline their long term fiscal strategies at budget time one of the key elements of this is the government s approach to debt people in this room will all have different views on what it could or should be that in part depends on the levels of investment you believe the government should be making and in what areas we also have to take into account capacity constraints at any point in time like in our construction sector with this in mind i am comfortable with the 20 point that we have been targeting but circumstances can obviously change beyond the budget responsibility rules our fiscal intentions in this budget will signal a shift to a net debt percentage range rather than a single figure at this point we are looking at a range of 15 25 of gdp based on advice from the treasury this range is consistent with the public finance act s requirement for fiscal prudence but takes into account the need for the government to be flexible so that it can respond to economic conditions essentially our current 20 target falls in the middle of the new range that will exist from 2021 22 onwards a range gives governments more capacity to take well considered actions appropriate to the nation s circumstances circumstances that change over time it establishes boundaries within which debt is kept to sensible and sustainable levels and where fiscal choices are driven by impact and value for example a government may choose to move higher up the debt range to combat the impact of an economic recession or where there are high value investments that will drive future economic dividends at other times it may be prudent to reduce debt levels to the lower end of the range to provide headroom for future policy responses our budget priorities are focussed on the outcomes new zealanders want to achieve and all ministers and agencies will be collectively accountable for delivering them and in their delivery this government will follow a disciplined fiscal strategy the strategy gives the balance to be both a responsible manager of public finances and responsive to new zealand s intergenerational wellbeing needs conclusion to wrap up i am really looking forward to delivering this budget we are doing things differently we ve prioritised spending that improves the wellbeing of all new zealanders this means tackling the big long term issues by investing in an economy that is more productive sustainable and inclusive you will learn much more about this in a weeks time come budget day you will be able to see that this is not simply the same old budget repackaged with softer edges and brighter colours you will see a budget that is new with a more structured approach and a new explicit emphasis on what we want to achieve for the long term for our country thank you ends content sourced from scoop co nz original url

partnerships have since been promoted ostensibly to mobilize private finance for the public purpose in all too many cases ppps have socialized costs and losses while ensuring private financial gains kuala lumpur malaysia may 21 2019 ips after the failure and abuses of privatization and contracting out services from the 1980s there has been renewed appreciation for the role of the state or government earlier promoters of privatization have taken a step backward only to take two more forward to instead promote public private partnerships ppps ppps for most purposes ppps are essentially long term contracts underwritten by government guarantees with which the private sector builds and sometimes runs major infrastructure projects or services traditionally provided by the state such as hospitals schools roads railways water sanitation and energy ppps are promoted by many governments associated with the organization for economic co operation and development oecd and some multilateral development banks especially the world bank as the solution to the financing shortfall needed to achieve development including the sustainable development goals sdgs since the late 1990s many countries have embraced ppps in many areas ranging from healthcare and education to transport and infrastructure with mixed consequences they were less common in developing countries but that is changing rapidly with many countries in asia latin america and africa now introducing enabling legislation and initiating ppp projects ppps are now an increasingly popular means to finance mega infrastructure projects but dams highways large plantations pipelines and energy or transport infrastructure can ruin habitats displace communities and devastate natural resources typically social and environmental legislation is weakened or circumscribed to attract investors for ppps there are also a growing number of dirty energy ppps devastating the environment undermining progressive environmental conservation efforts and exacerbating climate change ppps have also led to forced displacement repression and other abuses of local communities indigenous peoples displaced farmers and labourers among others ppp financing more public than private nevertheless experiences with ppps have been largely although not exclusively negative and very few ppps have delivered results in the public interest there has been some supposed success with infrastructure ppps mainly due to financing arrangements generally ppps for hospitals and schools have much poorer records compared to infrastructure one can have good financing arrangements due to preferential interest rates for a poor ppp project nevertheless private finance all over the world still accounts for a small share of infrastructure financing however good financing arrangements will not make a bad ppp project any better ppps typically involve public financing for developing countries to attract bids from influential private companies often from abroad blended finance export financing and new supposed aid arrangements have become means for foreign governments to support powerful corporations bidding for ppp contracts abroad especially in developing countries incredibly such arrangements are increasingly counted as overseas development assistance as north south south south or triangular development cooperation like privatization ppps often increase fees or charges for users ppp contracts often undermine the public interest in other ways with generous host government incentives and other privileges often compromising and undermining the state s obligation to regulate in the public interest ppps can limit government capacity to enact new legislation and other policies such as strengthened environmental or social regulations that might adversely affect or constrain investor interests ppps public pain private gain ppp contracts are typically complex negotiations are subject to commercial confidentiality making it hard for civil society and parliamentarians to provide checks and balances in the public and national interest such limited transparency significantly increases the likelihood of corruption and undermines democratic accountability it is important to establish the circumstances required to achieve efficiency gains and to recognize the longer term fiscal implications of ppp related contingent liabilities shifting public debt to government guaranteed debt does not really reduce government debt liabilities but obscures accountability as it is taken off budget and is no longer subject to parliamentary let alone public scrutiny hence ppps are more likely to be abused because they are typically off balance sheet so that they do not show up as government debt giving the illusion of easy money or credit despite claims to the contrary ppps are typically riskier for governments than for the private companies involved as the government may be required to step in to assume costs and liabilities if things go wrong ppps also undermine democracy and national sovereignty as such contracts tend not to be transparent and subject to unaccountable international adjudication due to investor state dispute settlement isds commitments rather than national or international courts under world bank proposed ppp contracts for example national governments can even be liable for losses due to strikes by workers government procurement one alternative of course is government or public procurement in many instances ppps have become the most expensive financing option and much less cost effective than transparent competitive government procurement they cost governments significantly more in the long run than if the government procures on an open competitive basis or if projects are directly financed by government borrowings generally ppps are much more expensive than government procurement despite government subsidized credit however with a competent government doing good work government procurement can be efficient and low cost with a competent government and accountable consultants efficient government procurement has generally proved far more cost effective than ppp alternatives it is therefore important to establish when and why meaningful gains can be achieved through ppps and when these are unlikely

this can be seen through the development of the living standards framework dashboard and from the indicators aotearoa new zealand work led by statistics new zealand we have developed our budget priorities on the basis of a wellbeing analysis we looked at the evidence and got expert advice to assess where we have the greatest opportunities to make a difference to new zealanders wellbeing we have focused our efforts on those opportunities this approach has led to some significant and different programmes like the 320 million investment announced last weekend to address domestic and sexual violence this is the wellbeing approach in action the evidence shows the long term impact that domestic violence has especially on children we are taking a joined up government response to start addressing this long term challenge we have brought together eight government agencies working with the community to take on this scourge that has such massive social and economic consequences from an economic perspective our wellbeing analysis showed that we have some way to go in achieving our vision of a productive sustainable and inclusive economy productivity growth is a key driver of incomes both at a household and country level despite working longer hours on average than workers in many developed countries new zealanders incomes have for some time remains in the bottom half of the oecd in addition the government has set ambitious greenhouse gas reduction targets to meet the 2015 paris agreement goal of keeping temperature rise to no more than 1 5 degrees as a result two of the priorities in this year s budget are creating opportunities for productive businesses regions iwi and others to transition to a sustainable and low emissions economy and supporting a thriving nation in the digital age through innovation social and economic opportunities come budget day you will see targeted investments in these areas to support more productive sustainable and inclusive economic growth fiscal sustainability of course fiscal sustainability is an inherent part of maintaining and improving intergenerational wellbeing and a sustainable economy that s why this government made a commitment to our budget responsibility rules when we came into office these include delivering a sustainable operating surplus across the economic cycle the key word here is sustainable that means our surpluses will exist after we have funded our policy objectives so that issues are not kicked further down the road for the next government or generation to deal with as i discovered after coming into my role as finance minister we are reducing the level of net core crown debt to 20 percent of gdp within five years of taking office new zealand has low levels of government debt by international standards but we remain vulnerable to shocks that are beyond our control such as earthquakes and other natural disasters we have made our commitment to keeping debt under control to ensure that future generations of new zealanders are in a position to be able to respond effectively to any such shock thirdly this government will prioritise investments to address the long term financial and sustainability challenges facing new zealand this is apparent in the intergenerational wellbeing priorities we have identified in this year s budget and restarting contributions to the nz superfund and our focus on issues such as climate change fourthly we will maintain government expenditure within the recent historical range of spending to gdp which has averaged around 30 percent over the past 20 years we are also focussed on the quality of spending with ministers running prioritisation exercises across their portfolios to identify spending that doesn t fit with the coalition government s priorities i am pleased to announce today that on the 30th of may the budget will show that we are meeting these rules again as we did in last year s budget i know there has been some criticism of this approach particularly around the debt target for me it is a question of balance we have made and will continue to make significant investments in our future but we also know that the volatility of the world be it economically or through natural disasters biosecurity incursions or unexpected events is never far away the public finance act obliges governments to outline their long term fiscal strategies at budget time one of the key elements of this is the government s approach to debt people in this room will all have different views on what it could or should be that in part depends on the levels of investment you believe the government should be making and in what areas we also have to take into account capacity constraints at any point in time like in our construction sector with this in mind i am comfortable with the 20 point that we have been targeting but circumstances can obviously change beyond the budget responsibility rules our fiscal intentions in this budget will signal a shift to a net debt percentage range rather than a single figure at this point we are looking at a range of 15 25 of gdp based on advice from the treasury this range is consistent with the public finance act s requirement for fiscal prudence but takes into account the need for the government to be flexible so that it can respond to economic conditions essentially our current 20 target falls in the middle of the new range that will exist from 2021 22 onwards a range gives governments more capacity to take well considered actions appropriate to the nation s circumstances circumstances that change over time it establishes boundaries within which debt is kept to sensible and sustainable levels and where fiscal choices are driven by impact and value for example a government may choose to move higher up the debt range to combat the impact of an economic recession or where there are high value investments that will drive future economic dividends at other times it may be prudent to reduce debt levels to the lower end of the range to provide headroom for future policy responses our budget priorities are focussed on the outcomes new zealanders want to achieve and all ministers and agencies will be collectively accountable for delivering them and in their delivery this government will follow a disciplined fiscal strategy the strategy gives the balance to be both a responsible manager of public finances and responsive to new zealand s intergenerational wellbeing needs conclusion to wrap up i am really looking forward to delivering this budget we are doing things differently we ve prioritised spending that improves the wellbeing of all new zealanders this means tackling the big long term issues by investing in an economy that is more productive sustainable and inclusive you will learn much more about this in a weeks time come budget day you will be able to see that this is not simply the same old budget repackaged with softer edges and brighter colours you will see a budget that is new with a more structured approach and a new explicit emphasis on what we want to achieve for the long term for our country thank you ends scoop media
the recent collapse of trade talks between the u s and china sent shock waves through the global capitalist system almost everyone had expected a deal to be struck including president trump who had predicted it would be epic when it all fell through he blamed china for the failure and escalated what had been a low intensity trade war into a full blown one he increased tariffs from 10 to 25 percent on 200 billion of chinese exports to the u s and threatened to impose 25 percent duties on another 300 billion once those go into effect all of china s exports will be subject to tariffs with the gauntlet thrown down beijing announced it would raise levies from 10 percent to as much as 25 percent on 60 billion worth of u s exports a spokesperson on its state television warned if the u s wants to talk our door is open if the u s wants to fight we ll be with them till the end the threat of a trade war spooked investors throughout the world in a massive selloff on stock markets around the world they wiped a trillion dollars off the books u s multinationals like apple and boeing which are heavily dependent on china and would be affected by the new tariffs for the first time were hammered particularly hard the markets seem to have stabilized in the hopes that the two powers will reach an agreement at talks in beijing later this month or when trump and chinese president xi jinping meet at the g20 summit in osaka japan at the end of june regardless of whether or not they strike a deal the growing conflict between the two powers will not abate it is the central inter imperial rivalry of the 21st century trump blew up the talks trump doomed the talks to failure by making demands china would never meet he views china as a state capitalist power that is violating the free market rules of the neoliberal world order to advance its rise as an imperial power and challenge the u s for global supremacy the growing conflict between the two powers is the central inter imperial rivalry of the 21st century he wants to bring it to heel so he insisted that china stop violating intellectual copyrights grant foreign investors equal market access stop forced technology transfer and end state subsidies to private corporations he called for all of these to be written into chinese law china judged these demands as an attempt by washington to defend its global dominance violate china s national sovereignty and prevent its reemergence as a world power unsurprisingly beijing refused to agree to them escalating the conflict between the two biggest economies in the world the road to imperial rivalry such imperial rivalry is exactly what the u s has sought to avoid since the end of the cold war it pursued a grand strategy of superintending neoliberal world order incorporating other states into it with the promise of win win globalization co opting any potential peer competitors in the process and enforcing its rule against so called rogue states with sanctions and regime change as part of this project the u s adopted a policy toward china that combined engagement and containment into what many call congagement it offered beijing carrots like joining the world trade organization on the condition that it accept its neoliberal rules but it also waved the stick of military power through naval patrols and bases throughout the asia pacific washington struck deals with beijing to allow u s multinationals to subcontract production to corporations in china that exploited the country s cheap labor force to manufacture products like apple s iphone in the process beijing transformed itself from an economic backwater into the world s second largest economy the political class state managers in the imperial bureaucracy and both of the u s s capitalist parties have also lined up behind trump while china rose the u s suffered relative decline it poured countless lives and funds into futile wars in afghanistan and iraq saw its economy devastated by the great recession and got mired in political polarization and paralysis in washington of course it remains the world s only superpower with the largest economy the most powerful military and therefore the greatest geopolitical influence xi jinping projects china as a great power but washington s relative decline opened the door to china to assert itself as a new imperial power china s president xi did just that he abandoned his predecessor s grand strategy of a peaceful rise and adopted a new one he calls the china dream of grand national rejuvenation which aims to compel the rest of the world to recognize beijing as a great power china launched the 1 trillion one belt one road project that aims to develop transport infrastructure to integrate china with the economies of europe asia and africa he also launched china 2025 the project that funnels state money into high tech corporations to turn them into national champions able to compete with rivals in the u s and europe china modernized its military especially its navy which is specifically designed to confront the u s it established bases on islands throughout the south and east china seas to control strategic shipping lanes previously policed by the u s lay claim to fisheries and assert its rights to undersea oil and natural gas reserves it also established its first overseas military base in djibouti on the horn of africa adjacent to the key shipping lane to the suez canal the pentagon warns that this is just the beginning it claims that china will construct an entire network of bases through one belt one road construction projects to rival the u s which until now had a near monopoly on such military outposts trump s economic nationalist strategy thus washington s policy of congagement backfired unintentionally helping to turn china into a peer competitor trump seized the presidency on the promise that he could make america great again and defeat china with a new strategy of economic nationalism multinationals worried about the trade war are starting to relocate production to lower wage countries once in office he put america first skirting multilateral institutions treating allies in a transactional fashion and even imposing tariffs on canada and europe in his national security strategy he downplayed the so called war on terror to focus on confronting great power rivals in particular china and russia trump launched trade talks determined to bring china to heel tried to lure countries like vietnam and others into the u s orbit through bilateral trade deals threatened to recognize taiwan as a sovereign state and deployed the navy to police the asia pacific leading to repeated confrontations with chinese vessels trump s defense department warned that the u s military industrial complex s dependence on supply chains in china was a threat to national security to overcome this the defense department argued for the federal government to enact an industrial policy to redevelop its domestic manufacturing base and stipulated that any offshore military production be shifted out of china to allied countries trump also singled out china s high tech industry as a threat to national security particularly huawei which is leading the construction of 5g networks throughout the world afraid the chinese state will use these to violate cybersecurity and spy on u s corporations he banned the company in the u s and is trying to force u s allies to do the same u s capital and the democrats back trump trump s economic nationalism has posed a dilemma for u s capital its multinational sector remains committed to the old strategy of the u s state overseeing a neoliberal order of free trade globalization but they have grown frustrated with china s state capitalism especially its theft of intellectual property estimated to cost u s corporations as much as 600 billion each year that s why a majority of corporations surveyed by the u s chamber of commerce supported trump s tariffs to pressure china into a new trade deal the interdependence of the u s and chinese economies and the spiraling conflict over trade could damage the world economy the political class state managers in the imperial bureaucracy and both of the u s s capitalist parties have also lined up behind trump the republicans previously ardent advocates of free trade have been cowed into toeing the line the democratic party from its corporate leadership to its progressive dissidents has either remained silent for fear of losing voters seduced by trump s protectionism or staked out positions to his right demanding that he take an even harder line in negotiations except for neoliberal former vice president joe biden he downplayed the threat china poses reassured people of u s supremacy and challenged trump s confrontational approach especially his tariffs he boasted china is going to eat our lunch come on man they re not bad folks folks but guess what they re not competition for us the bulk of the democrats however adopted a liberal nationalist position senate minority leader chuck schumer tweeted hang tough on china president don t back down strength is the only way to win with china sen elizabeth warren the doyenne of pro capitalist progressives declared that china weaponized its economy while she promised to save u s jobs with protectionist legislation and renegotiated trade deals not to be left out self proclaimed socialist sen bernie sanders attacked biden for being soft on china and promised he would better lead the u s struggle against china it s wrong to pretend that china isn t one of our major economic competitors he tweeted when we are in the white house we will win that competition by fixing our trade policies will trump decouple chimerica the hard nationalists like peter navarro in trump s cabinet and others on the sidelines like steve bannon are pushing for u s capital to decouple from china others like white house economic adviser larry kudlow are intent on forcing a deal through to open up china to further investment but it s hard to believe that beijing would agree to those terms the new socialist movement must adopt a clear and principled anti imperialist position against both the u s and china meanwhile decoupling is beginning to happen multinationals worried about the trade war frustrated with china s policies and unwilling to pay for the rising cost of chinese labor are starting to relocate production to lower wage countries like vietnam as well as countries closer to home like mexico according to the new york times china may also begin to reorient its economy away from dependence on the u s to develop its own capacities and relationships with other countries many chinese companies are talking about the end of chimerica chinese nationalists especially in its army are eager to push just such a separation president xi jinping sees a test of china s mettle as the economist notes protectionism is making it hard to obtain vital technologies from abroad he declared last september china must take the road of self reliance it could double down on exactly the path of state sponsored capitalist development like china 2025 that has raised the hackles of the u s state and capital it will also try and find alternative sites for investment to the u s through one belt one road other sources for the commodities it needs and other markets for its products especially the european union geopolitical conflicts multiply the increasing geopolitical conflicts between the two powers could drive them further apart they are at loggerheads over north korea taiwan iran venezuela and control of the south and east china seas as well as the arctic ocean of all of these their clashes over iran and venezuela are perhaps the most important in a globalized capitalist economy working class solidarity is the only way to end inter imperial rivalry and replace it with international socialism trump is committed to regime change in the two countries both of which are allied with china in the case of iran he has already used charges that chinese companies are violating sanctions on tehran to temporarily ban the sale of technology to chinese tech corporation zte which nearly destroyed it and to arrest huawei s executive meng wanzhou on top of that he just imposed sanctions on iran that bar the purchase of its oil a direct threat to china which is the largest purchaser of the country s crude exports in response beijing has demanded trump back down from threats of regime change engage in multilateral talks to preserve the nuclear accord and drop its sanctions on oil even going so far as to imply it may violate them similarly trump is intensifying efforts to topple nicolás maduro in venezuela by recognizing right wing opposition leader juan guaidó and maintain brutal sanctions on the country beijing reacted by denouncing trump for attempting a coup and backing maduro because it is heavily invested in the country s oil industry and fears the precedent of a regime change policy that could target china in the future will they fight or make up at the same time the interdependence of the u s and chinese economies and the threat that spiraling conflict over trade or geopolitics could damage the world economy could drive trump and xi to back off they have every reason to be concerned about this despite both leaders boasts about their economies both are fragile china s growth continues to slow and its attempt to quicken it has piled up debt and massive overcapacity throughout the system the u s economy regardless of trump s boosterism suffers from underlying problems of weak investment low productivity massive public and private debt and low workforce participation neither state wants the trade war and geopolitical conflicts to tip them into a recession at the same time neither the u s nor china can afford to be perceived as giving in at the negotiating table especially with nationalist factions braying for sharper confrontation this pressure will only grow in the event of an economic slowdown or larger geopolitical confrontation and both trump and xi as extreme nationalists will not hesitate to rally their nations behind them even in such situations though they are likely to try to avoid any dispute getting out of control and risking a military confrontation which both want to avoid because of the risk of nuclear war therefore their rivalry will likely continue to be expressed in terms of geopolitical and geoeconomic competition socialist anti imperialism the new socialist movement must adopt a clear and principled anti imperialist position against both the u s and china we must oppose trump s nationalism and protectionism it will only whip up anti asian racism domestically and divide workers in china and the u s who share common interests in a struggle against their bosses and their states we should also oppose the chinese state beijing s claims to be socialist are laughable it is a capitalist dictatorship that exploits its working class oppresses its uighur muslim minority going so far as to throw a million of them in concentration camps and competes as an imperialist power with the u s for dominance in the world market instead of picking sides between the u s superpower and its ascendant chinese rival the new socialist movement should build on the precedent set by high tech workers who staged an international strike against google and organized support for github workers in china in a globalized capitalist economy such working class solidarity is the only way to end inter imperial rivalry and replace it with international socialism before you go truthout faces a serious

rand no longer seen as indicator of country s economic prospects one would get a much better idea of the value of the rand by measuring how international investors perceive emerging markets as a whole but this is difficult to do an exchange rate is often seen as a country s share price people see it as a reflection of the nation s economic prospects political stability fiscal discipline any changes in government policy and inflation rate we believe the rand will strengthen if these things improve and worsen if they don t often dramatically to the point where the currency would basically cease to function as a monetary unit if a country s economy implodes totally the best known example being just north of the limpopo river the currency will become totally worthless and big events do have an impact on the exchange rate as the disastrous replacement of nhlanhla nene as finance minister in december 2015 proved but when everything is going along more or less as expected the big movements in the rand are largely the result of global investment sentiment towards so called emerging markets as a whole still the currency of choice on the continent the dominant position of the south african economy on the african continent the strength of our financial system and the liquidity of the rand on international markets make the good old zar the currency of choice for investors seeking exposure to africa figures from the african development bank show that the continent is offering opportunities with real gdp growth exceeding 3 most years in the last decade however it seems the growth in fixed investment international trade and income are not reflected in the demand for african countries currencies they have all depreciated over the last few years despite economic growth surpassing that of many developing countries the assumption that a currency reflects the internal economic health and prospects of any single country no longer holds true this is especially true in the case of sa sa has seen its currency decline sharply over the last 10 years from r8 47 against the dollar at the beginning of 2009 to r14 39 late tuesday afternoon of other large developing countries only brazil turkey russia and argentina performed worse although seven african currencies have performed better in africa the currencies of nigeria ethiopia ghana malawi sudan angola and mozambique have performed better than the rand nicky weimar senior economist at nedbank s economic unit says we need to consider that sa has become much more integrated into world markets since 1994 so much so that investors risk appetite for emerging market assets as a whole became the dominant factor influencing the exchange rate if global risk appetites improve the currencies of all emerging markets tend to strengthen similarly if global risk appetites fade foreign investors tend to withdraw from emerging markets with a negative effect on equities bonds and currencies says weimar she explains that factors specific to sa only tend to play a major role in the value of the rand if news is either much worse or much better than markets expected perceptions are what count one would get a much better idea of the value of the rand by measuring how international investors perceive emerging markets as a whole unfortunately this is difficult weimar lists several factors that are likely to influence the flow of funds into an out of emerging markets one of the major determinants is the difference between american interest rates and those of emerging economies as this affects returns made on carry trades in short the rand will improve whenever it is profitable to borrow money in new york to buy south african government bonds while taking risk into consideration slower economic growth in developing countries also tends to lower the demand for riskier investments in emerging markets even if the emerging countries continue to show good growth fund managers tend to reduce their risk when things start to get difficult this is why the trade war between the us and china has such an influence on emerging market currencies including the rand says weimar rising protectionism will ultimately hurt global growth but will undoubtedly hit small and open emerging economies more than those of larger developed countries but the big issue remains the general perceptions of the risk of investing in developing economies the currencies of turkey argentina and brazil fared badly against the dollar because of the fear that these countries might default on their debts the large loans of which are denominated in dollar the rand suffered too despite our much lower exposure to dollar denominated debt one way to see what investors believe nedbank looks at the difference between capital flows into emerging markets and developed markets to gauge investors appetite for more riskier assets and compares it to changes in the value of the rand weimar says the rand tracks this measurement of risk perfectly and can pinpoint any large discrepancies a good example was when former president jacob zuma fired nene in 2015 the rand devalued sharply compared to this risk gauge this was the moment the world realised how widespread and entrenched corruption had become in sa says weimar the rand recovered quickly compared to the perceived riskiness when cyril ramaphosa was appointed leader of the anc and president of sa since then says weimar the rand has been trading at a slight discount to the emerging markets risk line probably reflecting a number of major uncertainties such as whether the government will proceed with property expropriation and how it will deal with the electricity crisis the dire situation at many of our state owned enterprises the large budget deficit the country s high debt burden high rate of unemployment education system corruption and policy uncertainty brought to you by moneyweb
elevated tariffs on trade between the us and china sent shockwaves through global markets withering risk appetite with a prevailing sense of uncertainty over the future of trade talks between the world s two largest economies all risk assets felt the impact as fears of a global slowdown returned with some reacting in unexpected ways the emerging markets index msci fell by nearly 6 per cent and is now within touching distance of wiping out its year to date advance all but one em currency the russian rouble declined against the us dollar last week as the trade escalation alarmed investors highlighting how exposed the developing world is to the persistent trade tensions some currencies in the emerging market space are gathering more headline attention than others with the turkish lira once again in headlines the currency has fallen just over 40 per cent since 2017 and is sensitive to market shocks decreasing value as investors seek to reduce investment on higher risk assets amid the trade war uncertainties turkey s own political woes aren t helping to reassure investors but it s the country s economic weakness which is the real thorn in their side if china slows down because of diminished prospects in the us ankara s current challenges will face a further headwind because the asian giant is turkey s third largest trading partner globally and the first in east asia chinese investors hold around 2 8 billion dh10 28bn worth of investments in turkey which sells agricultural goods metals chemicals and other goods to china bilateral trade between the countries reached 23bn by the end of 2018 so the stakes are high for turkey should china see another slowdown in the coming quarters the yuan also fell at an accelerated pace against the dollar in the wake of the increased tariffs between the us and china the currency was even more pressured by a recent data release declining to a new 2019 low on global trade uncertainty the people s bank of china pboc has taken a mild stance and may be considering additional stimulus to counterbalance any negative effects in april the pboc reassured markets that it will continue to support ample liquidity but this was before the breakdown in us china trade negotiations and speculation has edged up since that the central bank may now be prepared to encounter a weaker yuan to offset the upcoming economic pressures from increased tariffs in other assets oil prices were taken down a notch or two for a couple of reasons first the increased risk that the world economy may slow down in the second quarter on the back of escalating trade tensions meaning aggregate demand for oil could fall accordingly second the us energy information administration reported a higher than expected inventory build for the week ending may 10 leaving investors wondering what s next the timing of the report was not positive for oil prices coming as it did so soon in the wake of trade tensions rekindling oil prices rebounded on geopolitical tensions but i expect oil to stay vulnerable to pressure for as long as doubts remain over china s growth while noting that there s still hope the us and china could reach a trade deal global stock markets flashed red sending a clear signal that investors are concerned about the increased tariffs between china and the us which had already pressured company profits in 2018 the chicago board options exchange volatility index which tracks volatility in us stocks recorded sharp spikes indicating a short term return to volatility in us stock markets in asia the hang seng dropped to a three month low and in europe the stoxx 600 index shed gains seen in march and april while risk assets felt the pain of uncertainty safe haven assets benefited from investors attracted to the idea of hedging the riskier instruments gold spiked to a one month high back up towards 1 300 appearing more robust than another safe haven the us dollar the dollar did shed some of the gains seen in april but managed to stabilise shortly after the announcement that trade negotiations would continue the yen benefited from the risk off mood appreciating against other major currencies including the euro and dollar the bright spots on the horizon include the prospect of continued talks between the us and china and the possibility of reaching a trade deal but for the short term the investor mood is likely to stay cautious until the air clears china s goods are set to become cheaper because of the yuan s weakness to other currencies paradoxically this could have the effect of increasing its exports but whether this happens or not remains to be seen in future data releases looking ahead the short term prospects for risk assets remain uncertain and i expect investors to view safe haven assets more favourably at least until the immediate shockwaves have calmed hussein sayed is the chief market strategist at fxtm

jerri lynn here this succinct post dissects the fad for public private partnerships touted to replace another neoliberal god that failed privatization by jomo kwame sundaram a former economics professor was assistant director general for economic and social development food and agriculture organization and received the wassily leontief prize for advancing the frontiers of economic thought in 2007 originally published by inter press service after the failure and abuses of privatization and contracting out services from the 1980s there has been renewed appreciation for the role of the state or government earlier promoters of privatization have taken a step backward only to take two more forward to instead promote public private partnerships ppps ppps for most purposes ppps are essentially long term contracts underwritten by government guarantees with which the private sector builds and sometimes runs major infrastructure projects or services traditionally provided by the state such as hospitals schools roads railways water sanitation and energy ppps are promoted by many governments associated with the organization for economic co operation and development oecd and some multilateral development banks especially the world bank as the solution to the financing shortfall needed to achieve development including the sustainable development goals sdgs since the late 1990s many countries have embraced ppps in many areas ranging from healthcare and education to transport and infrastructure with mixed consequences they were less common in developing countries but that is changing rapidly with many countries in asia latin america and africa now introducing enabling legislation and initiating ppp projects ppps are now an increasingly popular means to finance mega infrastructure projects but dams highways large plantations pipelines and energy or transport infrastructure can ruin habitats displace communities and devastate natural resources typically social and environmental legislation is weakened or circumscribed to attract investors for ppps there are also a growing number of dirty energy ppps devastating the environment undermining progressive environmental conservation efforts and exacerbating climate change ppps have also led to forced displacement repression and other abuses of local communities indigenous peoples displaced farmers and labourers among others ppp financing more public than private nevertheless experiences with ppps have been largely although not exclusively negative and very few ppps have delivered results in the public interest there has been some supposed success with infrastructure ppps mainly due to financing arrangements generally ppps for hospitals and schools have much poorer records compared to infrastructure one can have good financing arrangements due to preferential interest rates for a poor ppp project nevertheless private finance all over the world still accounts for a small share of infrastructure financing however good financing arrangements will not make a bad ppp project any better ppps typically involve public financing for developing countries to attract bids from influential private companies often from abroad blended finance export financing and new supposed aid arrangements have become means for foreign governments to support powerful corporations bidding for ppp contracts abroad especially in developing countries incredibly such arrangements are increasingly counted as overseas development assistance as north south south south or triangular development cooperation like privatization ppps often increase fees or charges for users ppp contracts often undermine the public interest in other ways with generous host government incentives and other privileges often compromising and undermining the state s obligation to regulate in the public interest ppps can limit government capacity to enact new legislation and other policies such as strengthened environmental or social regulations that might adversely affect or constrain investor interests ppps public pain private gain ppp contracts are typically complex negotiations are subject to commercial confidentiality making it hard for civil society and parliamentarians to provide checks and balances in the public and national interest such limited transparency significantly increases the likelihood of corruption and undermines democratic accountability it is important to establish the circumstances required to achieve efficiency gains and to recognize the longer term fiscal implications of ppp related contingent liabilities shifting public debt to government guaranteed debt does not really reduce government debt liabilities but obscures accountability as it is taken off budget and is no longer subject to parliamentary let alone public scrutiny hence ppps are more likely to be abused because they are typically off balance sheet so that they do not show up as government debt giving the illusion of easy money or credit despite claims to the contrary ppps are typically riskier for governments than for the private companies involved as the government may be required to step in to assume costs and liabilities if things go wrong ppps also undermine democracy and national sovereignty as such contracts tend not to be transparent and subject to unaccountable international adjudication due to investor state dispute settlement isds commitments rather than national or international courts under world bank proposed ppp contracts for example national governments can even be liable for losses due to strikes by workers government procurement one alternative of course is government or public procurement in many instances ppps have become the most expensive financing option and much less cost effective than transparent competitive government procurement they cost governments significantly more in the long run than if the government procures on an open competitive basis or if projects are directly financed by government borrowings generally ppps are much more expensive than government procurement despite government subsidized credit however with a competent government doing good work government procurement can be efficient and low cost with a competent government and accountable consultants efficient government procurement has generally proved far more cost effective than ppp alternatives it is therefore important to establish when and why meaningful gains can be achieved through ppps and when these are unlikely

actively promoting the need for a rate cut even bullard who was soft selling this idea recently had many caveats lined up through their forecast horizon and as the minutes confirmed there remains a group that believe rate hikes could very well be necessary if their economic outlook merely meets their expectations mr porcelli also said to be sure we think the hurdle for hikes even through the end

stocks for investors to buy right now and james hardie industries wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of march 1 2019 now let s move on to our group results for fiscal year 19 i m very pleased to announce that this is the first year that we as a group at james hardie crossed the 2 5 billion mark what is even more significant is that we now operate in three major regions around the world north america asia pacific and europe the discussion today will be a lot more in depth about the results in our three regions for the whole fiscal year of 19 because this is the first year that fermacell results are in our results for the whole fiscal year so you look at our year in review north america delivered improved pdg although it s below expectations so if you look at our pdg for fiscal year 19 we re north of 1 relative to the pdg of minus 2 5 a year before and our interior business is still a challenge and it is something that we will be discussing with you some more on what is the key strategy on what we are taking to fundamentally revert the course of the interior business now moving on to asia pacific australia and the philippines continue to lead the way in gaining market share both in market share and category share so in the end we continue to deliver growth above the market that continued also into q4 of fiscal year 19 our european business has really met our expectations this is a full year of fermacell being a part of james hardie group the team has really performed well and delivered the financial that met our expectations equally important is that the team has really done a nice job of integration into james hardie during the course of the past 12 months together with james hardie teams from asia pacific and north america the team in europe has really done a nice job of really understanding what are some of the unmet opportunities in europe for whole weekend and use those fiber cement technologies to come up with those fiber cement products specific for the european market for the european channel and users i m going to share a little bit more about the update on that in the strategy section for fiscal year 19 we continue to be challenged with the input costs they continue to go up particularly in the third and fourth quarter this is always important for us as a company that we focus on lean manufacturing to mitigate the effects of rising raw material costs again i ll share with you the status of where we are with that journey through just like in the past we continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation focused primarily on organic growth we provide the right capacity for our continued growth with the 3590 in north america as well as growth above market in asia pacific of course just to make sure that we focus on our core business and get our business back on track on the growth above the market we also decided to exit the windows business let s move on to north america you can that the housing market demand was soft in the second half of the fiscal year 19 despite that our exterior business grew above the market showing improvements from the prior year as i mentioned before our volume was up 4 7 in the fiscal year 19 for the exterior business that s a little bit offset by the soft performance in the interior business where our volume is down by 4 4 in fiscal year 19 of course the mix of exterior business is a lot bigger than interior in our north american business our ebit margin really came in at around 23 which is right in the target range despite the inflationary trends across key inputs costs are really about the abilities that we press on price as well as managed our cost and performance in the plants to make sure that we continue to gain momentum the commercial transformation and lean transformation are already under way and are beginning to gain traction in our business now let s move on the asia pacific results we continue to deliver excellent top line results on the softening market across the region if you look at fiscal year 19 for the region our volume grew 10 and that translated to about 11 in revenue growth for the year and growth is really driven primarily through australia and the philippines throughout the whole year that s really driven to by the fact that we have been really focusing a lot on primary demand at the end user builders and contractors while at the same time we re also enhancing the james hardie value through our channels and partners to ensure that we have the right go to market strategy to drive demand and then be able to convert into sales in a more sustainable way again we have mentioned that we continue to gain market share of fiber cement against brick and also against wood and plywood within the region within the fiber cement category during this past fiscal year our business in australia as well as in the philippines we continue to gain share against other fiber cement producers our ebit margin was significantly impacted by input cost inflation within asia pacific we had quite a bit of inflation in raw materials as well as the fact that within the region we pay our fiber as well as a key raw material in us dollars with the devaluation of the australian dollars that s added some headwinds in our business in asia pacific let s move on to europe again for the total year the team really did a nice job of delivering topline growth of 7 in euro that translates to a pro forma ebit growth of 6 for the year it s really about the growth of the core business of fermacell that s fiber gypsum that s across western europe particularly across scandinavia and the uk and also in switzerland and benelux the team has spent a lot of time during this past year doing a lot of very good market research to understand those unmet needs and really come up with a right product portfolio that we ll continue to develop for the european market i will share one of those products in the strategy section a little bit later our ebit margin came in with expectation for the whole year the team delivered a 10 6 margin which is what we had discussed with you about a year ago so with that i d like to hand it over to matt who will go into more details about our finances in q4 and fiscal year 19 i ll come back up and discuss the strategy matt matthew marsh chief financial officer thanks jack all right good morning everybody okay so i ll take everybody through the financials for fy19 and the fourth quarter overall a good financial performance last year especially considering the significant inflationary environment that we were in most of our raw materials and freight cost as jack already talked about our north america business continued to see momentum on the exterior side growing above our adjustable market asia pacific had a really good year on both market share gains and category share across the asia pacific business overall we were very pleased with the fermacell result in year one with the pro forma results that jack shared with you earlier and i ll take you through in a bit the integration very much remains right on track we re very pleased with where we are a year into that business and then we ve fully exited the windows business i ll take everybody through where we stand on those transactions for the year we are reporting an adjusted nopat of 300 5 million we had capital expenditures last year of 301 million primarily consisting of the capacity projects that everyone is already aware of i ll give everybody an update on those later in the presentation we declared a second half dividend of 0 26 per share we had talked throughout the year about being in the lower end of our 50 70 dividend payout range for as long as we re above our leverage target we are above our leverage target as i think many of you know as a result of the fermacell acquisition so we ve finally come down a bit in the range the range hasn t changed at all it remains 50 70 of adjusted nopat we re just down in that range in comparison to a year ago as a result of being above the leverage target when i get to the capital allocation framework and the financial management policy i ll talk more about that okay so 4q results for the group net sales were up 19 largely because of the fermacell acquisition that business has been in the result for the whole fiscal year of the 99 million of increased sales almost 90 million of that is a result of fermacell in north america we had both higher volume and net price higher volumes particularly in the exterior business and price across the segment and then higher volumes in the asia pacific business that i ll take everybody through when we get into the business results gross profits were up 10 gross margin rates were down almost 260 basis points what you are seeing there for the most part is the inflationary cost pressure mainly pulp and freight that we experienced in asia pacific and north america adjusted net operating profit was down 9 largely due to the north america and asia pacific segments were down 8 and 22 respectively we ll get into those dynamics those were largely input costs and freight related for the full year net sales were up 22 a very similar dynamic as i talked about in the fourth quarter so of the 452 million increase year over year in net sales 332 million of that was a result of fermacell north america the same story in the full year as the fourth quarter both price and volume were up year on year asia pacific had very good volume growth year on year gross profits were up 14 for the full year margins were down 230 basis points so what you can see in the fourth quarter is the margin compression a little bit more than the full year as jack mentioned the input costs were greater from an inflationary perspective in the second half of the year than the first half of the year and you re seeing that in the margin compression when i talk about input costs later we ll talk about where we see those now and what that might mean or the upcoming year adjusted net operating profit increased by about 9 million it s a combination of europe building products and our europe business and our north america segment both increased for the year okay so for north america a slight improvement in pdg as jack indicated we think we re above about 1 pdg on a market that we think was a 3 4 type growth market in terms of our index so and exterior volume for the quarter of about 3 5 growth for the full year almost 5 growth 4 7 price was right about where we thought it would be for the year you can see that it s up 3 for the full year i think that s right around where we had been talking about for most of the year that was largely a result of our strategic list prices changes that we do annually every april i d say tactical pricing is very much kind of on track and where we expected it to be full year ebit of 382 5 million which was flat compared to a year ago really the dynamics there are higher volume and average net sales price offset by input costs largely and freight here s a chart that i think everyone knows fairly well the red dotted line indicates our stated margin range of 20 25 you can throughout the year we remained right inside that range 23 was right in the middle of our range largely in the middle of the range at this part of the cycle because of the inflationary environment that we were in last year and the significant headwinds that both pulp and freight as well as some of the input costs but those were the large two drivers that resulted in us being in the middle of the range okay speaking of input costs pulp was really the story last year it remained at a very elevated level i think it peaked sometime around october or november it is down in comparison to october or november so where we saw pricing in march and where we see pricing today it s definitely down 3 4 but still up year on year so it still remains at a very elevated level we re starting to see the gap widen again in the spot market and in the contract market which is an encouraging sign those two markets had basically closed to the equivalent pricing so the spot market had basically evaporated we largely buy off of a us based index versus a china based index for you that follow pulp you know that the chinese spot market has definitely come down quicker than the us market and the us market is declining last year pulp for the market prices were up almost 12 year on year we buy better than the 12 so we didn t experience a 12 cost increase in the pulp but nonetheless pulp prices were up pretty significantly for us gas cement was up for the year as well you can see that electricity was about flat freight prices came down in the fourth quarter which is encouraging they were very elevated in the first half of the year i think when we spoke in february i d indicated that we were starting to see some good signs in the market that the freight market was coming back three months later we re continuing to see that so it certainly looks like the freight market is returning to a more reliable supply demand equation asia pacific very strong volume sales volumes were up 10 for the year and 7 in the quarter so a great result for the asia pacific business both in australia and the philippines the business overall had good market penetration gaining category share and market share last year so even though the underlying addressable market was softening throughout the year the overall growth and market penetration remained quite strong you can see that their ebit growth was adversely impacted on a us dollar basis by the strengthening us dollar on a local currency basis it was down 2 the difference between the deleveraging if you will between sales growth and ebit growth is really two dynamics there re input costs we buy much of our pulp in asia pacific in us dollars so you get kind of a double impact you get the strengthening us dollar on top of the rising costs of the contract and spot rates in the marketplace that was the primary driver as we talked about throughout the year last year new zealand manufacturing continued to underperform and that showed up in the result to some extent when you go through the three main businesses in the asia pacific australia had a great growth story market penetration and category gains in that business we talked about ebit already in new zealand very good growth for both the quarter and the full year in addition to the input costs we had manufacturing that was operating at the lower end of its operating band for most of last year that performance is starting to stabilize now although throughout the year it showed up in the result in the philippines good volume increase driven by market share gains so overall good market penetration higher input costs and we did have some non recurring items in that business as well as we started up the new manufacturing line those results show up in the full fiscal year okay so for the europe segment the overall increase was obviously driven by fermacell the price you can see year on year is on a reported basis down i ll just remind everybody that fiber gypsum sells at a significantly lower price than fiber cement as a result of the mix toward a business that is largely fiber gypsum on a year on year basis the pricing metric reports down net sales in euros were up 7 for the quarter and the full year on a pro forma basis the margin rates excluding the non recurring cost were right in line with where we expected them 10 6 for the full year and a little over 11 for the fourth quarter we had 3 5 million of integration costs in the fourth quarter and 18 million of integration costs for the full year in addition to that we had 6 2 million of inventory fair value adjustments that were reported during the fiscal year we included those results in the segment and then provide transparency in the ebit excluding line the other business was our windows business we made that decision and announced that at the november discussion the execution of the exit of that business has gone pretty well last year we had 30 9 million of ebit loses in that segment that included about 6 million of operating losses and 24 million related to the discontinuation of the business we think all of those charges are fully run through the p l at this stage the beechworth business was wound down and the razor pultrusion business we went through a selling process and that business was successfully sold in april of our fiscal 20 so you ll note that it s still in the result of the march 31st period you ll see that the sale transaction got completed in april so both the razor and the beechworth assets are largely fully off the balance sheet at this point we were going to do some liquidation of some of the remaining assets in beechworth but the book values are basically zero on those so here s a summary of the product line discontinuation in addition to windows last year we discontinued the mct business which was one of our trim lines you can see all of that activity on mct the discontinuation of certain color plus skews as a result of our win with color strategy those charges were all in the second quarter of last year the windows business came in kind of three separate quarters the bulk of that we took in the second quarter of last year we did additional writedowns in the third quarter and then as we went through the selling process on both of those businesses and the outcomes were more clear we finished things up in the fourth quarter research and development we reported 29 million of the cost associated with research and development last year roughly flat to where it was a year ago and roughly in line with our 2 3 as a percent of sales our general corporate costs for the year were roughly in line and flat to where they were a year ago so 57 3 million you see a little bit of variation quarter to quarter as we had some legal items related to new zealand weather tightness that created some quarter to quarter variation year on year i ll just remind everybody that we had a non recurring gain a year ago included in the fiscal 18 result of 3 4 million that was associated with a building that we had in our fontana california manufacturing location that we sold i d say the normal variation and volatility that you get in stock comp gets reflected on a quarter to quarter basis overall general corporate costs were right in line with where we thought they would be and roughly flat to about a year ago income tax we reported a 14 8 adjusted effective tax rate for the full year that s pretty in line with what we had talked in the last result about and at the half year result the decrease in the adjusted income tax expense is driven by an adjustment that we made related to the ongoing accounting treatment for amortization of intangibles that s very consistent no change with the last couple of times that we ve talked on that as a reminder our income taxes aren t currently payable or paid in australia due to the losses associated with aicf and our contributions to it we reported cash flow from operations for fiscal year 19 of 288 4 million down 2 i d say the decrease in other assets and liabilities and working capital is a normal quarter to quarter variation so nothing of a concern there the net cash outflow due to working capital again was just quarter to quarter variation no real consumption of working capital that we expect to be a feature of the result the higher investing activity was obviously as a result of fermacell and closing that acquisition and funding it in europe on top of the capacity expansion related capex within the year that i will provide more on the next slide we spent a total of 301 1 million on capex last year that was up about 97 million in comparison to a year ago the projects i think most of you are well aware of there are three main projects in north america the tacoma greenfield which we expect to have completed the start up of that in the early part of our fiscal 20 the continued construction of our prattville manufacturing location that we expect to complete and commission in the early part of fiscal 21 so next fiscal year and then the continued expansion of our color plus product line we were opportunistic and bought a piece of land and some buildings in massachusetts during the year and at some point in the future we ll also put some color plus manufacturing capability there so those were the three main projects that drove the spend in north america asia pacific had two main projects we completed the capacity expansion in the philippines and we re in the middle of the carol park brownfield expansion project both of those projects are very much on track within our financial management framework the overall framework hasn t changed we obviously started the framework with wanting to make sure that our business is performing at expectations we re an organic growth company so we re looking to grow topline results above our market index on volume and be modest price takers overall having good margin rates in the business with those in place and we re hard to get the strategy to continue to produce results that are more in line with both our and your expectations our top capital allocation priorities remain the same so no change on that we fund all the organic growth opportunities first those largely come in the form of r d and capacity expansion as well as funding sales and marking opex that remains our number one priority the ordinary dividend remains our number two priority that is very consistent we are committed to the 50 to 70 payout ratio we obviously operate within that ratio based on where we are with the balance sheet we were opportunistic last year and bought a very good business with fermacell that put us about our target debt range of one to two times adjusted ebitda for a period of time that we think at the time was roughly 8 to 10 quarters we re about halfway through that period now we re right on track with our balance sheet and overall capital management so we like where we are we think in about a year year and a half we ll be back under the two times ceiling again and as a result you can expect that we would then start to come up back in the range where over time back to where we were in that range but we re still very much in the range we re committed to that range i d say our balance sheet strategy is very much on track as i mentioned earlier we closed the year with about 79 million in cash 1 3 billion in net debt and about 340 million of available credit facilities in our revolving credit facility no change in the corporate debt structure we reported 2 4 times net debt at the end of the year and that s right where we expected it to be and right on track to get below two in another 4 or 5 quarters as many of you know the fourth quarter result also includes the annual update of the kpmg actuarial study that aicf commissions kpmg to do annually so that was updated as of 31 march and is reflected in our result the undiscounted uninflated estimate decreased to 1 4 billion from 1 443 billion in the prior year that was a combination of the net cash outflows of 142 8 million and a slight increase in the actuarial estimate for the year total contributions in our fiscal 19 result were 138 4 million australian or 103 million in the us since the time that we established the aicf back in 2007 the company has contributed approximately 1 2 billion into the fund and we anticipate that we will make 100 9 million us dollar contribution this july as part of our annual funding commitment that 100 9 million represents 35 of our free cash flows for fiscal year 19 a little bit on the claims for the full year claims received into aicf were 8 below the actuarial estimate they were approximately 1 higher compared to the prior year so overall a good outcome there claims reporting during the full year for mesothelioma were 4 lower than the estimate and 5 lower than the prior corresponding period so also a good data point in claims trend average claim settlements for the year were 24 below the actuarial estimate it was largely attributable to lower average claim settlements for non mesothelioma claims in summary for the financial section a good financial performance given the dynamic environment that we were in on the input cost and inflationary side higher net sells in north america and in asia pacific both of those segments grew the top line market penetration and category share gains and a really good topline outcome and business outcome for the asia pacific segment a really positive first year for jh europe we like where we are a year into that result and we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities and working within our financial management framework with that i ll hand it over to jack who will take everybody through a strategy update dr jack truong chief executive officer thanks matt okay so let s go to the next slide we confirm that our long term value creation for the james hardie group is about in north america 3590 is our north star it s really about driving growth above markets with strong returns 20 to 25 ebit margin and that s our north star europe is really about creating the 1 billion euro business with a good hearty like the return for the long term and for a pac it s really about making a good business continue to be better and that s about delivering growth above markets with strong returns and a 20 to 25 ebit margin with that being the strategy that s really the object so what we really want to talk about now is what is our key strategic priorities as a company globally that we need to focus on to ensure that we fulfill that long term objective so this is a three year strategic priority that we shared with you three months ago i d just like to give you an update on where we are in north america it is all about accelerating exterior growth it s really all about making sure our marketing and sales team drive the penetration of the total exterior solution that james hardie has in the marketplace that is about driving the hardie panels hardie planks hardie trim hardie soffit really provide that total exterior solution that allows the homeowners to have low maintenance and the durable with flexibility in designs i m going to show you a little bit later in how we bring that to life through the win with color program to drive share growth second in north america is really about how do we continue to transform ourselves to deliver a continually lower and lower unit costs and better quality that is about transforming us from being a world best fiber cement produce into a world class manufacturer through lean transformation i ll give you some updates on where we are with that third which is an area that we will begin to have a lot more focus on and that is to make the interior business a growth business again that is going to be a key focus for us going forward for europe it s really about we acquired fermacell was really to give us that strong footprint in europe with strong channel access as well as closer to the markets with the builder specifiers so that we can build a more meaningful and profitable fiber cement business for the long term and we are going to continue to gain traction in our current fiber cement products as well as continue to develop and launch fiber cement products for the european markets on top of that we ve got to continue to drive growth in our base business which is the fiber gypsum business with the james hardie manufacturing know how this is where we would like to apply a lot more of the capability to the european plant fiber gypsum to continue to unlock more capacity and drive more of the unit cost reductions so that we can enhance the ebit margin for our european business as well as provide additional cash to invest in the market development asia pacific is really about continuing to improve on our playbook that s been successful that is about investing at the end users as well through the channel to provide the push pull effect that has been effective for us and takes lean transformation to the next level to continue to learn and share the best practices with what s going on in north america now let s move on to give you an update on lean transformation in north america it is off to a very very strong start we confirm the targets that we have shared with you three months ago and that is to deliver 100 million in cost out savings over a three year period from fiscal year 20 to fiscal year 22 and the implementation of the lean concept is really beginning to take a stronghold across all of our plants across north america our employee engagement is very high particularly in plants where we executed the hardie manufacturing and offering system this is really the way that we run our plants based on leans wherever we roll out to our plants which is in waxahachie in peru and pulaski in the past three months our employee engagement in those plants has been very high the consistency of production has been really good as well as the variability in how we produce our products and throughput has really been reduced significantly through this whole process we have built a central organization of lean manufacturing experts as well as appoint key manufacturing team members within our plants that become lean change agents so through that organizational capability that we begin to drive a lean culture through our network of plants across north america our goal is to have by the end of the fiscal year that all of our manufacturing plant employees in north america are completely trained in lean so that we can begin to drive a lean culture throughout the manufacturing organization i d like to share with you this chart on the bottom right of the page here so this is the actual costs the unit costs per standard feet across the network of plants across north america this is without taking out the depreciation tax and insurance and freight so this is really the manufacturing cost of producing our products if you look at the highest point here that is the unit costs of our products in december of last year that was about the time that we really started the lean journey in north america you can see that since march of last year until december you can see that unit costs have been going up a lot of that is really in the raw material cost increases but also some of the plant performance lack of performance leading up to december our team started to drive and really build the execution of lean manufacturing through our plants you can see that we start to have lower unit costs in a more consistent way during the past four months if you look at our april actual unit cost it s about in the same range as of may of last year so it s really good to see that not only is employee engagement high but also produce the result that we intend to do with lean lean is a continuous process it s a continuous improvement that is a never ending journey it is an area that we know we are making the right decision we are focusing the organization in the right direction and we will continue to drive that improvement across our network of plants now let s move on to north american acceleration of exterior growth so for us to get to 3590 for short mid and long term is all about first we have to convert vinyl homes into fiber cement really to make that happen is about the win with color it is about our ability to deliver fiber cement in many different types of colors that would allow the developers to build homes with different aesthetics and different designs that would differentiate them comparing to other builders and developers at the same time provide low maintenance and durability to the homeowners just to give you a reference here this is the development in nashville tennessee that we were able to convert this development from vinyl into fiber cement you can see here this is about 300 000 to 400 000 per home developments to the left side is what we call the statement color which is really the core groups of colors that we produce every day that the market can buy from us on the right hand side is the part of the more 700 different colors that people can order from us we call that the dream collection you can see that by doing that together with hardie plank hardie panel hardie trim and hardie soffits that we are able to provide that complete exterior look that looks very nice and allows the builder to differentiate their development from others on the bottom right this is a development outside of boston massachusetts and it is roughly a 700 000 to 800 000 home area that we re able to convert from vinyl to our win with color program with our hardie planks hardie trim and hardie panels so this is really about what this is really what we would use to continue to develop our business against vinyl to really drive that category expansion the market expansion and really that s the what and this is the how the how is really about the commercial transformation that we shared with you back in february that is traditionally in north america we have been focusing a lot more on continuing to convert new builders we haven t really put a lot of focus on the channel and how to create more value with the channel while we create demand so that s what we call the push pull effect this is really the transformation of our commercial organization that needs to happen to make sure that we can have a repeatable more sustainable capability to drive growth above the market as we create demand and that need to translate into sales for us through the channel a key part of that is really about for us we ve got to be easier to do business with and it s important for us to set up the organization within the channel that has a capability of really being able to show and demonstrate that our channel really makes more money by selling our products versus others our sales team structure has been in place our key sales leaders have been hired and so the team talent continues to be filled within the organization so the commercial organization is a little bit tougher than the lean transformation because it s not within 100 of our control we have to convince customers as well as we have competition that we have to deal with certainly we are on the right track let s move on to give you an update on our european business going forward one of the key synergies that we saw with the fermacell business is really about fermacell has a fiber gypsum board that is a high performance board for the interior use that is really one board of fiber gypsum can replace two of gypsum board or a board of gypsum and osb because it has multiple properties within one board that is fire resistant water resistant and acoustic reduction so with fiber cement it is about the exterior our team at the former fermacell james hardie in europe really have access to the specifier the architects and designers this is the case where our team was able to already have the penetration and contact with a specifier to build this kindergarten in brittany france which it is in the northwest coast of france which is where the temperature is on the extreme net to the atlantic ocean it is a really good value proposition for our fiber cement you can see that this team was able to build this new kindergarten with the james hardie fiber cement panels and planks and the exterior and then with the fermacell the interior walls for the insides that s a total solution i d also like to share with you the very exciting things about our growth in europe the launch to that 1 billion euro for the long term is really about yes we have to continue to grow fiber gypsum on top of that we have to really build and develop new fiber cement products for the european market this is a really an exciting case because it really leverages on a global capability there is an unmet need in europe about what we call the weather protection system in scandinavian and in the uk by the coast in the construction and new construction or remodeling of homes or commercial buildings there is a need to have a temporary sheath that really attaches to the frame that would allow the workers to continue to work inside and before they need to put the clad in at the later date a lot of time that can be up to 12 months this is a need that really exists as a market opportunity for our teams in scandinavia so they either happen to have a meeting with our team in new zealand and there was a similar type of concept for the product in new zealand and then the team from europe took that product and market tested in europe it showed it was pretty close to what the needs are but they needed to have a few other requirements that we have to modify to meet the european market that is have to have fire resistance and also to survive up to 12 months in the elements and has to be easy to affix to the structure so they can use staples or nails so our teams passed on these product concepts to our r d center in california and then the team worked to develop the formulation tested it and finally it worked with the end users in europe then it was manufactured at our pulaski plant in virginia and finally shipped to europe for sales and will start selling beginning this week so it s really a very good case of how we can leverage our capability at james hardie around the world now that we have market access in europe to be able to grow our business in europe with fiber cement developed for the european markets and fit for use for the european market so this is really some of the key assumptions that we have for our fiscal year 20 and our market outlook for north america we continue to affirm that there can be modest growth in us housing in the fiscal year 2020 the residential housing start our assumption would be between 1 2 million and 1 3 million homes ebit margin was in the top half of 20 to 25 the exterior volume will be at 3 to 5 pdg europe a slight housing growth across our addressable market in western europe we ll be introducing new fiber cement product for europe this year and we expect to see ebit margin accretion for our european business asia pacific the addressable housing market in australia decreases this year in fact it has already happened a pac volume will be 3 to 5 growth over the market and with the continued focus on the lean transformation into a pac we also expect to see that our ebit margin will be in the top half of our stated range of 20 to 25 with that we ll close right here and we ll open up for q a questions and answers peter steyn macquarie analyst thanks jack peter steyn from macquarie just a quick home in on the commercial transformation estimates and particularly your intent to be easier to do business with we ve obviously seen a couple of movements in the channel just more recently but could you give us a sense of how you re going in terms of traction with further important channel partners as well the internal realignment of some of your sales plans and intent and people dr jack truong chief executive officer peter that s a very good question traditionally james hardie in north america we have been focusing so much onto the pulp side with is at the builders and contractors level we haven t really made the strong effort to really engage with our channel partners in terms of how do we make it more easy for them to receive our products to have the right pricing with us and how to be able to navigate within the james hardie company in the way that we ll get the right information to them to run their business with products that are a lot more simple that would center around the supply chain synchronization between us and then our channel partners to be able to deliver our product the markets in the right way so it is an area that is a key foundation of focus for us commercial transformation is really about adding that capability we call it key account management that is not just about the job of the salesperson the salesperson is a quarterback or the coordinator of james hardie to the account to where we would have the mirror image relationship between the top management and the big channel partners with us the same side with myself and then sean gadd and then our new head of sales all the way down and across to different functions from sales market and products and supply chain and finance that is the structure that we re building right now that will allow us to serve our channel partners a lot better and in a more significant way so that allows us to penetrate the markets peter steyn macquarie analyst perhaps just a quick follow up on that does that disruptive aspect of that reorganization has that been worse or better than what you expected dr jack truong chief executive officer i would say that the level of engagements of us with our channel partners in north america has a lot of room to improve i think it s more than i had expected so that s why it is important for us to really put a strong focus on key account management that is a different skill set and it takes a different focus to make sure that we manage that part correctly while we ve got to make sure that we continue to invest and deploy the right skill sets of the market development folks and the business development folks to go and create new demand for fiber cement to the conversion against vinyl and wood and so on so those are the two separate focus but then management has to align the demand and then the channel management together to ensure that we create the sales from the demand that we just created peter steyn macquarie analyst if i may just a quick on lean you ve indicated that you ve had throughput yield investments and that available hours are up yet the cost per square foot is still stable presumably that s largely a consequence of pulp prices i assume but can you give us a bit of a sense of what is happening at waxahachie pulaski and peru in terms of unit costs perhaps at a more granular level have you actually seen a reduction there dr jack truong chief executive officer yes so in the plant particularly in waxahachie and pulaski we actually have really quite a step change in improvement in our unit costs in a very substantial way in peru it s improved but it s not improved at the level compared to the other two plants yet andrew scott morgan stanley managing director it s andrew scott from morgan stanley one for matt but jack happy for you to chime in just your guidance for particularly north america the 20 to 25 range i note that in the comments there one of the assumptions is increasing input costs and input cost inflation as you mentioned freight is coming away it looks like pulp has turned the corner now is that just conservatism at the start of the year or is there something you re seeing that we re not aware of that is going to suggest that we re going to see input cost inflation throughout the year dr jack truong chief executive officer let me go back to one part it s really more about you can see that we launched the win with color program you see that we also launched our commercial transformation which is going to take some of the investment too make sure that we are able to drive traction to recreate the sustainable pdg so that s just why at this point it s a saving that would afford us the capability to drive more sales growth or more pdg growth go ahead matt matthew marsh chief financial officer yeah input costs before i get to your question andrew i think i mistakenly said that pulp was up 12 for the year just as a correction it was up 13 in the quarter for the year the pulp was up closer to 19 for the year sorry about that on your question pulp definitely looks like it s coming up but it s still pretty elevated so on a year on year basis it s still up if you looked at april to april pricing as an example or may year to date pricing as compared to may year to date pricing a year ago it s still up it s off of where it was a year ago oh sorry it s off of where it was last month it s off of where it was at the peak but it s still pretty elevated but pulp is still trading on the index at 1300 which is still very elevated so that result will sort of continue there s an assumption that we will see a trend down in pulp but i think i said that february and i said that november too i think i m fairly cautious on the pulp market s ability to forecast itself we are seeing good trends i d say over the last 6 or 12 weeks but it s still pretty elevated so that comment is much more around does the trend follow or does it stabilize at a really high level and that would obviously have an effect where we would be on the upper end of the range even taking that into account we still feel pretty comfortable saying we ll be in the top half of our range for next year andrew scott morgan stanley managing director thanks matt if i extend that to australia and i assume it s the same assumption where are we going to get the helping margin there where we re coming from in this quarter at least bang on the bottom end of the range to the top half of the range there because that is a meaningful step up matthew marsh chief financial officer yeah on a year on year basis new zealand manufacturing will no doubt go from being a headwind in the result to a contributor to the result that will be significant keep in mind we did have in the second quarter of our fiscal 19 that one off item in the philippines you take those two items and that has a pretty significant impact just with those two items and then we re not forecasting anything on foreign currency obviously and we ve got the same assumption for pulp that we have in north america andrew scott morgan stanley managing director as we see here today obviously we ve had fermacell integration roll through we ve had the business closures as we look into 20 are there any items you expect to take effectively below the line and in particular i assume you ll expand the strategic costs of living with strategic initiatives is there anything that we need to think about going forward matthew marsh chief financial officer nothing really below the line we ve got some additional fermacell integration costs to go i think those will be in the 5 million to 7 million range for this year it s primarily associated with completing the standup of the back office as you remember fermacell was owned by a private equity company and we ve had to completely stand up both the personnel and the it infrastructure associated with the back office functions so we re probably about two thirds of the way done with that and there are some additional costs in fiscal 20 associated with that but nothing ultimately we think we re through the product line review and portfolio review so we re not expecting additional product line discontinuation costs i m not expecting other items below the line in fiscal 20 simon thackray csla analyst simon thackray from csla jack can we just start with the interiors market down 10 in the quarter that looks like it s still moving away from you can we talk about the drivers of that i mean we ve probably all gone through and see the leisurely vinyl tile taking some share etcetera how much of this problem is a hardie problem versus a market problem dr jack truong chief executive officer good question simon in our interior business i would say 80 of our market access is through the retail channel and really the fundamental in retail is really about position placement pricing and promotion and products so essentially let s talk about the product we have essentially two skews in the channel for a long time for us to grow in this category we have got to have critical mass so it s important for us to really come out with new products and then continue to refresh our category to make us a destination within the retail channel for the contractors so that s the first thing that s one area of the innovation that we re going to focus on second is that more of the short term and that is about placement our product today with the two skews that we have we re not in full in the building material section of those two key retailers we are in primarily in the tile section where we have less traffic we don t have the traffic or the heavy user contract walks through there so we have to fix that placement and then third is really about the position it s about making sure that our products are well positioned in the store so that the contractors we can attract new contractors and be able to use our product in different applications so in some ways it s really about i would say about 75 of that is really within us within our control and then 25 is really about the markets of course when you have a new product or new category like lvt come in it s really incumbent for a manufacturer to say okay if that s the case what are we going to do differently to make sure we can continue to grow so those are the three key strategic actions that our teams are working on right now so that we can fundamentally improve the position for the interior business simon thackray csla analyst and you ve launched a new product at least at the trade level the aqua or hydra whatever it is i can t remember dr jack truong chief executive officer yes hydra defense simon thackray csla analyst so is that now being rolled out dr jack truong chief executive officer so it is a product that we just rolled out to the pro channel as you know the retail channel is the cut through the planner do that once a year so we have to wait until the time when they change the planner gram within retail to be able to launch that into retail that s just the first step the other step is really about to let me show you that we can come out with the new interior products that would resonate well with those unmet needs in the market here i think i mentioned at the last earnings call is that our business 85 or our business in europe is through the interior business today and 35 of our business in a pac is an interior business so there s a lot of know how a lot of the new product concept and opportunity that we can really now bring together as a global team to come up with those new products so i m optimistic about that capability simon thackray csla analyst great that s really helpful thanks jack just a quick one on the asbestos just a refresher it s been a while you re paying at 35 or operating cash flow there was always an opportunity within the agreement for there to be step downs to 30 to 25 over time what are the requirements to get to that is that feasible to get a step down in the payment you ve forked out 1 2 billion now you ve made an acquisition so the ebitda has presumably gone up and the free cash flow presumably goes up matthew marsh chief financial officer yeah over time at some point there will probably be an opportunity for that to step down the requirement in the afa is that when the cash outflow from the fund is less than the annual contribution and cash inflow to the fund when that occurs over a period of time then we can start to take a step down in the contribution rate so it s a formulaic approach i think it will be some time still before that occurs certainly the last couple of years are more positive trends i d say with respect to cash flow and last year was certainly a very good trend but i think we re still a bit away before we see that brooke campbell crawford jp morgan analyst thanks brooke campbell crawford from jp morgan just on the 3 volume growth in the fourth quarter can you talk about how that progressed through the quarter and if it continued into april also how are the order files looking thanks dr jack truong chief executive officer order file the famous order files as you know as we discussed last quarter we look at our commercial transformation is going to take some time we said back then it would take us about 6 or 7 months into the new fiscal year to gain traction so at this point i wouldn t expect our ancillary growth to be materially different from what you see in the fourth quarter until around 6 months from now lee powell deutsche bank analyst lee powell with deutsche bank jack can you just talk a little bit about pricing in fy20 i know there was a comment you said in the presentation about price positioning what pricing increases if any have you got coming through dr jack truong chief executive officer want to take that matt matthew marsh chief financial officer we think the price in fiscal 20 will be around 2 so pretty similar to fiscal 19 i think it was about 3 we haven t changed our approach in the way that we do strategic pricing it s the same process we are still value price that 2 nationally we go through a series of product and region reviews where we are evaluating our price position versus our commercial objectives so there is a range if you look at our product portfolio and our region portfolio you d see a range around that 2 last year that weighted average ended up being closer to 3 this year the weighted average of fiscal 20 will be closer to 2 so we re still pretty satisfied overall with where we are on strategic pricing no real change on the tactical side that 2 obviously includes a combination of that strategic pricing plus what we think we re going to do in tactical this year we re obviously trying to align both the strategic and tactical pricing to the commercial transformation that we re doing we re pretty happy overall with where the price is and we think it will be around 2 for fiscal 20 for north america lee powell deutsche bank analyst thanks following off of peter s question on this changing approach to pdg in north america can you give an idea of like salesforce turnover if anything and how that s been against your expectations as you ve pushed this new approach into your salesforce dr jack truong chief executive officer probably the biggest part of the transformation we had was in the interior business we usually have roughly 80 sales professional who supports the interior business the majority of our team is actually caught on to the stores across the country the business model has really changed with the big boxes really those decisions to promote and place products within them as already done in atlanta or at charlotte so what did there is that we have to have a turnover of over half of those folks so that we can reposition the business at the headquarters to really drive the account management then with the headcounts that we have we use that to hire more of the market development and business development professionals who really go in to convert new business from vinyl into fiber cement so that is the shift that we did to make sure that we can drive the demand and then be able to drive the channel growth at the right points lee powell deutsche bank analyst okay thank you sophie spartellus bank of america merrill lynch analyst sophie spartellus from bank of america merrill lynch just following on from both of the questions on the salesforce you talked about the key roles being filled last quarter we heard about these hunters and gathers that evolved placement of people in different towns and it was quite a cultural shift can you just talk through how that is going and how much of that process is complete dr jack truong chief executive officer so just to be clear the pulp side which is really the market demand which hardie has always been really strong with about creating the demand for fiber cement over vinyl that is an area we actually reinforce with more capability and more resources so that we can drive that demand that doesn t change not only doesn t change but we just add more resources to it we also add more resources to the r r that is an area that is also a growth opportunity for us from the demand generations perspective where we enhance the capability of the sales team is where we create a focus on key account management that is where we need the sales professionals who really understand how to manage our customers in terms of how to provide the services and capability of james hardie to our channel partners so that they can make more money selling our products that is a skill set that we continue to add to the company i think i mentioned at the last earnings call that we just hired a new head of sales for north america and he is reporting to sean gadd who is the chief commercial officer and he johnny cope is his name he is the one that now runs the total sales organization in north america with a strong focus on account management as well as in the market development within this organization we built a new organization called sales operations this is really about the analytics this is really about the sales trends and the mixture and that we have the right training across this is about the customer s inside sales price management and so on and so forth that is the new capability that we also build within the sales organization sophie spartellus bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay so just in terms of that process it seems to be still ongoing can you give you use a timeframe as to when all that will be bedded down and your sales function will be complete to the market dr jack truong chief executive officer we anticipate between 3 to 6 months sophie spartellus bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and just a quick follow up question in regard to asia pac you mentioned in your commentary that the market has peaked you ve got your guidance there decreasing in fy20 can you maybe just talk to through how much clarity you ve got in terms of your order book here in australia and the philippines given they are your key markets dr jack truong chief executive officer we don t have the big visibility out into the order book as we would like but in terms of how our teams are we have a team that is very focused on the primary demand in the marketplace they really know what the demand is we have a very strong team that manages work with our channel which is quite concentrated in australia quite well so they do have a good sense of how the market is moving and more about how we continue to create more demand for our product through the channel and also through the builders and contractors it s not a science yet but certainly there is a good feel for how we are performing against the markets as you can see in the fourth quarter our business in asia pacific continued to perform well at 7 growth and volume they couldn t get there without the growth in australia james branch ubs analyst james branch i m from ubs three months ago when we sat here last we talked about customer perception issues and customer retention problems that you were having at the time you talked about that was costing about 3 percentage points of pdg three months on i m just interested to know how customer perception has changed and where you are tracking against that against your expectations dr jack truong chief executive officer right back then i said we probably have about 25 to 3 erosion of our sales because we re not really managing our current customers i think during the past few months our teams from the top of the company all the way down that we have reached out to our customers form the ceo level down and met with them i think to be able to meet as top to top and mirror image as a team together that really helped to reinforce to our customers that we at james hardie like to engage in a different than we had in the past and that helped but of course just with any customer relationship and management we have to demonstrate that every day demonstrate with actions every day until our customers really believe that we have made a change to be a lot more customer focused now it is a journey it s not something that you change people s mind overnight it is an area as a company that we have to change to be able to get there james branch ubs analyst right so i guess the target for 3 to 5 points of pdg sorry the target this year for 3 to 5 of pdg doesn t really assume that you get any more traction in terms of retaining those lost customers there s no improvement that s upside is it or is there actually some improvement dr jack truong chief executive officer i think first and foremost that at least to start that would help minimize some of the erosion the next step is really about growing beyond that that s a two step process matthew marsh chief financial officer anyone on the phone operator we have a question from peter wilson with credit suisse please ask peter wilson credit suisse analyst thank you good morning jack in north america if i could just clarify one of your answers to your questions earlier you said it will take 6 to 7 months for some of this year s initiatives to gain traction and hence you wouldn t expect growth to be above the fourth quarter that would seem to imply that in order to achieve your 3 to 5 pdg target that you re going to have to be right on the top end of that range for the second half right dr jack truong chief executive officer we would anticipate that once we get our commercial transformation set to run that we would see stronger traction yes peter wilson credit suisse analyst and that would be the upper range right the top end of that range dr jack truong chief executive officer in the second half peter wilson credit suisse analyst okay the last you reported you illustrated a 10 year plan and i think part of that could be really used in the wood the numbers that you are reporting don t really seem to illustrate that i was just wondering how confident you are on that and if there is any tangible progress you can point to there matthew marsh chief financial officer can you repeat that to just make sure i ve got your question right you re asking if the commercial transformation that we talked about in february which showed a gain over the next ten years along our 3590 strategies against both vinyl and wood look alternatives required kind of early gains by substituting lp and your question is the reported result for lp looks pretty similar to our reported result so how that statement compares to the most recent results that s the essence of your question peter wilson credit suisse analyst apologies i think the first part got cut off there i guess my question is lps reported a high percent volume growth in the third quarter sorry in the march quarter and on the 12 month basis was well ahead of the numbers you printed as well it just doesn t suggest that there s any progress of taking share off of engineered wood dr jack truong chief executive officer i think if you look at the last 12 months our growth rate between us and lp is about the same i think about 5 so having said that for us to continue to march toward our 3590 it is important for us to be able to take more share for lp lp is a good competitor so it is going to be about execution and about plans and continue to adjust as necessary to make sure that we achieve our long term objectives peter wilson credit suisse analyst okay at what point would you start to become worried if those relative numbers don t start improving in your direction dr jack truong chief executive officer peter i think it s just too early to tell yeah peter wilson credit suisse analyst one last one the win with color is a big part of achieving that you have said you have an expanded range of colors am i wrong in saying that at the us investor day last year you outlined a plan to rationalize the number of colors that you were doing in order to improve your selection efficiencies dr jack truong chief executive officer that is correct we did rationalize quite a bit and then what we offer what we call the statement line is about the core products that our customer can order made to stock that s roughly about 15 skus and then the other is about over 700 different colors that our customer can order with us that s really about the made to order and so that kind of gives our customers the capability and the ability to design any type of development that they would like but it s really about uses focused primarily on the 15 skus that we sale day in and day out to the market and that is where the rationalization and standardization that would improve our manufacturing efficiency and translate to cost reduction peter wilson credit suisse analyst awesome that s perfect thank you operator we have another question from daniel kang from citigroup please ask your question daniel kang citigroup analyst good morning everyone just a quick one in terms of the pdg growth rate you mentioned that 1 off the full year are you able to estimate the exit rate for the fourth quarter and while we re talking about the competitive landscape who knows that the import level is quite strong into the march quarter are you seeing much impact from the increased import level dr jack truong chief executive officer i think our fourth quarter exterior volume growth is about 3 5 comparing to the third quarter of 1 we don t want to look at pdg really on a quarterly basis because it s not really an exact science so we kind of look at it from the rolling 12 months if you look at the rolling 12 months for fiscal year 19 it s more than 1 versus minus 2 5 a year ago there s that momentum a little bit coming out of the fourth quarter so in terms of an appreciable step change it s not going to be materialized until we execute our commercial transformation to the fullest and then relative to your question on the fiber cement go ahead daniel matthew marsh chief financial officer sorry no one is speaking jack had asked if you had a follow up question daniel kang citigroup analyst yeah the follow up question was just in terms of the increased import in the march quarter are you seeing any impact there matthew marsh chief financial officer on input costs dr jack truong chief executive officer yeah matthew marsh chief financial officer imports of fc yeah we noted the same no we re not seeing any sort of the significant change in the marketplace i think the headline number on the percent growth is a big number i think it was almost 30 something percent but keep in mind that i d say that what they re comping that off of is actually quite low from a year ago so if you look at the import volume over a longer period of time if you look at where it s been on a quarterly basis over the last three years it s still at a relatively low volume on a volume basis it s at a low point in comparison where some of the other quarters have gotten reported so no we re not seeing anything sort of unusual in the marketplace or anything that is concerning us or anything that s got us off strategy or off target daniel kang citigroup analyst very good also in terms of expectations for expected tax rate matthew marsh chief financial officer you can in august yeah i mean i m not going to guide on etr for fiscal 20 once we get a good sense of how the year is going to play out we ll talk about that in august i m not expecting material change okay so it s not like the 14 9 number we reported this quarter is going to change materially it will move up and down based on earnings and where those earnings occur but that s not an artificially high or low number we think that s a feature of the result going forward and i d say similarly on guidance for fiscal 20 we ll talk about that as we normally do as part of the august result daniel kang citigroup analyst got it thanks man matthew marsh chief financial officer for capex there s no change on prior guidance for fiscal 20 we expect that we ll spend somewhere around 200 million for fiscal 20 and we think the next two years after that fiscal 21 and 22 will be a step down from that probably closer to 150 million we ve largely gotten through our greenfield and brownfield capacity projects we think across the globe obviously there are other opportunities that we ll explore particularly in europe at some point we ll add capacity both for fiber gypsum and as the fiber cement business grows none of those are sort of included in that medium term outlook because we don t expect them to occur in that medium term outlook so 200 million in capex in fiscal 20 and then 21 and 22 is a step down from that probably around 150 million per year for each of those two years daniel kang citigroup analyst thank you operator there re no further questions at this time i d like to hand the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks please continue dr jack truong chief executive officer i think we both thank you all for coming i think our fiscal year 19 was a solid result from a global business we are going through a transformation in north america commercial and our lean manufacturing which we should expect to see the results throughout the year in fiscal year 20 thank you duration

menafn daily news egypt the monetary policy committee mpc of the central bank of egypt cbe will hold its third regular meeting this year to discuss the fate of interest rates which is the most prominent indicator of the direction of interest rates on the egyptian pound in the local market the committee s meeting this time comes amid strong expectations that it will be stabilised at the same levels reached on 14 february despite the decline in the rate of headline and core inflation at the end of april at its 14 february meeting the committee decided to reduce the basic interest rates by 1 to 15 75 for deposits 16 75 for lending and 16 25 for credit discount and main operation on 28 march the cbe disagreed with market expectations and decided to fix those prices at this level despite expectations of a reduction the cbe reported drop in core inflation to 8 1 year over year y o y in april from 8 9 in march the monthly core inflation rate was 0 4 in april from 0 5 in march the central agency for public mobilization and statistics capmas said that the annual inflation of consumer prices index cpi in cities fell to 13 y o y in april compared with 14 2 in march the cpi scored 308 1 points for april 2019 registering a rise of 0 4 compared to march 2019 mohamed abdel aal a member of the board of directors of the suez canal bank and a banking expert said that the changes in the international and domestic markets support the cbe s trend to stabilise its interest rates and weakens the trend to reduce them he expected the cbe to cut interest rates in the fourth quarter q4 of 2019 abdel aal added that despite the decline in inflation during the month of april yet removing subsidies and freeing the price of gasoline scheduled for implementation starting next july will lead to increased inflation again he pointed out that the exchange rate of the pound is stable and significantly improving which may push the cbe to stabilise interest rates so as not to pressure the local currency by raising or lowering interest rates adding that the interest rate must be attractive to foreign investors in government debt instruments according to abdel aal the cbe may also want to maintain the remarkable return on household savings to compensate for high inflation rates and avoid possible inflationary pressures especially as the country moves to liberalise energy prices in accordance with the agreed timetable with the international monetary fund in the second half of this year in addition to rising global oil prices furthermore abdel aal pointed to the existence of external factors which could affect the monetary policy of egypt including the escalating trade war between the united states and china which may push inflation to rise in the us which may force the federal reserve to raise the interest rate on the dollar which may be then force the cbe to raise the interest rate tarek metwally a banking expert who predicted interest rates to remain unchanged on thursday also agreed noting that the probability of keeping rates unchanged is greater than a cut in rates as the government moves to lift subsidies on fuel in june a report by the research department of hc securities said that the mpc of the cbe will set the interest rate at its meeting scheduled for thursday the research also expected the cbe to keep interest rates unchanged at its next three meetings so that the market absorbs the first and second impact cycles to increase fuel prices while monthly inflation was exceptionally low in april it is expected to rise in may due to increased consumer demand during ramadan sara saada macroeconomic analyst at the company s research department said however hc expects the cbe to resume its interest rate cuts by the end of q3 or in q4 of 2019 as prices stabilise but the reduction decision remains subject to the market s position at the time in a research note issued by pharos holdings it expected the pound interest to be stabilised at thursday s meeting but also expected 100 basis points bps rate cut to 200 bps in q4 of this year it pointed out that the monthly inflation figures were less than expected pointing out that the discounts on food items by the government contributed to curbing inflation pharos expected the annual inflation rate to rise again in the coming months due to the removal of fuel subsidies and for the headline inflation to increase by 3 in june and september in conjunction with the beginning of the school year which tends to come with 1 inflation increase on an annualized basis pharos sees inflation as between 12 5 and 13 5 the investment bank shuaa also predicted that the cbe will keep interest rates unchanged until the end of the year with ramadan and eid followed by fiscal controls expected to continue inflationary pressures in contrast investment bank beltone said there was a chance to cut the pound s interest rate further by 100 bps at the mpc meeting on thursday in our view the recent cut in interest rates ahead of february s forecast aimed to boost investor confidence by sending a strong confidence message in the current monetary policy as well as confidence in the local currency course however the most likely scenario is to cut interest rates by 100 bps by the end of the year amid the repercussions of inflationary pressure as the automated fuel pricing mechanism is applied fitch ratings had forecast that the cbe would cut interest rates again by 100 bps during the rest of 2019 the agency said in a report that the risks of further easing monetary policy maintains substantial risks
the architect of the argentine debacle advises the government of lópez obrador the arrival of andres manuel lopez obrador to the presidency of mexico unleashed the worst fears of financial analysts as the tabasco politician is pursued by the shadow of populist leaders such as hugo chavez nicolas maduro in the first months of his government none of the most pessimistic predictions about the mexican economy have been fulfilled in fact the peso has regained ground against the us dollar inflation remains generally stable and foreign investment has not gone into disarray on the contrary it increased in the first quarter of the year and the tariff agreement on metals cleared the way for the ratification of the t mec buuuuut the alerts remain lit perhaps the most relevant is that which speaks of an authoritarian government capable of canceling an international airport that is extremely needed and under construction which bets a great part of the economic growth on popular programs that will cost billions of pesos to the treasury does not cease to cause animosity many are concerned about the ideological baggage of people who have approached the government to provide advice the architect of the argentine economic debacle is one of those mary anastasia o grady of the wall street journal reported the presence in mexico of axel kicillof former minister of economy of cristina fernández de kirchner former president of argentina while working in kirchner s government kicillof was known for the hard left s anti market activism and fiery criticism that fostered envy and hatred among argentines lópez obrador has also been singled out for polarizing mexican society today it is common to hear in the streets and in political debates the words chairo or fifí to distinguish between followers of the president s economic policy and opponents axel kicillof came to mexico to give the lecture how to confront neoliberalism and not die trying argentina mexico and the new conservative wave in latin america but he also met with senators from the morena party and government officials this verified by the wall street journal there is no way to consider that meeting with people so close to lópez obrador as a good sign red alerts light up for entrepreneurs investors and mexico s main trading partners such as the u s and canada when the man responsible for the exponential increase in inflation in argentina has been hired as an advisor to mexican economists the red alerts returned once again when lópez obrador presented his national development plan a few weeks ago a document that is supposed to be a strategic quantitative and technical project which became a subjective document of good intentions with no concrete courses of action filled with populist phrases attractive to the people such as for the good of all the poor come first para el bien de todos primero los pobres according to the instituto mexicano de ejecutivos de finanzas imef the measurements and forecasts of the cost of amlo s social programs range from 1 5 to 2 5 of the gdp and kicillof s visit does not go unnoticed by investors since it is well known that for more than a quarter of a century mexico has been working hard to modernize its economic model and has achieved important advances up to the presidency of lópez obrador since there is fear of a similar situation as the one that happened in argentina with the kirchernism which could drag down the national economy back to the mexican recession of 1995 morena lópez obrador s party has among its ranks strong defenders and sympathizers of left wing governments and there have been multiple signs of sympathy towards the regime of nicolás maduro which the mexican government using the estrada doctrine has refused to ignore as most latin american states have done to this day no one with a little basic knowledge of economics and finance can see or say that kicillof s boundless populist legacy has been a success except of course the myopes members of mexico s left kicillof was part of a disastrous argentine economy with huge budget deficits pressure on the central bank to print money and destroyed the country s investment profile axel kicillof preached against private property rights applauded the debt default and confiscation of foreign assets national businessmen and labor force also received a bitter dose of populism when cristina fernández de kirchner nationalized private pension accounts in argentine banks let s remember that in a globalized world markets are no strangers to political winks no matter how faint they may be in argentina the announcement that cristina fernández de kirchner will contend in the next elections had an immediate response from the stock markets and investments if foreign investors had doubts about disbursing funds in argentina until after the october elections the ratification of cristina fernández de kirchner s candidacy will extend even further in time that agony of the arrival of investment as described by martín dinatale in infobae one way or the other in mexico the businessmen banks and the national and foreign investors have expressed their interest to continue participating in the mexican economy but the red alerts of uncertainty and doubts that surround lópez obrador are lit with visits like that of kicillof and are intensified with rumors of his hiring as an advisor which if true the future looks very bleak since using the wise words of mexican economics expert and political analyst alejandra cullen axel kicillof work is remembered as the most exceptional case of destruction of wealth and generation of poverty in the history of argentina so i can t help to think is mexico next josé e urioste palomeque for the yucatan times newsroom based in information from the wall street journal infobae the london times forbes bloomberg instituto mexicano de ejecutivos de finanzas imef

whenever the economy gets up a head of steam as has been the case recently we have a debate about does growth cause inflation this has been going on a long time about fifty years as i count it you would think that we could have answered that question by now and not still be talking about it so let s figure it out the core of the problem lies in the term inflation which doesn t have a specific meaning and which tends to be used rather carelessly by all involved at times people have attempted to attach a precise definition to the term i have done this too but other people don t follow this protocol so in the end it remains a muddle this is actually a big deal because since we don t want inflation presumably sometimes people do things that will stifle growth in an effort to avoid inflation this usually means some kind of tight monetary stance but it can also mean things like tax increases specifically to reduce growth which probably sounds pretty stupid but it was actually a popular line of argument in the late 1960s and 1970s among the usual bozos bearing nobel prizes although the term inflation can be misused in many ways usually it refers to two things the first is a decline in currency value for example the devaluation of the dollar from 20 67 oz of gold to 35 oz of gold in 1933 obviously reduced the value of the dollar and this was reflected in foreign exchange rates as well in response to this markets naturally accommodate this new monetary factor and nominal prices tend to rise over a period of years afterwards in short this kind of inflation is purely a monetary effect caused by central bank alteration and mismanagement of the currency the term inflation can also refer to an increase in some price indicator like the consumer price index we often say that the inflation rate is 2 referring to a 2 rise in the cpi this rise in the cpi can come about from monetary causes as was just described but it can also come about just from general economic prosperity even when there is no monetary cause in general rising productivity leads to rising wages and rising wages are commonly correlated with rising prices for various things especially services and assets such as property prices if you go to any city in the u s today you will generally find that if wages are high as in san francisco then the cost of living will be high also in terms of local service prices dentists restaurants daycare and property prices if you go somewhere where wages are lower such as buffalo you will find that local service prices and property prices are lower easily traded goods like gasoline or ipads will be about the same in either location obviously this has nothing to do with monetary effects since the dollar is the same in san francisco and buffalo what we find is that countries that are prosperous generally have a cpi as it is commonly calculated today that rises perhaps 2 3 per year due to these nonmonetary effects in a high growth economy like japan in the 1960s and hong kong in the early 1990s these growth effects can lead to a measured cpi rising in the 5 8 per year range without monetary effects this is good inflation as it is a harmless and benign aftereffect of high growth nathan lewis if we reword the question does growth cause inflation to does growth cause a decline in currency value and monetary distortion of the economy and also does growth cause the measured cpi to rise in the absence of monetary factors we can clearly see that the answer to the first question is no and the answer to the second question is yes unfortunately most economists can only think in one of these two frameworks because economists typically can only think in one of these two frameworks they tend to assume that the other side is invalid for example many people who understand very well that inflation can come about due to the effects of monetary distortion following a decline in currency value tend to assume that the cpi will be more or less unchanged in the absence of such factors in other words that the cpi growth rate will be very low perhaps around 0 or 2 or even negative even when growth is high this is usually wrong the other camp tends to assume that increases in the cpi come about via supply demand factors for goods and services and assume that there is no monetary distortion as a matter of principle during the 1970s the value of the dollar fell by a factor of about ten during the 1980s it was worth only about a tenth of its value during the 1960s this was wholly a monetary effect following the abandonment of the gold standard at 35 oz in 1971 the price of oil rose by thirteen times from 3 a barrel to 40 to compensate for the decline in the dollar but most economists of the time could not understand that this was entirely a monetary effect and assumed that it had something to do with the supply and demand for oil of course they spent the decade spouting the most absurd idiocies nathan lewis but the cpi is just one number it reacts to both monetary effects and growth effects and other effects on top of that even things like changes in sales taxes regulatory changes international factors and so forth a 15 minimum wage would probably raise prices but it isn t monetary and it is probably not so good for growth either you can t tell from the cpi alone whether it is reacting to changes in monetary value growth or some other factor this is one reason why cpi targeting and price stability can never be an effective method of central bank currency management if the value of the currency is stable stable money then you can have outrageous growth rates japan s nominal gdp grew at 16 per year in the 1960s which would be accompanied by big rises in the cpi of 5 8 per year and it won t be inflationary this is one of many reasons why nominal gdp targeting won t work that is the growth in nominal gdp and the increase in the cpi won t be from monetary factors the japanese yen was linked to gold in the 1960s and the hong kong dollar was linked to the u s dollar in the 1990s with a currency board the purpose of the gold standard in the many decades and centuries before 1971 was to produce as nearly as possible this stable money money that is stable in value when you have stable money you can ignore the cpi as japan and hong kong did and as the u s did in those wonderful decades of success before the modern cpi was created in 1940 wages can rise and rise and rise and rise and rise some more isn t that what we want
logo of jester cap with thought bubble with words fool transcripts below it image source the motley fool james hardie industries plc nyse jhx q4 2019 earnings call may 20 2019 7 00 p m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks dr jack truong chief executive officer good morning everyone welcome to our fiscal year 2019 earnings call thank you for joining us today i m jack truong ceo of james hardie group and with me here today is matt marsh group cfo both of us will share with you the results for fiscal year 19 and then we re going to share with you where we are going with our strategy and the status of our strategy so firstly on the agenda i ll briefly go over the operating review of the company in the fiscal year 19 then matt will come up and share with you in more detail on the financial results of the quarter and also the year then i ll get back up and really share with you the progress of the three year strategy that we shared with you three months ago where we are relative to the execution along that three year horizon and then we ll end with the q a more from the motley fool now let s move on to our group results for fiscal year 19 i m very pleased to announce that this is the first year that we as a group at james hardie crossed the 2 5 billion mark what is even more significant is that we now operate in three major regions around the world north america asia pacific and europe the discussion today will be a lot more in depth about the results in our three regions for the whole fiscal year of 19 because this is the first year that fermacell results are in our results for the whole fiscal year so you look at our year in review north america delivered improved pdg although it s below expectations so if you look at our pdg for fiscal year 19 we re north of 1 relative to the pdg of minus 2 5 a year before and our interior business is still a challenge and it is something that we will be discussing with you some more on what is the key strategy on what we are taking to fundamentally revert the course of the interior business now moving on to asia pacific australia and the philippines continue to lead the way in gaining market share both in market share and category share so in the end we continue to deliver growth above the market that continued also into q4 of fiscal year 19 our european business has really met our expectations this is a full year of fermacell being a part of james hardie group the team has really performed well and delivered the financial that met our expectations equally important is that the team has really done a nice job of integration into james hardie during the course of the past 12 months together with james hardie teams from asia pacific and north america the team in europe has really done a nice job of really understanding what are some of the unmet opportunities in europe for whole weekend and use those fiber cement technologies to come up with those fiber cement products specific for the european market for the european channel and users i m going to share a little bit more about the update on that in the strategy section for fiscal year 19 we continue to be challenged with the input costs they continue to go up particularly in the third and fourth quarter this is always important for us as a company that we focus on lean manufacturing to mitigate the effects of rising raw material costs again i ll share with you the status of where we are with that journey through just like in the past we continue to be very disciplined in our capital allocation focused primarily on organic growth we provide the right capacity for our continued growth with the 3590 in north america as well as growth above market in asia pacific of course just to make sure that we focus on our core business and get our business back on track on the growth above the market we also decided to exit the windows business let s move on to north america you can that the housing market demand was soft in the second half of the fiscal year 19 despite that our exterior business grew above the market showing improvements from the prior year as i mentioned before our volume was up 4 7 in the fiscal year 19 for the exterior business that s a little bit offset by the soft performance in the interior business where our volume is down by 4 4 in fiscal year 19 of course the mix of exterior business is a lot bigger than interior in our north american business our ebit margin really came in at around 23 which is right in the target range despite the inflationary trends across key inputs costs are really about the abilities that we press on price as well as managed our cost and performance in the plants to make sure that we continue to gain momentum the commercial transformation and lean transformation are already under way and are beginning to gain traction in our business now let s move on the asia pacific results we continue to deliver excellent top line results on the softening market across the region if you look at fiscal year 19 for the region our volume grew 10 and that translated to about 11 in revenue growth for the year and growth is really driven primarily through australia and the philippines throughout the whole year that s really driven to by the fact that we have been really focusing a lot on primary demand at the end user builders and contractors while at the same time we re also enhancing the james hardie value through our channels and partners to ensure that we have the right go to market strategy to drive demand and then be able to convert into sales in a more sustainable way again we have mentioned that we continue to gain market share of fiber cement against brick and also against wood and plywood within the region within the fiber cement category during this past fiscal year our business in australia as well as in the philippines we continue to gain share against other fiber cement producers our ebit margin was significantly impacted by input cost inflation within asia pacific we had quite a bit of inflation in raw materials as well as the fact that within the region we pay our fiber as well as a key raw material in us dollars with the devaluation of the australian dollars that s added some headwinds in our business in asia pacific let s move on to europe again for the total year the team really did a nice job of delivering topline growth of 7 in euro that translates to a pro forma ebit growth of 6 for the year it s really about the growth of the core business of fermacell that s fiber gypsum that s across western europe particularly across scandinavia and the uk and also in switzerland and benelux the team has spent a lot of time during this past year doing a lot of very good market research to understand those unmet needs and really come up with a right product portfolio that we ll continue to develop for the european market i will share one of those products in the strategy section a little bit later our ebit margin came in with expectation for the whole year the team delivered a 10 6 margin which is what we had discussed with you about a year ago so with that i d like to hand it over to matt who will go into more details about our finances in q4 and fiscal year 19 i ll come back up and discuss the strategy matt matthew marsh chief financial officer thanks jack all right good morning everybody okay so i ll take everybody through the financials for fy19 and the fourth quarter overall a good financial performance last year especially considering the significant inflationary environment that we were in most of our raw materials and freight cost as jack already talked about our north america business continued to see momentum on the exterior side growing above our adjustable market asia pacific had a really good year on both market share gains and category share across the asia pacific business overall we were very pleased with the fermacell result in year one with the pro forma results that jack shared with you earlier and i ll take you through in a bit the integration very much remains right on track we re very pleased with where we are a year into that business and then we ve fully exited the windows business i ll take everybody through where we stand on those transactions for the year we are reporting an adjusted nopat of 300 5 million we had capital expenditures last year of 301 million primarily consisting of the capacity projects that everyone is already aware of i ll give everybody an update on those later in the presentation we declared a second half dividend of 0 26 per share we had talked throughout the year about being in the lower end of our 50 70 dividend payout range for as long as we re above our leverage target we are above our leverage target as i think many of you know as a result of the fermacell acquisition so we ve finally come down a bit in the range the range hasn t changed at all it remains 50 70 of adjusted nopat we re just down in that range in comparison to a year ago as a result of being above the leverage target when i get to the capital allocation framework and the financial management policy i ll talk more about that okay so 4q results for the group net sales were up 19 largely because of the fermacell acquisition that business has been in the result for the whole fiscal year of the 99 million of increased sales almost 90 million of that is a result of fermacell in north america we had both higher volume and net price higher volumes particularly in the exterior business and price across the segment and then higher volumes in the asia pacific business that i ll take everybody through when we get into the business results gross profits were up 10 gross margin rates were down almost 260 basis points what you are seeing there for the most part is the inflationary cost pressure mainly pulp and freight that we experienced in asia pacific and north america adjusted net operating profit was down 9 largely due to the north america and asia pacific segments were down 8 and 22 respectively we ll get into those dynamics those were largely input costs and freight related for the full year net sales were up 22 a very similar dynamic as i talked about in the fourth quarter so of the 452 million increase year over year in net sales 332 million of that was a result of fermacell north america the same story in the full year as the fourth quarter both price and volume were up year on year asia pacific had very good volume growth year on year gross profits were up 14 for the full year margins were down 230 basis points so what you can see in the fourth quarter is the margin compression a little bit more than the full year as jack mentioned the input costs were greater from an inflationary perspective in the second half of the year than the first half of the year and you re seeing that in the margin compression when i talk about input costs later we ll talk about where we see those now and what that might mean or the upcoming year adjusted net operating profit increased by about 9 million it s a combination of europe building products and our europe business and our north america segment both increased for the year okay so for north america a slight improvement in pdg as jack indicated we think we re above about 1 pdg on a market that we think was a 3 4 type growth market in terms of our index so and exterior volume for the quarter of about 3 5 growth for the full year almost 5 growth 4 7 price was right about where we thought it would be for the year you can see that it s up 3 for the full year i think that s right around where we had been talking about for most of the year that was largely a result of our strategic list prices changes that we do annually every april i d say tactical pricing is very much kind of on track and where we expected it to be full year ebit of 382 5 million which was flat compared to a year ago really the dynamics there are higher volume and average net sales price offset by input costs largely and freight here s a chart that i think everyone knows fairly well the red dotted line indicates our stated margin range of 20 25 you can throughout the year we remained right inside that range 23 was right in the middle of our range largely in the middle of the range at this part of the cycle because of the inflationary environment that we were in last year and the significant headwinds that both pulp and freight as well as some of the input costs but those were the large two drivers that resulted in us being in the middle of the range okay speaking of input costs pulp was really the story last year it remained at a very elevated level i think it peaked sometime around october or november it is down in comparison to october or november so where we saw pricing in march and where we see pricing today it s definitely down 3 4 but still up year on year so it still remains at a very elevated level we re starting to see the gap widen again in the spot market and in the contract market which is an encouraging sign those two markets had basically closed to the equivalent pricing so the spot market had basically evaporated we largely buy off of a us based index versus a china based index for you that follow pulp you know that the chinese spot market has definitely come down quicker than the us market and the us market is declining last year pulp for the market prices were up almost 12 year on year we buy better than the 12 so we didn t experience a 12 cost increase in the pulp but nonetheless pulp prices were up pretty significantly for us gas cement was up for the year as well you can see that electricity was about flat freight prices came down in the fourth quarter which is encouraging they were very elevated in the first half of the year i think when we spoke in february i d indicated that we were starting to see some good signs in the market that the freight market was coming back three months later we re continuing to see that so it certainly looks like the freight market is returning to a more reliable supply demand equation asia pacific very strong volume sales volumes were up 10 for the year and 7 in the quarter so a great result for the asia pacific business both in australia and the philippines the business overall had good market penetration gaining category share and market share last year so even though the underlying addressable market was softening throughout the year the overall growth and market penetration remained quite strong you can see that their ebit growth was adversely impacted on a us dollar basis by the strengthening us dollar on a local currency basis it was down 2 the difference between the deleveraging if you will between sales growth and ebit growth is really two dynamics there re input costs we buy much of our pulp in asia pacific in us dollars so you get kind of a double impact you get the strengthening us dollar on top of the rising costs of the contract and spot rates in the marketplace that was the primary driver as we talked about throughout the year last year new zealand manufacturing continued to underperform and that showed up in the result to some extent when you go through the three main businesses in the asia pacific australia had a great growth story market penetration and category gains in that business we talked about ebit already in new zealand very good growth for both the quarter and the full year in addition to the input costs we had manufacturing that was operating at the lower end of its operating band for most of last year that performance is starting to stabilize now although throughout the year it showed up in the result in the philippines good volume increase driven by market share gains so overall good market penetration higher input costs and we did have some non recurring items in that business as well as we started up the new manufacturing line those results show up in the full fiscal year okay so for the europe segment the overall increase was obviously driven by fermacell the price you can see year on year is on a reported basis down i ll just remind everybody that fiber gypsum sells at a significantly lower price than fiber cement as a result of the mix toward a business that is largely fiber gypsum on a year on year basis the pricing metric reports down net sales in euros were up 7 for the quarter and the full year on a pro forma basis the margin rates excluding the non recurring cost were right in line with where we expected them 10 6 for the full year and a little over 11 for the fourth quarter we had 3 5 million of integration costs in the fourth quarter and 18 million of integration costs for the full year in addition to that we had 6 2 million of inventory fair value adjustments that were reported during the fiscal year we included those results in the segment and then provide transparency in the ebit excluding line the other business was our windows business we made that decision and announced that at the november discussion the execution of the exit of that business has gone pretty well last year we had 30 9 million of ebit loses in that segment that included about 6 million of operating losses and 24 million related to the discontinuation of the business we think all of those charges are fully run through the p l at this stage the beechworth business was wound down and the razor pultrusion business we went through a selling process and that business was successfully sold in april of our fiscal 20 so you ll note that it s still in the result of the march 31st period you ll see that the sale transaction got completed in april so both the razor and the beechworth assets are largely fully off the balance sheet at this point we were going to do some liquidation of some of the remaining assets in beechworth but the book values are basically zero on those so here s a summary of the product line discontinuation in addition to windows last year we discontinued the mct business which was one of our trim lines you can see all of that activity on mct the discontinuation of certain color plus skews as a result of our win with color strategy those charges were all in the second quarter of last year the windows business came in kind of three separate quarters the bulk of that we took in the second quarter of last year we did additional writedowns in the third quarter and then as we went through the selling process on both of those businesses and the outcomes were more clear we finished things up in the fourth quarter research and development we reported 29 million of the cost associated with research and development last year roughly flat to where it was a year ago and roughly in line with our 2 3 as a percent of sales our general corporate costs for the year were roughly in line and flat to where they were a year ago so 57 3 million you see a little bit of variation quarter to quarter as we had some legal items related to new zealand weather tightness that created some quarter to quarter variation year on year i ll just remind everybody that we had a non recurring gain a year ago included in the fiscal 18 result of 3 4 million that was associated with a building that we had in our fontana california manufacturing location that we sold i d say the normal variation and volatility that you get in stock comp gets reflected on a quarter to quarter basis overall general corporate costs were right in line with where we thought they would be and roughly flat to about a year ago income tax we reported a 14 8 adjusted effective tax rate for the full year that s pretty in line with what we had talked in the last result about and at the half year result the decrease in the adjusted income tax expense is driven by an adjustment that we made related to the ongoing accounting treatment for amortization of intangibles that s very consistent no change with the last couple of times that we ve talked on that as a reminder our income taxes aren t currently payable or paid in australia due to the losses associated with aicf and our contributions to it we reported cash flow from operations for fiscal year 19 of 288 4 million down 2 i d say the decrease in other assets and liabilities and working capital is a normal quarter to quarter variation so nothing of a concern there the net cash outflow due to working capital again was just quarter to quarter variation no real consumption of working capital that we expect to be a feature of the result the higher investing activity was obviously as a result of fermacell and closing that acquisition and funding it in europe on top of the capacity expansion related capex within the year that i will provide more on the next slide we spent a total of 301 1 million on capex last year that was up about 97 million in comparison to a year ago the projects i think most of you are well aware of there are three main projects in north america the tacoma greenfield which we expect to have completed the start up of that in the early part of our fiscal 20 the continued construction of our prattville manufacturing location that we expect to complete and commission in the early part of fiscal 21 so next fiscal year and then the continued expansion of our color plus product line we were opportunistic and bought a piece of land and some buildings in massachusetts during the year and at some point in the future we ll also put some color plus manufacturing capability there so those were the three main projects that drove the spend in north america asia pacific had two main projects we completed the capacity expansion in the philippines and we re in the middle of the carol park brownfield expansion project both of those projects are very much on track within our financial management framework the overall framework hasn t changed we obviously started the framework with wanting to make sure that our business is performing at expectations we re an organic growth company so we re looking to grow topline results above our market index on volume and be modest price takers overall having good margin rates in the business with those in place and we re hard to get the strategy to continue to produce results that are more in line with both our and your expectations our top capital allocation priorities remain the same so no change on that we fund all the organic growth opportunities first those largely come in the form of r d and capacity expansion as well as funding sales and marking opex that remains our number one priority the ordinary dividend remains our number two priority that is very consistent we are committed to the 50 to 70 payout ratio we obviously operate within that ratio based on where we are with the balance sheet we were opportunistic last year and bought a very good business with fermacell that put us about our target debt range of one to two times adjusted ebitda for a period of time that we think at the time was roughly 8 to 10 quarters we re about halfway through that period now we re right on track with our balance sheet and overall capital management so we like where we are we think in about a year year and a half we ll be back under the two times ceiling again and as a result you can expect that we would then start to come up back in the range where over time back to where we were in that range but we re still very much in the range we re committed to that range i d say our balance sheet strategy is very much on track as i mentioned earlier we closed the year with about 79 million in cash 1 3 billion in net debt and about 340 million of available credit facilities in our revolving credit facility no change in the corporate debt structure we reported 2 4 times net debt at the end of the year and that s right where we expected it to be and right on track to get below two in another 4 or 5 quarters as many of you know the fourth quarter result also includes the annual update of the kpmg actuarial study that aicf commissions kpmg to do annually so that was updated as of 31 march and is reflected in our result the undiscounted uninflated estimate decreased to 1 4 billion from 1 443 billion in the prior year that was a combination of the net cash outflows of 142 8 million and a slight increase in the actuarial estimate for the year total contributions in our fiscal 19 result were 138 4 million australian or 103 million in the us since the time that we established the aicf back in 2007 the company has contributed approximately 1 2 billion into the fund and we anticipate that we will make 100 9 million us dollar contribution this july as part of our annual funding commitment that 100 9 million represents 35 of our free cash flows for fiscal year 19 a little bit on the claims for the full year claims received into aicf were 8 below the actuarial estimate they were approximately 1 higher compared to the prior year so overall a good outcome there claims reporting during the full year for mesothelioma were 4 lower than the estimate and 5 lower than the prior corresponding period so also a good data point in claims trend average claim settlements for the year were 24 below the actuarial estimate it was largely attributable to lower average claim settlements for non mesothelioma claims in summary for the financial section a good financial performance given the dynamic environment that we were in on the input cost and inflationary side higher net sells in north america and in asia pacific both of those segments grew the top line market penetration and category share gains and a really good topline outcome and business outcome for the asia pacific segment a really positive first year for jh europe we like where we are a year into that result and we remain committed to our capital allocation priorities and working within our financial management framework with that i ll hand it over to jack who will take everybody through a strategy update dr jack truong chief executive officer thanks matt okay so let s go to the next slide we confirm that our long term value creation for the james hardie group is about in north america 3590 is our north star it s really about driving growth above markets with strong returns 20 to 25 ebit margin and that s our north star europe is really about creating the 1 billion euro business with a good hearty like the return for the long term and for a pac it s really about making a good business continue to be better and that s about delivering growth above markets with strong returns and a 20 to 25 ebit margin with that being the strategy that s really the object so what we really want to talk about now is what is our key strategic priorities as a company globally that we need to focus on to ensure that we fulfill that long term objective so this is a three year strategic priority that we shared with you three months ago i d just like to give you an update on where we are in north america it is all about accelerating exterior growth it s really all about making sure our marketing and sales team drive the penetration of the total exterior solution that james hardie has in the marketplace that is about driving the hardie panels hardie planks hardie trim hardie soffit really provide that total exterior solution that allows the homeowners to have low maintenance and the durable with flexibility in designs i m going to show you a little bit later in how we bring that to life through the win with color program to drive share growth second in north america is really about how do we continue to transform ourselves to deliver a continually lower and lower unit costs and better quality that is about transforming us from being a world best fiber cement produce into a world class manufacturer through lean transformation i ll give you some updates on where we are with that third which is an area that we will begin to have a lot more focus on and that is to make the interior business a growth business again that is going to be a key focus for us going forward for europe it s really about we acquired fermacell was really to give us that strong footprint in europe with strong channel access as well as closer to the markets with the builder specifiers so that we can build a more meaningful and profitable fiber cement business for the long term and we are going to continue to gain traction in our current fiber cement products as well as continue to develop and launch fiber cement products for the european markets on top of that we ve got to continue to drive growth in our base business which is the fiber gypsum business with the james hardie manufacturing know how this is where we would like to apply a lot more of the capability to the european plant fiber gypsum to continue to unlock more capacity and drive more of the unit cost reductions so that we can enhance the ebit margin for our european business as well as provide additional cash to invest in the market development asia pacific is really about continuing to improve on our playbook that s been successful that is about investing at the end users as well through the channel to provide the push pull effect that has been effective for us and takes lean transformation to the next level to continue to learn and share the best practices with what s going on in north america now let s move on to give you an update on lean transformation in north america it is off to a very very strong start we confirm the targets that we have shared with you three months ago and that is to deliver 100 million in cost out savings over a three year period from fiscal year 20 to fiscal year 22 and the implementation of the lean concept is really beginning to take a stronghold across all of our plants across north america our employee engagement is very high particularly in plants where we executed the hardie manufacturing and offering system this is really the way that we run our plants based on leans wherever we roll out to our plants which is in waxahachie in peru and pulaski in the past three months our employee engagement in those plants has been very high the consistency of production has been really good as well as the variability in how we produce our products and throughput has really been reduced significantly through this whole process we have built a central organization of lean manufacturing experts as well as appoint key manufacturing team members within our plants that become lean change agents so through that organizational capability that we begin to drive a lean culture through our network of plants across north america our goal is to have by the end of the fiscal year that all of our manufacturing plant employees in north america are completely trained in lean so that we can begin to drive a lean culture throughout the manufacturing organization i d like to share with you this chart on the bottom right of the page here so this is the actual costs the unit costs per standard feet across the network of plants across north america this is without taking out the depreciation tax and insurance and freight so this is really the manufacturing cost of producing our products if you look at the highest point here that is the unit costs of our products in december of last year that was about the time that we really started the lean journey in north america you can see that since march of last year until december you can see that unit costs have been going up a lot of that is really in the raw material cost increases but also some of the plant performance lack of performance leading up to december our team started to drive and really build the execution of lean manufacturing through our plants you can see that we start to have lower unit costs in a more consistent way during the past four months if you look at our april actual unit cost it s about in the same range as of may of last year so it s really good to see that not only is employee engagement high but also produce the result that we intend to do with lean lean is a continuous process it s a continuous improvement that is a never ending journey it is an area that we know we are making the right decision we are focusing the organization in the right direction and we will continue to drive that improvement across our network of plants now let s move on to north american acceleration of exterior growth so for us to get to 3590 for short mid and long term is all about first we have to convert vinyl homes into fiber cement really to make that happen is about the win with color it is about our ability to deliver fiber cement in many different types of colors that would allow the developers to build homes with different aesthetics and different designs that would differentiate them comparing to other builders and developers at the same time provide low maintenance and durability to the homeowners just to give you a reference here this is the development in nashville tennessee that we were able to convert this development from vinyl into fiber cement you can see here this is about 300 000 to 400 000 per home developments to the left side is what we call the statement color which is really the core groups of colors that we produce every day that the market can buy from us on the right hand side is the part of the more 700 different colors that people can order from us we call that the dream collection you can see that by doing that together with hardie plank hardie panel hardie trim and hardie soffits that we are able to provide that complete exterior look that looks very nice and allows the builder to differentiate their development from others on the bottom right this is a development outside of boston massachusetts and it is roughly a 700 000 to 800 000 home area that we re able to convert from vinyl to our win with color program with our hardie planks hardie trim and hardie panels so this is really about what this is really what we would use to continue to develop our business against vinyl to really drive that category expansion the market expansion and really that s the what and this is the how the how is really about the commercial transformation that we shared with you back in february that is traditionally in north america we have been focusing a lot more on continuing to convert new builders we haven t really put a lot of focus on the channel and how to create more value with the channel while we create demand so that s what we call the push pull effect this is really the transformation of our commercial organization that needs to happen to make sure that we can have a repeatable more sustainable capability to drive growth above the market as we create demand and that need to translate into sales for us through the channel a key part of that is really about for us we ve got to be easier to do business with and it s important for us to set up the organization within the channel that has a capability of really being able to show and demonstrate that our channel really makes more money by selling our products versus others our sales team structure has been in place our key sales leaders have been hired and so the team talent continues to be filled within the organization so the commercial organization is a little bit tougher than the lean transformation because it s not within 100 of our control we have to convince customers as well as we have competition that we have to deal with certainly we are on the right track let s move on to give you an update on our european business going forward one of the key synergies that we saw with the fermacell business is really about fermacell has a fiber gypsum board that is a high performance board for the interior use that is really one board of fiber gypsum can replace two of gypsum board or a board of gypsum and osb because it has multiple properties within one board that is fire resistant water resistant and acoustic reduction so with fiber cement it is about the exterior our team at the former fermacell james hardie in europe really have access to the specifier the architects and designers this is the case where our team was able to already have the penetration and contact with a specifier to build this kindergarten in brittany france which it is in the northwest coast of france which is where the temperature is on the extreme net to the atlantic ocean it is a really good value proposition for our fiber cement you can see that this team was able to build this new kindergarten with the james hardie fiber cement panels and planks and the exterior and then with the fermacell the interior walls for the insides that s a total solution i d also like to share with you the very exciting things about our growth in europe the launch to that 1 billion euro for the long term is really about yes we have to continue to grow fiber gypsum on top of that we have to really build and develop new fiber cement products for the european market this is a really an exciting case because it really leverages on a global capability there is an unmet need in europe about what we call the weather protection system in scandinavian and in the uk by the coast in the construction and new construction or remodeling of homes or commercial buildings there is a need to have a temporary sheath that really attaches to the frame that would allow the workers to continue to work inside and before they need to put the clad in at the later date a lot of time that can be up to 12 months this is a need that really exists as a market opportunity for our teams in scandinavia so they either happen to have a meeting with our team in new zealand and there was a similar type of concept for the product in new zealand and then the team from europe took that product and market tested in europe it showed it was pretty close to what the needs are but they needed to have a few other requirements that we have to modify to meet the european market that is have to have fire resistance and also to survive up to 12 months in the elements and has to be easy to affix to the structure so they can use staples or nails so our teams passed on these product concepts to our r d center in california and then the team worked to develop the formulation tested it and finally it worked with the end users in europe then it was manufactured at our pulaski plant in virginia and finally shipped to europe for sales and will start selling beginning this week so it s really a very good case of how we can leverage our capability at james hardie around the world now that we have market access in europe to be able to grow our business in europe with fiber cement developed for the european markets and fit for use for the european market so this is really some of the key assumptions that we have for our fiscal year 20 and our market outlook for north america we continue to affirm that there can be modest growth in us housing in the fiscal year 2020 the residential housing start our assumption would be between 1 2 million and 1 3 million homes ebit margin was in the top half of 20 to 25 the exterior volume will be at 3 to 5 pdg europe a slight housing growth across our addressable market in western europe we ll be introducing new fiber cement product for europe this year and we expect to see ebit margin accretion for our european business asia pacific the addressable housing market in australia decreases this year in fact it has already happened a pac volume will be 3 to 5 growth over the market and with the continued focus on the lean transformation into a pac we also expect to see that our ebit margin will be in the top half of our stated range of 20 to 25 with that we ll close right here and we ll open up for q a questions and answers peter steyn macquarie analyst thanks jack peter steyn from macquarie just a quick home in on the commercial transformation estimates and particularly your intent to be easier to do business with we ve obviously seen a couple of movements in the channel just more recently but could you give us a sense of how you re going in terms of traction with further important channel partners as well the internal realignment of some of your sales plans and intent and people dr jack truong chief executive officer peter that s a very good question traditionally james hardie in north america we have been focusing so much onto the pulp side with is at the builders and contractors level we haven t really made the strong effort to really engage with our channel partners in terms of how do we make it more easy for them to receive our products to have the right pricing with us and how to be able to navigate within the james hardie company in the way that we ll get the right information to them to run their business with products that are a lot more simple that would center around the supply chain synchronization between us and then our channel partners to be able to deliver our product the markets in the right way so it is an area that is a key foundation of focus for us commercial transformation is really about adding that capability we call it key account management that is not just about the job of the salesperson the salesperson is a quarterback or the coordinator of james hardie to the account to where we would have the mirror image relationship between the top management and the big channel partners with us the same side with myself and then sean gadd and then our new head of sales all the way down and across to different functions from sales market and products and supply chain and finance that is the structure that we re building right now that will allow us to serve our channel partners a lot better and in a more significant way so that allows us to penetrate the markets peter steyn macquarie analyst perhaps just a quick follow up on that does that disruptive aspect of that reorganization has that been worse or better than what you expected dr jack truong chief executive officer i would say that the level of engagements of us with our channel partners in north america has a lot of room to improve i think it s more than i had expected so that s why it is important for us to really put a strong focus on key account management that is a different skill set and it takes a different focus to make sure that we manage that part correctly while we ve got to make sure that we continue to invest and deploy the right skill sets of the market development folks and the business development folks to go and create new demand for fiber cement to the conversion against vinyl and wood and so on so those are the two separate focus but then management has to align the demand and then the channel management together to ensure that we create the sales from the demand that we just created peter steyn macquarie analyst if i may just a quick on lean you ve indicated that you ve had throughput yield investments and that available hours are up yet the cost per square foot is still stable presumably that s largely a consequence of pulp prices i assume but can you give us a bit of a sense of what is happening at waxahachie pulaski and peru in terms of unit costs perhaps at a more granular level have you actually seen a reduction there dr jack truong chief executive officer yes so in the plant particularly in waxahachie and pulaski we actually have really quite a step change in improvement in our unit costs in a very substantial way in peru it s improved but it s not improved at the level compared to the other two plants yet andrew scott morgan stanley managing director it s andrew scott from morgan stanley one for matt but jack happy for you to chime in just your guidance for particularly north america the 20 to 25 range i note that in the comments there one of the assumptions is increasing input costs and input cost inflation as you mentioned freight is coming away it looks like pulp has turned the corner now is that just conservatism at the start of the year or is there something you re seeing that we re not aware of that is going to suggest that we re going to see input cost inflation throughout the year dr jack truong chief executive officer let me go back to one part it s really more about you can see that we launched the win with color program you see that we also launched our commercial transformation which is going to take some of the investment too make sure that we are able to drive traction to recreate the sustainable pdg so that s just why at this point it s a saving that would afford us the capability to drive more sales growth or more pdg growth go ahead matt matthew marsh chief financial officer yeah input costs before i get to your question andrew i think i mistakenly said that pulp was up 12 for the year just as a correction it was up 13 in the quarter for the year the pulp was up closer to 19 for the year sorry about that on your question pulp definitely looks like it s coming up but it s still pretty elevated so on a year on year basis it s still up if you looked at april to april pricing as an example or may year to date pricing as compared to may year to date pricing a year ago it s still up it s off of where it was a year ago oh sorry it s off of where it was last month it s off of where it was at the peak but it s still pretty elevated but pulp is still trading on the index at 1300 which is still very elevated so that result will sort of continue there s an assumption that we will see a trend down in pulp but i think i said that february and i said that november too i think i m fairly cautious on the pulp market s ability to forecast itself we are seeing good trends i d say over the last 6 or 12 weeks but it s still pretty elevated so that comment is much more around does the trend follow or does it stabilize at a really high level and that would obviously have an effect where we would be on the upper end of the range even taking that into account we still feel pretty comfortable saying we ll be in the top half of our range for next year andrew scott morgan stanley managing director thanks matt if i extend that to australia and i assume it s the same assumption where are we going to get the helping margin there where we re coming from in this quarter at least bang on the bottom end of the range to the top half of the range there because that is a meaningful step up matthew marsh chief financial officer yeah on a year on year basis new zealand manufacturing will no doubt go from being a headwind in the result to a contributor to the result that will be significant keep in mind we did have in the second quarter of our fiscal 19 that one off item in the philippines you take those two items and that has a pretty significant impact just with those two items and then we re not forecasting anything on foreign currency obviously and we ve got the same assumption for pulp that we have in north america andrew scott morgan stanley managing director as we see here today obviously we ve had fermacell integration roll through we ve had the business closures as we look into 20 are there any items you expect to take effectively below the line and in particular i assume you ll expand the strategic costs of living with strategic initiatives is there anything that we need to think about going forward matthew marsh chief financial officer nothing really below the line we ve got some additional fermacell integration costs to go i think those will be in the 5 million to 7 million range for this year it s primarily associated with completing the standup of the back office as you remember fermacell was owned by a private equity company and we ve had to completely stand up both the personnel and the it infrastructure associated with the back office functions so we re probably about two thirds of the way done with that and there are some additional costs in fiscal 20 associated with that but nothing ultimately we think we re through the product line review and portfolio review so we re not expecting additional product line discontinuation costs i m not expecting other items below the line in fiscal 20 simon thackray csla analyst simon thackray from csla jack can we just start with the interiors market down 10 in the quarter that looks like it s still moving away from you can we talk about the drivers of that i mean we ve probably all gone through and see the leisurely vinyl tile taking some share etcetera how much of this problem is a hardie problem versus a market problem dr jack truong chief executive officer good question simon in our interior business i would say 80 of our market access is through the retail channel and really the fundamental in retail is really about position placement pricing and promotion and products so essentially let s talk about the product we have essentially two skews in the channel for a long time for us to grow in this category we have got to have critical mass so it s important for us to really come out with new products and then continue to refresh our category to make us a destination within the retail channel for the contractors so that s the first thing that s one area of the innovation that we re going to focus on second is that more of the short term and that is about placement our product today with the two skews that we have we re not in full in the building material section of those two key retailers we are in primarily in the tile section where we have less traffic we don t have the traffic or the heavy user contract walks through there so we have to fix that placement and then third is really about the position it s about making sure that our products are well positioned in the store so that the contractors we can attract new contractors and be able to use our product in different applications so in some ways it s really about i would say about 75 of that is really within us within our control and then 25 is really about the markets of course when you have a new product or new category like lvt come in it s really incumbent for a manufacturer to say okay if that s the case what are we going to do differently to make sure we can continue to grow so those are the three key strategic actions that our teams are working on right now so that we can fundamentally improve the position for the interior business simon thackray csla analyst and you ve launched a new product at least at the trade level the aqua or hydra whatever it is i can t remember dr jack truong chief executive officer yes hydra defense simon thackray csla analyst so is that now being rolled out dr jack truong chief executive officer so it is a product that we just rolled out to the pro channel as you know the retail channel is the cut through the planner do that once a year so we have to wait until the time when they change the planner gram within retail to be able to launch that into retail that s just the first step the other step is really about to let me show you that we can come out with the new interior products that would resonate well with those unmet needs in the market here i think i mentioned at the last earnings call is that our business 85 or our business in europe is through the interior business today and 35 of our business in a pac is an interior business so there s a lot of know how a lot of the new product concept and opportunity that we can really now bring together as a global team to come up with those new products so i m optimistic about that capability simon thackray csla analyst great that s really helpful thanks jack just a quick one on the asbestos just a refresher it s been a while you re paying at 35 or operating cash flow there was always an opportunity within the agreement for there to be step downs to 30 to 25 over time what are the requirements to get to that is that feasible to get a step down in the payment you ve forked out 1 2 billion now you ve made an acquisition so the ebitda has presumably gone up and the free cash flow presumably goes up matthew marsh chief financial officer yeah over time at some point there will probably be an opportunity for that to step down the requirement in the afa is that when the cash outflow from the fund is less than the annual contribution and cash inflow to the fund when that occurs over a period of time then we can start to take a step down in the contribution rate so it s a formulaic approach i think it will be some time still before that occurs certainly the last couple of years are more positive trends i d say with respect to cash flow and last year was certainly a very good trend but i think we re still a bit away before we see that brooke campbell crawford jp morgan analyst thanks brooke campbell crawford from jp morgan just on the 3 volume growth in the fourth quarter can you talk about how that progressed through the quarter and if it continued into april also how are the order files looking thanks dr jack truong chief executive officer order file the famous order files as you know as we discussed last quarter we look at our commercial transformation is going to take some time we said back then it would take us about 6 or 7 months into the new fiscal year to gain traction so at this point i wouldn t expect our ancillary growth to be materially different from what you see in the fourth quarter until around 6 months from now lee powell deutsche bank analyst lee powell with deutsche bank jack can you just talk a little bit about pricing in fy20 i know there was a comment you said in the presentation about price positioning what pricing increases if any have you got coming through dr jack truong chief executive officer want to take that matt matthew marsh chief financial officer we think the price in fiscal 20 will be around 2 so pretty similar to fiscal 19 i think it was about 3 we haven t changed our approach in the way that we do strategic pricing it s the same process we are still value price that 2 nationally we go through a series of product and region reviews where we are evaluating our price position versus our commercial objectives so there is a range if you look at our product portfolio and our region portfolio you d see a range around that 2 last year that weighted average ended up being closer to 3 this year the weighted average of fiscal 20 will be closer to 2 so we re still pretty satisfied overall with where we are on strategic pricing no real change on the tactical side that 2 obviously includes a combination of that strategic pricing plus what we think we re going to do in tactical this year we re obviously trying to align both the strategic and tactical pricing to the commercial transformation that we re doing we re pretty happy overall with where the price is and we think it will be around 2 for fiscal 20 for north america lee powell deutsche bank analyst thanks following off of peter s question on this changing approach to pdg in north america can you give an idea of like salesforce turnover if anything and how that s been against your expectations as you ve pushed this new approach into your salesforce dr jack truong chief executive officer probably the biggest part of the transformation we had was in the interior business we usually have roughly 80 sales professional who supports the interior business the majority of our team is actually caught on to the stores across the country the business model has really changed with the big boxes really those decisions to promote and place products within them as already done in atlanta or at charlotte so what did there is that we have to have a turnover of over half of those folks so that we can reposition the business at the headquarters to really drive the account management then with the headcounts that we have we use that to hire more of the market development and business development professionals who really go in to convert new business from vinyl into fiber cement so that is the shift that we did to make sure that we can drive the demand and then be able to drive the channel growth at the right points lee powell deutsche bank analyst okay thank you sophie spartellus bank of america merrill lynch analyst sophie spartellus from bank of america merrill lynch just following on from both of the questions on the salesforce you talked about the key roles being filled last quarter we heard about these hunters and gathers that evolved placement of people in different towns and it was quite a cultural shift can you just talk through how that is going and how much of that process is complete dr jack truong chief executive officer so just to be clear the pulp side which is really the market demand which hardie has always been really strong with about creating the demand for fiber cement over vinyl that is an area we actually reinforce with more capability and more resources so that we can drive that demand that doesn t change not only doesn t change but we just add more resources to it we also add more resources to the r r that is an area that is also a growth opportunity for us from the demand generations perspective where we enhance the capability of the sales team is where we create a focus on key account management that is where we need the sales professionals who really understand how to manage our customers in terms of how to provide the services and capability of james hardie to our channel partners so that they can make more money selling our products that is a skill set that we continue to add to the company i think i mentioned at the last earnings call that we just hired a new head of sales for north america and he is reporting to sean gadd who is the chief commercial officer and he johnny cope is his name he is the one that now runs the total sales organization in north america with a strong focus on account management as well as in the market development within this organization we built a new organization called sales operations this is really about the analytics this is really about the sales trends and the mixture and that we have the right training across this is about the customer s inside sales price management and so on and so forth that is the new capability that we also build within the sales organization sophie spartellus bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay so just in terms of that process it seems to be still ongoing can you give you use a timeframe as to when all that will be bedded down and your sales function will be complete to the market dr jack truong chief executive officer we anticipate between 3 to 6 months sophie spartellus bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay and just a quick follow up question in regard to asia pac you mentioned in your commentary that the market has peaked you ve got your guidance there decreasing in fy20 can you maybe just talk to through how much clarity you ve got in terms of your order book here in australia and the philippines given they are your key markets dr jack truong chief executive officer we don t have the big visibility out into the order book as we would like but in terms of how our teams are we have a team that is very focused on the primary demand in the marketplace they really know what the demand is we have a very strong team that manages work with our channel which is quite concentrated in australia quite well so they do have a good sense of how the market is moving and more about how we continue to create more demand for our product through the channel and also through the builders and contractors it s not a science yet but certainly there is a good feel for how we are performing against the markets as you can see in the fourth quarter our business in asia pacific continued to perform well at 7 growth and volume they couldn t get there without the growth in australia james branch ubs analyst james branch i m from ubs three months ago when we sat here last we talked about customer perception issues and customer retention problems that you were having at the time you talked about that was costing about 3 percentage points of pdg three months on i m just interested to know how customer perception has changed and where you are tracking against that against your expectations dr jack truong chief executive officer right back then i said we probably have about 25 to 3 erosion of our sales because we re not really managing our current customers i think during the past few months our teams from the top of the company all the way down that we have reached out to our customers form the ceo level down and met with them i think to be able to meet as top to top and mirror image as a team together that really helped to reinforce to our customers that we at james hardie like to engage in a different than we had in the past and that helped but of course just with any customer relationship and management we have to demonstrate that every day demonstrate with actions every day until our customers really believe that we have made a change to be a lot more customer focused now it is a journey it s not something that you change people s mind overnight it is an area as a company that we have to change to be able to get there james branch ubs analyst right so i guess the target for 3 to 5 points of pdg sorry the target this year for 3 to 5 of pdg doesn t really assume that you get any more traction in terms of retaining those lost customers there s no improvement that s upside is it or is there actually some improvement dr jack truong chief executive officer i think first and foremost that at least to start that would help minimize some of the erosion the next step is really about growing beyond that that s a two step process matthew marsh chief financial officer anyone on the phone operator we have a question from peter wilson with credit suisse please ask peter wilson credit suisse analyst thank you good morning jack in north america if i could just clarify one of your answers to your questions earlier you said it will take 6 to 7 months for some of this year s initiatives to gain traction and hence you wouldn t expect growth to be above the fourth quarter that would seem to imply that in order to achieve your 3 to 5 pdg target that you re going to have to be right on the top end of that range for the second half right dr jack truong chief executive officer we would anticipate that once we get our commercial transformation set to run that we would see stronger traction yes peter wilson credit suisse analyst and that would be the upper range right the top end of that range dr jack truong chief executive officer in the second half peter wilson credit suisse analyst okay the last you reported you illustrated a 10 year plan and i think part of that could be really used in the wood the numbers that you are reporting don t really seem to illustrate that i was just wondering how confident you are on that and if there is any tangible progress you can point to there matthew marsh chief financial officer can you repeat that to just make sure i ve got your question right you re asking if the commercial transformation that we talked about in february which showed a gain over the next ten years along our 3590 strategies against both vinyl and wood look alternatives required kind of early gains by substituting lp and your question is the reported result for lp looks pretty similar to our reported result so how that statement compares to the most recent results that s the essence of your question peter wilson credit suisse analyst apologies i think the first part got cut off there i guess my question is lps reported a high percent volume growth in the third quarter sorry in the march quarter and on the 12 month basis was well ahead of the numbers you printed as well it just doesn t suggest that there s any progress of taking share off of engineered wood dr jack truong chief executive officer i think if you look at the last 12 months our growth rate between us and lp is about the same i think about 5 so having said that for us to continue to march toward our 3590 it is important for us to be able to take more share for lp lp is a good competitor so it is going to be about execution and about plans and continue to adjust as necessary to make sure that we achieve our long term objectives peter wilson credit suisse analyst okay at what point would you start to become worried if those relative numbers don t start improving in your direction dr jack truong chief executive officer peter i think it s just too early to tell yeah peter wilson credit suisse analyst one last one the win with color is a big part of achieving that you have said you have an expanded range of colors am i wrong in saying that at the us investor day last year you outlined a plan to rationalize the number of colors that you were doing in order to improve your selection efficiencies dr jack truong chief executive officer that is correct we did rationalize quite a bit and then what we offer what we call the statement line is about the core products that our customer can order made to stock that s roughly about 15 skus and then the other is about over 700 different colors that our customer can order with us that s really about the made to order and so that kind of gives our customers the capability and the ability to design any type of development that they would like but it s really about uses focused primarily on the 15 skus that we sale day in and day out to the market and that is where the rationalization and standardization that would improve our manufacturing efficiency and translate to cost reduction peter wilson credit suisse analyst awesome that s perfect thank you operator we have another question from daniel kang from citigroup please ask your question daniel kang citigroup analyst good morning everyone just a quick one in terms of the pdg growth rate you mentioned that 1 off the full year are you able to estimate the exit rate for the fourth quarter and while we re talking about the competitive landscape who knows that the import level is quite strong into the march quarter are you seeing much impact from the increased import level dr jack truong chief executive officer i think our fourth quarter exterior volume growth is about 3 5 comparing to the third quarter of 1 we don t want to look at pdg really on a quarterly basis because it s not really an exact science so we kind of look at it from the rolling 12 months if you look at the rolling 12 months for fiscal year 19 it s more than 1 versus minus 2 5 a year ago there s that momentum a little bit coming out of the fourth quarter so in terms of an appreciable step change it s not going to be materialized until we execute our commercial transformation to the fullest and then relative to your question on the fiber cement go ahead daniel matthew marsh chief financial officer sorry no one is speaking jack had asked if you had a follow up question daniel kang citigroup analyst yeah the follow up question was just in terms of the increased import in the march quarter are you seeing any impact there matthew marsh chief financial officer on input costs dr jack truong chief executive officer yeah matthew marsh chief financial officer imports of fc yeah we noted the same no we re not seeing any sort of the significant change in the marketplace i think the headline number on the percent growth is a big number i think it was almost 30 something percent but keep in mind that i d say that what they re comping that off of is actually quite low from a year ago so if you look at the import volume over a longer period of time if you look at where it s been on a quarterly basis over the last three years it s still at a relatively low volume on a volume basis it s at a low point in comparison where some of the other quarters have gotten reported so no we re not seeing anything sort of unusual in the marketplace or anything that is concerning us or anything that s got us off strategy or off target daniel kang citigroup analyst very good also in terms of expectations for expected tax rate matthew marsh chief financial officer you can in august yeah i mean i m not going to guide on etr for fiscal 20 once we get a good sense of how the year is going to play out we ll talk about that in august i m not expecting material change okay so it s not like the 14 9 number we reported this quarter is going to change materially it will move up and down based on earnings and where those earnings occur but that s not an artificially high or low number we think that s a feature of the result going forward and i d say similarly on guidance for fiscal 20 we ll talk about that as we normally do as part of the august result daniel kang citigroup analyst got it thanks man matthew marsh chief financial officer for capex there s no change on prior guidance for fiscal 20 we expect that we ll spend somewhere around 200 million for fiscal 20 and we think the next two years after that fiscal 21 and 22 will be a step down from that probably closer to 150 million we ve largely gotten through our greenfield and brownfield capacity projects we think across the globe obviously there are other opportunities that we ll explore particularly in europe at some point we ll add capacity both for fiber gypsum and as the fiber cement business grows none of those are sort of included in that medium term outlook because we don t expect them to occur in that medium term outlook so 200 million in capex in fiscal 20 and then 21 and 22 is a step down from that probably around 150 million per year for each of those two years daniel kang citigroup analyst thank you operator there re no further questions at this time i d like to hand the call back to the speakers for any closing remarks please continue dr jack truong chief executive officer i think we both thank you all for coming i think our fiscal year 19 was a solid result from a global business we are going through a transformation in north america commercial and our lean manufacturing which we should expect to see the results throughout the year in fiscal year 20 thank you duration

this article is more than 4 years old in an earlier post i gave you a sneak preview of my interview with chris powell secretary treasurer at gold anti trust action committee gata for 20 years now chris and others at gata have made it their mission to expose collusion by international financial institutions to control the price and supply of gold below are highlights from my interview with chris i have to say that during much of our conversation my jaw was on the floor i don t want to say much more than that read on and remember to share widely tell us about gata s background and what it does gata was founded in 1999 to expose and litigate against the longstanding western central bank policy of suppressing the price of gold at first we weren t even sure if it was western banks that were doing it but after a year or so of research and investigation we concluded that the bullion banks were operating surreptitiously as brokers for governments giving cover to their intervention in the gold market at the time we had a law firm advise us that this rigging was very likely authorized by the gold reserve act of 1934 as amended since then and as such there may not be grounds to sue the government directly over gold price manipulation we went ahead and filed suit in 2001 anyway in the u s district court in boston we had a consultant a harvard trained lawyer and gold investor who brought a case against the bank of international settlements bis the u s treasury and various bullion banks one particular hearing i attended that year produced a remarkable admission from an assistant u s attorney in short he said that while the government was not admitting to the complaint it nevertheless had the power and authority to do all the things the suit complained of manipulating the price of gold in other words i made a record of this admission and put out a press release the lawsuit was ultimately dismissed by the judge on technical jurisdictional grounds having lost a little hope of suing the government directly we determined that the best course of action going forward was to try to publicize our findings we re convinced that the gold reserve act gives the u s government particularly the treasury department and the exchange stabilization fund esf the unrestricted authority to intervene in and secretly rig any market in the world our work now is simply to expose this policy to as large an audience as possible on a practical level how does manipulation like this occur on such a global scale it s done largely in the futures markets it s also done in the london over the counter otc market the mechanisms are gold swaps and leases between central banks and bullion banks and through the sale of futures contracts we ve seen a number of flash crashes in the price of gold but lately they ve been happening every few weeks somebody will dump a billion dollars or more of gold futures contracts in new york that can be achieved only by someone with infinite resources and money who also has a powerful interest in suppressing the price of gold nobody interested in making good money would dump that much gold all at once he would sell it gradually over a period of time i think these flash crashes are irrefutable evidence of price suppression u s global investors are there any public records that point to all of this yes there s all sorts of material in the treasury department and federal reserve archives about gold price suppression being u s policy jelle zijlstra the former president of the netherlands central bank who simultaneously served as president of the bis wrote in his memoirs that the gold price has always been suppressed at the behest of the united states through international action you can go back to the years of the london gold pool in the 1960s where the control of the gold price through international action was a matter of public record operating through the bank of england boe a very remarkable transcript exists of a meeting in april 1974 between secretary of state henry kissinger and thomas enders the assistant under secretary of state for economic and business affairs enders explains to kissinger that u s government policy is to drive gold out of the world s financial system and prevent european governments from remonetizing the metal in any way the purpose of this policy is to support the u s dollar as the world reserve currency and if not the dollar then the international monetary fund s imf special drawing rights sdr the most compelling evidence i believe are letters sent by representative alex mooney of west virginia to the federal reserve treasury department and u s commodity futures trading commission cftc mooney asked the fed and treasury to identify which markets they re secretly trading in and to explain the purposes of this trading fed chair jerome powell essentially refused to answer the question as did the treasury mooney asked the cftc to state whether manipulation trading in the futures markets undertaken by the u s government or its agents or brokers is subject to the cftc s jurisdiction or whether such manipulation is actually legal or exempt from ordinary commodities law the cftc refused to answer the question i think these agencies refusal to answer mooney s questions is quite revealing and notably mainstream financial journalists don t find any of this curious they have a rule never to put a critical question to any central bank about anything theoretically somebody could do it it s being attempted by alternate news agencies and research organizations but you can t get an answer that s a good indication i believe that central banks are doing things they don t want the markets to know about my next question has to do with central banks and their consumption of gold they ve been net buyers since 2010 the united states continues to be the single largest holder of gold of any institution on the planet how do we reconcile that if they own all this gold wouldn t it go against their self interest to suppress its price u s global investors that seemed to be a paradox to gata some years ago but we don t believe it is any longer to suppress the price of gold you need a certain amount of inventory to knock the market down you can t do it entirely through the naked shorting that they do in the futures market you always need to be bleeding a certain amount of the metal into the market to maintain the appearance of a gold market you can t just be trading paper all the time it s not enough the u s economists paul brodsky and lee quaintance wrote a paper a few years ago that floats a plausible hypothesis of what s going on the two hypothesized that the policy in recent years has been to redistribute world gold reserves among central banks so that those banks that have been overweight in u s dollars and treasuries could hedge themselves in anticipation of an inevitable devaluation of the dollar and revaluation of gold central banks the two allege intervene together in the futures market to drive the nominal price down to facilitate easy acquisition of gold they would prefer to keep the public out of acquiring the metal full disclosure i don t have any particular evidence from government sources that confirms brodsky and quaintance s hypothesis but it certainly fits the facts as we understand them as you likely know a jpmorgan trader is awaiting sentencing right now for his participation in gold price rigging what s your reaction to this his sentencing has been delayed twice now it was delayed again the other day for another six months i m not sure what to make of it to be honest there s some confusion here because a few years ago the chief executive of jpmorgan jamie dimon and the woman who was running its commodities desk at the time blythe masters both gave interviews saying that jpmorgan has no position of its own in the monetary metals markets they were trading them only for clients of course nobody in journalism followed up by asking dimon or masters who the clients were i would have wondered if the bank was acting as the broker for the u s or chinese government that was certainly implied from the answers they gave now this trader john edmonds apparently had to admit that he was rigging the gold and silver markets while trading at jpmorgan he was allegedly doing it with the knowledge and counsel of his superiors and if it were done on behalf of the government presumably it s legal under the gold reserve act but as charles peters former editor of the washington monthly used to say the scandal is never what s illegal the scandal is what s perfectly legal so why is edmonds being prosecuted because he was front running government trades was he doing it just for himself i can t imagine the justice department would be prosecuting him if his trading was being conducted on behalf of the u s government where do you think gold prices would be right now if not for this manipulation what s the true value of gold the true value of gold is whatever our free market wants it to be our attitude toward money is very libertarian let there be free markets and currencies and if governments are intervening they should be transparent about what they re doing having said that the disparagement of gold for years is that its price has not kept up with inflation everything keeps up with inflation that in itself is pretty powerful evidence of government intervention it s not keeping health insurance costs and medical care prices down it s not keeping college tuition down it s not keeping grocery prices down how come gold is the only thing that doesn t keep up with inflation silver too all of the traditional ratios of monetary metals values compared to stock market levels and other prices have been thrown off in recent years because of government intervention u s global investors so what would those prices be if the traditional ratios were enforced again i can t say for sure but obviously they would be far far higher than they are today and the government knows this if the government ever got out of the futures market and abandoned its manipulation scheme metal prices would remonetize in as little as a week i ll add that if you want the gold or silver price to go up you ve got to buy real physical metal take it out of the banking system and weaken the futures market which is where the manipulation takes place if readers are interested in learning more where should they go they can go to our site gata org in the upper right hand side visitors can subscribe to our daily newsletter the gata dispatch that s absolutely free on the left in the articles section you ll find a link to the basics and documentation all of the documentation of gold price suppression and secret intervention in gold markets by governments is contained there and if they re searching for anything in particular i d be happy to help them or refer

rates boston fed president eric rosengren said in a speech that today the two elements of the fed s mandate are sending opposing signals for monetary policy that is low unemployment suggests a bit tighter policy while low inflation the opposite but there is no clarion call to alter current policy in near term he viewed current policy as slightly accommodative consistent with lifting inflation back to target over time he added the fed can afford to wait to see if that forecast does indeed materialize on the economy rosengren is relatively optimistic and he expects unemployment rate to fall further he noted that the significant decline in equity markets in q4 has largely recovered worries over brexit and china slowdown appear to have subsided since the beginning of the year also q1 growth in us was stronger than many forecasters expected on trade he said i am optimistically assuming that both sides in the trade negotiations will work to reach an agreement and i am also assuming that while the uncertainty is not helpful it will be transitory and thus have only a modest effect on the forecast for the u s economy overall may s new brexit plan received terrible responses sterling was lifted briefly by uk prime minister theresa may s new brexit plan but recovery in pound quickly faded as the plan was terribly received by mps across the house in short under the new 10 point plan the most important part is guaranteeing a vote on whether to call a second referendum on the brexit deal however the pre condition for the vote on referendum is the passage of the brexit deal itself in the commons labour leader jeremy corbyn was quick to reject the proposal as largely a rehash and pledged we won t back a repackaged version of the same old deal former foreign minister boris johnson and ex brexit minister dominic raab said they d oppose the deal pro brexit cabinet ministers including michael gove andrea leadsom and chris grayling opposed the idea of a free vote northern ireland s democratic unionist party was concerned that fatal flaws of the original brexit deal remained which could split northern ireland with the rest of uk despite the desperate final gamble there is still practically no chance for may to get her brexit deal through commons in the june a fourth humiliating defeat is more likely than not boj harada if weak economy deteriorates should strengthen easing without delay boj dove yutaka harada said today that the economy has been weak recently and the same can be said about prices also there s a risk the current sluggishness observed in prices will spill over to inflation expectations further delaying a pick up in inflation in addition the impact of the consumption tax hike scheduled for october this year also is a concern harada warned if the economy deteriorates to the extent that achieving our price target in the long term becomes difficult it s necessary to strengthen monetary easing without delay he also dismiss claims that the ultra loose monetary policy hurts banks profits he said the deterioration of banks profitability is actually caused by a structural problem which is that they are accumulating

with brent d griffiths the ticker president barack obama s financial regulatory czar is ringing the alarm over his successors push to roll back post crisis restrictions on big banks moves he says could exacerbate the next major meltdown daniel tarullo the federal reserve governor who spent eight years following the 2008 2009 crisis rewriting the wall street rule book in a monday speech denounced what he called the trump era s low intensity deregulation of the financial industry he defined the phenomenon as a pileup of small tweaks to the existing regime all ignored by the public that taken together will undermine a system intended to prevent another devastating recession after the current regulators have moved on he said somewhere down the line someone else will suffer that damage in all likelihood it will once again be the most vulnerable of households and businesses advertisement the speech delivered at americans for financial reform in washington amounted to a rare rebuke of tarullo s successors from the man the wall street journal once called the most powerful man in banking and wall streeters themselves nicknamed the wizard of oz for his quiet power over their industry read the speech here and it comes a week after two former fed chairs and two former treasury secretaries sounded a warning about how trump s wall street watchdogs are minding their beat in a letter last monday the former fed chairs ben bernanke and janet yellen and the former treasury chiefs tim geithner and jack lew criticized the decision by the financial stability oversight council fsoc to stop subjecting to extra oversight non banks including major insurers and asset managers though framed as procedural changes these amendments amount to a substantial weakening of the post crisis reforms they wrote what s most notable here is just that all of these regulators collectively think that now is the time to speak out says jeremy kress an assistant professor of business law at the university of michigan and a crisis era attorney at the fed between what s going on at the fed and fsoc all the crisis era regulators have had enough and while they ve generally maintained a low profile since leaving office they ve decided to put their personas behind substantive and serious critiques of these deregulatory proposals tarullo focused in particular on stress testing the exercise designed to determine whether banks have enough reserve capital to survive an economic collapse he said the tests offer too many advance clues to banks a change made in the name of transparency that will in fact allow banks to find clever ways to reshape their assets so they can maintain lower levels of capital without actually trimming risk tarullo also said a fed proposal to create a new stress capital buffer to prevent banks from depleting their capital cushion with dividend payments could allow them to take on more risk since it would exclude one of two standards used to calculate a bank s exposure advertisement kevin fromer president of the financial services forum which represents ceos of eight of the largest banks suggested tarullo s concerns are unfounded because the biggest firms have more than an adequate capital cushion i don t think there s any question the overall level of capital in these institutions is obviously higher and the stress tests have demonstrated repeatedly that these institutions are extremely well capitalized and capable of lending in an extreme economic downturn he said but marcus stanley policy director of americans for financial reform which advocates tougher regulation of the industry said tarullo s critique highlighted how changes to the stress tests raise doubts about their reliability to ensure banks remain sound for someone who is the architect of this system to come out publicly and say this isn t fine tuning and it s undermining the system is quite significant he said ian katz an analyst at capital alpha partners says the former regulators worked long and hard on the post crisis rules so it s understandable they now want to be on record opposing efforts to dial them back plus katz notes the industry appears to be gaining some traction on capitol hill in the house 26 republicans recently wrote financial regulators pushing for more deregulation advertisement yet he said his conversations with investors in the industry indicate they are more concerned with those firms outside the scope of strict federal oversight i ve had discussions with people who believe that the regulators particularly the fed are still paying close attention to things like leveraged lending but in the markets to the extent people are concerned they re more concerned about whats going on outside the regulated banking sector market

interviewed by white house officials for a nomination to the fed s board of governors and served as an informal adviser to 2016 campaign she wrote critically in the weeks before that election about

a new united nations report concludes that high trade tensions and policy uncertainty are damaging global economic growth prospects a further escalation of the trade dispute between the u s and china threatens both short and medium term global growth prospects according to the united nations world economic situation and prospects wesp mid 2019 report released tuesday at un headquarters in new york the report said that global merchandise trade volume growth has slowed more sharply than expected particularly in late 2018 and early 2019 data from the u s census bureau showed that bilateral merchandise trade between the two countries has declined by more than 15 percent since september 2018 when the second round of tariffs went into effect this has also impacted global value chains in east asia and other trading partners the report said we ve seen the trade tariffs that have been introduced on both sides have already been damaging trade said dawn holland chief of the global economic monitoring branch in the un department of economic and social affairs holland said the adverse effects of trade tensions on economic growth in china has been partly offset by some stimulus measures according to the report growth in china is projected to moderate gradually from 6 6 percent in 2018 to 6 3 percent in 2019 and 6 2 percent in 2020 recent monetary and fiscal stimulus measures are expected to bolster domestic demand partially offsetting the adverse impact of trade tariffs on overall growth the report said the u s recently signaled its intention to impose additional tariffs on the european union primarily targeted at the aircraft and food industries it is in addition to the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs that are already in place amid unresolved trade disputes and higher tariffs the projected growth of world trade has been revised downwards to 2 7 percent in 2019 slowing markedly from 3 4 percent in 2018 the report warns that the impact of a spiral of additional tariffs and retaliations would not only dampen growth of these large economies but also have severe spillover effects on the developing economies particularly those with high export exposure to the impacted economies a more protracted period of weak international trade activity could also harm investment prospects and adversely affect productivity growth in the medium term the report indicated that the entire global economy is experiencing a broad based growth slowdown amid unresolved trade tensions high international policy uncertainty and softening business confidence the forecast for weaker global growth casts a shadow over efforts to implement the un s 2030 agenda for sustainable development which has set universal goals for eliminating poverty promoting prosperity and social well being while protecting the environment weaker economic growth puts at risk essential investments in areas such as education health climate change adaptation and sustainable infrastructure the growth outlook in all major developed economies and most developing regions has weakened due to a confluence of both domestic and external factors the report said following an expansion of 3 percent in 2018 world gross product growth is now projected to moderate to 2 7 percent in 2019 and 2 9 percent in 2020 reflecting a downward revision from the forecasts released in january the report identifies several downside risks that could trigger a sharper or more prolonged growth slowdown potentially inflicting significant damage on development progress those risks include a further escalation in trade tensions a sudden deterioration in financial conditions and the accelerating effects of climate change more comprehensive and well targeted policy responses are needed to tackle the current growth slowdown elliot harris un chief economist and assistant secretary general for economic development said tuesday at a news conference it is increasingly clear that policies to promote sustainable development will need to look beyond gdp growth and identify new and more robust measures of economic performance that appropriately reflect the costs of inequality insecurity and climate change in response to slowing growth and subdued inflation major central banks have eased their monetary policy stances the recent monetary policy shifts have helped to stabilize global financial markets and capital flows to emerging economies however the report cautions that a more protracted period of monetary accommodation could exacerbate financial imbalances including further fueling debt accumulation and raising medium term risks to financial stability faced with deep rooted structural weakness several large developing countries are struggling to recover from recessions or remain trapped on a low growth path the report highlights that per capita income growth in several parts of africa western asia latin america and the caribbean is expected to remain very weak in the outlook period that poses additional challenges for the sustainable development goals including the goal to universally eradicate poverty by 2030 the report further notes that while poverty remains predominantly rural further progress on poverty reduction also hinges on the effective management of ongoing urbanization that is particularly relevant for africa and south asia the two regions with the highest number of people in poverty which are expected to experience the most rapid pace of urbanization in the next two decades

entire global economy is experiencing a broad based growth slowdown amid unresolved trade tensions high international policy uncertainty and softening business confidence the forecast for weaker global growth casts a shadow over efforts to implement the un s 2030 agenda for sustainable development which has set universal goals for eliminating poverty promoting prosperity and social well being while protecting the environment weaker economic growth puts at risk essential investments in areas such as education health climate change adaptation and sustainable infrastructure the growth outlook in all major developed economies and most developing regions has weakened due to a confluence of both domestic and external factors the report said following an expansion of 3 percent in 2018 world gross product growth is now projected to moderate to 2 7 percent in 2019 and 2 9 percent in 2020 reflecting a downward revision from the forecasts released in january the report identifies several downside risks that could trigger a sharper or more prolonged growth slowdown potentially inflicting significant damage on development progress those risks include a further escalation in trade tensions a sudden deterioration in financial conditions and the accelerating effects of climate change more comprehensive and well targeted policy responses are needed to tackle the current growth slowdown elliot harris un chief economist and assistant secretary general for economic development said tuesday at a news conference it is increasingly clear that policies to promote sustainable development will need to look beyond gdp growth and identify new and more robust measures of economic performance that appropriately reflect the costs of inequality insecurity and climate change in response to slowing growth and subdued inflation major central banks have eased their monetary policy stances the recent monetary policy shifts have helped to stabilize global financial markets and capital flows to emerging economies however the report cautions that a more protracted period of monetary accommodation could exacerbate financial imbalances including further fueling debt accumulation and raising medium term risks to financial stability faced with deep rooted structural weakness several large developing countries are struggling to recover from recessions or remain trapped on a low growth path the report highlights that per capita income growth in several parts of africa western asia latin america and the caribbean is expected to remain very weak in the outlook period that poses additional challenges for the sustainable development goals including the goal to universally eradicate poverty by 2030 the report further notes that while poverty remains predominantly rural further progress on poverty reduction also hinges on the effective management of ongoing urbanization that is particularly relevant for africa and south asia the two regions with the highest number of people in poverty which are expected to experience the most rapid pace of urbanization in the next two decades

andrew scheer the leader of canada s official opposition conservative party has used two recent policy speeches to big business audiences to outline the right wing agenda of militarism and austerity a tory government would pursue should it come to power following this fall s federal election amid a sharp shift to the right within the canadian bourgeoisie including increasingly shrill attacks from big business on the trudeau government for not fully matching trump s tax cuts scheer s pledges to step up military cooperation with the us intensify canada s aggressive stance against china and russia and gut social spending at home have received a warm reception from the corporate media in his foreign policy speech delivered in montreal on may 7 scheer vowed to open negotiations with the trump administration on canada s participation in the us led ballistic missile defence shield which is aimed at enabling us imperialism to wage a winnable nuclear war he then proceeded to denounce russian president vladimir putin s aggression accusing him of turning the clock back to the cold war however the largest portion of scheer s remarks were directed at fulminating against china which he together with a substantial faction of the ruling elite feels the liberals have failed to confront forcefully enough scheer argued for canada s withdrawal from the china led asian infrastructure investment bank pledged to launch a complaint against beijing at the world trade organization over unfair trading practices vowed to bar the chinese tech giant huawei from canada s 5g network and said a conservative government would deny chinese state owned companies unrestricted access to the canadian market canada china relations declared scheer require a total reset underscoring that scheer following trump s lead wants to put canada on a war footing with beijing he designated china as one of the three main threats to canada s security and prosperity in the 21st century the other two threats he named were russia and state sponsors of terrorism of which he claimed iran was the prime example the fact that even as the tory leader spoke trump was deploying a us aircraft carrier to the persian gulf and vowing to wage war on tehran should it attack us interests or those of its allies would not have been lost on scheer s listeners scheer s demand for an even more aggressive stance towards china enjoys the backing of important sections of the ruling class including canada s two most influential newspapers the globe and mail and national post this faction is pushing for an escalation of the highly provocative line taken by the trudeau government which following on from the previous harper conservative government has integrated canada into the us military build up in the asia pacific and last year agreed to revamp the north american free trade agreement nafta to make it a more explicitly us dominated protectionist trade bloc with china as its foremost target then in december 2018 the trudeau government served as washington s appendage in a dramatic enflaming of tensions with china by arresting meng wangzhou huawei s chief financial officer while she changed planes in vancouver canadian authorities are in the process of extraditing meng to the us on trumped up fraud charges arising from washington s illegal economic sanctions against iran charges which could lead to her spending 30 years in prison a further intensification of canada s already aggressive anti china stance can only lead in one direction military conflict the trudeau government has already acknowledged as much adopting a plan in 2017 to hike military spending by over 70 percent by 2026 in her speech presenting the defence policy that outlined the government s plans to buy new battleships warplanes and other weaponry liberal foreign minister chrystia freeland identified china s rise as a threat to global stability and to the us led rules based international order but scheer expressed the logic of canada s turn to militarism and great power conflict even more brazenly he called for canada to play an even more prominent role in nato and demanded the modernization of the north american aerospace defence command norad a us canada war alliance established during the cold war to monitor north american airspace and prepare attacks including a nuclear first strike on the soviet union he also called for intensified cooperation among the five eyes alliance the global spying network led by the us national security agency nsa and that includes intelligence agencies from britain canada australia and new zealand this would require an upgrade of canada s military equipment that goes beyond that ordered by the liberals said scheer including the procurement of new submarines in concluding his foreign policy address scheer ominously declared we must be honest with ourselves about the threats we face it s why we must unite the forces of democracy and freedom across the globe to confront threats with greater resolve than those who pose them and we must be ready to do our part to back up our strength of our values with the strength of our forces even some bourgeois commentators pointed out in the immediate aftermath of scheer s speech that implementing the kind of wide ranging militarist plans he outlined would cost tens of billions of dollars in addition to what has already been set aside for the armed forces scheer made clear how his government would approach this problem in his may 13 speech on the economy delivered to the economic club of canada underscoring that the tories will make sweeping cuts to social spending scheer declared under my leadership any new spending not already budgeted must be paid for from savings within the government he went on to denounce the trudeau government for running bottomless deficits and burdening business with excessive taxes and regulations additionally he vowed to deregulate the energy sector and weaken environmental oversight to make it easier for oil pipelines to be built to tidal water and to lower business costs through tax cuts and other handouts to boost corporate competitiveness taken together scheer s two speeches represent a declaration of war on the working class working people are to be made to bear even greater burdens than under the current liberal government so as to bolster canadian imperialism s reckless drive to advance its predatory interests through aggression and war that this agenda is advanced by scheer should come as no surprise his 2017 campaign for the conservative party leadership pitched him as a disciple of stephen harper trudeau s conservative predecessor whose hard right government shifted canadian politics sharply to the right prime minister from 2006 to 2015 harper expanded canada s role in the afghanistan war sent troops into battle in libya iraq and syria rebranded canada as a warrior nation to fit with his right wing nationalist outlook enforced sweeping attacks on democratic rights in the name of the war on terror and virtually abolished any right to strike for workers in federally regulated industries however as reactionary as harper was a scheer tory government would not merely mean a continuation of harper s policies since harper stood down following the tories 2015 election defeat the conservatives have shifted further to the right this is exemplified in its demonization of immigrants and refugees fleeing trump s vicious crackdown in the united states a stance that has emboldened far right and outright fascist forces in canada to take to the streets a scheer government would come to power under conditions in which the right wing populists doug ford and francois legault hold power in ontario and quebec respectively their governments are mounting a savage assault on the working class which now will be joined by jason kenney s right wing united conservative government in alberta which won office last month more fundamentally the global capitalist crisis has deepened considerably even since harper s decade in office one expression of this is the promotion of far right forces by capitalist elites the world over whether it be the efforts of the billionaire oligarch trump to build up a fascistic movement the emergence of the neo fascist alternative for germany afd as that country s official opposition or the attempts of france s ostensibly liberal president emmanuel macron to rehabilitate the nazi collaborator and vichy regime president marshal pétain on the other hand the growing war danger and ever worsening social conditions are propelling the working class into struggle around the world from the mass wildcat strike by manufacturing workers in matamoros mexico to france s yellow vest protests and the working class mobilizations against ford s social spending cuts in ontario workers in every country are entering into struggle against austerity and social inequality implementing the kind of reactionary agenda outlined by scheer in the face of these rising class struggles would necessitate a political regime far to the right of that led by harper ultimately the subordination of all aspects of government policy to the ruling elite s insatiable pursuit of markets and profits of which the imperialist drive to war is the starkest expression is incompatible with democratic forms of rule
the canadian dollar rose 0 16 percent after a long weekend the loonie benefited from rising risk appetite and given that the us reached an agreement with canada and mexico to cancel steel and aluminum tariffs the currency was exempt from trade war tensions the bank of canada has kept rates unchanged in 2019 and given how economic data has been mixed there is little expectation of a rate move in either direction this year the central bank joined the dovish choir despite impressive job gains as trade headwinds could still pressure the economy next week s economic calendar in canada will be low

u s president donald trump is scheduled to come to tokyo on saturday to meet with prime minister shinzo abe trump indicated earlier that a deal may be achieved in the bilateral trade talks with japan even before his arrival but so far there has been no such sign while tight information control to focus public attention on a grand announcement cannot be completely ruled out finding an agreeable compromise point would seems to require additional talks at a less publicized bureaucratic level trump s trade policy started with his decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership deal in 2017 the u s joined the tpp negotiations in 2010 followed by its two partners in the north american free trade agreement nafta canada and mexico in 2012 and japan in 2013 japan s decision to join the tpp was mostly based on economic cost benefit analysis while a reduction of japan s trade barriers including tariffs exposes agriculture and previously closed service sectors to competition with foreign suppliers competitive sectors in the japanese manufacturing industry would benefit from a reduction of tariffs by japan s trade partners

the negotiations were strained and at times it looked like it would be stillborn but the usmca the new north american free trade agreement linking the economies of the united states mexico and canada was signed in november 2018 and awaits ratification its future is still uncertain although u s president donald trump finally removed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from canada and mexico something both countries and even some congressional republicans were demanding for the deal to be ratified democrats in the u s are unhappy with its costly monopoly protection for new pharmaceuticals and weak enforcement measures for labour and environmental protection but beneath the political jockeying is a sleeper issue concerning public health that signals a bad agreement health impact assessment we undertook a recently released health impact assessment of the usmca focusing on three specific aspects of the agreement with direct or indirect health effects pharmaceuticals health and environmental regulations and labour and environmental protection for prescription drugs the costs of which have risen dramatically since the era of patent protection in trade agreements the usmca contains provisions the americans wanted in the trans pacific partnership agreement these provisions were suspended by the remaining countries when trump pulled the u s out of that agreement now they re back in but with an even longer 10 year guaranteed monopoly for biologics a new category of costly drugs used to treat cancers and autoimmune disorders generic equivalents known as biosimilars can cut the price by almost half canada currently offers eight years of market protection for biologics the additional two years could eventually add almost 170 million to each year s drug costs hardest hit would be mexico which presently offers no such monopoly rights for biologics the usmca also locks in rules that make it easier for drug companies to evergreen their products through minor changes in their components or in how they re administered extending the years of patent protection and prevent regulators from using for several years the patent drug company s test data when approving generic versions impact on health regulations a more subtle but critical set of changes in the usmca imposes new constraints on the three countries abilities to enact health safety and environmental policies or regulations it is these so called behind the border rules in trade and investment agreements that have garnered the greatest public health concerns the usmca tries to assuage these concerns by affirming countries inherent right to regulate including to protect public health safety the environment and natural resources but it immediately undercuts this right by specifying that it must be exercised in a manner consistent with this agreement that consistent manner includes provisions that could make it harder for mexico to use existing safeguards under world trade organization rules to ensure domestic food security or to guarantee minimum food prices to reduce rural poverty and support small scale mexican farmers it requires the three governments to ensure that any new international standards upon which new regulations might be based do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade suggesting trade issues will trump new health regulations this became an issue even during negotiations when the u s wanted the agreement to ban any front of package nutrition labelling that would warn consumers of unhealthy levels of fat salt or sugar canada and mexico rejected this but the usmca contains several provisions on labelling that could lead to trade disputes should the two other countries choose to adopt new nutrition labels as canada is proposing to do american and canadian trade associations representing meat processors have already argued that canada s proposal violates the usmca portending a possible trade challenge if the usmca becomes law foxes guarding the hen house other rules open the doors for persons of another party in other words primarily u s based corporations to have a seat at the table when canada or mexico decide to consult on new regulations this runs the risk of regulatory capture by private vested interests akin to inviting the foxes to guard the hen house unaware that your cosmetics are not always healthy or safe the usmca would like to keep it that way requiring governments to wait until a problem shows up and fix it later in a similar way usmca provisions require governments to submit detailed scientific evidence and explanation for any new government regulation which is likely to lead to regulatory chill slowing down or preventing the introduction of novel health protection measures this risk is compounded by an entire and enforceable chapter that aims to have the three governments harmonize their regulations to enable freer movement of goods across borders the economic elephant in the usmca is of course the u s whose regulatory rules will likely set the tone for canada and mexico and the trump administration is keen to undo as many health and environmental regulations as possible there are some less troubling glimmers in the new agreement controversial rules allowing foreign investors to sue governments over regulations that may undermine the value of their investment have been eliminated between the u s and canada apart from a three year window for legacy claims to be made canada fared particularly badly under the old nafta while the u s never lost a case yet it was the united states that scrapped the rules while canada wanted to keep them so go figure the americans hedged their bets however by retaining the rules to protect u s investors in mexico mandatory mexican minimum wage the usmca also contains provisions that claim to protect labour rights and the environment often used by governments to sell trade deals to skeptical citizens a key labour provision however requires mexico to amend its laws to allow workers to more effectively collectively bargain the country recently passed legislation to satisfy this provision but questions remain over implementation and enforcement strategies a second provision mandates a substantially increased minimum hourly wage in mexico s auto manufacturing sector which could help relieve poverty for mexicans although mexican exporters might opt instead to pay the low tariff the u s would levy if they fail to raise wages and while there s lots of references to labour rights and multilateral environmental agreements in the usmca it s unsurprisingly silent on climate change and the paris climate accord and there are escape clauses provisions only become enforceable if a country lowers its existing level of protection to gain a trade or investment advantage this might prevent a race to the regulatory bottom but it s hardly a reassuring reach for the top in the end we have an agreement that binds governments future regulatory options in return for scant evidence of improved labour or environmental protection or even economic gain the imf for example estimates a net economic boost across the three countries of us 550 million a year chump change at best the u s international trade office ito with some fanfare begged to differ announcing american gains of us 62 billion and 176 000 new jobs the rub here is that these numbers rest on a unique modelling assumption reduced policy uncertainty that raised the eyebrows of most conventional trade economists remove this novel assumption and the american study actually shows a net loss in both income and jobs make america great again perhaps not so much as with any trade agreement some economic sectors will be winners and others losers but as far as protecting public health is concerned the usmca is a big step backwards authors ronald labonte professor and canada research chair university of ottawa courtney mcnamara senior researcher

standard lessees are required to recognize lease right of use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for all leases the company adopted this standard and related amendments during the quarter using a prospective transition approach which applies the provisions of the new standard at the effective date without adjusting the comparative periods the adoption of the standard resulted in an increase in lease related assets of 3 6 billion and an increase in lease related liabilities of 3 9 billion the difference between the increases in lease related assets and liabilities net of the deferred tax impact was recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in fiscal 2019 the standard had no impact on the company s debt covenant compliance under its current agreements

the bitcoin standard the decentralized alternative to central banking by saifedean ammous wiley 286 pages 29 95 the truth machine the blockchain and the future of everything by michael j casey and paul vigna st martin s press 302 pages 26 99 if you find it hard to imagine how bitcoins could ever replace dollars as the world s primary medium of exchange consider the bizarre tale of the donut shaped rai stones on the island of yap weighing up to four metric tons and standing up to 12 feet tall these rocks couldn t be slipped into a wallet deposited in a bank or even moved around without enormous effort yet for centuries they served the yapese people as an effective form of money because the high cost of acquiring new stones made them hard to debase writes saifedean ammous in the bitcoin standard the decentralized alternative to central banking the system lasted until the 1870s when the irish american ship captain david o keefe managed to overwhelm the island s economy with a new supply of the giant limestone discs it s an artful beginning to a book that makes a case for bitcoin as the best form of money ever conceived largely because its supply is permanently capped at 21 million units that hard limit means bitcoin can never be devalued as were the rai stones of yap and every other historical currency to varying degrees thus it can facilitate long term planning and investment by businesses and households an economist at the lebanese american university in beirut ammous earned his ph d in sustainable development from columbia curiously he worked as a teaching assistant under progressive economist jeffrey sachs who has called bitcoin a waste of time and resources that is destined for collapse ammous résumé also lists as a reference economist joseph stiglitz who has called for the u s to outlaw bitcoin though written with clarity and wit the bitcoin standard is not the definitive work i had hoped for a book that thoroughly counters the best arguments of bitcoin s many detractors it also lapses periodically into odd rants attributing all of society s alleged cultural failings from miley cyrus s twerks to bland mass produced junk food to government issued money as if financing endless wars and fueling the boom and bust cycle weren t enough to support his case yet the book s virtues far outweigh its faults while the best writings on the topic can be forbidding to readers who lack a technical understanding of how bitcoin functions ammous has managed to produce a complex analysis that doesn t require any prerequisite knowledge the book begins by placing bitcoin in the context of other forms of currency though gold is resistant to inflation because it s so costly to mine its fatal flaw compared to bitcoin is that it has to be stored in a physical location making it vulnerable to government takeover world war i era inflation marked the beginning of the end for the gold standard it was replaced by government issued currency which distorted the natural interest rate and turned money into a plaything of politics in the words of ludwig von mises then came bitcoin with no physical properties this decentralized digital money isn t susceptible to state control and its users don t need permission to spend their holdings it s also the hardest money ever invented ammous writes since bitcoin s fixed supply of 21 million units is coded into the software previously it proved impossible to come up with a form of money of which more cannot be created which makes bitcoin the first example of absolute scarcity when the late economist julian simon observed that human time is the only truly limited resource ammous has quipped he was only correct because bitcoin hadn t yet been invented with gold a price increase incentivizes miners to excavate more of it a bitcoin price increase by contrast attracts participants also known as miners to contribute additional computing power to the network indirectly strengthening its security ammous sees this as perhaps the most ingenious aspect of bitcoin s design here the author parts company with many mainstream macroeconomists who hold that inflation of the money supply is necessary to prevent the economy from freezing up the cato institute s george selgin a leading figure in the modern free banking school maintains for different reasons that bitcoin s fixed supply makes it ill suited to becoming the monetary standard he thinks a growing labor force under a fixed supply of money would be especially problematic average compensation would be driven down over time and workers would find this unacceptable there are strong counterarguments to this concern why couldn t workers adjust to a world in which their paychecks shrink so long as their money grows in value even faster the bitcoin standard would be a better book with a detailed rebuttal to free market economists like selgin instead it dismisses these objections as arising from mainstream confusion and fears in the last section ammous tackles the topic of blockchain technology the distributed ledger that is a core component of bitcoin to understand the blockchain s purpose consider the analogy of a banking ledger that s used to tabulate account holders credits and debits we entrust banks to keep their own ledgers the bitcoin blockchain in contrast is maintained by the community at large anyone can download a constantly updated duplicate copy the file is constructed in a manner that prevents any existing information from being deleted or altered while allowing new data to be added this system of decentralized recordkeeping enables the bitcoin network to operate without third party oversight but since it involves so much duplication and is built to contend with the security vulnerabilities that come with decentralization it s also wildly inefficient it s a common refrain in the cryptocurrency community that this technology will have a bigger impact than bitcoin itself ammous calls this cargo cult science arguing that bitcoin will always be the only successful implementation of the blockchain because blockchains are so much more resource intensive than traditional databases use cases need to be compelling enough to justify the extra costs in arguing that only bitcoin meets that high bar ammous overlooks some worthy projects in their early stages one promising application is verifying that land title records in countries with insecure property rights are properly maintained and updated blockchains may also come to serve as a decentralized white pages a shared virtual ledger for anchoring our digital identities the most technically sound project in this space is blockstack which is attempting to use the blockchain as the foundation for a new more open internet where users needn t rely on facebook google or other centralized platforms to manage their contacts reputations and data but if ammous bar for blockchain success is too high michael j casey and paul vigna have set theirs too low the truth machine the blockchain and the future of everything sees this new form of database impacting just about every type of business casey a senior advisor at the mit media lab and vigna a wall street journal reporter open their book by describing a pilot program for tracking food payments in the jordanian azraq refugee camp by scanning a refugee s iris and publishing the transactions to a blockchain but the world food program which runs the camp has no incentive to falsify its records so why not use a far less costly and cumbersome centralized database or a google doc the authors silliest claim is that a blockchain could prevent a repeat of the 2015 food poisoning crisis at chipotle mexican grill by reasonably verify that its supplier butchers are appropriately handling the meat they assert that the very existence of an all knowing ledger of activity could compel better behavior how the existence of a blockchain would lead a well intentioned butcher to remember to change his plastic gloves or wash his hands after a trip to the bathroom is unclear casey and vigna also imagine that blockchain technology could have stopped the collapse of lehman brothers by making its activities more transparent because the 2008 financial crisis was essentially a failure of trust that entailed a vast manipulation of ledgers the authors explain that lehman tricked regulators by keeping two sets of books but they don t elaborate on why a decentralized public ledger would prevent chicanery of this sort they also don t acknowledge that lehman brothers financial records comprise too much data to live on a public blockchain as ammous understands bitcoin s most radical implications aren t about building a better database they re about restoring the era of sound money whether authorities like it or not the best way to stop the next financial crisis is a new global standard of free market money that governments and banks can t control

implement retail price changes to mitigate cost pressure our recent acquisition of the retail analytics platform from boomerang commerce will also assist in modernizing and digitizing our approach to pricing we are still in the early stages of our transformation and with the changes we are putting in place we expect to deliver improved gross margin performance over the balance of the year i would

powell says he sees moderate risk from corporate debt washington ap federal reserve chairman jerome powell said monday that the central bank is closely monitoring a sharp rise in corporate debt but currently does not see the types of threats that triggered the 2008 financial crisis in remarks to a banking conference in fernandina beach florida powell said views about riskier corporate debt known as leveraged lending range from this is a rerun of the subprime mortgage crisis to nothing to worry about here he said his view lies somewhere in the middle the risks currently are moderate powell said his comments followed a fed report earlier this month that showed riskier corporate debt had grown by 20 in 2018 to 1 1 trillion prompting the attention of regulators investors are attracted to the riskier corporate debt because it pays higher returns than the very low rates they can receive on safer debt much of this debt is grouped together and used to back securities known as collateralized loan obligations powell said that much of this borrowing because it is financed opaquely outside the banking system has prompted concerns it could pose a new threat to financial stability just as similar debt instruments that bundled sub prime mortgages helped to trigger the 2008 crisis file in this wednesday may 1 2019 file photo federal reserve board chair jerome powell speaks at a news conference following a two day meeting of the federal open market committee in washington powell says a sharp rise in corporate debt is being closely monitored but currently the fed does not see the types of threats that triggered the 2008 financial crisis ap photo patrick semansky file however powell said he believes regulators learned the lessons of the 2008 crisis which brought the worst financial crisis in the united states since the 1930s and pushed the country into the deepest recession since the great depression the financial system today appears strong enough to handle potential business sector losses which was manifestly not the case a decade ago with subprime mortgages powell said powell said one key difference between 2008 and now is that the increase in business borrowing is not being fueled by a dramatic asset price bubble like the housing bubble of the past decade improvements in banking regulation such as annual stress tests for the nation s biggest banks have allowed regulators to make sure banks are in a position to withstand even a serious economic downturn he said powell s speech focused on bank regulation issues rather than the fed s interest rate policies after raising its key policy rate four times last year the fed has left the rate unchanged this year and is projecting no rates hikes for all of 2019 however president donald trump seeking to ensure a strong economy going into the 2020 presidential election has been pressuring the fed to start cutting rates while some economists believe the central bank may begin reducing rates later this year other analysts think the more likely outcome is no rate changes for the entire year during a question and answer period following his speech powell was asked about the recent slowdown in inflation which has fallen further below the central bank s 2 target for annual price increases he said that the central bank is grappling with the issue that inflation pressures today are different than 25 years ago he cited a variety of factors such as the rise in internet sales which help hold down prices the fed is keeping close tabs on these inflation dynamics in deciding how to set interest rate policies he said advertisement on another issue powell said the central bank is also closely watching the trade dispute between the united states and china and is prepared to alter interest rate policies if necessary but he noted that at the moment the outcome of the u s china trade negotiations is not known
the negotiations were strained and at times it looked like it would be stillborn but the usmca the new north american free trade agreement linking the economies of the united states mexico and canada was signed in november 2018 and awaits ratification its future is still uncertain although u s president donald trump finally removed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from canada and mexico something both countries and even some congressional republicans were demanding for the deal to be ratified democrats in the u s are unhappy with its costly monopoly protection for new pharmaceuticals and weak enforcement measures for labour and environmental protection but beneath the political jockeying is a sleeper issue concerning public health that signals a bad agreement health impact assessment we undertook a recently released health impact assessment of the usmca focusing on three specific aspects of the agreement with direct or indirect health effects pharmaceuticals health and environmental regulations and labour and environmental protection for prescription drugs the costs of which have risen dramatically since the era of patent protection in trade agreements the usmca contains provisions the americans wanted in the trans pacific partnership agreement these provisions were suspended by the remaining countries when trump pulled the u s out of that agreement now they re back in but with an even longer 10 year guaranteed monopoly for biologics a new category of costly drugs used to treat cancers and autoimmune disorders generic equivalents known as biosimilars can cut the price by almost half canada currently offers eight years of market protection for biologics the additional two years could eventually add almost 170 million to each year s drug costs hardest hit would be mexico which presently offers no such monopoly rights for biologics the usmca also locks in rules that make it easier for drug companies to evergreen their products through minor changes in their components or in how they re administered extending the years of patent protection and prevent regulators from using for several years the patent drug company s test data when approving generic versions impact on health regulations a more subtle but critical set of changes in the usmca imposes new constraints on the three countries abilities to enact health safety and environmental policies or regulations it is these so called behind the border rules in trade and investment agreements that have garnered the greatest public health concerns the usmca tries to assuage these concerns by affirming countries inherent right to regulate including to protect public health safety the environment and natural resources but it immediately undercuts this right by specifying that it must be exercised in a manner consistent with this agreement that consistent manner includes provisions that could make it harder for mexico to use existing safeguards under world trade organization rules to ensure domestic food security or to guarantee minimum food prices to reduce rural poverty and support small scale mexican farmers it requires the three governments to ensure that any new international standards upon which new regulations might be based do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade suggesting trade issues will trump new health regulations this became an issue even during negotiations when the u s wanted the agreement to ban any front of package nutrition labelling that would warn consumers of unhealthy levels of fat salt or sugar canada and mexico rejected this but the usmca contains several provisions on labelling that could lead to trade disputes should the two other countries choose to adopt new nutrition labels as canada is proposing to do american and canadian trade associations representing meat processors have already argued that canada s proposal violates the usmca portending a possible trade challenge if the usmca becomes law foxes guarding the hen house other rules open the doors for persons of another party in other words primarily u s based corporations to have a seat at the table when canada or mexico decide to consult on new regulations this runs the risk of regulatory capture by private vested interests akin to inviting the foxes to guard the hen house unaware that your cosmetics are not always healthy or safe the usmca would like to keep it that way requiring governments to wait until a problem shows up and fix it later in a similar way usmca provisions require governments to submit detailed scientific evidence and explanation for any new government regulation which is likely to lead to regulatory chill slowing down or preventing the introduction of novel health protection measures this risk is compounded by an entire and enforceable chapter that aims to have the three governments harmonize their regulations to enable freer movement of goods across borders the economic elephant in the usmca is of course the u s whose regulatory rules will likely set the tone for canada and mexico and the trump administration is keen to undo as many health and environmental regulations as possible there are some less troubling glimmers in the new agreement controversial rules allowing foreign investors to sue governments over regulations that may undermine the value of their investment have been eliminated between the u s and canada apart from a three year window for legacy claims to be made canada fared particularly badly under the old nafta while the u s never lost a case yet it was the united states that scrapped the rules while canada wanted to keep them so go figure the americans hedged their bets however by retaining the rules to protect u s investors in mexico mandatory mexican minimum wage the usmca also contains provisions that claim to protect labour rights and the environment often used by governments to sell trade deals to skeptical citizens a key labour provision however requires mexico to amend its laws to allow workers to more effectively collectively bargain the country recently passed legislation to satisfy this provision but questions remain over implementation and enforcement strategies a second provision mandates a substantially increased minimum hourly wage in mexico s auto manufacturing sector which could help relieve poverty for mexicans although mexican exporters might opt instead to pay the low tariff the u s would levy if they fail to raise wages and while there s lots of references to labour rights and multilateral environmental agreements in the usmca it s unsurprisingly silent on climate change and the paris climate accord and there are escape clauses provisions only become enforceable if a country lowers its existing level of protection to gain a trade or investment advantage this might prevent a race to the regulatory bottom but it s hardly a reassuring reach for the top in the end we have an agreement that binds governments future regulatory options in return for scant evidence of improved labour or environmental protection or even economic gain the imf for example estimates a net economic boost across the three countries of us 550 million a year chump change at best the u s international trade office ito with some fanfare begged to differ announcing american gains of us 62 billion and 176 000 new jobs the rub here is that these numbers rest on a unique modelling assumption reduced policy uncertainty that raised the eyebrows of most conventional trade economists remove this novel assumption and the american study actually shows a net loss in both income and jobs make america great again perhaps not so much as with any trade agreement some economic sectors will be winners and others losers but as far as protecting public health is concerned the usmca is a big step backwards authors ronald labonte professor and canada research chair university of ottawa courtney mcnamara senior researcher

generic versions impact on health regulations a more subtle but critical set of changes in the usmca imposes new constraints on the three countries abilities to enact health safety and environmental policies or regulations it is these so called behind the border rules in trade and investment agreements that have garnered the greatest public health concerns the usmca tries to assuage these concerns by affirming countries inherent right to regulate including to protect public health safety the environment and natural resources but it immediately undercuts this right by specifying that it must be exercised in a manner consistent with this agreement that consistent manner includes provisions that could make it harder for mexico to use existing safeguards under world trade organization rules to ensure domestic food security or to guarantee minimum food prices to reduce rural poverty and support small scale mexican farmers it requires the three governments to ensure that any new international standards upon which new regulations might be based do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade suggesting trade issues will trump new health regulations this became an issue even during negotiations when the u s wanted the agreement to ban any front of package nutrition labelling that would warn consumers of unhealthy levels of fat salt or sugar canada and mexico rejected this but the usmca contains several provisions on labelling that could lead to trade disputes should the two other countries choose to adopt new nutrition labels as canada is proposing to do american and canadian trade associations representing meat processors have already argued that canada s proposal violates the usmca portending a possible trade challenge if the usmca becomes law foxes guarding the hen house other rules open the doors for persons of another party in other words primarily u s based corporations to have a seat at the table when canada or mexico decide to consult on new regulations this runs the risk of regulatory capture by private vested interests akin to inviting the foxes to guard the hen house unaware that your cosmetics are not always healthy or safe the usmca would like to keep it that way requiring governments to wait until a problem shows up and fix it later in a similar way usmca provisions require governments to submit detailed scientific evidence and explanation for any new government regulation which is likely to lead to regulatory chill slowing down or preventing the introduction of novel health protection measures this risk is compounded by an entire and enforceable chapter that aims to have the three governments harmonize their regulations to enable freer movement of goods across borders the economic elephant in the usmca is of course the u s whose regulatory rules will likely set the tone for canada and mexico and the trump administration is keen to undo as many health and environmental regulations as possible there are some less troubling glimmers in the new agreement controversial rules allowing foreign investors to sue governments over regulations that may undermine the value of their investment have been eliminated between the u s and canada apart from a three year window for legacy claims to be made canada fared particularly badly under the old nafta while the u s never lost a case yet it was the united states that scrapped the rules while canada wanted to keep them so go figure the americans hedged their bets however by retaining the rules to protect u s investors in mexico mandatory mexican minimum wage the usmca also contains provisions that claim to protect labour rights and the environment often used by governments to sell trade deals to skeptical citizens a key labour provision however requires mexico to amend its laws to allow workers to more effectively collectively bargain the country recently passed legislation to satisfy this provision but questions remain over implementation and enforcement strategies a second provision mandates a substantially increased minimum hourly wage in mexico s auto manufacturing sector which could help relieve poverty for mexicans although mexican exporters might opt instead to pay the low tariff the u s would levy if they fail to raise wages and while there s lots of references to labour rights and multilateral environmental agreements in the usmca it s unsurprisingly silent on climate change and the paris climate accord and there are escape clauses provisions only become enforceable if a country lowers its existing level of protection to gain a trade or investment advantage this might prevent a race to the regulatory bottom but it s hardly a reassuring reach for the top in the end we have an agreement that binds governments future regulatory options in return for scant evidence of improved labour or environmental protection or even economic gain the imf for example estimates a net economic boost across the three countries of us 550 million a year chump change at best the u s international trade office ito with some fanfare begged to differ announcing american gains of us 62 billion and 176 000 new jobs the rub here is that these numbers rest on a unique modelling assumption reduced policy uncertainty that raised the eyebrows of most conventional trade economists remove this novel assumption and the american study actually shows a net loss in both income and jobs make america great again perhaps not so much as with any trade agreement some economic sectors will be winners and others losers but as far as protecting public health is concerned the usmca is a big step backwards authors ronald labonte professor and canada research chair university of ottawa courtney mcnamara senior researcher

our biological asset adjusted ebitda for the farming and land transformation businesses reached 31 9 million in 1q19 13 1 million or 69 6 higher year over year the improvement in financial performance is primarily explained by higher margins in our rice and dairy businesses coupled with the completion of the sale of alto alegre farm which contributed 9 4 million to ebitda in the case of the rice

and now available we feel confident that we will be able to plant the remaining hectares through 2020 and 2021 subject to weather conditions milk processing facilities investment update right after taking full control of the two milk processing facilities we acquired all the efforts were focused in obtaining the necessary permits and certifications to produce and commercialize our dairy products that took almost two months and by the end of march we started to fully operate the plants in the meantime we started to make the necessary maintenance works to fine tune the operation and enhance industrial efficiencies at the same time we started developing commercial relationships with raw milk suppliers and potential customers currently we are operating at half of the targeted capacity and already reached break even the shortage of raw milk in argentina resulted in high domestic prices as a result all the milk is diverted to our chivilcoy facility to produce fluid milk for the domestic

us china trade war here are beijing s options and not one looks any good from the volume of bellicose rhetoric in china s state media you might think beijing is digging in for a bloody fight to the finish in its trade conflict with the united states but after the us administration this month jacked up import tariffs on us 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 per cent and threatened equal tariffs on another us 340 billion the chinese government faces a problem the policy responses it is considering are all either impossible impractical ineffective or expensive this leaves beijing in an unenviable position the usual trade war response to the imposition of tariffs is to impose countervailing tariffs of your own inflicting enough pain on your antagonist to bring him back to the negotiating table but that s impossible in the us china dispute yes last week the chinese government slapped 25 per cent tariffs on us 60 billion of imports from the us but that just highlights beijing s problem last year the us imported us 540 billion of stuff from china whereas china bought just us 155 billion from the us or maybe as much as us 180 billion if you include all the us goods shipped to hong kong so if the us imposes 25 per cent tariffs on everything it buys from china and china retaliates by doing the same its retaliation will be ineffective in comparison worse many of those imports from the us advanced semiconductors for example are important for china s economic growth so imposing tariffs on the us would hurt back home and if beijing tried to relieve the pain by paying subsidies to injured importers it would defeat the object of imposing tariffs in the first place aware that countervailing tariffs are not an option many chinese commentators and some in the us have suggested beijing could punish washington by dumping its holdings of us treasury bonds considering that at the end of february china s declared holdings of us treasuries amounted to us 1 1 trillion this might sound like a viable threat if beijing were to sell them say the move s backers it would trigger a collapse in bond prices and therefore a sharp spike in us interest rates which would punish the us economy and trash confidence in the us dollar except as this column has explained before things wouldn t work like that at all china s us 1 1 trillion pile of treasuries might sound a lot but it s less than 5 per cent of the total outstanding if beijing were to sell them slowly private investors would have little difficulty absorbing the paper especially given the safe haven flows into the treasury market at a time of heightened tension and if china were to try and sell them all at once the us federal reserve would step in and buy them to preserve an orderly market and hold down interest rates it bought more than that in the few weeks following the 2008 implosion of lehman brothers and if beijing did manage to sell its treasuries what would it do with the proceeds put them on deposit at citibank in new york well guess what citi would put the money straight back into the treasury market net result zero and if china were to sell the us dollar proceeds of its treasury bond sales in the foreign exchange market what would it sell them for euros no chance there is already such a shortage of low risk european government paper that the yield on 10 year german government bonds is negative in any case selling us dollars would just push down the us currency s exchange rate which would benefit us exporters and further hurt chinese companies already penalised by us tariffs hardly the ideal outcome in a trade war nor would funding hard assets work china has tried that with its belt and road initiative even according to the most generous estimates current investments and future commitments come to less than us 200 billion that s already causing massive capacity problems there s no way china could attempt to invest us 1 1 trillion in short order and ever get its money back so if selling its us treasuries isn t practical what else could beijing do to exert pressure on washington the most obvious course would be to stimulate china s domestic economy by expanding credit growth and then not to stand in the way when the yuan weakened in response to the looser monetary conditions firstly a weaker yuan would help to offset the impact of tariffs on china s exporters secondly if the experiences of 2015 and 2018 are anything to go by a sharp fall in the yuan would spook global investors and trigger a steep sell off in the us stock market and if there s one thing we know donald trump sets store by it s the level of the us stock market so allowing the yuan to weaken would have the twin benefits of supporting china s exporters and hurting the us administration possibly enough to achieve a trade deal acceptable to beijing but there would be costs involved first faster credit expansion would support chinese growth but at the cost of increasing leverage in the economy which beijing has spent the last two years urgently trying to contain second allowing the yuan to weaken would risk triggering destabilising capital outflows which would exacerbate the danger posed by excessive leverage in the domestic financial system and third allowing the chinese currency to weaken would badly set back the progress of yuan internationalisation a key long term policy goal of xi jinping s government of course considering all the difficulty and expense of responding to the us tariffs the other option would be for beijing to return to the 150 page outline trade deal with the us which it rejected so effectively two weeks ago but that too would have costs a loss of face and the acceptance of constraints on beijing s long term industrial strategy another of xi s highly prized policies not an enviable position at all source south china morning post
the negotiations were strained and at times it looked like it would be stillborn but the usmca the new north american free trade agreement linking the economies of the united states mexico and canada was signed in november 2018 and awaits ratification its future is still uncertain although u s president donald trump finally removed tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from canada and mexico something both countries and even some congressional republicans were demanding for the deal to be ratified democrats in the u s are unhappy with its costly monopoly protection for new pharmaceuticals and weak enforcement measures for labour and environmental protection but beneath the political jockeying is a sleeper issue concerning public health that signals a bad agreement health impact assessment we undertook a recently released health impact assessment of the usmca focusing on three specific aspects of the agreement with direct or indirect health effects pharmaceuticals health and environmental regulations and labour and environmental protection for prescription drugs the costs of which have risen dramatically since the era of patent protection in trade agreements the usmca contains provisions the americans wanted in the trans pacific partnership agreement these provisions were suspended by the remaining countries when trump pulled the u s out of that agreement now they re back in but with an even longer 10 year guaranteed monopoly for biologics a new category of costly drugs used to treat cancers and autoimmune disorders generic equivalents known as biosimilars can cut the price by almost half canada currently offers eight years of market protection for biologics the additional two years could eventually add almost 170 million to each year s drug costs hardest hit would be mexico which presently offers no such monopoly rights for biologics the usmca also locks in rules that make it easier for drug companies to evergreen their products through minor changes in their components or in how they re administered extending the years of patent protection and prevent regulators from using for several years the patent drug company s test data when approving generic versions impact on health regulations a more subtle but critical set of changes in the usmca imposes new constraints on the three countries abilities to enact health safety and environmental policies or regulations it is these so called behind the border rules in trade and investment agreements that have garnered the greatest public health concerns the usmca tries to assuage these concerns by affirming countries inherent right to regulate including to protect public health safety the environment and natural resources but it immediately undercuts this right by specifying that it must be exercised in a manner consistent with this agreement that consistent manner includes provisions that could make it harder for mexico to use existing safeguards under world trade organization rules to ensure domestic food security or to guarantee minimum food prices to reduce rural poverty and support small scale mexican farmers ap photo marco ugarte it requires the three governments to ensure that any new international standards upon which new regulations might be based do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade suggesting trade issues will trump new health regulations this became an issue even during negotiations when the u s wanted the agreement to ban any front of package nutrition labelling that would warn consumers of unhealthy levels of fat salt or sugar canada and mexico rejected this but the usmca contains several provisions on labelling that could lead to trade disputes should the two other countries choose to adopt new nutrition labels as canada is proposing to do american and canadian trade associations representing meat processors have already argued that canada s proposal violates the usmca portending a possible trade challenge if the usmca becomes law foxes guarding the hen house other rules open the doors for persons of another party in other words primarily u s based corporations to have a seat at the table when canada or mexico decide to consult on new regulations scott walsh unsplash this runs the risk of regulatory capture by private vested interests akin to inviting the foxes to guard the hen house unaware that your cosmetics are not always healthy or safe the usmca would like to keep it that way requiring governments to wait until a problem shows up and fix it later in a similar way usmca provisions require governments to submit detailed scientific evidence and explanation for any new government regulation which is likely to lead to regulatory chill slowing down or preventing the introduction of novel health protection measures this risk is compounded by an entire and enforceable chapter that aims to have the three governments harmonize their regulations to enable freer movement of goods across borders the economic elephant in the usmca is of course the u s whose regulatory rules will likely set the tone for canada and mexico and the trump administration is keen to undo as many health and environmental regulations as possible there are some less troubling glimmers in the new agreement controversial rules allowing foreign investors to sue governments over regulations that may undermine the value of their investment have been eliminated between the u s and canada apart from a three year window for legacy claims to be made canada fared particularly badly under the old nafta while the u s never lost a case yet it was the united states that scrapped the rules while canada wanted to keep them so go figure the americans hedged their bets however by retaining the rules to protect u s investors in mexico mandatory mexican minimum wage the usmca also contains provisions that claim to protect labour rights and the environment often used by governments to sell trade deals to skeptical citizens a key labour provision however requires mexico to amend its laws to allow workers to more effectively collectively bargain the country recently passed legislation to satisfy this provision but questions remain over implementation and enforcement strategies a second provision mandates a substantially increased minimum hourly wage in mexico s auto manufacturing sector which could help relieve poverty for mexicans although mexican exporters might opt instead to pay the low tariff the u s would levy if they fail to raise wages and while there s lots of references to labour rights and multilateral environmental agreements in the usmca it s unsurprisingly silent on climate change and the paris climate accord and there are escape clauses provisions only become enforceable if a country lowers its existing level of protection to gain a trade or investment advantage this might prevent a race to the regulatory bottom but it s hardly a reassuring reach for the top in the end we have an agreement that binds governments future regulatory options in return for scant evidence of improved labour or environmental protection or even economic gain the imf for example estimates a net economic boost across the three countries of us 550 million a year chump change at best the u s international trade office ito with some fanfare begged to differ announcing american gains of us 62 billion and 176 000 new jobs the rub here is that these numbers rest on a unique modelling assumption reduced policy uncertainty that raised the eyebrows of most conventional trade economists remove this novel assumption and the american study actually shows a net loss in both income and jobs make america great again perhaps not so much as with any trade agreement some economic sectors will be winners and others losers but as far as protecting public health is concerned the usmca is a big step backwards

u s president donald trump is scheduled to come to tokyo on saturday to meet with prime minister shinzo abe trump indicated earlier that a deal may be achieved in the bilateral trade talks with japan even before his arrival but so far there has been no such sign while tight information control to focus public attention on a grand announcement cannot be completely ruled out finding an agreeable compromise point would seems to require additional talks at a less publicized bureaucratic level trump s trade policy started with his decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership deal in 2017 the u s joined the tpp negotiations in 2010 followed by its two partners in the north american free trade agreement nafta canada and mexico in 2012 and japan in 2013 japan s decision to join the tpp was mostly based on economic cost benefit analysis while a reduction of japan s trade barriers including tariffs exposes agriculture and previously closed service sectors to competition with foreign suppliers competitive sectors in the japanese manufacturing industry would benefit from a reduction of tariffs by japan s trade partners
debt death spiral approaching today our spirits wallow and our brow is creased with worry for we are informed the united states is racing into a death spiral of debt that is when every public dollar it borrows must service its debt crowding out all other demands that debt presently exceeds 22 trillion it expands by day by hour by minute by second but when does america finally go corkscrewing into the fatal abyss eight years 10 years perhaps a dozen the all important answer shortly but first a brief canvas of wall street and the stock market the trade war strikes again the opening whistle blew this morning and the dow jones instantly sank triple digits once again we must look to trade chinese state media indicated early today that china is in no special hurry to resume peace talks this is because the united states once again crossed chinese interests it has put chinese telecommunications behemoth huawei under the ban the firm can no longer purchase components from american firms but stocks absorbed the initial blow and gradually clawed their way back but not enough to break even the dow jones ended the day 99 points lower the s p lost 17 points the nasdaq 82 and so the merry go round spins but when will the united states enter the death spiral of debt to begin we sit down with the facts interest on the debt the fastest growing budget item four items alone constitute 78 of the federal budget medicare medicaid social security and interest on the national debt all other programs scratch along on the remaining 22 these include defense education scientific research all bread all circuses all remaining programs but the fastest expanding sinkhole in the budget is interest on the national debt interest on the debt is the great villain of our tale the horseman of our apocalypse the united states government ladled out 221 billion in interest on the national debt through the first four months of fiscal year 2019 that is nearly 10 greater than last year s payments over the same space and this we have on official authority of the united states department of treasury interest on united states public debt will stretch to some 591 billion this fiscal year a record 2 000 out of your pocket could you put an extra 2 000 to good use this year perhaps you could heave an extra 2 000 into savings investment leisure charitable causes etc but if you are the average american the national debt denies you that option that is because over 2 000 of your tax bill is being siphoned to service this debt all of which transpires while the gross domestic product continues to expand in a growing economy the old time keynesians preached a gospel of fiscal restraint it is the time to store in reserves to save against the rainy day the inevitable rainy day come the recession the government can then proceed against it with a brimming war chest countercyclical policy academic men style it but the old keynesians currently preach before an empty church the flock has gone winging off for the heretic faith of perpetual deficit and the united states is passing rapidly beyond all hope of heaven the tragic math when unemployment last sunk to today s 3 6 in 1969 and 2000 the united states government boasted surpluses in lean seasons these surpluses it could sacrifice upon the altar of countercyclical fiscal policy and push back against recession but the congressional budget office cbo projects this year s deficit will verge upon 900 billion and cbo estimates gdp will limp along at an average 1 9 per annum the next decade but again debt is piling on at 6 per year trillion dollar annual deficits are therefore in prospect for the next decade at least annual interest costs on the debt will scale 724 billion by 2025 estimates cbo and 928 billion by 2029 or nearly 25 of the entire budget when inevitable recession descends the war chest will not only be empty it will have a gaping hole in its bottom but let us add another strand to the hangman s noose cbo numbers don t account for recession cbo s figures do not admit the possibility of recession for the following 10 years a handsome assumption that is given the present expansion will rank history s longest come july how can it peg along another decade without recession even the federal reserve is giving out visible and audible signals of the coming rough house it is publicly airing mentions of negative interest rates standing repo facilities a variant of qe and more would it ransack its toolkit for policy options if not expecting to use them does a man ransack his closet for an umbrella if not expecting rain 2 3 trillion annual deficits if the economy does sink into recession depend on it the government will plunge even deeper into debt to stimulate the economic machinery we get a recession affirms analyst sven henrich and you are looking at 2 3 trillion deficits interest on the debt will swamp the budget especially if interest rates rise cbo s current 2029 forecast of 928 billion then appear quaint as stands cbo estimates the average interest rate on the debt will rise from 2 3 last year to 3 5 in 2029 the lord help us all if interest rates run much higher but when again will the united states go spinning into the death spiral of debt the primary deficit the united states treasury department s office has issued its fiscal year 2019 q1 report in in treasury s office of debt management projects total u s government borrowing from the public among the metrics it tracks is the primary deficit the primary deficit is the amount by which total spending exceeds total revenue excluding interest payments on debt for the next number of years interest on the debt approximates other elements of the budget deficit but beginning in 2024 treasury projects the primary deficit will fall to zero and then turn negative explains zero hedge while in 2019 and 2020 surging u s interest expense is roughly matched by the other deficit components in the u s budget these gradually taper off by 2024 the real red flag is that starting in 2024 when the primary deficit drops to zero according to the latest projections all u s debt issuance will be used to fund the u s net interest expense which depending on the prevailing interest rate between now and then will be anywhere between 700 billion and 1 2 trillion or more and that is when the death spiral begins 2024 five years from today that is when every new dollar uncle samuel borrows from the public goes to service interest on the debt the ponzi finance phase continues zero hedge in short the u s will enter the penultimate ponzi finance phase the one in which all the new debt issuance is used to fund only interest on the debt sometime around 2024 setting the business in concrete is craig eyermann research fellow at the independent institute when the national debt reaches the point where all newly borrowed dollars must be used to pay this mandatory expenditure the u s government will have passed the event horizon that marks the boundary of the national debt death spiral of course the united states may enter the fatal orbit later than 2024 but also earlier either case it is dead on course regards brian maher managing editor the daily reckoning

over the recent days financial markets again has been dominated by the ongoing trade war between u s and china however prolonged negotiations are just one of many unsolved problems in beijing donald trump raises tariffs on chinese products on sunday may 5 president of the united states announced on his twitter account tariffs increase on chinese products worth 200 billion dollars from 10 to 25 new duties have been implemented on friday may 10 trump added in his tweet feed that 25 tarrifs on additional goods worth 325 billion dollars may be also imposed in the future after the announcement indices in china recorded the strongest declines since january 2016 as it can be seen in the chart below technology companies dropped by almost 8 blue line while the shanghai composite index consisting of all companies listed on the shanghai stock exchange lost over 5 5 red line source zerohedge in the u s at the beginning it looked similar futures contracts on stock indexes were significantly losing till the market opening during the session however u s indices recovered almost all losses closing the day slightly below zero source zerohedge during the following days investors in the u s were slowly losing faith in a quick deal between u s and china as a result stock prices on the american stock exchanges dropped by several percent however declines in the middle kingdom were stronger why do we mention this the above situation shows sensitivity of chinese companies to any threats related to the ongoing trade war for this reason investors are very concerned about further developments in the middle kingdom continuing sell off of chinese shares is a very good proof of that between 6th and 10th may foreign investors dumped stocks worth 4 4 billion yuan 646 million dollars which was the biggest weekly sell off in history china s problems however are much greater debt problem to better understand how problems within china were developing let s go back in time a few years in the aftermath of financial crisis in 2018 economic growth sharply decreased as a result communist party decided to massively pump investments using debt party leaders assumed that economic growth should remain at a minimum level of 8 per annum as it is shown in the chart below gdp growth in china managed to stay above assumed 8 only until 2012 we can observe decreasing economic growth rate in china for a long time now which is currently only 6 4 the same as it was at the bottom of financial crisis 10 years ago it should be emphasized that all data releases in china are only for a point of reference even chinese officials admit it and in reality economic growth is much lower nevertheless as a result of the policy applied by the communist party after crisis china has experienced several years of economic recovery which resulted in a gigantic increase in debt total debt to gdp is currently around 270 this means that debt since the crisis has almost doubled chart shows that the largest share in debt is held by state owned enterprises dark blue and local governments units light blue over the last 20 years a huge increase in household debt red have been also observed in addition chinese companies have a significant problem according to bloomberg companies in china and hong kong excluding banks would need 74 years to pay off all their liabilities using free funds for comparison in argentina country which regularly announces bankruptcy 57 years are needed in greece so called euro bankrupt 28 years corporate debt problem of insolvency as we mentioned the situation of many companies in the middle kingdom is dramatic which negatively translates into their bond market it is worth mentioning that it is 3rd largest market in the world after japan and the u s and its capitalization is worth about 13 trillion dollars this is an equivalent of china s annual gdp along with growing bond market companies insolvency is significantly increasing only in the first four months of 2019 enterprises in china did not meet their obligations to bond holders for 5 6 billion dollars it is 3 times more than in the same period of 2018 if this pace continues in 2019 we will see new insolvency record in relation to the overall market value it is still a small percentage but in our opinion also these figures look worse in reality despite the growing debt problem china is trying to further stimulate lending of the corporate sector especially small and medium sized companies on monday may 9 bank of china announced another cuts in reserve requirement ratios as a result banks will have an additional 280 billion yuan 41 billion dollars to be used as loans to companies with financial problems that reduction would be divided over three stages on may

banking make it impossible for these enterprises to borrow outside the banking system all these aforementioned factors translate into the economy state and this one currently does not look bright current situation of the chinese economy chinese economy is very much dependent on exports and production they account together for over 40 of gdp in december 2018 export experienced a real shock dropping 20 in relation to the previous year black line on the chart in the following months we have seen a recovery in april however exports dropped again this time by 2 7 major impact on this had the decline in exports to the u s which decreased in april by 13 1 on the other hand import after 7 6 decline in march increased by 4 in april it should be noted that import from the u s have drastically dropped by as much as 25 7 another alarming signal can be data flow from the automotive sector we pay attention to this for two reasons a when we are dealing with economic slowdown and likely occurrence of the recession the automotive sector is one of the firsts which shows greater weakness b it is the largest automotive sector in the world chart shows that car sales in china has been declining over last several months the worst month was december 2018 when sales dropped by almost 20 it should be emphasized that these weak economic data come in the period when the bank of china and commercial banks facilitate credit access in various ways scale of this support for the economy in the first quarter of 2019 amounted to over 1 trillion dollars or 9 of chinese gdp this is more accurately illustrated by the following monthly chart showing value of funds which went to chinese enterprises and households upper part of the chart is shown in yuan while lower part in dollars it is easy to see that the first quarter of 2019 was record in terms of funds pumped into the financial system therefore there is nothing surprising in chinese stock exchange growth by more than 30 over this period green line which is twice as much as in the u s red line and germany blue line source zerohedge subsequently when liquidity injections has been limited then immediate drops in share prices has begun summary chinese policy after financial crisis of 2008 led to return of the economic growth however with the passage of time increasing debt became a significant problem for the second largest economy in the world weakness of the middle kingdom is already affecting related countries this can be seen among others in the number of companies that in 2018 announced earnings worse than expected top chart as well as anticipated changes in 2019 profitability bottom chart value below zero means that company earnings are expected to decline as it can be seen in the second chart in case of half of countries companies profits are expected to fall or not exceed real inflation remember that we are talkng about earnings expectations for this year they will probably be gradually reduced in our opinion it is very positive that china is trying to support the economy by lowering taxes and generally facilitating economic activity in 2019 plans include vat cuts for the production transport and construction sectors amounting to 298 billion dollars on the other hand china has been following u s footsteps for a long time and they are trying to artificially sustain good economic environment and keep shares and bond prices this means that they are trying to influence the economic and market cycles which should not be disturbed as a result debt in china has enormously grown and we are concerned that over time china may not be able to deal with it which will result in an extreme downturn such a situation will strongly affect the whole world because china share in global gdp is significant probably when this happens chinese authorities even more likely will manipulate data and in official communications inform that economic data is good although in reality chinese economy will shrink the authorities will be able to take such a step because in china the recognition of the rulling party can not be undermined therefore the rulers will not admit that they failed during implementation of a long term vision of state development in terms of chinese stock exchange companies associated with rare earth metals deserve attention recent decisions of donald trump mean that the chinese can introduce export restrictions of these metals this would mean a gigantic increase in their prices and problems of many american technology companies independent trader team
barquisimeto venezuela andreina cordero started the year skipping meals so her three kids could eat her husband a construction worker was out of a job and the family s savings had been devastated by the nation s hyperinflation limiting cordero s children to a diet of rice beans pasta and fried corn patties but the family got a break from their daily struggle to feed themselves this spring when a social worker enrolled them in a program run by a silicon valley startup that is donating cryptocurrency to hundreds of venezuelan families advertisement every week from february to april cordero received a deposit of eos tokens through a cellphone app she then traded the digital money for local currency through online transfers and used the funds to shop in market stalls we finally got to eat chicken cordero said and there were also vegetables for the kids the three month trial in crypto transfers is now over and the family is back to skipping meals and eating mostly beans and rice but cordero is thankful for the time that digital currency saved her kids from malnutrition i m very grateful for what they did for us cordero said it would be a blessing if something like that were set up again over the past decade cryptocurrencies like eos and bitcoin have become popular among investors looking to make large profits from a new and anonymous form of storing wealth but a handful of charities are also now using digital currencies to send relief directly to those in need circumventing banks and companies that handle remittances they ve found the ideal testing ground in venezuela where the annual inflation rate by some estimates has soared to a staggering 67 000 forcing millions to scavenge daily to feed themselves crypto has the highest likelihood of being helpful to people in places where money is broken said joe waltman executive director of givecrypto the charity that provided direct transfers to cordero and more than 100 venezuelan families in barquisimeto and there s probably no better example of broken money right now than venezuela advertisement givecrypto s program provided temporary help to vulnerable families by providing them with a weekly deposit worth around 7 or about the same as venezuela s monthly minimum wage the organization is also aiming to make people familiar with crypto apps so they can transfer their own earnings into digital currency and use it to buy goods long after they have stopped receiving free deposits we want to show that people who are not techies or investors can also benefit from this technology said efrain pineda the project s manager anyone can use crypto to protect themselves from inflation and make their daily life easier while many middle class venezuelans already try to protect their savings from hyperinflation by purchasing u s dollars and even gold nuggets saving in crypto offers a solution to store wealth that may be physically safer than holding on to cash or precious metals in a crime infested country online platforms that allow venezuelans to buy and hold u s dollars provide a similar service storing cryptocurrency presents greater financial risks than holding u s dollars though due to the wild swings in the value of some crypto assets including bitcoin but in venezuela where the local bolivar currency has lost two thirds of its value this year some merchants are willing to give this technology a shot in barquisimeto leticia luque an informal merchant said she began to accept crypto payments two months ago at the request of a social worker collaborating with givecrypto s direct transfer scheme she said the technology has helped her gain time to barter for better prices with suppliers and plan what she will buy next we used to be in a rush to purchase goods before our bolivars lost their value said luque whose husband travels every week to colombia to stock up on packaged foods and basic goods that the couple re sells out of their home now we can take our time and we know that our earnings are in a safe place waltman said the barquisimeto experiment was the first stage of a larger effort to promote the use of cryptocurrency in venezuela using stable currencies whose values have less fluctuation than bitcoin a similar initiative known as an airdrop is being developed by airtm a currency exchange platform based in mexico city that plans to donate small amounts of cryptocurrency to 100 000 people in venezuela this summer so far it has raised 300 000 from donations toward its 1 million goal the one time payment of no more than 10 a person will provide only momentary relief but the goal is also to encourage venezuelans to engage with the airtm platform we want to show venezuelans how to hold money outside their local currency said joshua kliot the organization s co founder the biggest impact this could have is to crypto ize the country and it s not just in venezuela where nonprofits are attempting to help vulnerable people by introducing them to digital currency platforms in europe bitnation a humanitarian agency has enabled hundreds of refugees without bank accounts to receive direct donations through bitcoin accounts in jordan the world food program delivers aid to 100 000 syrian refugees by creating digital currency accounts for each recipient using blockchain technology but official currencies to pay for goods refugees only need to have their iris scanned in participating stores paul lamb a nonprofit management consultant based in california says the idea of distributing funding directly to people in need is becoming increasingly popular among humanitarian groups because in some contexts it is cheaper than organizing the logistics required to physically hand out food or medicine usually these money transfers are made through debit cards in the local currency but humanitarian groups are also starting to look at cryptocurrency it s harder for someone to steal cryptocurrency said hugh aprile the colombia country director for mercy corps a nonprofit that has handed out debit cards to 7 000 venezuelan refugees and in situations where you have high inflation it can ensure the stability of the funds being transferred but aid programs that distribute cryptocurrency also face several challenges in venezuela power cuts like the one that recently left much of the country in the dark for days knock out the internet connection needed to use cryptocurrency and connections for many are iffy even when there is power a tightly controlled currency system that punishes financial crimes with jail time has also discouraged some merchants from accepting cryptocurrency merchants who accept crypto and are public about it risk being inspected by the government said randy brito the founder of bitcoin venezuela a cryptocurrency education group poverty is another barrier ariany jaimes a social worker who recruited participants for givecrypto s project in barquisimeto said she had to keep some of the neediest

introduction regulation gets a bad name in much of the world today business lobbies have successfully equated it in many people s minds with just so much red tape government imposed rules on how things are made how services are delivered and what products have no place on the market at all are said to hamper business competitiveness precautionary measures aimed at safeguarding people s health or the health of fragile water bodies and ecosystems are labelled unfair barriers to trade and investment a claim made increasingly over the past quarter century of corporate globalization at the same time the need for stronger and more precautionary regulations has never been clearer new science on the effect of chemicals on human and animal bodies strongly suggests we should be much more strictly controlling certain compounds in pesticides cosmetics and other products or taking those products off the market while awash with plastic products nobody needs and it s now obvious that market based carbon trading schemes cannot on their own lower greenhouse gas emissions enough for countries to meet their paris agreement targets more forceful action will be needed on all these fronts even if that action creates new trade barriers since the 1995 founding of the world trade organization wto environmental ngos and public interest watchdogs have warned that overly restrictive language in the wto agreements unfairly constrains the policy options available to governments for conserving animal and plant habitats eliminating pollution reducing greenhouse gas emissions and taking toxic chemicals out of our consumer products among other public interest priorities while some progress has been made to remedy this imbalance in newer free trade agreements through the inclusion of environmental labour and sustainable development chapters for example big business has lobbied successfully for other less discussed provisions and chapters that institutionalize an ideology of deregulation this report focuses on the significant threats to precautionary environmental labour consumer and public health policy from regulatory cooperation and good regulatory practices chapters within the eu canada economic and trade agreement ceta us mexico canada agreement usmca and the currently parked eu u s transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip 1 it will be argued that while international regulatory cooperation is often pitched to governments and the public as innocuous or beneficial the terms under which this cooperation takes place belie its real func tion as a further entrenchment of corporate bias in the globalization project good regulatory practices can and are intended to delay or distract the public and decision makers from introducing more democratic and sus tainable economic and social policy typically regulatory cooperation and good regulatory practices chapters in trade agree ments require governments to institution alise voluntary or mandatory arrangements through which public servants in different countries can and in some cases must work together usually in close collaboration with industry to reduce or eliminate differences in domestic laws policies standards regulations and testing procedures including health en vironmental and consumer protections that are said to impede trade this trade bias in the regulatory process has roots in u s law but it has since been elaborated in a set of regula tory best practices developed within the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd and at the wto one important tenet of good regulatory practice is that regulation should be based on risk management meaning that its ob jective is limited and it is justified by currently available scientific evidence as the risk based regulatory framework has evolved it has come to also require regulators to minimize the costs or burdens on business consider how they might regulate in ways that encourage trade and innovation and adopt international standards or practices wherever possible these tenets attempt to strip politi cal or ethical considerations from government rule making and are in a fundamental way directly opposed to the precautionary principle which states when an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically in this context the proponent of an activity rather than the public should bear the burden of proof emphasis added good regulatory practices grp are there fore at once an ideology of how and when government should intervene in the market to protect people or nature for example a set of institutional arrangements for regulating in a pro business way and in cooperation with other governments and a new privileged space for multinational corporations to intervene in national rule making frequently and at the earliest stages this report begins by exploring the roots of good regulatory practices ideology in the wto oecd and u s law it then examines how grp based regulatory 9 cooperation has functioned between canada and the united states and compares that to the expected functioning of similar bodies in the concluded ceta and proposed ttip and usmca agreements following this we consider what business lobbies have said they hope to get out of transatlantic regulatory cooperation the report concludes by considering the ben efits of precaution and regulatory leadership along with some alternative forms that international regulatory cooperation could take that are not based on the deregulatory grp ideology the findings here should be of special interest to european policy makers activists and the public as the european commission sets out to revive the stalled ttip negotiations even as opposition to the rati fication of ceta with canada remains strong but the report should also resonate in north america where policy makers will soon de bate the ratification of a nafta replacement that includes the most aggressive short sighted good regulatory practices chapter negotiated to date

afcfta negotiations update from autradeindustry the 15th meeting of the afcfta negotiating forum kicked off monday at the african union addis ababa the meeting will consider among others the afcfta post launch implementation plan and the organogram of the afcfta secretariat details of the au coda afcfta implementation policy dialogue 27 28 may oecd economic outlook may 2019 the outlook remains weak and there are many downside risks that cast a dark shadow over the global economy and people s well being first the mediocre growth outlook is conditional on no escalation of trade tensions which cut across the americas asia and europe simulations in this outlook s first chapter show that renewed tensions between the united states and china could shave more than 0 6 from global gdp over two to three years second manufacturing and services do not work in isolation while services have remained buoyant providing a buffer it is unlikely that they decouple for long from manufacturing more than a third of manufacturing gross exports comes from services and services contribute directly or indirectly to more than half of global exports in addition manufacturing crucially depends on investment which is not only an engine of growth and employment today but also shapes tomorrow s growth and living standards third china remains a source of concern as the deployment of monetary fiscal and quasi fiscal tools not only has uncertain effects on activity but might continue to fuel non financial corporate debt already at a record high level we estimate that a 2 percentage point reduction in domestic demand growth in china sustained for two years and combined with heightened uncertainty could reduce global gdp by 1¾ per cent by the second year finally private sector debt is growing fast in major economies the global stock of non financial corporate bonds has almost doubled in real terms compared with 2008 at close to usd 13 trillion and the quality of debt has been deteriorating including a heightened stock of leveraged loans a new bout of financial stress could erupt looking ahead trade tensions are not only hurting the short term outlook but also medium term prospects calling for urgent government action to reinvigorate growth the global economy was expanding in sync less than two years ago but challenges to existing trade relationships and the multilateral rules

agricultural strategy pdf comprehensively details key drivers for agriculture a sector which has been intensely studied talked about but never prioritised with enough budgetary resources or political focus it is a strategy that is 20 years too late my key take on the strategy is agro processing an area that has always interested me the report says that agro processing contribution to gdp in kenya is only 3 2 with 2 4 contribution to national employment and 8 5 of exports egypt a desert country has far higher agro processing metrics for those of us who were around in 1960 70s we can confirm that former president jomo kenyatta had delivered a high level of agro industries which unfortunately collapsed in the subsequent leadership of his successor daniel moi the just launched strategy for agro processing is achievable all we need is to revisit the successes of yester years the strategy promises 10 agro processing feasibility studies to be undertaken in the next five years with five of them actually accelerated for design construction and operation if we shed off the bureaucracy and lethargy that is characteristic of our government systems and allocate sufficient budgetary resources it is possible to deliver ten feasibilities and five industries in five years frontiers of economic policy communications imf the role of communications is increasingly recognized in all policy areas but the journey communications has made in central banking over the past 30 years is especially impressive from secrecy to vagueness to transparency and accountability the growing popularity of inflation targeting in which communications play a central role and increased use of forward guidance in the aftermath of the global financial crisis are important factors behind the greater attention to communications long gone are the days when central banks sought to keep the press out of the bank and the bank out of the press and there is no going back however there is room for one policy area to draw from experiences in the others the paper discusses current and prospective developments in communications on monetary financial stability fiscal and structural policies it also considers the role that communications can play in helping to strengthen public trust in institutions the country examples have been chosen to highlight issues that arise and recur in a wide range of political systems and economic policy frameworks today s quick links zimbabwe vision 2030 should be anchored on value added exports usgc seeks export opportunity in south africa kenya seeks assistance from

rbi s think tank study led by amartya lahiri noted that stipulating a level of capital could potentially compromise the central bank s inflation liquidity and credit targets in anticipation of dividend payment demands central banks could deviate from their preferred monetary policy to avoid the payout a lower policy rate causes the value of central bank domestic assets to rise hence it could try and prevent a rise in its capital levels above the stipulated threshold by not reducing policy rates by as much as they would have in the absence of such a mandated threshold also since local currency depreciation raises central bank s capital it could try and avoid the resultant demand for payments to the fiscal authority by preventing currency depreciation compromising growth and external balance targets and in turn its own operational independence

politics would elizabeth warren s tax proposals actually cover her policy agenda here s what experts think some economists are beginning to questions warren s math others say her numbers well founded sen elizabeth warren pauses as she speaks during a campaign event earlier this month at river s bend bed breakfast in iowa falls iowa daniel acker the washington post six words increasingly met with cheers on the campaign trail have come to encapsulate elizabeth warren s position as the leading ideas candidate in the crowded democratic presidential primary i ve got a plan for that in town halls across the country warren has promoted her plans to offer americans free college universal child care student debt cancellation and more all paid for by raising taxes on the superwealthy taken as a whole the massachusetts senator s transformative slate of social programs and tax increases could amount to the largest transfer of wealth from the richest americans to the middle class in u s history advertisement but warren s ambitious agenda relies on two assumptions that defy a long history of u s policymaking first that the country s wealthiest taxpayers won t find ways to evade the targeted tax hike she proposes and second that new entitlement programs won t result in ballooning costs that plunge the federal government deeper into debt she s gone big there s nothing small about these proposals said mark zandi who as chief economist at moody s analytics has analyzed policies for warren and other presidential candidates will the wealthy do things that wealthy people can do to avoid paying the tax that s the real concern that i have a lot of other countries have tried this and backtracked because of tax avoidance issues while other candidates have offered general platforms and principles warren has outpaced the field in outlining specific policies and detailing how she would pay for them as her i ve got a plan mantra has caught fire with voters in recent weeks her poll numbers have also risen highlighting the hunger many democratic primary voters have for fleshed out policy prescriptions since launching her presidential campaign warren has rolled out a domestic platform that so far her campaign estimates would cost a combined 3 trillion over 10 years plans that include canceling student debt for almost every american building 3 million affordable housing units reducing rents by 10 percent nationwide shrinking the black white wealth gap by 4 percentage points subsidizing child care for all young families offering universal prekindergarten providing universal opioid treatment and eliminating the national park service s maintenance backlog while making all national parks free advertisement the centerpiece of warren s agenda is a 2 percent annual tax on household assets above 50 million hitting the wealthiest 0 1 percent of americans underscoring the populist themes that drive her candidacy warren often spends several minutes describing the wealth tax before laying out her ideas for free college child care and pre k think about that that s how badly out of whack our economy has gotten that two cents on the greatest fortunes in this country would yield an investment in every one of our kids across this country warren said earlier this month at a kermit west virginia town hall on the opioid crisis i m tired of freeloading billionaires the crowd broke into cheers several times as warren described how a 2 percent tax on the diamonds the yachts and the rembrandts of multimillionaires would pay for a host of new social programs including a 100 billion plan to combat the opioid epidemic but some economists are beginning to question the math behind warren s proposals warren s campaign claims that the wealth tax would raise 2 75 trillion over 10 years enough to cover her spending plans with hundreds of billions of dollars to spare she also has proposed a 1 trillion corporate tax on the most profitable companies advertisement in a washington post op ed last month former obama administration economic adviser lawrence summers and university of pennsylvania professor natasha sarin wrote such a wealth tax will not yield the revenue that its proponents hope for citing figures from the current estate tax that show how the wealthy have proved adept in avoiding the 40 percent levy on their assets after death the problem with their estimate is that they fail to engage with the fact that wealthy people do a lot of things that make it very hard to tax their estates and will make it equally hard to tax their wealth said sarin who teaches finance at the wharton school of business a recent poll of about 40 top economists by the university of chicago booth school of business found that 73 percent believed a wealth tax would be much more difficult to enforce than existing federal taxes because of tax evasion only 7 percent disagreed several cited the experience in europe where most countries have abandoned their wealth taxes in recent decades wealth taxes in the world s richest nations have brought in far less revenue than expected due to tax avoidance according to a 2018 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development warren declined a request to comment a campaign aide cited research by university of california at berkeley professors gabriel zucman and emmanuel saez who came up with the wealth tax proposal and calculated the revenue estimate in an interview zucman said warren s numbers are well founded zucman said warren s plan is specifically designed in a way that limits tax evasion allowing no exemptions increasing enforcement by the irs and imposing heavy fines on people who try to skirt the tax by undervaluing assets hiding their wealth abroad or renouncing their u s citizenship the 2 75 trillion estimate includes an allowance for 15 percent tax avoidance said zucman whose work with saez on wealth concentration is respected by other economists advertisement if it s properly enforced and there s a serious effort at having no exemptions and enforcing it strongly then it can collect a lot of tax revenue he said of the wealth tax tax avoidance tax evasion these are not things that happen out of the blue the government chooses to make taxes work to enforce them well or to not enforce them properly even as economists debate the feasibility of an ultra millionaires tax warren has found it to be an effective political weapon on the stump she talks about taxing the wealthiest 75 000 families in the country to illustrate how the wealth gains in recent decades have disproportionately flowed to the top 1 percent her plan offers an aggressive path to shrinking the wealth gap and has proved popular among broad swaths of the public a february politico morning consult poll found that 61 percent of voters supported the wealth tax while only 20 percent oppose it among republicans 50 percent supported it and 30 percent were opposed and even if the wealth tax proves more complex in practice than in theory it would certainly face legal challenges voters give warren credit for offering fresh ideas to address such major issues as income inequality many are seeking a contrast to president donald trump who ascended to the presidency with a campaign heavy on slogans and light on policy details advertisement they really have a good team said zandi who has worked with warren s aides to analyze plans for affordable housing and universal child care that s why they re coming out with the most in depth proposals warren s campaign has indicated that it will continue to roll out new policies while warren has voiced support for universal health care paid sick leave and an expansive federal response to climate change her campaign like others has yet to describe how those programs would be structured and funded some of the plans warren has described in detail would create massive new entitlements with the risk of overshooting budget estimates warren has promised that the government would pay all tuition and fees for students to attend public colleges and she has proposed a universal child care and pre k program that would cap costs at 7 percent of family income she also pledged to cancel student loan debt for 95 percent of borrowers who have it college is a basic need that should be available for free to everyone who wants to go warren wrote in a medium post describing her plan warren s estimated cost for her college and student loan plan totaled more than 1 25 trillion over 10 years sandy baum a higher education fellow at the urban institute said costs for free two and four year college could quickly spiral beyond estimates using the example of a student in pennsylvania contemplating where to go to college baum said a free public college program might incentivize more students to take advantage of the government benefit raising potential costs advertisement right now you might decide i m not going to college in pennsylvania i m going to go to a private college in massachusetts she said if it suddenly becomes free to go to penn state then that s going to be a very different choice and some of those students are definitely going to say penn state it s free the warren campaign did not provide an analysis of how it estimated the cost of its free college program which includes increasing pell grants and creating a 50 billion fund for historically black colleges and universities and minority serving institutions it s a lot of money said baum if it accomplishes its goal of getting more people to go to college and stay there for a longer time it ll be more expensive warren s child care and early education proposal is one of her most costly initiatives citing estimates from moody s warren s campaign said providing free child care for families below 200 percent of the federal poverty line and subsidizing care for almost everyone else would cost about 1 1 trillion over 10 years that total is reduced to 700 billion if you include the benefits of economic growth the campaign said but zandi who wrote the moody s analysis for the campaign acknowledged that the child care program could ultimately be more expensive one risk is that the free benefit could attract more users than forecast driving up costs it s very possible the takeup could be more significant that what i ve anticipated zandi said adding that there s also a chance that economic growth could be greater than forecast canceling out additional costs advertisement warren s conservative critics have chafed at her claim that such a major expansion of government benefits could be financed only by taxing the wealthy some also predict that higher taxes on the rich quickly compounding at 2 percent annually will have unintended consequences for the economy shrinking growth that s one of the things about taxes they change behavior said michael strain an economist at the conservative leaning american enterprise institute if you tax savings you ll get less savings that will hurt investment which will hurt productivity and that will hurt wages but warren is banking on the idea that voters are ready to reject the kind of supply side economics that have dominated much of u s policymaking for decades and embrace a new system aimed at reorienting the economy around the middle class during a campaign stop last week in philadelphia warren talked about how working families had fallen further behind as politicians catered to millionaires and large corporations then she described her push to fundamentally restructure government with an expansive social program financed by a historic tax increase on the wealthy we need to make not some nibbles around the edge not like one statute over here and a regulation over there in a little piece what we need is big structural change in this country she said to applause and i ve got a plan for that in fact i ve got multiple plans for that
six words increasingly met with cheers on the campaign trail have come to encapsulate elizabeth warren s position as the leading ideas candidate in the crowded democratic presidential primary i ve got a plan for that in town halls across the country warren has promoted her plans to offer americans free college universal child care student debt cancellation and more all paid for by raising taxes on the superwealthy taken as a whole the massachusetts senator s transformative slate of social programs and tax increases could amount to the largest transfer of wealth from the richest americans to the middle class in u s history but warren s ambitious agenda relies on two assumptions that defy a long history of u s policymaking first that the country s wealthiest taxpayers won t find ways to evade the targeted tax hike she proposes and second that new entitlement programs won t result in ballooning costs that plunge the federal government deeper into debt she s gone big there s nothing small about these proposals said mark zandi who as chief economist at moody s analytics has analyzed policies for warren and other presidential candidates will the wealthy do things that wealthy people can do to avoid paying the tax that s the real concern that i have a lot of other countries have tried this and backtracked because of tax avoidance issues while other candidates have offered general platforms and principles warren has outpaced the field in outlining specific policies and detailing how she would pay for them as her i ve got a plan mantra has caught fire with voters in recent weeks her poll numbers also have risen highlighting the hunger that many democratic primary voters have for fleshed out policy prescriptions since launching her presidential campaign warren has rolled out a domestic platform that so far her campaign estimates would cost a combined 3 trillion over 10 years plans that include canceling student debt for almost every american building 3 million affordable housing units reducing rents by 10 percent nationwide shrinking the black white wealth gap by 4 percentage points subsidizing child care for all young families offering universal prekindergarten providing universal opioid treatment and eliminating the national park service s maintenance backlog while making all national parks free the centerpiece of warren s agenda is a 2 percent annual tax on household assets above 50 million hitting the wealthiest 0 1 percent of americans underscoring the populist themes that drive her candidacy warren often spends several minutes describing the wealth tax before laying out her ideas for free college child care and pre k advertisement think about that that s how badly out of whack our economy has gotten that two cents on the greatest fortunes in this country would yield an investment in every one of our kids across this country warren said earlier this month at a kermit w va town hall on the opioid crisis i m tired of freeloading billionaires the crowd broke into cheers several times as warren described how a 2 percent tax on the diamonds the yachts and the rembrandts of multimillionaires would pay for a host of new social programs including a 100 billion plan to combat the opioid epidemic democratic presidential candidate sen elizabeth warren d mass wants to cancel billions of dollars in student loan debt and make college less expensive video reuters but some economists are beginning to question the math behind warren s proposals warren s campaign says that the wealth tax would raise 2 75 trillion over 10 years enough to cover her spending plans with hundreds of billions of dollars to spare she also has proposed a 1 trillion corporate tax on the most profitable companies advertisement in a washington post op ed last month former obama administration economic adviser lawrence summers and university of pennsylvania professor natasha sarin wrote that such a wealth tax will not yield the revenue that its proponents hope for citing figures from the current estate tax that show how the wealthy have proved adept in avoiding the 40 percent levy on their assets after death the problem with their estimate is that they fail to engage with the fact that wealthy people do a lot of things that make it very hard to tax their estates and will make it equally hard to tax their wealth said sarin who teaches finance at the wharton school of business a recent poll of about 40 top economists by the university of chicago booth school of business found that 73 percent believed a wealth tax would be much more difficult to enforce than existing federal taxes because of tax evasion seven percent disagreed several cited the experience in europe where most countries have abandoned their wealth taxes in recent decades wealth taxes in the world s richest nations have brought in far less revenue than expected as a result of tax avoidance according to a 2018 report by the organization for economic cooperation and development warren declined a request to comment a campaign aide cited research by university of california at berkeley professors gabriel zucman and emmanuel saez who came up with the wealth tax proposal and calculated the revenue estimate advertisement in an interview zucman said warren s numbers are well founded zucman said warren s plan is specifically designed in a way that limits tax evasion allowing no exemptions increasing enforcement by the irs and imposing heavy fines on people who try to skirt the tax by undervaluing assets hiding their wealth abroad or renouncing their u s

as presidents go donald trump is unlikely to be remembered for his principles but he has one in fear trump in the white house bob woodward describes how the president wrote trade is bad in the margins of a draft speech when his economic adviser gary cohn asked why he believed this trump replied i just do i ve had these views for 30 years this is true in 1987 trump published an open letter to the american people as a full page newspaper ad it s time for us to end our vast deficits he declared by making japan and others who can afford it pay in an interview with the wall street journal in 1999 trump speculated about waging a trade war against japan it s not going to last very long he explained because japan if they don t sell to this country they go out of business ok he has been nothing if not consistent except of course that japan has been replaced by china as the principal though by no means the only target of trump s protectionist policy on the campaign trail in 2016 he repeatedly threatened to impose a 45 tariff on all chinese imports back then the journalist salena zito memorably observed that the press takes literally but not seriously his supporters take him seriously but not literally on trade we should have taken him both seriously and literally last year trump imposed a succession of tariffs on imports beginning with washing machines and solar products and then targeting steel and aluminium he also imposed tariffs on chinese imports worth 200bn 157bn earlier this month just when trade negotiations between washington and beijing seemed close to a conclusion trump carried out his threat to hike those tariffs from 10 to 25 he has since begun the process to extend the 25 tariff to nearly all us imports from china as happened last year china has retaliated by slapping tariffs on us goods the president s song remains the same tariffs will bring in far more wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind he tweeted on may 10 an easy way to avoid tariffs he asked a day later make or produce your goods and products in the good old usa it s very simple and we will be taking in tens of billions of dollars in tariffs from china the economics profession and nearly everyone it has taught in the past 50 years begs to differ one recent paper written before this year s escalation of the trade war calculated that the full incidence of the tariff falls on domestic consumers with a reduction in us real income of 1 4bn per month by the end of 2018 not only do the tariffs raise the prices american consumers pay american manufacturers and farmers are losing out as a result of china s retaliation soya bean exports to china for example have plummeted with opinion polls suggesting an increase in public support for free trade agreements since 2016 trump s strategy looks economically and politically suicidal yet there is method in his madness if tariffs really are so self destructive the economic history of the united states presents something of a puzzle from its very inception a revolt against british control of among other things import duties the american republic relied on tariffs as a source of revenue and as protection for its own nascent industries as exporters of cotton the southern democrats were the free traders the manufacturers of the north first as whigs then as republicans favoured an american system based on protection though many other factors contributed to making america great tariffs certainly did nothing to slow the rapid growth of the us economy in the 19th century by 1872 it was the world s biggest meanwhile tariffs had become a domestic political stick with which as in the case of the 1828 tariff of abominations the north beat the south later it was tariffs that divided the east of the country from the west economists tend to remember with horror the 1930 smoot hawley bill which raised tariffs just as the world was tipping into depression but the new rates were only slightly higher than those that had been imposed in 1922 it was not until the later stages of the second world war that the united states finally committed itself to free trade and only gradually thereafter with a major hiccup in the 1970s that average duties were lowered for roughly 150 years in other words the united states was a protectionist power tariffs were a large part of what the nation s elected representatives fought over on capitol hill the era of free trade has been precisely half as long if it began in 1941 with the atlantic charter it ended with the election of donald trump 75 years later trump s trade war is doubly political primarily as i have argued before it is designed to check china s rise and though a blunt instrument it is undoubtedly causing significantly more pain to china than to the us taking account of the gains to us producers and the government in the form of revenue the net cost of tariffs to the united states is in fact just 7 8bn a year 0 04 of gdp true the return to protectionism may also cost shareholders some of their wealth many big corporations will take a hit as they reconfigure their global supply chains but the chinese leadership miscalculated badly in thinking that it could make last minute improvements to its trade deal with trump it thought he would make concessions rather than see us stocks take a hit wrong trump isn t going to make a bad deal with china when he can simply lean on the federal reserve to match chinese monetary policy with interest rate cuts the second political dimension of trump s tariffs is as is always true of tariffs domestic sure there are losers but at the last census farmers amounted to just 1 of the us population and the principal losers a recent study shows are workers in heavily republican counties they don t seem very likely to vote for a democrat especially if the nominee is joe biden who thinks the chinese are not bad folks and not competition for us americans agree with trump not biden in 2018 only 38 of americans had a favourable view of china down from 44 the previous year and 58 worried more about china s economic strength than its military strength true not everyone thinks that tariffs are the way to counter china s rise but republicans clearly do even if democrats don t republicans up for re election next year are watching carefully how the trade war plays in their states right now it s playing well as one red state political veteran put it if we can t take a few tariffs in the short run how can we ever beat china in the long run the widespread perception of donald trump as unprincipled is wrong he has one principle the protection principle it may not be great economics but history suggests it could be pretty good politics comment below

a steelworker tests a sample of steel at an indiana mill in march 2018 scott olson getty images tariffs have been applied over the years to protect homegrown industries and target competitors who are seen as using unfair trade practices they impose costs on both importers and exporters and had been in decline until the recent u s china trade spat by andrew chatzky research staff council on foreign relations tariffs have long been used to prop up homegrown industries by getting locals to buy goods produced domestically for most of the past century however tariffs have fallen out of favor because they often lead to reduced trade higher prices for consumers in tariff wielding countries and retaliation from abroad with tariffs once again rising under u s president donald j trump and global trade slowing many experts fear companies could soon face higher costs and the world economy could suffer what is a tariff a tariff is a tax imposed on goods imported from a foreign country tariffs are paid by an importing business to its home country s government most commonly as a fixed percentage of the value of the imports tariffs can serve several goals like all taxes they provide a modest source of government revenue several countries have also used tariffs to help their infant industries at home hoping to shelter local firms from foreign competitors some tariffs are also meant to address unfair practices that other countries have used to make their exports artificially cheap who uses tariffs almost every country imposes some tariffs exceptions include hong kong which as a free port never imposes tariffs in general wealthy countries maintain low tariffs compared to developing countries there are several reasons why developing countries might have more fragile industries that they wish to protect or they might have fewer sources of government revenue the united states for instance maintained high tariffs for many years until income taxes supplanted tariffs as the most important source of revenue after world war ii tariffs continued to decline as the united states emphasized trade expansion as a central plank of its global strategy who authorizes tariffs in the united states the u s constitution grants congress the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states which it used for more than a century to impose tariffs perhaps most infamous congress raised close to nine hundred separate tariffs with the 1930 smoot hawley tariff act driving the economy deeper into the great depression but over the past ninety years congress has delegated more and more trade authority to the executive branch in part a response to its mistakes in smoot hawley several pieces of legislation underline this trend among them the trade expansion act of 1962 granted president john f kennedy the authority to negotiate tariff reductions of up to 80 percent and the trade act of 1974 allowed the president to negotiate some trade agreements with foreign countries which were then presented to congress for an unamendable up or down vote both democratic and republican presidents have used this authority to shrink tariffs create the world trade organization wto and enter into a range of trade agreements what are the various aims of tariffs in a narrow sense tariffs are intended to protect local industries by making imports more expensive and driving consumers to domestic producers in the united states several industries benefit from such tariffs sugar producers have been protected by tariffs since 1789 and the auto industry has benefited from the so called chicken tax since 1964 which places 25 percent tariffs on some pickup trucks other tariffs are meant to counteract specific measures taken by foreign countries or firms for instance the united states applies countervailing duties when another country subsidizes a domestic industry allowing its exporters to sell products at a lower price than they would otherwise be able to in a free market undercutting u s producers antidumping tariffs are applied when a u s firm proves that a foreign firm is selling products in the united states at lower prices than they charge in their home market often in an attempt to drive competitors out of an industry before raising prices in both of these cases tariffs are meant as a penalty that allows domestic producers to compete as if the market had not been distorted critics however claim that even these tariffs are often disguised protectionist policies in some strategic industries often for goods with military uses tariffs can be used to ensure a country does not rely on trade for its supply of a good section 232 of the trade expansion act of 1962 for example allows the president to raise tariffs on certain goods for national security reasons president trump used this law to raise tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from china as well as from allies including canada and the european union leading to accusations that national security was being used as a pretext for protectionism many economists challenge the logic behind tariffs and suggest they hurt more industries than they help but some economists favor tariffs robert e scott of the economic policy institute a pro labor think tank found that as of late 2018 hundreds of jobs had been created in the steel and aluminum sector and that there was no evidence of the negative downstream effects many economists had forecast others point out that u s taxpayers have subsidized those jobs with cost estimates ranging from 300 000 to 2 3 million per job created others have made arguments rooted in grand strategy alexander hamilton asserted that tariffs were necessary at least temporarily to help infant industries in the united states until they grew strong enough to compete abroad at which point tariffs could be removed still others support tariffs for purely geopolitical reasons ceding any economic argument according to them tariffs might not help the home country but wielding such a powerful weapon can hurt adversaries abroad and force them to make political concessions several of president trump s trade advisors have advanced this notion framing recent u s tariffs on china as a negotiating tactic that has gotten beijing s attention they have pointed to the fact that the threat of tariffs against u s ally south korea led it to quickly institute quotas on steel exports to the united states president trump has often noted that tariffs reduce trade and if the united states has a bilateral trade deficit with a country less trade will shrink that deficit reducing bilateral deficits has been one of the president s avowed goals despite a near consensus among economists that bilateral trade balances matter far less than other trade indicators and that trade deficits aren t a function of a country s tariffs around the world many high tariff countries run substantial trade deficits who pays importers pay tariffs to their home government most economists find that the bulk of tariff costs are passed on to consumers this is particularly true for industries such as retail or grocery stores with small profit margins i don t think there are an awful lot of retailers or businesses out there whose margins are so huge that they can just swallow a 25 percent cost increase said philip levy an economist in the george w bush administration a study by researchers from the federal reserve and the university of chicago found that consumers bore between 125 and 225 percent of the costs of washing machine tariffs indicating that appliance retailers charged even more than the tariffs had cost them other studies have pointed to different costs for consumers with tariffs on their foreign competitors domestic producers can raise their prices in may 2019 goldman sachs told clients that it found that the effects of u s tariffs applied to chinese goods spilled over noticeably to the prices charged by u s producers competing with goods affected by the levies ultimately consumers share the burden with importers at the same time exporters can cut prices to hold on to their market share most empirical research on recent u s tariffs suggests this has not occurred but economists agree it is a possibility what is the impact on countries targeted with tariffs tariffs hurt exporters by making their products more expensive they could struggle to maintain their sales which could cause profits to fall and potentially the country s economy to shrink alternatively exporters could decide to cut their prices to maintain sales but this too could shrink their profits the effect is particularly worrisome for countries whose economies are export driven the asian tigers hong kong singapore south korea and taiwan relied on exports to maintain annual growth above 7 percent for much of the postwar era though their growth has slowed more recently other countries especially in asia have attempted to replicate this china became the world s largest exporter in 2009 and vietnam has become a hub for low cost manufacturing exports more recently many high income countries such as germany have turned to exports to support their growth countries that depend on exports for growth can lose many of their consumers when they face tariffs resulting in strong economic headwinds economists forecast that chinese economic growth will take a 0 8 percent hit when u s tariffs announced in may 2019 take effect what is the impact on tariff wielding countries tariffs also act as an economic drag in the countries using them when consumers bear the brunt of tariff costs it makes them effectively poorer because prices are higher many economists agree that this has been the result of the wave of u s tariffs implemented in 2018 one study by economists from the federal reserve bank of new york princeton university and columbia university found that the entire burden of those tariffs fell on domestic consumers with a reduction in u s real income of 1 4 billion per month by the end of 2018 firms that use domestic products as inputs also see their purchasing power shrink as tariffs allow domestic producers to raise prices for example as automakers pay more for steel economists suggest they are likely to shed more workers than steel mills will hire one study by the peterson institute for international economics found that u s jobs in steel using industries outnumbered jobs in steel producing industries by an eighty to one ratio separately cfr s benn steil found that steel tariffs alone could cause forty thousand american autoworkers to get laid off advocates hope that tariffs will force firms in the tariff wielding country to produce more china has long maintained a high auto tariff leading both domestic and foreign firms to open automotive plants in china as they sought to tap into the world s largest auto market such examples show tariffs don t always hurt domestic production though there is still a drop in overall trade and countries miss out on the economic gains it can bring perhaps most important tariffs often lead to retaliatory tariffs these place the country that first levied tariffs on the other side of the equation and ensure that both its consumers and its export industries will be hit what can countries do to mitigate the effects of tariffs the most common way for countries to fight back against tariffs aside from levying retaliatory tariffs is to subsidize the domestic industries that have been hit the trump administration has countered tariffs on agricultural products by providing farmers with 12 billion in aid to make up for lost exports trump has considered another 20 billion in assistance as wheat and soybean exports continue to shrink many economists have criticized these strategies as counterproductive and wasteful some fear that recipients come to rely on such spending programs making them difficult to end others point out that unilaterally imposing tariffs or retaliatory tariffs could violate wto rules though this has not stopped some countries in recent trade disputes some experts including cfr s brad w setser have suggested that export dependent countries could let their currencies depreciate in the face of tariffs letting the yuan weaken has always been in my view the logical asymmetric chinese response to a trade war setser writes this would effectively cheapen exports and make them competitive despite tariffs but it would also make consumers in that country poorer as the local currency would have less purchasing power another remedy is to find alternative markets for imports and exports trump has encouraged this suggesting that companies facing tariffs on imports from china turn to vietnam many companies greatest fear is that changes in trading patterns from tariffs will become entrenched if tariffs lead trading partners to find new buyers and sellers those new relationships may endure chinese importers for instance have reacted to their own country s retaliatory tariffs on u s soybeans and liquefied natural gas by shifting to buying from brazil and australia this leaves american suppliers unsure whether lowering tariffs would be enough to bring chinese importers back originally published by the council on foreign relations 05 16 2019 under the terms a creative commons

without pension reform progressive income tax amendment guarantees tax hikes on illinois middle class the current progressive income tax proposal would fail to pay down the state s unfunded liability while damaging illinois economy on may 20 democrats in the illinois house revenue finance committee approved gov j b pritzker s prized progressive tax constitutional amendment while the senate had previously passed a new income tax structure already different from the governor s original proposal the house committee also passed the amendment without putting in income tax rates pritzker and other proponents of replacing illinois flat income tax with a progressive tax have claimed the switch would allow the state to fund its skyrocketing pension obligations pay off its bill backlog spend more on education and social services enable property tax relief and more but progressive tax proponents need to face that without pension reform illinois crushing public employee retirement debt will consume every new dollar generated with a progressive tax and will require further tax hikes to fully pay off pension debt as pritzker has advocated illinois could lose up to 95 000 jobs and the economy could suffer up to 18 billion in economic impact were it to try to use a progressive tax to pay off the state s unfunded pension liability within 40 years a new illinois policy institute study shows current progressive tax proposals while pritzker has been campaigning for months on his own proposal the rates and brackets passed out of the senate are different from the governor s pritzker s proposal levied a 7 95 flat rate on the highest income bracket while the plan passed out of the senate features a 7 99 flat rate on the highest income bracket that top bracket also now kicks in at a lower level for single filers 750 000 instead of 1 million the state s corporate income tax rate would also be bumped up to 7 99 from 7 pritzker s plan hiked the corporate income tax to 7 95 of all the things pritzker and other proponents have promised the progressive income tax would do the most significant is addressing the state s pension crisis currently illinois five state run pension systems officially report 137 billion in unfunded liabilities though moody s investors service has estimated the number stands at 232 billion despite the state spending more on pensions each year these unfunded liabilities continue to grow although many independent groups as well as mayors and municipal leaders have called for reforms to illinois unsustainable pension system pritzker has thus far rejected those ideas instead he s called for a graduated income tax and other tax hikes to cover the rising debt while illinois taxpayers might expect the graduated income tax to pay for public services such as education the reality is the state s sky high pension debt ensures any future revenue increase mostly will go to pensions credit ratings agencies have noted the promise of a progressive income tax that pays for pensions but have also pointed out that positive outcome for the state s credit standing would require that the new system yield substantial net new revenue without material damage to the economy and that the new revenue be largely allocated to addressing the state s retirement benefit liabilities on a recurring basis a negative outcome characterized by growing economic challenges and scant progress addressing pension funding needs is also possible thus according to credit rating agencies a progressive income tax would only improve illinois worst in the nation credit rating if it resulted in a huge influx of revenue that goes almost exclusively to pensions it must do so without harming the state s economy this would be a nearly impossible feat can the senate s plan pay for pensions the illinois commission on government forecasting and accountability estimated the state s unfunded liability at 136 8 billion at the end of fiscal year 2019 similar to haasl mattoon and walstrum s 2018 study presented at a pensions forum at the federal reserve bank of chicago the illinois policy institute s analysis assumes that all additional progressive tax revenue revenue above what the current flat income tax would have brought in would go directly to pay for pension debt this exercise assumes the state will be able to accurately predict the normal cost of servicing state pensions they have historically failed to do so leading to further growth in unfunded liabilities if annual income tax revenue growth caused by secular income growth matches the state s recent experience the progressive income tax rates passed by the senate will fail to pay off the state s pension debt ever in order for the senate s current plan to fully pay for pensions the annual increase in tax revenue caused by increases in the tax base would have to remain at 5 35 annual growth nearly 400 higher than the most recent 5 year compound annual growth rate of 1 35 for the senate plan to work the tax base would need to grow at the 5 35 rate for a 54 year period see appendix in a scenario where secular income growth causes income tax revenues to grow at 3 35 annually 250 faster than the recent 1 35 rate it would take the state 151 years to pay down the unfunded pension liability obviously these benefits will have to be paid out before then and avoiding further credit downgrades would require even more resources being diverted to pension debt the haasl mattoon and walstrum study referenced above suggested the state could pay for these costs on a 40 year timeline with a statewide property tax an even more unpopular proposal using the same 40 year timeline and maintaining the same income brackets as the senate s proposal income tax rates would have to be much higher to pay down the state s unfunded pension liability see appendix even using the most generous assumption regarding natural growth in illinois income tax revenue income tax rates would have to be raised on everyone from 8 to 22 higher than the rates in the senate s proposal in order to pay down the unfunded pension liability within the next 40 years see appendix again this assumes every dime of additional revenue goes to pensions and would require much higher tax rates than currently proposed the lower the growth in revenues is the higher income tax rates will have to be in order to pay down the pension debt therefore under the lowest growth assumption tax rates are the highest and bring in the most additional revenue in the first year though the faster growth assumptions eventually generate more revenue effects on the economy moody s second and perhaps most important requirement for a progressive tax that pays for pensions while avoiding a credit downgrade is that the new tax doesn t inflict material damage on the economy unfortunately the tax increase necessary to eliminate the state s pension debt would crush illinois already weak economy when the chicago fed economists suggested a statewide property tax in may of 2018 to pay down pension debt they claimed it would be the most fair efficient and transparent option while property taxes may be one of the most efficient forms of taxation this proposal illustrated the wide gap between main street and academia at the time of the proposal home prices in illinois had yet to recover from their pre recession peak and illinois homes stayed on the market twice as long as the national average and came with some of the highest effective property tax rates in the nation particularly in minority communities yet as painful as a statewide property tax would be a progressive income tax would be even more devastating to the economy income tax increases have a negative effect on investment in human and physical capital research and development purchases of new machinery or other equipment that would otherwise improve labor productivity this results in less income generation and lower living standards for everyone and demonstrates why marginal tax rates should not increase with earning ability diamond and mirrlees 1971 gruber and saez 2002 following a long tradition in the economics literature the illinois policy institute estimated the potential effects of a progressive tax to pay for pensions through the lens of the neoclassical growth model the most widely taught model of capital accumulation and long run growth see appendix the institute s research shows a progressive income tax plan with new revenue solely dedicated to paying down the unfunded pension liability could cost the state up to 95 000 full time jobs even under the best case scenario the tax would still cost 56 000 full time jobs the same goes for other effects of the tax hike on the economy the tax hike could cost the state 14 billion 18 billion worth of economic activity with the lowest cost estimate derived from the smallest tax increase under the most generous growth assumption a better path forward the large income tax collection necessary to pay for illinois state pension debt would not satisfy moody s criteria of avoiding harm to the state s economy it would be even more economically disastrous than a statewide property tax the current proposal by the illinois senate would not produce enough revenue to pay off the state s unfunded liabilities even if all additional revenue were dedicated to pension debt furthermore while a significant income tax hike on everyone could potentially pay down the current pension debt within a reasonable time horizon it would require higher tax rates than the current proposals at a huge cost to the state s economic future plus that would require assuming that the state s estimations of the debts are accurate third party estimates put the unfunded liability at nearly double what the state reports an income tax hike big enough to truly satisfy the debt would wreak havoc on the state s already fragile economy resulting in further deterioration of the state s credit rating instead of doubling down on tax hikes pritzker and state lawmakers should look at structurally reforming illinois pension system through an amendment to the state constitution s pension clause the illinois policy institute shows how necessary commonsense reforms can be achieved in budget solutions 2020 a 5 year plan to balance illinois budget pay off debt and cut taxes an amendment that protects pensioners already earned benefits and allows for slower growth in future benefit accruals would help the state address its debt while protecting public employees retirements it would also protect taxpayers and any hope for the state s economy

author courtney mcnamara menafn the conversation the negotiations were strainedand at times it looked like it would be stillborn but the usmca the new north american free trade agreement linking the economies of the united states mexico and canada was signed in november 2018 and awaits ratification its future is still uncertain although u s president donald trump finallyremoved tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from canada and mexico something both countries and even some congressional republicans were demanding for the deal to be ratified democrats in the u s are unhappy with its costly monopoly protection for new pharmaceuticals and weak enforcement measures for labour and environmental protection but beneath the political jockeying is a sleeper issue concerning public health that signals a bad agreement health impact assessment we undertooka recently released health impact assessment of the usmca focusing on three specific aspects of the agreement with direct or indirect health effects pharmaceuticals health and environmental regulations and labour and environmental protection for prescription drugs the costs of which have risen dramatically since the era of patent protectionin trade agreements the usmca contains provisions the americans wanted in thetrans pacific partnership agreement these provisions were suspended by the remaining countries when trump pulled the u s out of that agreement now they re back in but with an even longer 10 year guaranteed monopoly for biologics a new category of costly drugs used to treat cancers and autoimmune disorders generic equivalents known as biosimilars cancut the price by almost half canada currently offers eight years of market protection for biologics the additional two yearscould eventually add almost 170 million to each year s drug costs hardest hit would be mexico which presently offers no such monopoly rights for biologics the usmca also locks in rules that make it easier for drug companies to evergreen their products through minor changes in their components or in how they re administered extending the years of patent protection and prevent regulators from using for several years the patent drug company s test data when approving generic versions impact on health regulations a more subtle but critical set of changes in the usmca imposes new constraints on the three countries abilities to enact health safety and environmental policies or regulations it is these so calledbehind the border rules in trade and investment agreementsthat have garnered the greatest public health concerns the usmca tries to assuage these concerns by affirming countries inherent right to regulate including to protect public health safety the environment and natural resources but it immediately undercuts this right by specifying that it must be exercised in a manner consistent with this agreement that consistent manner includes provisions that could make it harder for mexico to use existing safeguards under world trade organization rules to ensure domestic food security orto guarantee minimum food prices to reduce rural poverty and support small scale mexican farmers activists wear donald trump masks to protest against the seventh round of the nafta renegotiations mexico city in february 2018 ap photo marco ugarte it requires the three governments to ensure that any new international standards upon which new regulations might be based do not create unnecessary obstacles to international trade suggesting trade issues will trump new health regulations this became an issue even during negotiations whenthe u s wanted the agreement to ban any front of package nutrition labellingthat would warn consumers of unhealthy levels of fat salt or sugar canada and mexico rejected this but the usmca contains several provisions on labelling that could lead to trade disputes should the two other countries choose to adopt new nutrition labels as canada is proposing to do american and canadian trade associations representing meat processors have already argued thatcanada s proposal violates the usmca portending a possible trade challenge if the usmca becomes law foxes guarding the hen house foxes guarding the hen house other rules open the doors for persons of another party in other words primarily u s based corporations to have a seat at the table when canada or mexico decide to consult on new regulations inviting corporations to help determine new regulations is a bit like asking the fox to guard the hen house scott walsh unsplash this runs the risk ofregulatory captureby private vested interests akin to inviting the foxes to guard the hen house unaware that yourcosmetics are not always healthy or safe the usmca would like to keep it that way requiring governments to wait until a problem shows up and fix it later in a similar way usmca provisions require governments to submit detailed scientific evidence and explanation for any newgovernment regulation which is likely to lead to regulatory chill slowing down or preventing the introduction of novel health protection measures this risk is compounded by an entire and enforceable chapter that aims to have the three governments harmonize their regulations to enable freer movement of goods across borders the economic elephant in the usmca is of course the u s whose regulatory rules will likely set the tone for canada and mexico and the trump administrationis keen to undo as many health and environmental regulations as possible there are some less troubling glimmers in the new agreement controversial rules allowing foreign investors to sue governments over regulations that may undermine the value of their investment have been eliminated between the u s and canada apart from a three year window for legacy claims to be made canada fared particularly badly under the old naftawhile the u s never lost a case yet it was the united states that scrapped the rules while canada wanted to keep them so go figure the americans hedged their bets however by retaining the rules to protect u s investors in mexico mandatory mexican minimum wage mandatory mexican minimum wage the usmca also contains provisions that claim to protect labour rights and the environment often used by governments to sell trade deals to skeptical citizens a key labour provision however requires mexico to amend its laws to allow workers to more effectively collectively bargain the countryrecently passedlegislation to satisfy this provision but questions remain over implementation and enforcement strategies a second provision mandates a substantially increased minimum hourly wage in mexico s auto manufacturing sector which could help relieve poverty for mexicans although mexican exporters might opt instead to pay the low tariff the u s would levy if they fail to raise wages and while there s lots of references to labour rights and multilateral environmental agreements in the usmca it s unsurprisingly silent on climate change and theparis climate accord and there are escape clauses provisions only become enforceable if a country lowers its existing level of protection to gain a trade or investment advantage this might prevent a race to the regulatory bottom but it s hardly a reassuring reach for the top in the end we have an agreement that binds governments future regulatory options in return for scant evidence of improved labour or environmental protection or even economic gain the imf for example estimatesa net economic boost across the three countries of us 550 million a year chump change at best the u s international trade office ito with some fanfare begged to differ announcing american gains ofus 62 billion and 176 000 new jobs the rub here is that these numbers rest on a unique modelling assumption reduced policy uncertainty that raised the eyebrows of most conventional trade economists remove this novel assumption and the american study actually shows a net loss in both income and jobs make america great again perhaps not so much as with any trade agreement some economic sectors will be winners and others losers but as far as protecting public health is concerned the usmca is a big step backwards public health free trade regulatory reform nafta prescription drugs trump administration trade deals regulatory capture usmca inviting corporations to help determine new regulations is a bit like asking the fox to guard the hen house scott walsh unsplash activists wear donald trump masks to protest against the seventh

with the uncertainty of the election campaign behind us the future looks a lot clearer for the australian economy the coalition has been returned and that means changes are minimal the new government does not have an elaborate policy agenda that would affect the whole fabric of the australian economy in fact the most salient thing about the government is what it is not doing housing policy will stay exactly as it was that s a negative on changing negative gearing do two negatives make a positive labor had two big policy promises that were designed to affect the housing market it was going to change negative gearing and capital gains tax which was likely to make homes slightly cheaper those changes are now not going to happen this policy stability is likely to be good news for anyone hoping to sell their home it is likely to make house prices slightly higher than they would otherwise have been in the short run as they were probably falling a bit in anticipation of labor winning the flip side of this relative bump in prices would be bad news for anyone hoping to get into the housing market but probably provides a small boost for the economy overall at least in the short run higher house prices are likely to make homeowners feel wealthier they could also tempt more people to sell their house in the second half of the year higher volumes of properties being sold in turn tends to drive expenditure on retail as people buy new furnishings and do repairs what we don t want is a return to the boom times that saw housing debt leaping up to record levels if house prices go back to zooming up at 10 per cent a year and mortgages get bigger and bigger that would leave the country with an even bigger problem in a few years an optimal scenario might be house price stability for a few years with houses getting more affordable gradually as inflation rises whether this happens in reality depends a great deal on the reserve bank rba more on that later the coalition win is expected to cause a bump in house prices but we don t want them to go too high tax cuts in the budget the coalition announced tax cuts of 1080 for middle income earners labor immediately mirrored this policy so it didn t matter who won but this policy it seems will be very important to economic growth economic growth depends on consumption growth and without strong wages growth the only way to get more money into our pockets is tax cuts the rba expects that when we get more money in our pockets it will flow through into household spending they are probably right the only risk here is actually putting the money in our pockets the end of the tax year is june 30 and the tax office can t officially get us our tax cuts unless the law is changed but the government can t change the law until parliament sits for the first time and parliament won t sit before june 30 it is possible that even if parliament doesn t sit before the end of the financial year the government can pull together some sort of retrospective law that gets us all a 1080 payment anyway it seems like the economy will be desperate for some stimulus so we better hope they are able to arrange that the rba while the coalition is promising mostly more of the same substantial changes could come from australia s central bank the rba appears to be promising two big changes first it is hinting at interest rate cuts that could come within weeks that would add further fire to the housing market and also hopefully give the real economy a gentle boost second the rba is now arguing we should have a lower unemployment rate my judgment of the accumulating evidence is that the australian economy can support an unemployment rate of below 5 per cent without raising inflation concerns said the rba governor on tuesday this is especially gratifying since i made this exact argument on these pages a few weeks ago you read it here first the rba is right to adopt this stance five per cent unemployment does not mean what it used to five per cent unemployment used to mean low underemployment too it doesn t mean that anymore so we should no longer happily accept unemployment at 5 per cent an unemployment rate starting with a three is a realistic target the governor of the rba dr philip lowe gives a speech in brisbane today picture darren england aap and what if a global recession comes the trade war between the usa and china is only getting worse the risk of a global economic downturn is real the big question is whether the new government will be able to respond adequately if it happens the coalition has one thing going for it it is unencumbered by big policy commitments so if it all hits the fan internationally they can easily leap to action to save the economy the question remains over whether it would remember kevin rudd s big spending reaction to the gfc it was criticised heavily by the coalition would a coalition government be willing to step in and keep the economy flowing if australians stopped spending in response to a big shock i actually suspect they would it s easy to criticise form opposition but when the hard choices need to be made i expect the government to do what needs to be done they might avoid subsidising roof insulation however that turned out rather controversial last time in fact those 1080 tax cuts mentioned above are actually not entirely different to rudd s 900 cheques the government could just repeat that trick if a global recession threatens the ideal future if the coalition can keep house prices roughly stable and drive unemployment down below 5 per cent they will have done something to earn their reputation as good economic managers but managing the economy is hard things can come at you out of left field cyclones and financial collapses and donald trump and even the best economic data is never as clear as you hope this last election showed the economy remains central to politics it will be central for the next three years too and in three years time we will get the ultimate assessment on how happy australians are with how this government is managing the economy another election originally published as what election results really mean for property market
