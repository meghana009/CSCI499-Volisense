economic and financial crisis forcing him to take actions he had once repudiated he borrowed huge sums from china and saudi arabia ended foreign exchange controls and slapped taxes on numerous goods

austerity measures including salary freezes for civil servants and a 13 percent cut in military expenditures khan pleaded with the nation for patience vowing that stability would return soon already

policymakers around the world are fretting about trade uncertainty and its impact on the global economy for instance christine lagarde the managing director of the international monetary fund overall we estimate that us china tariffs including those implemented last year could reduce global gdp by 0 5 in 2020 this amounts to a loss of about 455 billion larger than the size of south africa s economy lagarde 2019 similarly the world bank s global economic prospects argues that confidence and investment could be markedly impacted by a sudden rise in policy uncertainty triggered for instance by substantial new trade barriers between major economies world bank 2019 in addition the effects are likely to be felt more in the manufacturing sector where global value chains prevail has been hit hard by tariffs and the associated uncertainty on the future of trade relationships says the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd 2019 in its latest economic outlook existing work on trade uncertainty recent developments have inspired efforts to measure trade uncertainty progress so far has been mostly made in measuring trade uncertainty in the us the us trade policy uncertainty index of baker et al 2016 and for the global economy as a whole for instance hlatshwayo 2018 has constructed an index of trade protectionism uncertainty focusing on the public s attention to trade uncertainty and risks by aggregating references to trade protectionism in newspapers for 44 countries from 2003 onwards the blackrock investment institute has constructed a global index of trade tensions that focuses on the market s attention to trade risk this aggregate index is from 2005 onwards and is constructed using thomson reuters broker report the dow jones global newswire and twitter a new measure of trade uncertainty we have constructed the world trade uncertainty wtu index it uses economist intelligence unit eiu country reports to measure uncertainty related to trade for each of 143 countries on a quarterly basis from 1996 onwards to the best of our knowledge this is the first effort to construct a panel of trade uncertainty index for a large set of developed and developing countries the index captures uncertainty related to trade for example uncertainty over the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement or market uncertainty over future trade policy will weigh on investor sentiment we construct the wtu index by counting the number of times uncertainty is mentioned in proximity to a word related to trade in the eiu country reports specifically for each country and quarter we search through the eiu country reports for the words uncertain uncertainty and uncertainties that are near the following words protectionism north american free trade agreement nafta tariff trade united nations conference on trade and development unctad and world trade organisation wto world trade uncertainty is rising sharply globally the wtu index is

agreement nafta tariff trade united nations conference on trade and development unctad and world trade organization wto in eiu country reports the wui is then normalised by total number of words and rescaled by multiplying by 100 000 a higher number means higher trade uncertainty and vice versa in the figure the source for the data on key dates in the us china trade negotiations is bown and kolb 2019 text in blue indicates the tariff measure taken and text in black is for the narrative of the world trade uncertainty index the recent spikes in the wtu index broadly agree with previous measures of trade uncertainty the index spiked around the third quarter of 2018 coinciding with a series of tariff increases by the us and china the us tariffs on 34 billion of chinese imports and the china s tariffs on 34 billion of us imports the index dropped in the fourth quarter of 2018 as us and chinese officials announced a deal to halt the escalating of tariffs at the g20 meeting in buenos aires on 1 december it spiked again in the first quarter of 2019 following the tariff increase on 200 billion of imports from china scheduled to go into effect on 1 march while spikes in trade uncertainty relate mostly to us china trade tensions increases in trade uncertainty have been also felt in key us trading partners such as mexico canada the european union and japan figure 2 figure 2 country

total number of words and rescaled by multiplying by 100 000 a higher number means higher trade uncertainty and vice versa and it is contributing to the recent rise in overall uncertainty the latest reading of the wui data shows a sharp increase in global uncertainty in the second quarter of 2019 figure 3 while the latest spike is the result of uncertainty over brexit and us trade policy trade uncertainty explains more than 70 of the increase in uncertainty since the first quarter of 2018 figure 3 world uncertainty index 1996q1 to 2019q2 gdp weighted average note the wui is computed by counting the frequency of uncertain or the variant in economist intelligence unit country reports the wui is then normalised by total number of words and rescaled by multiplying by 1 000 the wui is then normalised by total number of words rescaled by multiplying by 1 000 and using the average of 1996q1 to 2010q4 such that 1996q1 2010q4 100 a higher number means higher uncertainty and vice versa uncertainty comes at a cost we find that increases in uncertainty foreshadow significant output declines based on our estimates the increase in trade uncertainty observed in the first quarter could be enough to reduce global growth by up to 0 75 percentage points in 2019 this result corroborates recent evidence on the negative effect of trade uncertainty ebeke and siminitz 2018 find that the investment to gdp ratio is on average 0 8 percentage points lower for five quarters following a one standard deviation increase in the level of trade uncertainty handley and limão 2017 conclude that increases in global trade policy uncertainty could have long term negative impacts on trade and investment until confidence in the world trading system to deliver stable trade policy is restored the

authored by jack rasmus via counterpunch org this past weekend june 29 2019 trump and china president xi met again at the g20 in japan in the midst of a potential further escalating trade war but the outcome looks eerily similar to that of the prior g20 meeting in buenos aires on december 2 2018 when trump and xi also met once more the same post g20 spin is in i e trump declares publicly he has such a great relationship with xi there s a great trade deal soon forthcoming between the two countries us and china trade teams will now begin to thrash out the details on the remaining 10 or so of us china trade differences in the interim once again trump announced he will withhold imposing more tariffs this time on an additional 325 billion of china imports to the us in other words coming out of the latest g20 it s almost an exact déjà vu all over again to the outcome which occurred at last december 2 2018 s g20 meeting between trump and xi in buenos aires will it be different this time will there by an agreement or will trump once again just be buying time i e until just before the 2020 elections until he sees china s economy softening further and he raises us demands further again or maybe trump and his neocon trade advisers lighthizer navarro bolton who are now driving us trade and most of us foreign policy don t want to compromise and will accept nothing less than china s capitulation on the nextgen technology issue that was at the core of the blow up of negotiations in may 2019 it s probably becoming increasingly clear to the chinese that the us did not just launch a tariff war back in march 2018 us policy is driving toward a bonafide economic war between the us and china longer term in the nearer term the current differences may well transform the tariff war into a currency war that will spread contagion and reverberate globally across other economies at a time at which the global capitalist economy is slowing fast and approaching as well a new financial instability all china has to do is allow its currency the yuan renminbi to devalue naturally in response to us policy and the slowing global economy that devaluation would more than offset us tariffs thus far china has intervened in global money exchange markets to prevent this but all it needs to do is allow it to occur according to prevailing economic and market forces and just not intervene in global money markets further to prop up the yuan that will become inevitable as the china us and global economy weaken further in coming months china doesn t have to manipulate its currency it only has to allow global market forces unleased in large part by trump policies to naturally devalue the yuan then there s china s 1 3 trillion of us assets mostly us treasuries it could slow its purchase of new us government debt which it appears it may now be doing should the tariff currency war intensify if necessary it could stop or even sell off its dollar hoard of us treasuries it s been moving toward that since september 2018 as its purchases of us securities first slowed and then declined in march 2019 that reduction of purchases if not offset by other economies buying more would drive up long term interest rates in the us and in turn the value of the us dollar still more all of which further slows global growth rising us rates and the dollar will likely precipitate another us stock and junk bond sell off similar to that which occurred late 2018 and we know trump doesn t like stock market declines there are numerous other actions the chinese could take in response to us neocons intensifying or prolonging the us china tariff trade war further driving the differences into a broader economic war various bureaucratic obstacles to us corporations majority ownership of operations in china buy china not america in china movements restrictions on the sale of what s called rare earths minerals key to technology and military production would likely be imposed even if us neocons don t understand this or don t care widespread business and banking interests do and could intervene more forcefully should trump s drift toward economic war continue economic slowdown recession wild card and there s a wild card in the trade war deck that may check the neocons influence perhaps that s the current softening of the us and china economies that could force both sides to an agreement trump may grab the major concessions on china purchases and us majority ownership rights in china and announce a big victory just before the 2020 us elections china s economy is clearly slowing growing likely no more than 4 5 not the official 6 5 but so too is the us economy as well which will start to become more obvious once the data for the 2nd quarter us gdp start to come in by late july we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the us 1st quarter gdp numbers were propped up by temporary factors associated with inventory over investment and net exports both of which are fading rapidly this quarter moreover us household consumer spending is barely growing most recently at less than 1 the housing sector has slowed for the past 17 months manufacturing orders and production is now stagnant and business investment has turned negative lagging indicators like jobs are now beginning to turn down as well the us central bank s lowering of interest rates in the second half of 2019 which is helping to drive the massive 1 5 trillion in stock buybacks and dividend payouts scheduled for this year may succeed in putting a temporary floor under stock markets but the real side of the us economy is being driven to slowdown or even worse by year end more bank research departments big finance capitalists and even some economists a notorious conservative and timid forecasting lot have begun to predict recession by year end 2019 a more rapidly slowing us economy now clearly beginning may thus change the trade negotiations dynamic forcing both sides to some kind of a deal and if the us slips into recession by winter 2019 20 which this writer has also been predicting the past year the pressure to cut a deal will grow trump may yet be convinced to take the china concessions already on the table and temporarily suspend the us demand for china s capitulation on the technology issue trump could yet take what s been offered by china i e to buy 1 trillion more us farm goods and allow us corporations majority ownership of operations in china and declare a major victory in the trade negotiations in 2020 just before the elections the nextgen tech military confrontation the real core of the us china dispute could be re raised and revisited thereafter later that s one possible scenario because for trump a deal is never a deal it s never concluded but subject to reopening whenever he so chooses breaking an agreement is standard practice for trump just ask the mexicans where trump recently threatened to levy 25 more tariffs even after us concluding a new nafta 2 0 deal last year or ask the iranians who thought they had an agreement with the us or the europeans who thought they had a climate deal for trump negotiations are a continuing process punctuated by happy talk events stroking foreign leaders followed by more threats of sanctions and personal insults and intimidations to force a reopening of deals once thought concluded by trading partners allied and challengers alike in other words even if a china us trade deal is done perhaps next year the trade war with china will not be over it will have just begun as it evolves toward a broader economic war after the 2020 elections perhaps even before the key to a china trade deal occurring sooner rather than later is whether trump and us big bankers and multinational capitalists can convince the neocons and the military industrial complex to agree to a short term deal with china now that provides only token nextgen technology concessions backed by the trump neocon assurance that the us will reopen and resume the technology offensive after the 2020 elections once again for the us economic and political elites are in basic agreement with the neocons behind the trump daily circus on the nextgen technology issue neither will allow china to challenge us global hegemony next decade by leveraging nextgen technologies that are the key to both economic and military hegemony it s just a question of timing by the us elites trump neocons take two bites of the bargaining apple from the chinese and come back later for the big bite i e the fight over nextgen technology either that or trump and the neocons will continue to insist on three bites all at once this writer s guess and prediction is that the now slowing us and global economy will result in the former and the us will reopen any deal reached and renew its technology demands after the 2020 elections for the current tariff trade war is just the opening salvo in an epic struggle between the us and china the technology war has already begun albeit in early stages the trump trade war today is just the opening move today to a more fundamental technology war tomorrow historical precedents just as european and american imperialists jockeyed and maneuvered in the years leading up to 1914 and the first world war with their focus on disputes over markets and global natural resource control in the 21st century the jockeying and maneuvering has similarly begun albeit this time with a different focus on nextgen technologies over who controls global money flows whose currency will continue to dominant over who calls the shots in global institutions like the imf world bank wto and so on the 2020s decade ahead will prove a highly dangerous period the global capitalist economy is slowing as has always done periodically a new restructuring of global capitalism is on the agenda as it was in the late 1970s in the mid 1940s and during the years immediately leading up to 1914 trump s trade wars and other policies should be understood as part of a broad reordering of us economic and political policies and relations with other nation states allied and adversary alike to ensure the continuation of us global economic and military hegemony for the coming decade nextgen technology development is at the core of that restructuring and restoration of us hegemony trump is just the appearance the historic vehicle behind the deeper global capitalist transformation in progress

business reporter the international monetary fund imf says the latest reforms announced by both the ministry of finance and economic development through si 142 of 2019 and the reserve bank of zimbabwe through exchange control directive ru102 2019 are welcome as they seek to address economic distortions that have impaired macroeconomic stability last week government introduced a raft of changes that saw the country finally abandoning the multicurrency regime that had been in place since 2009 through si 142 of 2019 government outlawed the use of any foreign currency in local transactions but still allowed the buying and selling of foreign currency on a willing buyer willing seller basis the zimbabwe dollar shall with effect from june 24 2019 be the sole legal tender in zimbabwe in all transactions reads si 142 the british pound united states dollar south african rand botswana pula and any other foreign currency whatsoever shall no longer be legal tender alongside the zimbabwe dollar in any transactions in zimbabwe commenting on the changes minister of finance and economic development professor mthuli ncube said what was happening in the market was that the market was self us dollarising it was uncontrollable and we felt that we needed to bring the situation under control quite clearly it became an untenable situation and it became necessary for government to move a lot faster and introduce a mono currency regime in favour of a domestic currency this marks the end of the multi currency he said the latest measures the imf says are welcome we welcome the reforms announced in the february 20 monetary policy statement and june 24 press release which seek to address economic distortions that have impaired macroeconomic stability imf representative to zimbabwe mr patrick imam told business weekly in an interview as part of monetary policy measures the rbz adjusted the interest rate on the reserve bank overnight window upwards from 15 percent per annum to 50 percent per annum in line with inflation trends it also removed administrative limits on the operation of bureaux de change and on the cap on margins for banks for interbank foreign exchange transactions to increase supply of foreign currency into interbank foreign market the rbz said it will ensure that at least 50 percent of the surrender portion of foreign currency is sold to the interbank market such moves were supported by mr imam who said hiking interest rates to 50 percent removing administrative limits on the bureau de change and relaxing the surrender requirements in a bid to stabilise the exchange rate are welcomed mr imam however said more needed to be done we encourage the authorities to continue ongoing efforts to implement a coherent monetary policy framework to pursue policies that preserve financial stability and ensure the orderly operation of payment systems and stop monetary financing of fiscal deficits to stabilise inflation and the exchange rate he said as part of this effort more transparency in monthly data statistics on the execution of the budget but especially on the evolution of money and credit will be important imam reiterated his earlier assertions that economic policies under the transitional stabilisation programme tsp if fully implemented under the watch of the imf s staff monitored programme are comprehensive enough to deal with the country s macroeconomic imbalances the economic policies of the new administration under the tsp constitute a comprehensive stabilisation and structural reform programme to address zimbabwe s deep macroeconomic imbalances a staff monitored programme smp that can support the authorities reform efforts has been approved by our management to cover the period may 15 2019 to march 15 2020 said mr imam the economic policies under the smp are anchored on the tsp and the smp is expected to help the authorities establish a track record of policy implementation in turn this will support efforts to re engage with the international community and move towards a comprehensive normalisation of relations with creditors he added that so far in 2019 the authorities policies appropriately focus on reducing the fiscal deficit to restore public debt sustainability whilst protecting investment in infrastructure and priority social spending including reconstruction and humanitarian support to respond to the drought and cyclone idai the reform programme also stopped the monetary accommodation of the fiscal deficit to stabilise inflation and the exchange rate at the same time the authorities are implementing foreign exchange reforms to maintain financial stability and improve the functioning of the market
performance under the ecf supported program has been broadly satisfactory reflecting strong commitment by the authorities despite a challenging environment washington d c united states of america july 4 2019 apo group performance under the ecf supported program has been broadly satisfactory with continued improvement in the fiscal position and progress in implementing structural reforms in spite recent delays overall economic activity strengthened in 2018 but further reform efforts are needed to support the recovery in the non oil sector and improve social conditions chad s program is supported by the implementation of policies and reforms by the regional institutions which are critical to its success on july 3 2019 the executive board of the international monetary fund imf completed the fourth review of chad s economic and financial program supported by an extended credit facility ecf arrangement completion of the review enables the disbursement of sdr 28 04 million about us 38 9 million bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to sdr 168 24 million about us 233 1 million chad s ecf arrangement was originally approved by the executive board on june 30 2017 see press release no 17 257 for sdr 224 32 million about us 310 8 million or 160 percent of chad s quota the ecf supported program aims to help chad restore macroeconomic stability lay the foundation for robust and inclusive growth and contribute to the regional effort to restore and preserve external stability for the central african economic and monetary union cemac following the executive board discussion on chad mr mitsuhiro furusawa deputy managing director and acting chair made the following statement performance under the ecf supported program has been broadly satisfactory reflecting strong commitment by the authorities despite a challenging environment including security concerns and a difficult social situation all end december 2018 performance criteria and most end march indicative targets were met progress is underway on the structural reform agenda despite some delays moving forward it is essential that efforts continue to create fiscal space for increased social spending and public investment and to reduce domestic debt and clear arrears key actions in this regard include continued fiscal prudence increasing domestic revenue mobilization particularly by reducing exemptions and strengthening public financial management pursuing these policies accompanied by continued structural reform implementation will help further stabilize the fiscal position energize non oil growth and reduce banking sector vulnerabilities chad s program is supported by the implementation of supportive policies and reforms by the regional institutions in the areas of foreign exchange regulations and monetary policy framework and to support an increase in regional net foreign assets which are critical to the program s success the executive board also concluded the 2019 article iv consultation with chad chad is a low income fragile country that depends heavily on oil revenues in recent years it has been heavily impacted by an oil price shock and security tensions which intensified recently significant progress has been made under the 2017 ecf arrangement to help restore debt sustainability and fiscal stability however the economic financial and social situation is still very difficult and the recovery in the non oil economy has not taken strong hold as the economy continues to deal with legacies from the crisis and long standing structural weaknesses executive board assessment executive directors commended the authorities continued commitment to the reform program supported by the imf despite a challenging environment marked by fragility and significant development challenges notwithstanding the broadly favorable outlook directors noted the significant downside risks including from the deterioration in the security situation and large drops in oil prices in this context they underscored the need to maintain fiscal discipline while implementing reforms to address long standing structural impediments to non oil activity and achieve higher and more inclusive growth directors commended the authorities for maintaining prudent fiscal policy however in light of high risk of debt distress they emphasized the importance of increasing non oil revenue including by reducing costly exemptions and improving vat collection and maintaining spending discipline this would help to ensure debt sustainability and create space for the much needed social and infrastructure spending to reduce vulnerability to oil price fluctuations directors encouraged the authorities to consider a simple price smoothing mechanism they noted that strengthening public financial management and clearance of domestic arrears also needs to remain a priority directors noted that vulnerabilities in the financial sector remain elevated reflecting the tight sovereign bank nexus they encouraged curtailing the public banks financing of the budget reducing the high levels of non performing loans and improving banking sector liquidity directors encouraged the authorities to accelerate the pace of structural reforms to promote private sector development diversify the economy and boost competitiveness they emphasized the need for efforts to improve the business climate enhance the fight against corruption strengthen public financial management and deepen financial inclusion directors noted that these efforts should be supported by well targeted and coordinated capacity development activities taking into account the authorities absorptive capacity to ensure the effectiveness of the provided technical assistance many directors supported the authorities call for long term resident experts directors noted that chad s program continues to be supported by the implementation of policies and reforms by the regional institutions which are critical to the program s success these comprise the policy assurances provided in the december 2018 letter of policy support which were implemented as planned and the assurance on nfa accumulation in 2019 presented in the updated letter of june 2019 and discussed in the june 2019 union wide staff report completion of the fifth review will be conditional on the

spread the love as the country faces economic meltdown the government has again imposed policy without any legislative underpinning on 24 june familiar feelings of despair accompanied the shock announcement by finance minister mthuli ncube that only zimbabwe s quasi currency the rtgs dollar would constitute legal tender this prelude to the resurrection of the dreaded zimbabwe dollar added to the sense of déjà vu brought on by long queues for fuel inflation over 100 18 hour load shedding and failed water reticulation the rtgs dollar from the real time gross settlement system used to transfer money electronically exists only in electronic form in theory and government pronouncements rtgs dollars were merely the electronic representation of united states dollars held in depositors accounts however after 2016 when government began paying its debts by entering billions of dollars of credit on to the books of banks unsupported by anything it became apparent that the rtgs dollar wasn t what it was held out to be its value steadily declined in february this year government finally abandoned the fiction that rtgs dollars were us dollars real us dollars were ring fenced in depositors nostro accounts and rtgs dollars held under a second separate account this measure was accompanied by another where government claimed that the exchange rate between us dollar and rtgs dollars would be allowed to float and be determined by interbank trading another lie in practice government tightly controlled the rate of exchange so that the interbank rate for us dollars was generally half that offered by the black market as a result opportunities for arbitrage by the political and business elite abounded they could procure us dollars from the central bank at the interbank rate and sell them on the black market for twice the amount raking in millions business could also borrow rtgs money from banks immediately exchanging it for us dollars on the black market driving the demand for us dollars up and the value of rtgs dollars down once the value of rtgs money had declined significantly only a fraction of the us dollars acquired needed to be changed back to repay the rtgs debt to the bank representing millions of dollars of profit nice work if you can get it not however very nice for workers civil servants and the lower ranks of the military being paid in rtgs dollars the real value of their wages plummeted when the rtgs dollar was set as sole legal tender on 24 june its value to the us dollar had fallen from about 1 4 1 in february to over 13 5 1 and was set to drop further in an accelerated fall services and goods particularly imported products were being charged or priced in us dollars the economy was re dollarising and civil servants were demanding that they be paid in us dollars ncube introduced statutory instrument 142 setting rtgs money as sole legal tender in the midst of negotiations around wages with civil servants this was done to undermine the argument that since goods and services were being charged in us dollars civil servants should be paid in this currency it was also an attempt to stop the rapid depreciation of rtgs money to strengthen the rtgs dollar the reserve bank mopped up rtgs liquidity from banks returning 1 2 billion of the faux currency to the ether from whence it came hidden in the turmoil that has followed are two other replays of prior events one is that just as government had tried to defy the market and legislate price controls in the days of record breaking hyperinflation in 2008 it is now trying to legislate that the incoming tide of re dollarisation stay out the second is more pernicious it is the sight of zimbabweans again rushing to the cliff edge like lemmings on the basis of government fiat as occurred with government s now defunct indigenisation laws introduced in 2010 then robert mugabe s government issued regulations that it said required all foreign owned business in zimbabwe to surrender 51 of their shares to indigenous zimbabweans in fact the law did not and could not provide anything of the sort companies do not own their shares shareholders do the government s claim as to the meaning of its regulations was never challenged not by the media as it made a good blood on the floor story and not by affected businesses who knew that government could make life difficult by withholding licences required to do business in zimbabwe fast forward to 2019 government says statutory instrument 142 criminalises transactions in us dollars the police have been unleashed to prowl around petrol stations and retail outlets ready to arrest any hapless person using us dollars in fact si 142 doesn t ban the use of us dollars for trade it simply sets rtgs dollars as the sole legal tender if someone decides to dispose of their car in exchange for 10 goats there is no law preventing him or her from doing so even though goats don t constitute legal tender substitute us dollars for goats and the point is clear countries that wish to ban transactions in anything other than the local currency enact laws providing that so why didn t zimbabwe s finance minister do that because he has no power under the reserve bank act to prohibit us dollar transactions however as in the case of the indigenisation regulations the media happily accepts his interpretation of his own regulations once again government is imposing policy without any legislative underpinning and using extra legal means to do so enforcing the whims of particular ministers on the threat of arrest rather than applying statute is the very antithesis of the rule of law it reveals a government floundering in policy and governance uncertainty and inconsistency in the face of an economic meltdown president emmerson mnangagwa repeatedly says zimbabwe s door is open to foreign investors any company stepping through this door in such a climate will have difficult questions to

followed are two other replays of prior events one is that just as government had tried to defy the market and legislate price controls in the days of record breaking hyperinflation in 2008 it is now trying to legislate that the incoming tide of re dollarisation stay out the second is more pernicious it is the sight of zimbabweans again rushing to the cliff edge like lemmings on the basis of government fiat as occurred with government s now defunct indigenisation laws introduced in 2010 then robert mugabe s government issued regulations that it said required all foreign owned business in zimbabwe to surrender 51 of their shares to indigenous zimbabweans in fact the law did not and could not provide anything of the sort companies do not own their shares shareholders do the government s claim as to the meaning of its regulations was never challenged not by the media as it made a good blood on the floor story and not by affected businesses who knew that government could make life difficult by withholding licences required to do business in zimbabwe fast forward to 2019 government says statutory instrument 142 criminalises transactions in us dollars the police have been unleashed to prowl around petrol stations and retail outlets ready to arrest any hapless person using us dollars in fact si 142 doesn t ban the use of us dollars for trade it simply sets rtgs dollars as the sole legal tender if someone decides to dispose of their car in exchange for 10 goats there is no law preventing him or her from doing so even though goats don t constitute legal tender substitute us dollars for goats and the point is clear countries that wish to ban transactions in anything other than the local currency enact laws providing that so why didn t zimbabwe s finance minister do that because he has no power under the reserve bank act to prohibit us dollar transactions however as in the case of the indigenisation regulations the media happily accepts his interpretation of his own regulations once again government is imposing policy without any legislative underpinning and using extra legal means to do so enforcing the whims of particular ministers on the threat of arrest rather than applying statute is the very antithesis of the rule of law it reveals a government floundering in policy and governance uncertainty and inconsistency in the face of an economic meltdown president emmerson mnangagwa repeatedly says zimbabwe s door is open to foreign investors any company stepping through this door in such a climate will have difficult questions to answer from shareholders dm derek matyszak is a senior research consultant iss pretoria
in addition more than 75 percent of the direct aid loans provided in recent years have come from two state run financial institutions the export import bank of china and the china development bank that means that the government is constantly informed of every phase of their aid projects and when crisis befalls creditor countries china is well positioned to grab its collateral ahead of other creditors the study notes that china has developed a new form of development aid in which state loans are provided at commercial terms that can result in ugly conflicts when projects fail to proceed as planned in sri lanka for example china took control of a port after the government ran into difficulties servicing its debt in ecuador beijing secured 80 percent of the country s oil revenues to compensate for the costs associated with an enormous dam project in zambia which owes china an estimated 6 billion regime critics are concerned that beijing will take over the state energy supplier zesco
friday june 28 2019 statement by prime minister of antigua and barbuda and chairman of the oecs honourable gaston browne at the 13th annual conference and annual general meeting of the caribbean association of audit committee members on thursday june 27th 2019 at the royalton hotel and spa antigua and barbuda i thank the organisers of this conference for the honour of addressing the annual general meeting of the caribbean association of audit committee members you meet at a time when the financial services sector of our region is under assault by forces in the external community disguised as concerns over profit erosion tax havens money laundering and counter terrorism financing the objectives of these external agencies appear to be designed to cripple competition in the financial services sector having dominated the sector until the mid 1980s financial centres in developed countries found that newcomers to the sector particularly in the off shore sector were becoming highly competitive lower tax rates and efficient and lower cost services for a range of products from jurisdictions in the caribbean led the european union eu through the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd launching its harmful tax competition initiative in effect that initiative was designed to try to stop competition in financial services by coercing smaller jurisdictions to adopt tax rates that approximated the higher rates in europe regrettably smaller jurisdictions did not coalesce to resist this imposition on their sovereign rights by a body that had no international authority to do so instead some jurisdictions individually acquiesced to oecd and eu pressure fracturing any attempt at unified resistance acquiescence of sovereign rights is a slippery slope once the slide begins the fall is difficult to stop and almost impossible to reverse over the years the eu and oecd s assault on the caribbean s offshore financial sector crept into the onshore sector engulfing all in their increasing demands to push our jurisdictions out of the business of providing international financial services now we have come to the point where in march of this year the european union black listed countries that they claim do not meet tax good governance five caribbean countries were on that list barbados belize bermuda dominica and trinidad and tobago others were placed on a monitoring list because we have made commitments to implement changes in our legislative and enforcement regimes by december of this year those jurisdictions are antigua and barbuda the bahamas st kitts and nevis saint lucia anguilla the british virgin islands and the cayman islands as a group caricom countries have expressed concern that the new listing by the eu council constitutes an infringement of our sovereign right of self determination we have said that it is starting to border on anti competitive conduct targeting the decimation of international business and the financial services sector in the caribbean caricom has said collectively that we believe the eu council is trying to destroy the financial sector in our member states even as we try to develop resilience in our economies to mitigate our inherent vulnerabilities of small size limited resources and exposure to natural disasters but we live in a world of intolerance for the development aspirations of the small and of increasing imposition of the doctrine that might is right of course we could collectively take the eu to the world trade organization on the basis that its actions are a restraint on our ability to trade it is not an option that we should take off the table we should not take it off the table because it appears that no matter how much our jurisdictions adopt draconian laws and pay for expensive enforcement machinery new and more intrusive demands are made we have wounded our financial services sector by a thousand cuts already is it that the only time that external forces will be satisfied is when our financial services sector is dead and buried i say we cannot allow that to happen i say we have a right to compete in the global marketplace on a level playing field with all i say that the interests of our economies and of our people are as important and vital as anyone else s and we should fight for them against injustice and imposition ladies and gentlemen you are all aware of the serious threat posed to the economies of our countries and the well being of our people from de risking and the loss of correspondent banking relationships cbrs without cbrs the global financial and trading system would come to a halt and affected countries will drop into poverty from which recovery will be costly both in time and money but more importantly in human life this grave threat has been hanging over the caribbean now for almost half a decade and it shows no sign of abating right now in many parts of the region the majority of banks are reduced to only one correspondent bank and at an extremely high cost consequently the cost of doing business is escalating even as we try to cope with high debt incurred largely to recover our countries from disasters but since 1966 the united nations has recognised and codified in international law the right of people to pursue their economic development as a fundamental human right in this connection deprivation of cbrs to our countries is deprivation of a fundamental human right it is about the right to survive and to prosper and not to wash up on the shores of the rich begging for a living if not for life itself as the recently appointed chair of the heads of government of the oecs i have made it clear that under my watch there will be an organised and vigorous promotion to identify cbrs for re engagement re assessment and re risking of our financial institutions we are ready to work with the caribbean association of banks our central bank and international banking authorities to promote agreed strategies that will demonstrate that our jurisdictions are compliant with the various requirements of all the external agencies we will also comply with the financial action task force s aml cft guidelines to ensure that we are not included in any black or grey lists but where those lists are unreasonable and unfair we will publicly and openly voice our concerns we will not silently fade away allowing our countries to wither and our people to suffer ladies and gentlemen some of our caribbean jurisdictions have been improperly labelled as tax havens a haven implies that our banks hold profits and large deposit for multi national corporations and high net worth individuals but the truth is revealed in our reported bank deposit balances that are reviewed annually by professional third party firms these balances tell a very different story and show that we are no tax havens in the case of antigua and barbuda for instance the audited and reported balances recorded by the eccb for domestic banks and the financial service authority fsrc for international banks are less than us 4 billion us 4 billion in a world economy of hundreds of trillions of us dollars is far too minuscule to possibly qualify as a tax haven audit committees of banks represented in this room are aware that the us international narcotics control strategy report incsr perennially describes every single country in the caribbean without exception as a major money launderer the us statute defines a major money laundering country as one whose financial institutions engage in currency transactions involving significant amounts of proceeds from international narcotics trafficking well the caribbean audit committees of the region s banking sector as the internal watchdogs over money laundering risks can attest that no significant proceeds from international narcotics trafficking passes through our banks all international transactions are traceable by person business bank account and bank and each of them is vetted by our banks as senders and receivers therefore we are left bewildered over how our jurisdictions are placed in this category of high risk i should point out that this particular us report is not a blacklist of jurisdictions nor are there sanctions associated with it but it does unfairly create concerns among us banks that as a result have been withdrawing correspondent banking relationships in this regard antigua and barbuda s diplomatic representatives in washington have been in the forefront of efforts to review the sources process and conclusions of the reports this year some success was achieved and the report was modified encouraged by this progress we will continue to urge the us to recognise that the total amount of money transacted by all our banks is far too small to warrant the labelling as major money launderers and they should stop it the reputational damage to our banks has frightened us banks and caused them to shy away from providing correspondent banking relationships this situation is both unfair and unwarranted and threatens to un bank our countries and plunge our economies into decline on a related matter some of the people in this room are bankers from antigua and barbuda and other sister oecs countries that offer economic citizenship to qualified applicants they will be aware of the increasing challenges being posed to our citizenship by investment programmes cip which have quite literally saved our economies from decline in the face of poor terms of trade repeated natural disasters diminished aid and high costs of imports the cip is not unique to the caribbean it competes with similar programmes in europe and north america perhaps that is a reason why like financial services it is under assault by external forces but cips involve greater and stronger due diligence on their transactions than apply to others certainly cips prevent money laundering since funds received by the government for approved applicants are non refundable nonetheless some correspondent banks have shy ed away from transactions related to cips in this regard i urge caribbean banks involved in this service to demonstrate to their correspondent banks the extreme care and due diligence used in managing the cip product by clear policies and procedures they should demonstrate why cips do not pose a risk to the integrity of correspondent banking relationships i will go further in my capacity as the chair of the heads of government of the oecs i undertake if necessary to assemble a team of government officials cip executives aml cft experts and our banks to hold joint meetings with correspondent banks to sensitise them on the integrity and security of the cip application and approval process the cip programmes are too important to our economies and to the welfare of all including the banking sector for us not to run the extra mile that might be necessary to disabuse misconceptions and to build up confidence in them ladies and gentlemen financial institutions have a pivotal role to play in the financial growth of national economies strong financial institutions are identified by strong financial auditing and reporting good reporting will attract confidence in the institution which will then attract local and foreign direct investments that will grow the national economy national prosperity is a circle that requires the good health of our financial institutions the global financial world is evolving and our banking sectors will need to participate actively to remain competitive our banks need to be nimble flexible and well advised by their audit committees to safely meet the challenges and to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the advance of digital banking services in the oecs i commend governor timothy antoine and his team at the eastern caribbean central bank for exploring the issuance of a high security digital ec currency to operate alongside physical ec cash this development could accelerate real time processing and settlements that would benefit businesses and individuals saving time and improving efficiency ladies and gentlemen the strength of our banking sector has a greater role to play now in the prospects of our small economies than at any other previous time banks have to place themselves in a position in which they can not only satisfy local regulation they must also be able to withstand international scrutiny that is the only way they will overcome the fears related to securing correspondent banking relations that are so vital to them and to the economies in which they function but within that framework banks must also innovate and contribute to new initiatives that could make our caribbean region stronger for sound investment and sustainable development in all this audit committees have a vital role to ensure that boards of banks are well advised that the integrity of the institutions is safeguarded and that the deposits of clients are protected i know that auditing committees of banks more than any others are very mindful of the warning of warren buffet that banking is very good business if you don t do anything dumb i am confident our banks will be better for your scrutiny your diligence and your sound advice thank you
on 24 june familiar feelings of despair accompanied the shock announcement by finance minister mthuli ncube that only zimbabwe s quasi currency the rtgs dollar would constitute legal tender this prelude to the resurrection of the dreaded zimbabwe dollar added to the sense of déjà vu brought on by long queues for fuel inflation over 100 18 hour load shedding and failed water reticulation the rtgs dollar from the real time gross settlement system used to transfer money electronically exists only in electronic form in theory and government pronouncements rtgs dollars were merely the electronic representation of united states dollars held in depositors accounts advertisement however after 2016 when government began paying its debts by entering billions of dollars of credit onto the books of banks unsupported by anything it became apparent that the rtgs dollar wasn t what it was held out to be its value steadily declined the rtgs dollar was set as sole legal tender in the midst of wage negotiations with civil servants advertisement in february this year government finally abandoned the fiction that rtgs dollars were us dollars real us dollars were ring fenced in depositors nostro accounts and rtgs dollars held under a second separate account this measure was accompanied by another where government claimed that the exchange rate between us dollar and rtgs dollars would be allowed to float and be determined by interbank trading another lie in practice government tightly controlled the rate of exchange so that the interbank rate for us dollars was generally half that offered by the black market as a result opportunities for arbitrage by the political and business elite abounded they could procure us dollars from the central bank at the interbank rate and sell them on the black market for twice the amount raking in millions business could also borrow rtgs money from banks immediately exchanging it for us dollars on the black market driving the demand for us dollars up and the value of rtgs dollars down once the value of rtgs money had declined significantly only a fraction of the us dollars acquired needed to be changed back to repay the rtgs debt to the bank representing millions of dollars of profit nice work if you can get it not however very nice for workers civil servants and the lower ranks of the military being paid in rtgs dollars the real value of their wages plummeted when the rtgs dollar was set as sole legal tender on 24 june its value to the us dollar had fallen from about 1 4 1 in february to over 13 5 1 and was set to drop further in an accelerated fall contrary to what zimbabwe s government says the use of us dollars for trade isn t banned in law services and goods particularly imported products were being charged or priced in us dollars the economy was re dollarising and civil servants were demanding that they be paid in us dollars ncube introduced statutory instrument 142 setting rtgs money as sole legal tender in the midst of negotiations around wages with civil servants this was done to undermine the argument that since goods and services were being charged in us dollars civil servants should be paid in this currency it was also an attempt to stop the rapid depreciation of rtgs money to strengthen the rtgs dollar the reserve bank mopped up rtgs liquidity from banks returning 1 2 billion of the faux currency to the ether from whence it came hidden in the turmoil that has followed are two other replays of prior events one is that just as government had tried to defy the market

this article was first published 4 years ago india s foreign exchange reserves continue to be comfortably placed in excess of 400 billion dollars and the current account deficit is within manageable levels finance minister nirmala sitharaman said on thursday while tabling the economic survey 2018 19 in parliament although the cad increased to 2 1 per cent of gdp in 2018 19 due to a rise in crude oil prices up from 1 8 per cent in 2017 18 it is within manageable levels she said the widening of the cad has been driven by a deterioration in the trade deficit from 6 per cent of gdp in 2017 18 to 6 7 per cent in 2018 19 acceleration in the growth of remittances has however prevented a larger deterioration of cad said the survey in funding the cad the total liabilities to gdp ratio inclusive of both debt and non debt components declined from 43 per cent in 2015 to about 38 per cent at end of 2018 besides the share of foreign direct investment has risen and that of net portfolio investment fallen in total liabilities thereby reflecting a transition to more stable sources of funding cad in sum although the cad to gdp ratio has increased in 2018 19 the external indebtedness continues to be on a declining path the survey said india s foreign exchange reserves continue to be comfortably placed in excess of 400 billion dollars the rupee traded in the range of 65 to 68 per dollar in 2017 18 but depreciated to 70 to 74 in 2018 19 the exchange rate in 2018 19 has been more volatile than in the previous year mainly due to volatility in crude prices but not much due to net portfolio flows the real effective exchange rate also depreciated in 2018 19 making india s exports potentially more competitive the income terms of trade a metric that measures the purchasing power to import has been on a rising trend possibly because the growth of crude prices has still not exceeded the growth of india s export prices india s external debt was 521 1 billion dollars at end december 2018 1 6 per cent billion lower than its level at end march 2018 the long term debt declined by 2 4 per cent to 417 3 billion dollars at end december 2018 over end march 2018 though its share was mostly same at 80 1 per cent of total external debt compared to 80 7 per cent during the same period the composition of india s exports and import basket has by and large remained unchanged in 2018 19 over 2017 18 india s merchandise exports stood at 330 07 billion dollars in the year 2018 19 petroleum products precious stones drug formulations gold and other precious metals continue to be top export items india s imports totalled 514 03 billion dollars during the year 2018 19 and crude petroleum pearl precious semi precious stones and gold remained as top import items the trade deficit was 183 96 billion dollars during the period india s main trading partners continue to be the united states china hong kong the united arab emirates and saudi arabia 5 trillion economy india needs to sustain a gdp growth rate of 8 per cent to become a five trillion dollar economy by 2025 the economic survey has stated such growth can only be sustained by various cycle of savings investment and exports it said tabling the survey document in the rajya sabha finance minister sitharaman said global crude oil prices are expected to decline in the current financial year 2019 20 but india s export prospects remain weak however the gdp growth rate for 2019 20 is likely to be 7 per cent on stable macroeconomic conditions sitharaman said accommodative monetary policy is required to help cut real lending rates as investment rate seems to have bottomed out the economic survey 2018 19 has stressed the need for reducing economic policy uncertainty in the country to promote investment and has recommended the predictability of policies quarterly monitoring of economic policy uncertainty index and quality certification the survey has stated that higher economic policy uncertainty discourages investment while predictability of policy action and broad consistency in actual policy attract investment while noting the reduction in economic policy uncertainty in india over the past decade the survey has given a set of recommendations to ensure that it stays at low levels in the coming years to ensure growth in investments policy recommendations the survey notes that unlike generic economic uncertainty which cannot be controlled policymakers can reduce economic policy uncertainty to foster a salutary investment climate in the country in view of the above it has made the following recommendations for policy changes first policymakers must make their actions predictable provide forward guidance on the stance of policy and reduce ambiguity arbitrariness in policy implementation and maintain broad consistency in actual policy to ensure predictability the horizon over which policies will not be changed must be mandatorily specified so that investor can be provided the assurance about future policy certainty the government could also use labels such as standstill versus ratchet up to categorise various categories of policies according to the level of commitment about future certainty that it can provide second what gets measured gets acted upon so economic policy uncertainty index must be tracked at the highest level on a quarterly basis the government must also encourage construction of economic policy uncertainty sub indices to capture uncertainty stemming from fiscal policy tax policy monetary policy trade policy and banking policy finally quality assurance of processes in policy making must be implemented in government via international quality certifications the adage of document what you do but more critically do what you document must be implemented in the government the process of certification will require training of personnel in following quality assurance processes and will significantly reduce economic policy uncertainty

cnn christine lagarde the incoming president of the european central bank is not an economist that s a good thing lagarde who most recently led the international monetary fund is different from her predecessors for starters she s a woman she also has no experience in crafting monetary policy what she brings to the ecb is a knack for handling the biggest jobs savvy political instincts honed at the national and then international level and deep connections in global finance it s precisely those skills that make lagarde such an attractive choice to lead the ecb one of the world s three most important central banks and a bulwark against instability in europe lagarde s first day on the job is set for november 1 the day after britain is due to leave the european union a crash out is unlikely to phase lagarde however she s known as a gifted communicator who commands the respect of markets should an italian debt debacle threaten the euro investors have reasons to remain calm lagarde was french finance minister during the global financial crisis at the imf she organized bailouts for argentina and greece it s a big break from the past but one that has been needed mohamed el erian chief economic adviser of allianz said of her appointment tough choices ahead lagarde is set to become president of the ecb at what she herself has labeled a delicate moment global economic growth is slowing signs of weakness have been particularly acute in europe where inflation is stubbornly low the latest ecb estimate pegs eurozone gdp growth at an anemic 1 2 this year such frailty could heighten the impact of any shocks to the system and in the current environment there are plenty of tremors global trading relationships are precarious italy s high levels of debt are projected to stay above 130 of gdp this year and could at some point generate wider instability and britain still doesn t have a plan for an eu exit that protects trade should any of these issues turn into a crisis the ecb could be in trouble draghi didn t raise interest rates once giving his successor little room to maneuver his quantitative easing program which involved creating new money to buy assets such as government bonds only ended in december given these challenges analysts have long warned that draghi s successor may need to convince europe s rowdy national governments to get in line on a broad plan for fiscal stimulus the european central bank has for years been carrying too much of the policy burden el erian said lagarde is uniquely positioned to spur reluctant national governments into action after taking over for dominique strauss kahn as head of the imf in 2011 lagarde joined the ecb and european commission in orchestrating a second bailout for greece whose debt load put the entire eurozone at risk that involved working not only with draghi but also with regional heavyweights such as german chancellor angela merkel she is the kind of person who can go beyond the constraints of the position said ángel talavera of oxford economics furthermore investors are confident that lagarde will remain firmly within draghi s dovish tradition aiding continuity yields on germany s benchmark 10 year bond on wednesday hit a record low yields and prices move in opposite directions stocks rallied with germany s dax rising 0 6 and france s cac 40 gaining 0 7 lagarde s selection to lead the ecb surprised some but it s the latest in a long stream of firsts she was the first woman to score the top job at powerhouse chicago law firm baker mckenzie she was the first woman to serve as finance minister of a g7 country and in 2011 she became the first woman to lead the imf

the choice of christine lagarde as the next boss of the european central bank has sparked a backlash amid fears that it will politicise the institution frenchwoman lagarde who runs the international monetary fund imf has emerged as the favoured candidate to succeed italy s mario draghi after days of horse trading among european union diplomats the 63 year old s nomination which must still be approved by the european parliament cheered the markets due to hopes that she will continue draghi s regime of money printing and ultra low interest rates backlash frenchwoman christine lagarde currently runs the international monetary fund but the appointment also raised eyebrows because of her lack of central banking experience and a controversial stint as french finance minister analysts said lagarde a lawyer by training was a skilled political operator but they questioned whether she had the expertise to steer the ecb through turbulent times and fear she is likely to bend to the whims of politicians she supports the mother of two will serve for a single term of eight years if she is confirmed in the post economist marc ostwald of adm investor services said the appointment of lagarde will raise questions about the politicisation of the role above all because in sharp contrast to draghi she does not have any background in economics or indeed monetary policy formulation and jim reid of deutsche bank added there is a credibility risk especially if and when things get more complicated economically but markets will like the fact she is a skilled and well connected political operator another analyst erik nielsen of unicredit said in normal times she d be fine but it is not quite normal times now what if or when a downturn or crisis comes who does she rely on without her own educational framework or experience at a central bank lagarde s nomination comes as the eurozone economy stagnates and fears grow about italian plans to bust eu budget rules with debt fuelled spending plans draghi has signalled the ecb could slash rates and start pumping money into the economy again as soon as this month the central banker was a champion of so called quantitative easing which has been used by central banks since the financial crisis to boost economies it effectively involves printing money that is then used to buy assets such as government debt in the form of bonds under lagarde the ecb is widely expected to continue the policies backed by draghi she previously praised the italian s pledge in 2012 to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro seen as a pivotal moment in saving the currency imf chief s 3 6m tax free bonanza christine lagarde has raked in more than 3 6m from her role running the international monetary fund and paid no income tax anywhere in the world the 63 year old was put in charge of the washington based lender in 2011 and receives a tax free salary of nearly 393 200 as part of her package she also gets an annual cash allowance of almost 70 400 to fund what the imf calls a scale of living appropriate to your position and does not have to justify what she spends this on the paris born mother of two and her partner french businessman xavier giocanti are also reimbursed for all their travel expenses including hotel costs lagarde s job takes her all over the world including to the fund s annual meetings which tend to be held in exotic locations this year s was in bali the imf is funded by public money from member countries including britain and she has argued that governments with spare cash should use this to cushion the impact of economic downturns fiona cincotta a senior market analyst at city index group said there is a good chance lagarde will want to continue with draghi s stance paris born lagarde who has been dubbed a rock star of international finance graduated with a law degree from paris nanterre university and was a member of the french national team for synchronised swimming she worked at law firm baker mckenzie before switching to politics serving as a french government minister under both jacques chirac and nicolas sarkozy however her stint as finance and economy minister from 2007 to 2011 prompted allegations she abused her authority a french court ruled that in 2008 she was guilty of negligence for approving the award of 360m in compensation to businessman bernard tapie over the disputed sale of a firm however she was not made to serve a sentence and kept her job at the imf lagarde s work with the french and german governments during her time at the imf has also proved controversial under her leadership the washington based lender was part of the hated troika with the european commission and ecb they enforced brutal austerity on struggling greece during the eurozone crisis
so far the implementation of the tsp has been aimed at recuperating an economy which had been dysfunctional for over three decades among its hallmark footprints to zimbabwe s economic turn around is the much anticipated re dollarisation herein defined as the introduction of the local zimbabwean currency as the legal tender for all transaction according to the ministry of finance this policy position is an exigent step which was needed in the addressing zimbabwe s economic inflation under the multi currency system by richard mahomva the transitional stabilisation programme tsp has laid the foundation for fiscal consolidation at the same time generating sustainable budget methods therefore the merits of the country s de dollarisation process are briefly outlined from a broadly socio political perspective here de dollarisation refers to the elimination of the us dollar as a legal tender in zimbabwe zimbabwe adopted the multi currency regime in 2009 to curb the ruinous hyperinflation it has served its purpose and over stayed its welcome however in 2016 the government due to shortages of cash issued a surrogate currency the bond note which was trading along with the rtgs the multi currency basket composed of the united states dollar usd south african rand british pound botswana pula and a wide range of other foreign currencies but the usd was the widely spread currency in the market most goods and services prices were pegged at parallel market based rates this later invited the inter bank rating intervention by the reserve bank of zimbabwe what re dollarisation means the usd was taking about 90 of the transactional activity in the economy and the government has no control over this crisis consequently it was an imperative step for the government to employ a bold policy move to expedite the re introduction of the country s currency the fundamental merit of this position is that the country s sovereign dignity is restored as this is in synch with substantiating the transitional output of the second republic this is a mark of sacrificial rebirth of a people s dignity beyond political parameters but a loud acclamation to realigning the correct economic fundamentals of a nation which had been long aborted to sustain corruption and illicit financial flows it was only appropriate that the government had to take a responsible action to abate the monopoly of the economy by oligopolies as such progressive zimbabweans must support government s reintroduction of the zimbabwean currency and in all logic and the call for re dollarisation must be cast away from our development trajectory as this inclination only coincides with the retrogressive impulse to suffocate the country s economic growth capacity export growth potential has been suppressed by the dominance of the usd centred economy this propelled the backbone of an import based economy which offers an uncompetitive ground for local industry to flourish as a result the us de dollarisation is a critical step in clamping the influence of the parallel market in fracturing the potential growth of the local economy on several accounts the minister of finance prof mthuli ncube all the fundamentals to deal with the new currency are now in place the government has managed to record a surplus almost each month and has enough gold and other precious minerals to back the new currency this goes on to substantiate the success output of the transitional stabilisation programme tsp which among many other objectives was put into place to bring stability to the economy the long term impact of this policy s implementation will be noted through zimbabwe s economic actualisation of zimbabwe earmarked at reaching a middle income class status by 2030 as capsuled in vision 2030 which among a plethora of goals stresses the need for improved governance and the rule of law re orientation of the country towards democracy upholding freedoms of expression and association peace and national unity respect for human and property rights the abandonment of the multi currency system was inspired by the need to protect civil servants from local businesses that were now demanding forex for goods and services the civil service was now up in arms with government with valid points that they are paid in rtgs in an economy that had virtually dollarised the zimbabwe dollar zim will now be the sole legal tender for all local transactions the situation we were in were prices of commodities were packed against the black market rate of usd and prices of goods going up daily was not sustainable civil servants were no longer able to buy good in shops they could not pay for medicines and health care services when hospitals and clinics were demanding payments in usd the zim can help the general populace which was at the mercy of unscrupulous business entities the scrapping of the multi currency system on local transactions brings political and economic stability in the country the re dollarisation approach is inclusive because the multi currency system was now disenfranchising other citizens who were now unable to access goods and services priced in the usd this is a pro poor and peoples intervention that will go a long way in bettering the livelihoods of our people the re introduction of zim would help businesses to clear legacy debts on 1 1 basis as announced by the minister this is a very big plus to business businesses are going to wipe off debts if they have enough rtgs balances and businesspeople will start on a new slate this policy pronunciation serves both industry and the people the removal of multi currency system would be central to re industrialisation that was illusive under the usd the intervention has prevented economic implosion that was being driven by the loss of value of the local unit due to market manipulation by parallel market foreign currency dealers the increase of forex on interbank market and issue of lcs would be a soft landing measure for industry to avoid economic shock the removal of the multi currency system will further improve competitiveness and effort should be made to ensure importation of essential raw materials capital goods drugs medicines fuel and energy only companies that import raw materials should be given preference to get forex at the interbank market the promulgation of si 142 0f 2019 has also helped the banking sector the banks are now able to charge 50 interest on loans this means banks are going to redeem some value from loans because the rate of inflation meant that what was borrowed would be meaningless in terms of repayments this has brought normalcy in terms of lending the policy announcement stamp out borrowing for speculative purposes the coming of zim has served the country from recession that we were experiencing and without our own currency it was going to be very difficult to move out of it the country has to move on and embrace its own currency and have independence in monetary policy formulation with reserve bank of zimbabwe rbz playing the lender of last resort role in sync with the ongoing fiscal policy reforms the intervention gave rbz full control of monetary policy to defend the value of the currency the local market had continued to plummet due to black market activities resulting in most people preferring the green back the outlawing of the multi currency regime has restricted transactions to local currency to curb widespread market indiscipline that had seen traders quoting prices of essential products and services in usd and putting them beyond the reach of many given that majority earn local currency

over the last month as trade tensions between the united states and china heat up adding pressure to an already delicate global economic fabric both gold and bitcoin have began to take off and rally however it s not just gold and bitcoin it s actually other safe haven assets such as swiss francs or the japanese yen as well two foreign exchange currencies that often are looked to for their stability it s caused one prominent investor to suggest that mainstream finance is finally starting to look at bitcoin in the same light as a potential safe haven asset during times of economic turmoil joining the ranks of many other assets that are often used as a flight to safety bitcoin earns seat at king s table of highly regarded safe haven assets during times of economic growth investors look to high risk assets such as stocks and other emerging markets when the opposite occurs and the global economy begins to decline or enter a recession investors often turn to safe haven assets such as gold japanese yen or the swiss franc all highly regarded for their general stability related reading btc and gold showing correlated moves will bitcoin price rise from here according to prominent investor ari paul bitcoin is now begun gradually entering the mainstream financial discourse suggesting that more mainstream investors from traditional financial markets outside of the emerging crypto market are finally starting to take notice of bitcoin s unique attributes that potentially make it a safe haven asset unlike the world has ever seen before bitcoin as a potential safe haven asset is gradually entering the mainstream financial discourse ari paul aridavidpaul july 3 2019 while the evidence is in the price charts themselves with each of the safe haven assets showing some correlation between each other there are still many naysayers peter schiff recently called bitcoin s rally nothing more than a sucker s rally despite the two assets rising in almost the same exact manner but is btc too risky to become a safe haven asset because of bitcoin s notorious volatility and its ability to suck in investors via a bubble that later pops and eliminates most of the gains investors earned most see the asset as far too risky to ever be considered something that is safe during economic distress with investors fleeing the stock market over increased fears entering a market that just saw 85 of its value washed away doesn t sound like anyone with financial market experience would do if they are looking to avoid risk at all costs or maybe the 85 decline helped make bitcoin even more attractive for investors looking for a safe haven not only does bitcoin share the same scarcity as and does it even better than gold it also offers far more benefits and its supply is mathematically hard capped via computer code gold on the other hand can be mined right from the ground at what limit no one knows there may even be an asteroid floating in space with so much gold it could render all of the gold here on earth virtually worthless if its ever tapped into related reading edward snowden on crypto and privacy bitcoin is freedom because it s permissionless bitcoin s deflationary design coupled with increased economic fears and the fact its coming off a major retrace and has brought investors unheard of gains each time it does so makes bitcoin even more attractive as a safe haven as it could not only protect capital it could go on to make those who chose it as their safe haven of choice extremely wealthy disclaimer the article is provided for educational purposes only it does not represent the opinions of newsbtc on whether to buy sell or hold any investments and naturally investing carries risks you are advised to conduct your own research before making any investment decisions use information provided on this website entirely at your own risk
frankfurt july 3 imf chief christine lagarde may be the first woman to be nominated head of the european central bank but her political background and lack of central bank experience raises important questions about the independence of monetary policy in today s highly uncertain times analysts said a former corporate lawyer and french finance minister with a polished public image and confident command of english the 63 year old provides a sharp contrast to the long line up of besuited male technocrats whom ecb watchers had all seen on the shortlist in recent months taking over the ecb a decade after the global financial crisis the international monetary fund director is expected to push on with the easy money policies and ultra low rates that outgoing ecb chief mario draghi employed to stimulate the economy while lagarde has stopped short of issuing recommendations to central bankers from her washington seat she has always been supportive of the ecb s unconventional policies said frederik ducrozet a strategist at pictet wealth management advertisement since the financial crisis and subsequent sovereign debt battered the eurozone the central bank has entered uncharted territory in its battle to coax inflation back towards its preferred goal of just below 2 0 percent looking to boost the flow of credit through the economy to support activity and prices it has set interest rates at historic lows and pumped 2 6 trillion euros 2 9 trillion into the financial system via its quantitative easing qe bond buying scheme between 2015 and 2018 looking ahead the eurozone is still suffering sluggish growth and inflation meaning in the absence of improvement additional stimulus will be required draghi said last month advertisement that could mean lagarde could quickly have to lower rates still further and relaunch qe purchases political crossfire the ecb s massive interventions have not escaped controversy in germany conservative politicians and economists accused the central bank of printing money to prop up shaky eurozone members the key thing about the appointment of christine lagarde is that she is not jens weidmann the bundesbank german central bank governor who notoriously voted against qe said andrew kenningham of capital economics lagarde has consistently supported monetary policy loosening in general and qe in particular he added her political background raises questions as central bankers increasingly come under pressure from politicians us president donald trump for example has not only put pressure on the head of the us federal reserve on interest rates but last month accused draghi of trying to manipulate the euro michael hewson analyst at cmc markets uk called lagarde a controversial choice at a time when central bank independence is increasingly being questioned he noted that if her appointment is confirmed there will be two ex politicians at the top of the ecb the vice president luis de guindos previously served as spain s economy minister this calls into question the political impartiality of what is probably the most important position in europe hewson said but pictet s ducrozet said that lagarde has frequently insisted on the importance of central bank independence brain drain another question raised by the choice is the level of expertise needed to run a central bank with the departure of former chief economist peter praet and draghi the ecb s six strong executive board is losing two phds in the field this year the change of the guard amounts to a monetary policy brain drain ing bank economist carsten brzeski said lagarde would probably be more of a moderator than an intellectual mastermind on monetary policy he added potentially amplifying the role of the 19 national central bank governors who sit on the ecb s governing council nevertheless the president is backed up by a massive staff of experts and former central bank of ireland head philip lane who has stepped into praet s shoes a continuation of a pragmatic monetary policy stance as well as a confirmation of whatever it takes looks likely brzeski predicted in a reference to draghi s infamous pledge to take possibly radical measures to save the euro other analysts also pointed out that a non economist is running the us federal reserve on the other side of the atlantic jay powell is a lawyer as well even if the difference is that he has been a fed governor for a number of years said quincy krosby strategist at prudential financial as for lagarde the important thing is she has proven herself during a difficult time globally a global downturn a synchronised recovery and now a global slowdown she added afp
as it enters its 11th year america s economic expansion is now the longest on record a streak that has shrunk unemployment swelled household wealth revived the housing market and helped fuel an explosive rise in the stock market yet even after a full decade of uninterrupted economic growth the richest americans now hold a greater share of the nation s wealth than they did before the global financial crisis began in 2007 and income growth has been sluggish by historical standards leaving many americans feeling stuck in place the recovery has been very disappointing from the standpoint of inequality those trends help explain something unique about this expansion it s easily the least celebrated economic recovery in decades as public discontent has grown the issue has become one for political candidates to harness beginning with us president donald trump in 2016 now some of the democrats running to challenge mr trump for the presidency have built their campaigns around proposals to tax wealth raise minimum wages or ease the financial strain of medical care and higher education america s financial disparities have widened in large part because the means by which people build wealth have become more exclusive since the great recession fewer middle class americans own homes fewer are invested in the stock market and home prices have risen far more in wealthier metro areas on the coasts than in more modestly priced cities and rural areas the result is that affluent homeowners now sit on vast sums of home equity and capital gains while tens of millions of ordinary households have been left mainly on the sidelines the recovery has been very disappointing from the standpoint of inequality said gabriel zucman an economist at the university of california berkeley and a leading expert on income and wealth distribution household wealth the value of homes stock portfolios and bank accounts minus mortgage and credit card debt and other loans jumped 80 per cent in the past decade more than one third of that gain 16 2 trillion dh59 5tn in riches went to the wealthiest 1 per cent figures from the federal reserve show just 25 per cent of it went to middle to upper middle class households the bottom half of the population gained less than 2 per cent nearly 8 million americans lost homes in the recession and its aftermath and the sharp price gains since then have put ownership out of reach for many would be buyers for america s middle class the homeownership rate fell to about 60 per cent in 2016 from around 70 per cent in 2004 before the housing bubble according to separate fed data the other major engine of household wealth the stock market has not benefited many people either the longest bull market in us history which surpassed its own 10 year

disparities in wealth have worsened too the typical wealth for a white household is 171 000 nearly 10 times that for african americans that s up from seven times before the housing bubble and it primarily reflects sharp losses in housing wealth for blacks the african american homeownership rate fell to a record low in the first three months of this year most economists argue that higher income growth is needed to make it easier for more americans to save and build wealth mr zucman favours a higher minimum wage cheaper access to college education and more family friendly policies to enable more parents to work he and his colleague emmanuel saez also an economist at the university of california berkeley helped formulate senator elizabeth warren s proposed wealth tax on fortunes above 50 million to help pay for those proposals income growth has lagged partly because for most of the expansion employers have had a surfeit of workers to choose among when filling jobs leaving

frankfurt imf chief christine lagarde may be the first woman to be nominated head of the european central bank but her political background and lack of central bank experience raises important questions about the independence of monetary policy in today s highly uncertain times analysts said a former corporate lawyer and french finance minister with a polished public image and confident command of english the 63 year old provides a sharp contrast to the long line up of besuited male technocrats whom ecb watchers had all seen on the shortlist in recent months taking over the ecb a decade after the global financial crisis the international monetary fund director is expected to push on with the easy money policies and ultra low rates that outgoing ecb chief mario draghi employed to stimulate the economy while lagarde has stopped short of issuing recommendations to central bankers from her washington seat she has always been supportive of the ecb s unconventional policies said frederik ducrozet a strategist at pictet wealth management since the financial crisis and subsequent sovereign debt battered the eurozone the central bank has entered uncharted territory in its battle to coax inflation back towards its preferred goal of just below 2 0 percent looking to boost the flow of credit through the economy to support activity and prices it has set interest rates at historic lows and pumped 2 6 trillion euros 2 9 trillion into the financial system via its quantitative easing qe bond buying scheme between 2015 and 2018 looking ahead the eurozone is still suffering sluggish growth and inflation meaning in the absence of improvement additional stimulus will be required draghi said last month that could mean lagarde could quickly have to lower rates still further and relaunch qe purchases the ecb s massive interventions have not escaped controversy in germany conservative politicians and economists accused the central bank of printing money to prop up shaky eurozone members the key thing about the appointment of christine lagarde is that she is not jens weidmann the bundesbank german central bank governor who notoriously voted against qe said andrew kenningham of capital economics lagarde has consistently supported monetary policy loosening in general and qe in particular he added her political background raises questions as central bankers increasingly come under pressure from politicians us president donald trump for example has not only put pressure on the head of the us federal reserve on interest rates but last month accused draghi of trying to manipulate the euro michael hewson analyst at cmc markets uk called lagarde a controversial choice at a time when central bank independence is increasingly being questioned he noted that if her appointment is confirmed there will be two ex politicians at the top of the ecb the vice president luis de guindos previously served as spain s economy minister this calls into question the political impartiality of what is probably the most important position in europe hewson said but pictet s ducrozet said that lagarde has frequently insisted on the importance of central bank independence another question raised by the choice is the level of expertise needed to run a central bank with the departure of former chief economist peter praet and draghi the ecb s six strong executive board is losing two phds in the field this year the change of the guard amounts to a monetary policy brain drain ing bank economist carsten brzeski said lagarde would probably be more of a moderator than an intellectual mastermind on monetary policy he added potentially amplifying the role of the 19 national central bank governors who sit on the ecb s governing council nevertheless the president is backed up by a massive staff of experts and former central bank of ireland head philip lane who has stepped into praet s shoes a continuation of a pragmatic monetary policy stance as well as a confirmation of whatever it takes looks likely brzeski predicted in a reference to draghi s infamous pledge to take possibly radical measures to save the euro other analysts also pointed out that a non economist is running the us federal reserve on the other side of the atlantic jay powell is a lawyer as well even if the difference is that he has been a fed governor for a number of years said quincy krosby strategist at prudential financial as for lagarde the important thing is she has proven herself during a difficult time globally a global downturn a synchronised recovery and now a global slowdown she added

sommer johnson thought everything was finally coming together for her last year she was engaged working full time and doing well in online college classes when her fiance s mother died a week before their wedding day triggering a series of large and unexpected expenses that left her struggling to pay her bills and brought her to the verge of bankruptcy i keep hearing this is one of the best economies we ve ever had and unemployment is down especially among african americans which i am said johnson 39 who lives in douglasville ga an atlanta suburb i m looking around going where is this boom from where i sit this doesn t look like the best economy ever the economic expansion this week became the longest in u s history surpassing the 1990s boom which lasted exactly a decade advertisement the stock market is at record levels with the dow jones industrial average closing at a new high wednesday ahead of the july 4 holiday and president trump has made the economy s strong performance a centerpiece of his reelection campaign but this expansion has been weaker and its benefits distributed far more unevenly than in previous growth cycles leaving many americans in a vulnerable position this is a two tier recovery said matthew mish head of credit strategy at the investment bank ubs about 60 percent of americans have benefited financially he said while 40 percent have not the 40 percent which mish calls the lower tier have seen paltry or volatile wage growth rising expenses for housing health care and education and increased levels of personal debt they tend not to own homes or many stocks advertisement in discussions with 30 americans unable to pay all of their bills a clear pattern emerged most were able to eke by until they faced an unexpected crisis such as a job loss cancer car trouble or storm damage the extra expense caused them to get behind on their bills and they never fully rebounded economists fear such precarious financial situations put many americans at risk if there is even a mild setback in the economy potentially setting up the next recession to be worse than anything in recent history except the great recession so many americans are living paycheck to paycheck said signe mary mckernan vice president of the center on labor human services and population at the urban institute we are headed toward a political crisis if not an economic one their vulnerability is due to a confluence of factors first the average american family has yet to recover fully from the 2008 financial crisis the federal reserve found leaving half the nation with a diminished cushion to handle surprise expenses or the next downturn advertisement the bottom half has less wealth today after adjusting for inflation than it did in 1989 according to fed data through march of this year while wage growth has accelerated in recent months especially for the lowest paid workers families who have struggled for years have a ways to go to return to solid footing half of u s jobs pay less than 18 58 an hour and more than a third pay less than 15 which makes it difficult to save or invest for a better future trump and his team argue that a strong economy is lifting more and more americans up financially including blue collar workers the formerly incarcerated and minorities in contrast democrats are calling for major expansions of government programs to address inequality how to help the economically vulnerable is likely to be a key debate in the 2020 race advertisement just because folks on wall street think things are fine doesn t mean most americans feel like things are fine said ray boshara director of the center for household financial stability at the federal reserve bank of st louis when every day is a rainy day for millions of families things are not fine to get by americans have borrowed heavily in recent years total u s household debt is now 13 7 trillion surpassing the 2008 peak in dollar terms according to the federal reserve bank of new york the surge in debt this time around is for cars and college not mortgages johnson knows these issues all too well her family of five including two teenagers and an infant daughter was making it on her 31 000 salary as an insurance underwriting assistant and her husband s part time job as a clerk but it took longer to sell her mother in law s house than the couple expected advertisement the modest life insurance policy the couple collected on her death soon ran out but the bills for the funeral carrying the extra house rent health insurance and the new baby kept coming johnson s husband carl dunlap has applied repeatedly for full time jobs but has not been able to get one he picked up as many extra hours as he could at work but it wasn t enough already in debt for college and a used volkswagen passat she bought in 2017 johnson turned to friends and family for help but she eventually had to choose between paying for day care and the 350 a month auto loan she picked day care and her family lost a vehicle she recalls the exact moment it happened 10 p m on a thursday night in early march she saw the red flashing lights of the repo men through her living room window and ran outside barefoot i just stood there and watched it go which was tough johnson said that was the first car i ever bought for myself and we needed it the couple carpool to work now trying to save money to pay the thousands of dollars they still owe on the vw that is no longer in their possession advertisement older and wealthier and usually white americans typically take on debt to buy homes or make investments that are likely to make them richer in the years to come most in this category have recovered the wealth they lost in the great recession as home prices and stocks have soared in contrast data from the fed show that families of color and americans born after 1970 are the least likely to have recovered the wealth they lost in the crisis households earning less than 60 000 also tend to carry heavy debt loads according to data from credit score company equifax often taking out loans for college which they cannot get rid of in bankruptcy or loans to pay bills which can put them further behind the prevailing view among wall street investors and washington policymakers is that there is little to worry about because student loans are backed by the government and delinquency rates for other kinds of debt are fairly low meaning most people can make their monthly payments advertisement credit quality is about as good as i ve ever seen it said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics there is nothing that suggests inordinate stress on low income households certainly nothing compared to times past but boshara of the st louis fed pointed out that credit card and auto loan delinquencies have risen this year the opposite of what wall street expected in good economic times four in 10 americans say they still struggle to pay their bills despite the strong economy according to a quarterly survey by ubs that has shown no improvement since 2014 an april gallup poll found that 36 percent of americans were very or moderately worried about not being able to pay their normal monthly bills little changed from 2018 but up from 2017 when 31 percent were very or moderately worried and looking at how households are doing by class race

badly damaged and the couple decided it was not safe enough for their children prompting her to buy another her monthly payment jumped to over 450 a month because she didn t have a credit history

also a candidate for the her party s nomination for the presidency and representative katie porter have announced plans tointroduce versions of the accountability for wall street executives act of

oversight of federally chartered banks ending what the senator termed a decades long cooperative arrangement between state law enforcement officials and federal banking regulators and giving exclusive enforcement authority to the office of the comptroller of the currency the proposed legislation would clarify that state ags have visitorial authority to conduct oversight of federally chartered national banks to issue subpoenas to inspect bank records and interview bank executives and repair language in the national bank act that the supreme court interpreted as limiting those powers the

to monitor emerging risk areas such as rising corporate and public debt levels he also called for harnessing technological innovations to contain risks while at the same time responding to the potential risks posed by some of those innovations such as crypto assets a progress report issued on june 25 finds that the new regulatory framework sought by the g20 is largely in place but also notes that implementation is not complete and remains uneven across reform areas four core reform areas identified in the progress report include more timely regulatory adoption of core basel iii elements ending too big to fail which has advanced for gsibs but not as much for less prominent financial institutions including non banks making derivatives markets safer and strengthening oversight of non bank financial intermediation in an opening statement for a june 25 press briefing quarles noted that the japanese g20 hosts had asked fsb to look into ways to reduce market fragmentation along geographic lines and he noted that financial regulation and supervision can cause cross border frictions in financial activities that are international in nature in response fsb s report focused on cross border trading and clearing of over the counter derivatives cross border management of capital and liquidity and international sharing of data and other information fsb based in basel switzerland was established in 2009 and includes all the g20 economies quarles also serves as the federal reserve s vice chair for supervision basel committee finalizes changes in treatment of client cleared derivatives and leveraged ratio disclosure requirements the basel committee on banking supervision will revise the leverage ratio treatment of client cleared derivatives to align it with the standardized approach to measuring counterparty credit risk exposures sa ccr in a june 26 announcement bcbs explained that this treatment will allow for cash and non cash forms of initial and variation margin received from a client to offset the replacement cost and potential future exposure for client cleared derivatives only this limited revision balances the robustness of the leverage ratio as a non risk based safeguard against unsustainable sources of leverage with the policy objective set by the g20 leaders to promote central clearing of standardized derivative contracts the committee stated bcbs also issued revisions to require banks to disclose their leverage ratios based on quarter end and daily average values of securities financing transactions in an effort to address the practice of window dressing in which temporary reductions of transaction volumes around reference dates lead to public disclosure of artificially elevated leverage ratios bcbs whose 45 members comprise central banks and bank supervisors from 28 jurisdictions is the primary global standard setter for the prudential regulation of banks ncua delays rbc rule by two years a divided national credit union association board on june 20 voted for the second time to delay the effective date of its risk based capital rule to january 1 2022 the vote on the proposed rule that incorporates the delay was 2 1 ncua board chairman rodney hood said in june 26 statement that the delay would provide more time for study this is an appropriate time to consider additional improvements to the risk based capital rule hood said we have a strong economy and credit unions are very well capitalized with a net worth above 11 percent but board member todd harper who cast the sole dissenting vote said credit union regulators should follow the example of banking regulators who have imposed risk based capital requirements on banks in the aftermath of the financial crisis also opposing the delay were the aba and senate banking committee ranking member sherrod brown d oh who are not typically on the same side of many issues since 2014 every bank in the country has had to adopt and comply with risk based capital rules recommended by regulators around the world aba president and ceo rob nichols said it defies simple logic that the ncua would propose again to delay imposing comparable rules for the nation s credit unions when the agency is simultaneously allowing and encouraging credit unions to operate exactly like banks senator brown said i am disturbed that ten years after the financial crisis the ncua is once again delaying important rules to increase capital at large credit unions i commend board member harper for opposing this unnecessary extension and demanding that ncua focus on strengthening supervision and identifying risks to credit unions ncua originally approved the rule in 2015 and scheduled it to go into effect at the beginning of this year last october the board unanimously approved delaying the effective date to january 1 2020 and raised the asset threshold for a complex credit union from 100 million to 500 million comments on the proposed rule must be received within 30 days after publication in the federal register credit unions falling short of and straying from their mission aba funded study finds trade groups push back a new study has determined that the credit union industry is failing to live up to its statutory mission to provide financial services to borrowers of modest means and is calling for stronger enforcement to ensure that mission is achieved the study which was funded by the american bankers association but conducted independently by federal financial analytics recommends that the ncua the federal regulator of the sector go beyond its current policy of measuring only total credit union loan volume and instead measure what types of loans are made to whom at how much long term gain to borrowers in terms of income advancement or wealth accumulation titled the credit union equality commitment an analytical assessment the 38 page study notes that the credit union industry was established in 1934 to provide households of small means with provident or productive financial services in exchange for a federal tax exemption and other benefits federal financial analytics managing partner karen petrou said in a june 25 press release that the goal of the study is to remind policy makers of their vital mission to ensure that taxpayer benefits received are credit union benefits earned but the study argues the 2019 credit union regulatory regime has redesigned the credit union business model into one often indistinguishable from expressly for profit financial institutions with no comparable duties to serve low and moderate income households the national association of federally insured credit unions pushed back on what it called the banker report in a june 26 press release nafcu spokesperson jacqueline ramsay said the paper offers scant evidence for the conclusions reached and makes no mention of banker efforts to prevent credit unions from serving underserved communities the credit union national association also dismissed the report cuna s chief advocacy officer ryan donovan was quoted in a published report stating as the saying goes you get what you pay for and the aba appears to have gotten exactly what it was looking for a well funded long winded attack on a movement that for more than a century has provided value and benefit to consumers in ways

new delhi july 4 ani india s foreign exchange reserves continue to be comfortably placed in excess of 400 billion dollars and the current account deficit cad is within manageable levels finance minister nirmala sitharaman said on thursday while tabling the economic survey 2018 19 in parliament although the cad increased to 2 1 per cent of gdp in 2018 19 due to a rise in crude oil prices up from 1 8 per cent in 2017 18 it is within manageable levels she said the widening of the cad has been driven by a deterioration in the trade deficit from 6 per cent of gdp in 2017 18 to 6 7 per cent in 2018 19 acceleration in the growth of remittances has however prevented a larger deterioration of cad said the survey in funding the cad the total liabilities to gdp ratio inclusive of both debt and non debt components declined from 43 per cent in 2015 to about 38 per cent at end of 2018 besides the share of foreign direct investment has risen and that of net portfolio investment fallen in total liabilities thereby reflecting a transition to more stable sources of funding cad in sum although the cad to gdp ratio has increased in 2018 19 the external indebtedness continues to be on a declining path the survey said india s foreign exchange reserves continue to be comfortably placed in excess of 400 billion dollars the rupee traded in the range of 65 to 68 per dollar in 2017 18 but depreciated to 70 to 74 in 2018 19 the exchange rate in 2018 19 has been more volatile than in the previous year mainly due to volatility in crude prices but not much due to net portfolio flows the real effective exchange rate also depreciated in 2018 19 making india s exports potentially more competitive the income terms of trade a metric that measures the purchasing power to import has been on a rising trend possibly because the growth of crude prices has still not exceeded the growth of india s export prices india s external debt was 521 1 billion dollars at end december 2018 1 6 per cent billion lower than its level at end march 2018 the long term debt declined by 2 4 per cent to 417 3 billion dollars at end december 2018 over end march 2018 though its share was mostly same at 80 1 per cent of total external debt compared to 80 7 per cent during the same period the composition of india s exports and import basket has by and large remained unchanged in 2018 19 over 2017 18 india s merchandise exports stood at 330 07 billion dollars in the year 2018 19 petroleum products precious stones drug formulations gold and other precious metals continue to be top export items india s imports totalled 514 03 billion dollars during the year 2018 19 and crude petroleum pearl precious semi precious stones and gold remained as top import items the trade deficit was 183 96 billion dollars during the period india s main trading partners continue to be the united states china hong kong the united arab emirates and saudi arabia ani

this is a rush transcript copy may not be in its final form amy goodman this is democracy now democracynow org the war and peace report i m amy goodman with juan gonzález juan gonzález well june 28th marked the 10th anniversary since honduran soldiers stormed into the residency of democratically elected president manuel zelaya and forced him onto a plane to costa rica ousting him from honduras just six months before the end of his term since the coup which was plotted by the honduran military business and political elite and which was supported by the obama administration tens of thousands of hondurans have been murdered including more than 300 lgbtq people 60 journalists and hundreds of campesino rights leaders and environmental and land protectors one of the most devastating blows to environmentalists in the country was the brutal killing of lenca environmental activist and winner of the prestigious 2015 goldman environmental prize berta cáceres who was shot to death in her bedroom three years ago by honduran military intelligence specialists with links to the country s u s trained special forces amy goodman as both extreme poverty and violence skyrocketed in the last 10 years in recent years under the presidency of juan orlando hernández tens of thousands of refugees have fled honduras in caravans with the hope of political asylum in the united states many argue this is a humanitarian crisis caused by u s intervention in honduras as well as the u s government s unconditional support for hernández many challenged the fairness of his re election in 2017 since april tens of thousands of protesters have marched throughout honduras protesting plans by honduras s government to privatize healthcare pensions and education protesters have been met with violent repression from the honduran military and police the reforms were suspended but the protests are ongoing demanding hernández resign for more we re joined by the ousted president manuel zelaya coordinator of the honduran opposition party libre he is speaking to us from honduras where he has just returned for this 10th anniversary of the coup that ousted him manuel zelaya welcome to democracy now can you start off by describing what happened to you 10 years ago and then what s happening in your country in honduras today manuel zelaya very well greetings amy and greetings to democracy now democracy now has covered the events in honduras very objectively in an exemplary manner for the last 10 years when we began to have direct contact honduras is part of this region we are neighbors of the united states we are under the aegis of the dollar for the united states before we were good neighbors we have now become an uncomfortable neighbor for the united states because they changed their perspective on the region on central america and south america especially because they always used the idea that this region should be treated from the standpoint of well establishing democratic regimes in recent decades nonetheless i think u s policy towards our region has changed radically and honduras is a special case it would be easier for the united states which has absolutely meddled in this country and it has interfered in a way to support the dictatorship it would be easier to handle the situation if there were not a military and oppressive regime with a system that impoverishes the people of honduras because the economic system that is sealed for us by the international monetary fund is harmful privatizing all activities privatization itself is not bad what is bad is that it drives up the price of basic services for the population plus since private enterprise needs profit and needs to accumulate wealth it impoverishes the rest of the population the famous trickle down of the capitalist system never reached our society here 70 of the population is living in poverty and the problem is that poverty continues to deteriorate the lives of millions of people who or of thousands of people who migrate to the united states the caravans coming from central america are made up of persons from honduras also el salvador and guatemala but the large caravans are people going after what we know as the american dream which has become the american nightmare because people go and find that the policies of president donald trump who is a white supremacist that s how we see him he looks down on and holds in contempt mestizos and migrants young hondurans in particular don t migrate from honduras just because they want to but out of necessity there are more than 1 million hondurans who have family members in the united states and if we look at it from the perspective of honduran migrants in the united states well there are a million hondurans who have close family ties with their families in honduras but family reunification is a crime that has no name nobody has chosen where they were born in this life even your name is given to you by your parents when you re born and the least that we human beings should have is the right to live where we want of course following procedures but now these conditions i consider that militarizing society which is what the united states has done with honduras from the southern command and the united states doesn t even have an ambassador in honduras it has colonel heide fulton who is chargé d affaires who has been running the country for the last four years the united states looks at honduras merely from the standpoint of security policy here if you want to characterize what is happening in terms of what the trump administration is doing to us we ve practically gone back to the 1980s here there s a major campaign against communists against those who sympathize with chávez or the chavistas president hernández who has usurped power because he is a result of the coup d état he illegitimately assumed the presidency through election fraud two election frauds that the united states has been supporting incredibly even the organization of american states mr almagro who is a major conservative and totally pro u s said that the honduran elections should be redone nonetheless colonel heide fulton came forward the chargé d affaires here and at a press conference with the electoral tribunal said that would 5 000 new would be counted well 70 of the vote tally sheets had been collected and with the other 20 000 they said there were 5 000 that had to be recounted and that changed the outcome it was a clear fraud that was supported by the united states and this president came to power and then he said facelessly the current president who is illegal said that the problem in honduras is that practices of al qaeda were coming in imagine telling us that the opposition had islamic tendencies and bringing in other things from the middle east from other conflicts and he also blamed drug trafficking for the problems that he has but there was an increase in drug trafficking after the coup d état the department of state says so juan gonzález president zelaya you re mentioning drug you mentioned drug trafficking here in the united states most of the images that the american public receives of what s going on in honduras is of the violence of the street gangs in honduras of the criminality in honduras but very little of the political repression by the government against the people could you talk about your perspective of how the rise of street gangs and the violence in honduras is linked to the coup that occurred to the corruption in the government that is occurring every day in your country manuel zelaya well look the coup d état inexorably it marks a new form of u s meddling in our society ten years ago john negroponte undersecretary of state and president george w bush warned me and threatened me when i was president of honduras saying that if had relations with hugo chávez then i would have problems with the united states six months after that warning i was removed from power and removed from this country the problem for the united states is that the friends of those who they consider their adversaries are not their friends they ve decided they re enemies of the united states quite simply because i was seeking better relations with the south bringing in oil from venezuela and getting financing for hydroelectric projects with president lula da silva who they are now holding prisoner in brazil so the policies of the united states towards this region changed and they made a mistake and i ll talk to you about the gangs the maras in just a moment to your question but if you think about the elite in the u s government well their view for this region is mistaken they want to go back to the 1980s which was marked by the cold war stigmatizing the opposition they ve created shock forces psychological war dirty war well if they think that they re going to be able to stop migration in this way well it s only going to worsen the gangs are a link in the drug trafficking business and they come about because there s no jobs there s an excess of poverty poverty is misery in honduras youth find no solution so organizations such as well then the drug trafficking organizations come on the scene and instead of creating more jobs the government brings more repression plus these are components of the dictatorship the united states is supporting they ve looted the country since the coup d état in these 10 years each year the united states through the international monetary fund has authorized 24 billion of additional debt each year so now we have approximately 14 billion debt when they removed me 10 years ago we only owed 3 billion today it s 14 billion so to uphold the dictatorship first they militarize the country then they drive the country into debt and they take out huge credits which they call sovereign bonds at huge interest rates and of every 100 lempiras 40 now go to the banks plus they loot the state institutions the levels of corruption are exorbitant they are abusive in every sense of the word they ve looted institutions such as social security which is where the retirement funds for the elderly are and where the moneys are to cover the illnesses that the mothers suffer they have looted these institutions in order to finance an unpopular anti democratic and dictatorial regime the united states doesn t talk about honduras because it s shameful they are ashamed to talk about what they re supporting in honduras and the only thing to do about it is to denounce it because there are murders there are death squads they ve exported what s called plan colombia to honduras the false positives where many opposition leaders such as berta cáceres to mention one or murillo at the time of the coup or another person who was asphyxiated a 24 year old who was asphyxiated by the gases all of these there s no way to describe these crimes over the last 10 years other than by calling them crimes against humanity and this country should be brought before the international criminal court because what u s policy is doing is supporting genocide in honduras and in central america juan gonzález president zelaya i would like to ask you about another country in the region about the role of mexico because many expected that when andrés manuel lópez obrador won the presidency in mexico that mexico would develop a more humane policy toward the refugees coming across its borders what s your assessment of the first year or the first several months of amlo s presidency in relationship to your country and your situation manuel zelaya well look andrés manuel lópez obrador i consider him to be a profoundly human man with values that are in line with great moral principles for the region and for mexico and for central america he has had a very clear position vis à vis the united states i believe that mr trump s pressures against mexico are serious when they threaten to impose tariffs on mexican merchandise well that produces more migrants more migration and more poverty in our region so the policies of mr andrés manuel lópez obrador are practically being punished by the united states in focusing on migration they re going to look for some solution to the system that is provoking the migrants because everyone talks about migration but the causes of migration are the u s policies the imf policies the policies of the southern command for this region are provoking more and more migrants with each passing day so militarizing central america militarizing honduras means that that escape valve that the honduran people have had which is to be able to get work in the united states and the honduran people haven t even looked for jobs in the united states it is the u s businesses u s businesses for example have large crops and cannot pay a u s person to work in the countryside they give the travel expenses to the family members of those who are their employees and that is why there s massive migration to work in the united states they might work six months or a year and then go back and then return migration is a human process seeking to find solutions when they militarize the border what they are going to provoke here will be greater convulsions greater explosions and the honduran people you ve seen this in media reports the honduran people are in the streets and they re protesting and they re not protesting because we the opposition tell them to protest nobody goes out to protest because some politician tells them to do so maybe there would be a group of a hundred people in that context but here it s thousands of people in different parts of the country engaged in massive protests peaceful protests they do not use weapons at most the protesters might mobilize in the streets making traffic difficult bringing transportation to a halt but those expressions of migration shows that poverty has worsened the debt has gone up and people are in the streets protesting because the cost of electricity the cost of transportation the cost of fuel almost everything has been privatized in honduras so that should be evidence that this which is a model for neoliberal capitalism everything is turned into a business for a small group and for the rest there s no solution it s a failure of mr donald trump in central america and then drug trafficking increases no one wants to say so but drug trafficking increased after the coup d état because the drug traffickers when they see a country that they can control through an authoritarian system well they immediately get involved here they ve found the military and the police so democracy is the way forward for honduras and central america the united states should learn to live with democracy and not be creating repressive policies against us we have the same right that they do to be able to make a living and live in freedom amy goodman you have the current president of honduras juan orlando hernández investigated by the u s government for drug trafficking and his brother tony hernández actually arrested for cocaine trafficking he was arrested in miami he s currently awaiting trial in this country how does what does this mean for the people of honduras i mean this is under the trump administration that supports the current president hernández manuel zelaya well there s only one way to read this the united states is protecting its dictator here and mistakenly they think that benefits the government of donald trump donald trump might win re election in the united states if the world sees that he is taking measures in favor of democracy in honduras rather than in favor of the dictatorship as he is doing now drug trafficking is a measure of that drug trafficking is managed by the dea the dea knows of each shipment that comes out of venezuela and colombia the dea knows about it and some pass through without any problem and others are stopped so there is not a fight against drug trafficking there is a fight against cartels there are some cartels that are fought and others they let them go they know the implications of drug trafficking here nonetheless justice is selective they take action against some and protect the others i think the president is protected by the united states juan gonzález ten years ago before the coup against you throughout latin america there were progressive governments trying to change the social conditions of their people and we ve seen this enormous change in brazil in your country in argentina in the attacks on the government in venezuela what is your sense of what is happening in latin america today in terms of the movements of peoples for greater social equality manuel zelaya well there were some statements recently made by a u s senator that triumph in socialism was seen that it could set a bad example for the united states because it could even impact domestic politics in the united states they could not allow socialism modern socialism i would say because this is a socialism that is different than the socialism one found in europe during the cold war this is a socialism that accepts capital not capitalism but capital it accepts private enterprise not control by capitalism of the state because we understand the concept of popular sovereignty where sovereignty resides in the people power does not reside in a military or economic elite as under the neoliberal model so of course for the united states which has internal opposition because internally in the united states there s begun to be talk of democratic socialism i have heard democratic party candidates talking about democratic socialism that is why the policy of the united states towards our region has changed and in brazil they went after dilma rousseff with a technical coup d état because of socialist agreements with the people of honduras and others in the region and the right won the elections because lula was in prison they would not have done so if lula were free and now the united states not only trains military but also judges because they re using the justice system as a tool for political purposes amy goodman president zelaya what is your assessment of president trump and what he s doing along the border manuel zelaya i don t know if that brings him any electoral benefit but i consider it to be an absurd action in a globalized world in which for the last three decades we ve been talking about free trade talking about competition and competitiveness as part and parcel of the development of capitalism and now he has come up putting a halt to globalization so trump is like a negation of the historic process he is a setback in almost every sense so in a conservative society such as the united states that can bring him electoral benefits but in the eyes of the world he is behaving like a white supremacist with no human sensitivity as one would require in the 21st century because migration well migration is a right not a crime and the migration of the poor northward is bad but migration of the investor southward is good the investors come to take over the natural resources to take over like an oligopoly and they further impoverish our countries and that impoverishment produces migration and the increase in drug trafficking and so on and so forth so i see that mr donald trump s policies with the republican party represent a setback when it comes to having good neighbor relations with latin america amy goodman president trump cut off all aid to the northern triangle countries to el salvador to guatemala and to your country honduras this is very interesting considering he supports juan orlando hernández the president now he s backed off cutting that aid but threatens to do so if the immigrant flow continues do you think president hernández would fall without that u s aid manuel zelaya we don t need the help of the united states the united states gives very little assistance what the united states wants is to exercise economic control over the structures of the macroeconomy worldwide for example the world bank gives honduras some 150 million a year 150 million the inter american development bank a similar sum so all told we might get about 240 million and that is controlled by the united states and it also has a specific weight in our region the imf authorizes a letter that is signed every year so that honduras can go into debt at very high interest rates because it is a government that is allied with the united states what that provokes in our region is clear i think i think it s evident what it causes in our region i believe that that relationship where they say they re going to cut the assistance has almost no effect let me put it in clearer terms honduran migrants send to honduras about 4 billion a year let me repeat this amy 4 billion a year and the united states together with the world bank and the idb sends 200 million so honduras should be concerned and the current president has no dignity we should be able to speak to the americans on equal conditions with reciprocity and dignity but he doesn t protest because an immigration treaty we had with the united states was canceled we had an immigration treaty it was renewed every year indeed i had good relations with the united states the u s and european oil companies don t accept competition but they respected me and every year they renewed tps every year they renewed the millennium account but this year they have not renewed a single penny of the millennium account but of course the policy is threatening that aid well the u s aid from the standpoint of hegemonic control of capitalism through the transnational corporations through businesses through the control of the southern command over security and the imf over the economy and the oas the oas has supported or made an internal effort on the justice system through the maccih so if the justice system is controlled by the oas and if the u s and monetary fund and idb control the economy and security is controlled by the southern command then well then what does honduras run it s all based on u s policy and on the interference and meddling of the united states in honduras we should simply reach agreement because the united states is a strong neighbor it s the biggest military and technological power in the world it s not that we re going to be the same as the united states but we should not be a vassal of the united states we are a small country but with the same dignity as the europeans and the u s have amy goodman president manuel zelaya we want to thank you very much for joining us president zelaya was president of honduras from 2006 to 2009 he was ousted in a u s backed coup june 28th 2009 coordinator of the honduran opposition party libre i m amy goodman with juan gonzález thanks so much for joining us

by don mcintosh union members might have thought oregon s 2019 legislative session would be a pivotal year for working people thanks to a historic democratic supermajority in both chambers it didn t work out that way in the session that ended june 30 democratic lawmakers passed an important paid family and medical leave bill and enacted a 1 billion corporate tax to increase school funding but also cut public employee compensation to shore up public pension finances and let several priority union proposals die with no vote meanwhile republican state senators learned first hand the value of

how syriza lost the left how syriza lost the left the greek coalition of the radical left is likely facing a major defeat in this sunday s election u s secretary of state michael pompeo cypriot president nicos anastasiades israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and greek prime minister alexis tsipras flickr u s embassy general elections in greece this sunday will pit prime minister alexis tsipras and syriza or the coalition of the radical left against kyriakos mitsotakis and center right new democracy party some see this as a litmus test for the left around the world most people here are predicting an utter rout for syriza the far right galloped ahead during the european parliament elections on may 26 neo nazi golden dawn along with elliniki lisi greek solution laos popular orthodox alarm anel independent greeks syriza s erstwhile right wing partner in government eleutheri patrida free homeland and nea deksia new right plus half a dozen other nationalist and ultra conservative parties captured 19 percent of the vote add to this the 33 1 percent new democracy garnered compared to syriza s 23 8 percent and the proportion of the electorate expected to vote for the center and far right on july 7 is as high as 52 percent which would be the highest returns for the right since the second world war mirroring the current rightward slide in many parts of the world in the current moment it is sometimes hard to remember the elation with which many on the left greeted syriza s victory back in january 2015 with 36 percent of the vote the right reacted with horror i remember the students at the prep school in athens where i worked fretting that tsipras che guevara as they called the young prime minister then would take our homes from us shortly after syriza s victory however i bet a conservative colleague a souvlaki that greece s radical leftists were not what their name suggested i wagered that syriza would keep the country in the european union and submit to the austerity measures pushed by the troika the european commission european central bank and international monetary fund i hoped i would lose the bet unfortunately i won there were many things progressive people found endearing about syriza and its leaders the party vowed to support grassroots initiatives that had sprung up since 2010 when the troika put the screws on greece soup kitchens supermarket baskets where people donated canned food and craigslist posts offering all manner of goods and services free of charge syriza ministers were praised for their laid back dress code and for refusing to travel first class or accept limos chauffeurs bodyguards and other perks many expected a permanent continuation of free public transportation marxists were calling on syriza to extend capital controls with the goal of nationalizing banks and corporations and hoped the government would support workers control of hospitals and enterprises especially in the accounting departments in order to avoid further capital flight from the country in july 2015 alexis tsipras pulled a fast one on his political opponents and the people who voted for him when he called a snap referendum on new austerity measures the troika wanted to impose on greece a lot of people thought this was a sign tsipras had not sold out he was going to the people and would not cross any of the red lines his government had set for itself german chancellor angela merkel admitted during her victory tour of athens in january 2019 that tsipras s sudden move had scared the living daylights out of her grexit and the sundering of the european union by a domino of exits by countries like portugal spain and italy seemed a short step away new democracy condemned the irresponsile brinksmanship and bolshevism of syriza which was irresponsibly passing the buck to the greek people the referendum took place on july 5 2015 under dire conditions banks were closed for lack of funds after the troika cut off the country s money supply many believed the european union would be torn apart over little greece when 61 percent of greek voters said no to the troika s austerity measures it appeared disaster had finally struck a few days later however tsipras surprised everyone again he caved in to greece s overlords in the north went against the popular mandate he had just received and signed a loan agreement that was even harsher than the measures voters had just rejected naturally the anger among those who voted no in the referendum was molten tsipras then called new elections which he won in september 2015 by re electing him according to the mainstream media narrative the greek people gave their consent to his capitulation to the troika but the september elections set a record for the lowest turnout in a postwar greek election only half of registered voters came to the polls as only a few prescient observers at the time of the july referendum realized the snap vote on austerity was aimed not at securing a better deal for greece but at keeping syriza united and tsipras in power it is hard to overstate how crushing these developments were for people with high expectations for syriza many had hoped the new government in athens would infect europe with a democratic ethos that would wipe away the unfair trade relations between southern europe and the stronger powers in berlin brussels and paris they imagined a government acting dynamically drawing support away from neo nazis and sharpening the left instead the third memorandum agreement signed in july 2015 cost the greek people as much as 200 billion poverty unemployment crime mental illness and suicide all skyrocketed they remain at high levels today the land where democracy was born is now subject to intervention by foreign powers to a degree it hasn t been since 1829 when it gained its independence from the ottoman empire syriza has caved on strategic issues dealing with debt payments austerity and privatizations selling off on the cheap ports airports seashores railways power stations water and gas companies cultural and archaeological sites theaters goldmines and other profitable enterprises worse after flattening people under a raft of new taxes syriza stood by when banks seized their homes with a left like syriza who needs a right a friend remarked to me the other day in greece only conservatives and right wingers call alexis tsipras a socialist though admired in the west greece s forty four year old premier is held in low esteem here when he submitted to the troika in 2015 many likened him to the early christians who went naively to the lions others called him a traitor and judas iscariot that is probably unfair it is true however that greece s radical prime minister took the path of least resistance adopting the mentality of the shock doctrine there is no alternative he interpreted the choice he had to make as one between sudden death and slow death he chose the latter if the coalition of the radical left lost the support of many who voted for it in 2015 it gained the silent support of conservatives that is not surprising why vote for new democracy when syriza has done such a good job of implementing austerity measures tsipras has the support of the banks the european union the european commission and the imf major business interests declared their support for tsipras before the european elections indeed the syriza government has been very good to big business in february for instance tsipras gave an extremely generous tax break to greece s roughly 500 shipping companies not surprisingly about half of the country s twenty odd tsakia literally fireplaces a euphemism for the most powerful families were openly backing syriza the party became respectable syriza rather than representing the little guy was exposed as a middle class movement keen on returning their supporters to the status and security they lost as a result of the worldwide slump that began in 2008 tsipras s syriza wanted capitalism with a human face and it was to that unrealizable end that the party surrendered to the troika in syriza s telling the party was the victim of german led bullying it bargained valiantly with the troika and managed to keep greece in the european union and eurozone but of the two left strategies syriza could have followed to try to change europe from within or to save greece via a well formulated plan b or grexit it chose neither instead in four quick years tsipras has masterfully molded his image into that of a reasonable conformist like so many others in the syriza leadership he comes from a wealthy family his father pavlos was a civil engineer who landed highly lucrative government contracts during the military dictatorship of 1967 1973 tsipras s father donated generous sums to the greek orthodox church some disgruntled syriza voters have suggested in the media that this explains why the government has not targeted the preferential tax treatment of an institution with billions of euros in real estate and other assets there is compelling logic for big business leaders and other conservatives to prefer a syriza government to one headed by new democracy if re elected tsipras and syriza will go on implementing austerity measures and privatizing the public sector in this crisis ravaged country no one doubts that harsh measures against an unwilling population are best implemented by self proclaimed socialists a victory on july 7 by kyriakos mitsotakis and his neoliberals will trigger loud and sustained reaction from anarchists who will turn up the heat on the police in athens and other cities major forces outside europe also have reason to support syriza tsipras s government spent close to 2 5 billion on f 16 fighters from the united states built close relations with the netanyahu government in israel and lifted the country s veto of nato expansion in the balkans if syriza looks likely to falter as it did in the european elections it isn t because of conservative opposition but because left leaning voters may choose not to vote at all they increasingly see no difference between syriza and new democracy in an effort to attract voters in the last elections syriza passed legislation lightening the burden of austerity measures on the average family it allowed tax debtors the majority of the country to schedule arrears payments in as many as 120 installments the government also offered tax rebates and promises of higher wages but all these moves band aids on a gaping wound backfired and syriza s popularity fell further these failures have been made worse by the crass arrogance displayed by some of syriza s leadership on the last day parliament met before it was dissolved for the elections amendments and new laws were passed so that friends and relatives of high ranking syriza members including nikos voutsis the speaker of the parliament could be hired by the public sector or transferred to higher paying jobs there this is not the sort of behavior one expects from radical socialists the public outcry was so great that tsipras was compelled to step in and put an end to the nonsense he made matters worse for his campaign by publicly apologizing for nepotism in his cabinet in greek politics the words i m sorry have as salutary an effect as three gallons of bleach poured into a gas tank the anarchists i have spoken to in athens are calling for voter abstention on july 7 they repeat the refrain that if elections could change anything they would be illegal others counter that if abstention changed anything it would be illegal the anarchists reply that at least nominally voter participation is in fact mandatory in greece depending on where one stands on the political spectrum representative democracy has the vice or virtue of barely needing us the people at all even with high rates of abstention the system reproduces itself this is why some anarchist groups in athens are calling for active abstention they plan to gather outside polling stations on election day to make noise and try to get their message across meanwhile what is left of the left in greece dreads the possibility of a syriza victory the best thing for the country they say would be syriza s total dissolution and disappearance from the political scene people in the kke communist party and antarsya the acronym spelling rebellion for a conglomeration of marxists anarchists and left wing populists are looking for a resounding defeat of syriza on july 7 many are convinced that the coalition of the radical left will soon pass into the dustbin of history where it belongs for being socialist in words but capitalist in deeds let this be a warning they say to anti establishment movements around the world that have faith in people like jeremy corbyn in britain pablo iglesias in in spain bernie sanders and alexandria ocasio cortez in the united states and even jean luc mélenchon in france because none of them call for the transfer of the means of production to the people according to these voices they are not true socialists and the system need not fear them these are isolated voices however if the kke and antarsya do relatively well in the elections this will be because they are seen as buffers against the far right and neo nazis democracy as we practice it did not originate in greece ask anyone in athens and they will tell you inspired by roman systems of government modern democracy is a continuation of the feudal tradition whereby kings and queens selected representatives from the estates to advise them it has very little to do with the amesi dimokratia or direct democracy that was born in ancient greece today this elite tendency appears to define the situation in greece working class voters are now twice as likely not to vote as other voters and a great majority of the country s non greek population one in ten people in greece do not have the right to vote decisions concerning the lives of over half the people who live in greece are made without their participation at all any doubts i had that greece s first time left government as syriza calls itself would fall from power were dispelled a little less than a year ago july 23 2018 was the worst day in my life tragically it was the last day in the lives of more than 100 people in the towns of mati and rafina located some thirty kilometers northeast of athens my family and i have lived in rafina since 2007 a few hundred meters from my house on dimokratias democracy street thirty six cars were caught in an inferno people scrambled out of their vehicles and ran headlong from the flames toward the sea but there was no escape in a nearby property twenty six bodies were found charred and huddled in a circle with children s remains in the middle macabre evidence that the parents had tried to sacrifice themselves and save the kids a little further away was the body of a young woman who jumped off a cliff and died on the sea rocks below words cannot describe the terrible things we all lived through children adults the elderly i was alone at home that awful evening i had just finished laying concrete edging around our wooden house when my daughter anastasia called me from the café in rafina where she works as a waitress dad she asked have you seen the sky no i said and looked up at the biggest cloud of smoke i have ever seen it took up half the sky dropping everything i jumped on my motorcycle and rode down to the end of my street to see where the fire was i turned onto a dirt road and rounding the first bend slammed on the brakes about fifty meters away a fifteen meter high wall of fire was racing toward me i spun around and honking the horn and shouting at the top of my lungs warned people of the danger i ditched the bike and ran home for rosa our dog we left the house with the fire right behind us on democracy street i bumped into my daughter who had come running from work red embers flew all around us the street was full of people sobbing and shouting moving down the hill in a supermarket parking lot by the port i met my wife julia who was returning from work in athens and my son nikiforos who had been at a friend s house when the fire forced them out tears in our eyes we hugged each other certain we had lost the house to the fire and would have to start from scratch my daughter returned to work and the rest of us walked over to the beach the sun had fallen the twilight was orange and surreal as the fire crackled audibly in the distance to the left and right of us families sat on the sand with soot smeared faces crying for the homes and loved ones they had lost i learned the next day from my daughter that many of the patrons at the café were residents of mati when they learned their town was burning most drove there to try and save their homes about an hour later anastasia told me that only half of these people returned to the café the rest were dead what does this all have to do with syriza everything during the deadly fire the fire service was nonexistent no helicopters or canadair water bombers arrived this fire prone country has just ten mostly old fixed wing firefighting aircraft and thirteen helicopters by contrast it has some 235 fighter aircraft including lockheed f 16 fighting falcons the planes purchased by the syriza government amid general austerity dassault mirage 2000s and mcdonnell douglas f 4 phantoms the same applies to the coast guard which did not act hundreds of people tried to save themselves by running into the stormy sea where a dozen drowned only a few hundred meters up the attica coastline from a coast guard station as for the police they displayed criminal negligence and stupidity failing to warn people of the danger instead of ordering drivers to get out of the area they permitted them to seek alternative routes leading dozens directly into the path of fire later that evening tsipras and a handful of cabinet members staged a pathetic show in the operations room of the fire service they had pretended there were no dead until that moment and they lied awkwardly about the severity of the problem but the coup de grâce for tsipras came in may when a photograph taken a few weeks after the fires in mati and rafina was leaked to the press it showed him relaxing in the ionian sea on the deck of a shipping magnate s luxury yacht smoking a cigar there are two things all governments must do to remain in power provide security for their citizens and an economy that offers jobs and opportunities syriza has done neither evel economakis received his phd in russian history from columbia university he has taught at universities in north america europe and russia he currently lives with his family in greece where he teaches history at ionios lyceum in athens

new york facebook and some of its corporate allies have decided that what the world really needs is another cryptocurrency and that launching one is the best way to use the vast talents at their disposal the fact that facebook thinks so reveals much about what is wrong with twenty first century american capitalism in some ways it is a curious time to be launching an alternative currency in the past the main complaint about traditional currencies was their instability with rapid and uncertain inflation making them a poor store of value but the dollar the euro the yen and the renminbi have all been remarkably stable if anything the worry today is about deflation not inflation the world has also made progress on financial transparency making it more difficult for the banking system to be used to launder money and for other nefarious activities and technology has enabled us to complete transactions efficiently moving money from customers accounts into those of retailers in nanoseconds with remarkably good fraud protection the last thing we need is a new vehicle for nurturing illicit activities and laundering the proceeds which another cryptocurrency will almost certainly turn out to be the real problem with our existing currencies and financial arrangements which serve as a means of payment as well as a store of value is the lack of competition among and regulation of the companies that control transactions as a result consumers especially in the united states pay a multiple of what payments should cost lining the pockets of visa mastercard american express and banks with tens of billions of dollars of rents excessive profits every year the durbin amendment to the 2010 dodd frank financial reform legislation curbs the excessive fees charged for debit cards only to a very limited extent and it did nothing about the much bigger problem of excessive fees associated with credit cards other countries like australia have done a much better job including by forbidding credit card companies from using contractual provisions to restrain competition whereas the us supreme court in another of its 5 4 decisions seemed to turn a blind eye to such provisions anti competitive effects but even if the us decides to have a non competitive second rate financial system europe and the rest of the world should say no it is not anti american to be pro competition as trump seems to have recently suggested in his criticism of european commissioner for competition margrethe vestager one might well ask what is facebook s business model and why do so many seem so interested in its new venture it could be that they want a cut of the rents accruing to the platforms through which transactions are processed the fact that they believe that more competition will not drive down profits to near zero attests to the corporate sector s confidence in its ability to wield market power and in its political power to ensure that governments will not intervene to curb these excesses with the us supreme court s renewed commitment to undermining us democracy facebook and its friends might think they have little to fear but regulators entrusted not just with maintaining stability but also with ensuring competition in the financial sector should step in and elsewhere in the world there is less enthusiasm for the us tech dominance with its anticompetitive practices supposedly the new libra currency s value will be fixed in terms of a global basket of currencies and 100 per cent backed presumably by a mix of government treasuries so here is another possible source of revenue paying no interest on deposits traditional currencies exchanged for libra facebook can reap an arbitrage profit from the interest it receives on those deposits but why would anyone give facebook a zero interest deposit when they could put their money in an even safer us treasury bill or in a money market fund the recording of capital gains and losses each time a transaction occurs as the libra is converted back into local currency and the taxes due seem to be an important impediment unless facebook believes it can ride roughshod over our tax system as it has over privacy and competition concerns there are two obvious answers to the question of the business model one is that people who engage in nefarious activities possibly including the us current president are willing to pay a pretty penny to have their nefarious activities corruption tax avoidance drug dealing or terrorism go undetected but having made so much progress in impeding the use of the financial system to facilitate crime why would anyone let alone the government or financial regulators condone such a tool simply because it bears the label tech if this is libra s business model governments should shut it down immediately at the very least libra should be subject to the same transparency regulations that apply to the rest of the financial sector but then it would not be a cryptocurrency alternatively the data libra transactions provide could be mined like all the other data that has come into facebook s possession reinforcing its market power and profits and further undermining our security and privacy facebook or libra might promise not to do that but who would believe it then there is the broader question of trust every currency is based on confidence that the hard earned dollars deposited into it will be redeemable on demand the private banking sector has long shown that it is untrustworthy in this respect which is why new prudential regulations have been necessary but in just a few short years facebook has earned a level of distrust that took the banking sector much longer to achieve time and again facebook s leaders faced with a choice between money and honouring their promises have grabbed the money and nothing could be more about money than creating a new currency only a fool would trust facebook with his or her financial well being but maybe that is the point with so much personal data on some 2 4 billion monthly active users who knows better than facebook just how many suckers are born every minute joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate in

federal reserve board chairman jerome brushed off president donald trump s threats to remove him from his post the federal reserve opened the door to an interest rate cut on wednesday vowing to act to keep the economy growing as uncertainties about trade and other issues mount us federal reserve chief jerome powell said trade friction and slowing growth worldwide have led many central bankers to feel the case for an interest rate cut has strengthened but most still want to see more data before making a move but one policymaker dissented in the vote advocating for an immediate cut something president donald trump has been calling for loudly and which many economists say is necessary given the damage done by the escalating trade frictions the policy setting federal open market committee kept the key rate in the 2 25 2 5 percent range but sent a strong signal of possible cuts ahead saying uncertainties about this outlook have increased and the fed will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion after the meeting powell confirmed monetary policy could soon become more accommodative a byword for lowering the rate that serves as the basis for all types of lending from autos to homes to credit cards uncertainties surrounding the outlook have clearly risen since our last meeting and officials are mindful of ongoing cross currents including trade developments and concerns about global growth he told reporters while the baseline outlook remains favorable he said many fomc participants now see that the case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened but he cautioned that it is important they not overreact to single bits of data or a short term swing in sentiment markets are almost universally predicting multiple fed moves this year and seem to view the fed stance as dovish enough for now with the three major stock indexes closing with modest gains following the announcement however trump may be disappointed not to get a rate cut since he has accused the fed of undercutting his efforts to supercharge the economy he even hinted tuesday he might remove powell from his post but the fed chairman said wednesday he believes the law is clear that he has a four year term i fully intend to serve it he said trump on tuesday also bashed european central bank chief mario draghi saying his signal of more stimulus ahead would put the united states at a disadvantage against a weaker euro which would make american exports less competitive powell declined to wade into that debate or comment on the exchange rate saying only that the central bank does not use interest rate policy to influence the american currency he said we don t target the dollar we will target our domestic economic and financial conditions and not our exchange rate however the dovish comments did impact the exchange rate as the dollar weakened slightly against the euro and other currencies dovish tilt james bullard president of the federal reserve s st louis regional branch pictured in may 2019 said he wanted to see the federal funds rate cut by 25 basis points james bullard president of the fed s st louis regional branch voted against the decision saying he wanted to see the federal funds rate cut by 25 basis points at this meeting bullard earlier this month was to first central banker to give voice to the expectations of financial markets that economic conditions would require the fed to act saying a rate cut could be needed soon diane swonk chief economist grant thornton who before the meeting had called for an immediate move said the fed s language suggests a willingness to cut rates in july but with trump expected to meet china s president xi jinping next week at the group of 20 summit in osaka japan there is a chance for good news to deflate trade tensions and clear away some of the gloom there are some within the fed who wanted to wait out the g20 meetings to see if the president levies additional tariffs on china but their mood about the economy has clearly darkened swonk said the quarterly forecasts issued by the central bankers on wednesday revealed a decidedly more dovish tilt with committee members were spilt on whether to keep the key rate where it is now or lower it but the projections did not reflect much change in the outlook for the economy the median estimates for growth and unemployment were essentially unchanged compared to march while the forecast for inflation was cut to 1 5 percent from 1 8 percent previously

employees at an air conditioner manufacturing unit near new delhi agence france presse india s government forecast on thursday that economic growth could get back up to 7 per cent this year but cautioned it will face challenges keeping its fiscal deficit in check the views were expressed in an annual economic survey presented to parliament one day before finance minister nirmala sitharaman presents the budget for the fiscal year that ends in march 2020 india s growth cooled to 6 8 in the year that ended on march 31 its slowest rate of expansion in five years growth in the economy is expected to pick up in 2019 20 as macroeconomic conditions continue to be stable said the finance ministry s chief economic adviser krishnamurthy subramanian the report s main author prime minister narendra modi s government is widely expected to push up spending in friday s budget to spur activity by offering tax incentives to boost consumer demand and investment officials of his political party said a shortfall in monsoon rains pivotal for the farm sector that constitutes about 15 of the economy employing nearly half of india s workers has increased concern about rural distress and strengthened the case for government intervention but the report said india faces a challenge on the fiscal front the economic slowdown has impacted tax collection while state spending on the farm sector is rising in an interim budget unveiled in february ahead of a general election the government set 3 4 of gross domestic product gdp as a target for 2019 20 s fiscal deficit we are sticking to the fiscal consolidation path for the last five years we anticipate that path will continue krishnamurthy told reporters after the release of the report to allow higher spending the fiscal deficit target might be lifted to 3 6 on friday a senior government official told reuters otherwise to meet the initial target of 3 4 the government will have cut expenditure by 700 billion indian rupees to 800 billion indian rupees 10 12 billion the official said in 2018 19 the government resorted to spending cuts of nearly 1 5 trillion rupees to meet the upwardly revised fiscal deficit target of 3 4 after a fall in tax collections the annual survey gave no projection for the deficit economists believe the real figure has to exceed 3 4 because already in the first two months of the current year the deficit equalled 52 of the total targeted for 12 months the report urged the removal of hurdles to private investment and a further opening of the economy to foreign investors to boost growth to over 8 annually which would make india a 5 trillion economy in five years in january march annual growth slumped to 5 8 the slowest pace in 20 quarters and more recent indicators such as plummeting industrial output and automobile sales have stoked fears of a deeper slowdown krishnamurthy said transmission of monetary easing was key to reduce the cost of capital in the economy india s central bank reserve bank of india rbi has cut benchmark repo rate by 75 basis points bps since february but commercial banks have reduced lending rates by only 10 15 bps as they are saddled with huge distressed assets amounting to near 150 billion indian financial markets largely shrugged off the economic survey and investors said they would prefer to wait for the budget on friday for direction the survey identifies problems and its core is india to be a 5 trillion economy by 2024 25 which looks a bit optimistic said devendra pant chief economist at india ratings research the indian arm of the rating agency fitch it is banking on productivity growth of 70 basis point compared with the united states pant said india is likely to stick to a modest rise in defence spending in the 2019 20 budget because of tight government finances officials said further delaying a long planned military modernisation programme india s air force desperately needs hundreds of combat planes and helicopters to replace its soviet era aircraft while the navy has long planned for a dozen submarines to counter the expanding presence of the chinese navy in the indian ocean the army a large part of which is deployed on the border with traditional foe pakistan has been seeking everything from assault rifles to surveillance drones and body armour but these plans have been on hold for years because governments have not been able to set aside large sums and most of the defence expenditure goes on salaries and pensions for a 1 4 million standing military the world s second largest after china in an interim budget announced in february before national elections the government allocated 4 31 trillion rupees 62 27 billion for defence a 6 6 per cent rise over the previous year raising concern at the time it wouldn t be enough for modernisation reuters

chinese people are starting to feel the pressure of economic slowdown as china s yuan continues to devalue and several small and medium sized banks have recently filed for bankruptcy many chinese are choosing to buy gold or take their money out of banks to protect their assets additionally the chinese government issued an unusual notice in late june to encourage party members and cadres to invest in stocks which is interpreted by many as a desperate move to rescue china s economy currency devaluation china s yuan or renminbi rmb fell sharply on july 2 hitting its weakest level against the u s dollar in a week by 4 30 p m beijing time the onshore rmb closed at 6 8835 against the dollar a fall of 391 points from the previous trading day offshore rmb closed at 6 8856 which was a drop of nearly 300 points reuters s chinese language edition quoted a currency trader as saying that investor optimism continues to wane upon seeing the ups and downs in the previous rounds of trade negotiations they rush to trade chinese yuan into u s dollars whenever the dollar weakens a little bit therefore presently the dollar is very stable and the chinese currency still faces further downward pressure the trade tensions between the united states and china have seriously affected china s economy in particular after u s president donald trump announced to increase the tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese goods from 10 percent to 25 percent on may 5 the yuan depreciated by about 2 5 percent deutsche bank has predicted that the tariff increase from 10 percent to 25 percent would lead to a devaluation of the yuan to 7 1 against the dollar if the united states decides to impose tariffs on the additional 300 billion worth of chinese goods the yuan may further depreciate to 7 4 against the dollar ming chu cheng a political science professor at national taiwan university who specializes in chinese politics predicted on his youtube channel that if the chinese yuan ever drops below 7 yuan per dollar it will trigger a confidence crisis of the chinese economy devaluation of chinese currency will accelerate and capital outflows will occur in both china and hong kong if the standoff between the united states and china on trade relations continues for a long time china will fall into a financial crisis eventually china will become the second venezuela ming said buying gold to preserve wealth chinese people are seeking to preserve their wealth by buying gold as the chinese currency continues to depreciate in value according to a june 24 report from chinese news portal sina the manager at gold hangzhou s flagship store revealed that the sale of gold increased significantly since may the store is seeing more and more big transactions recently a big transaction refers to more than 1 kilogram of gold in a single purchase a customer bought 3 5 kilograms of gold bars just two days ago sales volumes for both gold bars and gold ornaments exceeded our expectations in these two months the manager said mr zhu a businessman from hangzhou told radio free asia that local people are buying gold because they are worried that the chinese currency will continue to depreciate we wish to exchange yuan into u s currency but the foreign exchange control is getting stricter so we have to buy gold instead although every chinese citizen is allowed to exchange 50 000 worth of currency a year banks are using all kinds of excuses to reject our request when we need to exchange a relatively large amount sometimes they even refuse to exchange 5 000 if there is no such foreign exchange control holding u s dollars is the best way for us to hedge against inflation zhu said zhang li a resident of wuhan told radio free asia that the recent news about baotou commercial bank being taken over by china s central bank due to insolvency has made many people worry about the money they keep in bank accounts some people have chosen to store money in the most primitive way that is storing money at home zhang said a lot of people i know of took money out of the bank as they fear that they may lose the money if the bank files bankruptcy party members encouraged to buy stocks the central discipline inspection commission china s anti corruption watchdog published an article on its official website on june 24 saying that party members and cadres can engage in legitimate securities trading activity and by doing so they are supporting china s economic development in october 1993 china s state council stipulated in its regulation that government officials at or above the county level were not allowed to buy or sell stocks it wasn t until april 2001 that the state council gradually lifted the ban on stock trading by party or government officials a long term stock investor mr zhou from hubei province told radio free asia that the majority of stock investors in china have suffered huge losses and the number of people interested in stock trading is diminishing drastically now that the central government has called on party and government officials to enter the stock market we are wondering does that mean there is no more money going into the stock market and the stock market will collapse soon maybe they encourage party members and cadres to put their money in because the stock market needs money desperately to sustain it

new york facebook and some of its corporate allies have decided that what the world really needs is another cryptocurrency and that launching one is the best way to use the vast talents at their disposal the fact that facebook thinks so reveals much about what is wrong with twenty first century american capitalism in some ways it is a curious time to be launching an alternative currency in the past the main complaint about traditional currencies was their instability with rapid and uncertain inflation making them a poor store of value but the dollar the euro the yen and the renminbi have all been remarkably stable if anything the worry today is about deflation not inflation the world has also made progress on financial transparency making it more difficult for the banking system to be used to launder money and for other nefarious activities and technology has enabled us to complete transactions efficiently moving money from customers accounts into those of retailers in nanoseconds with remarkably good fraud protection the last thing we need is a new vehicle for nurturing illicit activities and laundering the proceeds which another cryptocurrency will almost certainly turn out to be the real problem with our existing currencies and financial arrangements which serve as a means of payment as well as a store of value is the lack of competition among and regulation of the companies that control transactions as a result consumers especially in the united states pay a multiple of what payments should cost lining the pockets of visa mastercard american express and banks with tens of billions of dollars of rents excessive profits every year the durbin amendment to the 2010 dodd frank financial reform legislation curbs the excessive fees charged for debit cards only to a very limited extent and it did nothing about the much bigger problem of excessive fees associated with credit cards other countries like australia have done a much better job including by forbidding credit card companies from using contractual provisions to restrain competition whereas the us supreme court in another of its 5 4 decisions seemed to turn a blind eye to such provisions anti competitive effects but even if the us decides to have a non competitive second rate financial system europe and the rest of the world should say no it is not anti american to be pro competition as trump seems to have recently suggested in his criticism of european commissioner for competition margrethe vestager one might well ask what is facebook s business model and why do so many seem so interested in its new venture it could be that they want a cut of the rents accruing to the platforms through which transactions are processed the fact that they believe that more competition will not drive down profits to near zero attests to the corporate sector s confidence in its ability to wield market power and in its political power to ensure that governments will not intervene to curb these excesses with the us supreme court s renewed commitment to undermining us democracy facebook and its friends might think they have little to fear but regulators entrusted not just with maintaining stability but also with ensuring competition in the financial sector should step in and elsewhere in the world there is less enthusiasm for the us tech dominance with its anticompetitive practices supposedly the new libra currency s value will be fixed in terms of a global basket of currencies and 100 per cent backed presumably by a mix of government treasuries so here is another possible source of revenue paying no interest on deposits traditional currencies exchanged for libra facebook can reap an arbitrage profit from the interest it receives on those deposits but why would anyone give facebook a zero interest deposit when they could put their money in an even safer us treasury bill or in a money market fund the recording of capital gains and losses each time a transaction occurs as the libra is converted back into local currency and the taxes due seem to be an important impediment unless facebook believes it can ride roughshod over our tax system as it has over privacy and competition concerns there are two obvious answers to the question of the business model one is that people who engage in nefarious activities possibly including the us current president are willing to pay a pretty penny to have their nefarious activities corruption tax avoidance drug dealing or terrorism go undetected but having made so much progress in impeding the use of the financial system to facilitate crime why would anyone let alone the government or financial regulators condone such a tool simply because it bears the label tech if this is libra s business model governments should shut it down immediately at the very least libra should be subject to the same transparency regulations that apply to the rest of the financial sector but then it would not be a cryptocurrency alternatively the data libra transactions provide could be mined like all the other data that has come into facebook s possession reinforcing its market power and profits and further undermining our security and privacy facebook or libra might promise not to do that but who would believe it then there is the broader question of trust every currency is based on confidence that the hard earned dollars deposited into it will be redeemable on demand the private banking sector has long shown that it is untrustworthy in this respect which is why new prudential regulations have been necessary but in just a few short years facebook has earned a level of distrust that took the banking sector much longer to achieve time and again facebook s leaders faced with a choice between money and honouring their promises have grabbed the money and nothing could be more about money than creating a new currency only a fool would trust facebook with his or her financial well being but maybe that is the point with so much personal data on some 2 4 billion monthly active users who knows better than facebook just how many suckers are born every minute joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate in

editorial roundup excerpts from recent editorials excerpts from recent editorials in the united states and abroad ___ june 18 the orlando sentinel on why it won t endorse donald trump for president in 2020 donald trump was in orlando tuesday to announce the kickoff of his re election campaign we re here to announce our endorsement for president in 2020 or at least who we re not endorsing donald trump some readers will wonder how we could possibly eliminate a candidate so far before an election and before knowing the identity of his opponent because there s no point pretending we would ever recommend that readers vote for trump after 2½ years we ve seen enough enough of the chaos the division the schoolyard insults the self aggrandizement the corruption and especially the lies so many lies from white lies to whoppers told out of ignorance laziness recklessness expediency or opportunity trump s capacity for lying isn t the surprise here though the frequency is it s the tolerance so many americans have for it there was a time when even a single lie a phony college degree a bogus work history would doom a politician s career not so for trump who claimed in 2017 that he lost the popular vote because millions of people voted illegally they didn t in 2018 he said north korea was no longer a nuclear threat it is and in 2019 he said windmills cause cancer they don t just last week he claimed the media fabricated unfavorable results from his campaign s internal polling it didn t according to a washington post database the president has tallied more than 10 000 lies since he took office trump s successful assault on truth is the great casualty of this presidency followed closely by his war on decency trump insults political opponents and national heroes alike with middle school taunts he demonstrates no capacity for empathy or remorse he misuses his office to punish opponents as when he recently called for a boycott of at t to get even with his least favorite media outlet cnn he tears down institutions once airily suggesting the u s should try having a leader for life as china now allows he seems incapable of learning a lesson telling an abc interviewer last week just two months after robert mueller s report on election interference was released that he would accept dirt on an opponent from russia or china trump has diminished our standing in the world he reneges on deals attacks allies and embraces enemies this nation must never forget that humiliating public moment in helsinki in 2018 when the president of the united states chose to accept vladimir putin s denials of russian interference in the 2016 election over the unanimous assessment of the american intelligence community such a betrayal by a u s president would have been the unforgivable political sin in normal times as if that s not enough trump declares his love for north korea s kim jong un a genuine villain who starves and enslaves his people and executes his enemies with anti aircraft guns and flamethrowers but he wrote the president a beautiful letter flattery will get you everywhere with this president and that s dangerous domestically the president s signature issue immigration has moved in fits and starts happily he abandoned pursuing an outright and unconstitutional ban on muslims entering the u s opting instead to restrict travel for people from a handful of nations most of them majority muslim he s tried separating families sending troops to the border and declaring a national emergency for all of that illegal border crossings are as the president himself calls it at crisis levels he blames house democrats because casting blame is trump s forte but republicans controlled the house and the senate for two full years that seemed like an ideal time to fix what the president believes ails our immigration laws even with democrats now controlling the house where is trump s much touted deal making mojo an attribute he campaigned on but the economy yes the market has done well since trump s election the s p 500 was up about 21 between trump s inauguration and may 31 of his third year in office under president obama it was up about 56 in that same period unemployment is headed down as it was during seven straight years under obama wages are up and that s a welcome change but gdp increases so far are no better than some periods under obama deficit spending under obama was far too high in part because of the stimulus needed to dig out of the great recession under trump it s still headed in the wrong direction once again pushing 1 trillion even though the economy is healthy trump seems to care nothing about the deficit and the national debt which once breathed life into the tea party through all of this trump s base remains loyal sadly the truest words trump might ever have spoken were when he said he could shoot someone on fifth avenue and not lose his supporters this non endorsement isn t defaulting to whomever the democrats choose this newspaper has a history of presidential appointments favoring republicans starting in the mid 20th century except for lyndon johnson in 1964 the sentinel backed republican presidential nominees from 1952 through 2004 when we recommended john kerry over another four years of george w bush as recently as 2012 we recommended republican mitt romney because of what seemed at the time to be obama s failure to adequately manage the nation s finances if however unlikely a republican like romney now a senator from utah or former ohio gov john kasich successfully primaried the president we would eagerly give them a look same if an independent candidate mounted a legitimate campaign we d even consider backing trump if say he found the proverbial cure for cancer or about as likely changed the essence of who he is he won t the nation must endure another 1½ years of trump but it needn t suffer another four beyond that we can do better we have to do better online ___ june 18 the washington post on the death of former egyptian president mohamed morsi it speaks volumes that the first and only democratically elected president of egypt dropped dead on monday inside the glass cage he was confined to in a cairo courtroom where he was facing the latest in a long series of unfair trials mohamed morsi did a poor job as egyptian president before being ousted in a bloody military coup by the country s current dictator abdel fatah al sissi but the gross mistreatment mr morsi was subjected to over the past six years offers a vivid demonstration of how human rights have regressed in a country that once aspired to set political standards for the middle east mr morsi was thrust into the center of egypt s democratic revolution after he was chosen by the muslim brotherhood the country s most popular political movement as its candidate in the presidential election of 2012 an engineer by training he had few political skills though he surprised his islamist movement s foes by seeking good relations with the united states and maintaining egypt s peace treaty with israel he resorted to autocratic methods in an effort to best secular opponents as well as the entrenched military the result was mass popular demonstrations that provided a pretext for mr sissi s july 2013 coup and the bloody repression that followed mr morsi was jailed with tens of thousands of others most of whom remain in prison for the past six years he was held in solitary confinement allowed to see his family on only three occasions his protests and those of outside monitors that he was not being adequately treated for his medical conditions including diabetes and liver problems were ignored a panel of british lawyers and politicians found last year that his treatment could be described as torture meanwhile he was subjected to multiple trials on a host of trumped up charges most recently espionage human rights advocates including at the united nations called for an independent investigation of mr morsi s death an inquiry that is as unlikely as it is needed but perhaps his story will focus greater attention on the depravity of the sissi regime which is guilty of by far the worst human rights offenses in egypt s modern history in addition to the tens of thousands imprisoned thousands of other muslim brotherhood members or regime opponents have been tortured or murdered outright by security forces the secular political parties and civil society groups that opposed mr morsi have been destroyed a once pluralist press has been silenced the united states has consistently enabled this horrific record continuing to provide the military with 1 3 billion in annual aid congress has imposed human rights conditions only to see them waived by the trump administration president trump has received mr sissi twice at the white house and described him as a great president let the record show that this particular great president just presided over the cruel and unjust death of his predecessor online ___ june 18 the los angeles times on the u s supreme court s ruling to try defendants on the state and federal level for the same offense the u s supreme court ruled on monday that if you are convicted in a state court of a criminal offense the federal government can put you on trial again for essentially the same crime and if you re convicted your new sentence can be added to your old one in our view that s a violation of the constitution s prohibition against double jeopardy in 2015 terance gamble s vehicle was searched at a traffic stop in alabama and a gun was found gamble who had a robbery conviction on his record pleaded guilty to a state charge of being a felon in possession of a firearm and was sentenced to a year in prison but he was also charged by the u s government for essentially the same crime arising from the same incident gamble pleaded guilty to the federal charge as well while preserving his right to challenge the second prosecution as a violation of the 5th amendment s command that no person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb in our view that s a violation of the constitution s prohibition against double jeopardy the justices rejected his argument monday by a 7 2 vote writing for the majority justice samuel a alito jr cited the court s longstanding view that the federal government and the states are separate sovereigns and that a crime under one sovereign s laws is not the same offense as a crime under the laws of another sovereign alito also emphasized that a ruling in gamble s favor would depart from 170 years of precedent the court shouldn t lightly cast aside precedents but there were several reasons for the court to do so in this case as justices ruth bader ginsburg and neil m gorsuch argued in persuasive dissents that put the focus where it should be on the injustice of subjecting anyone to two trials for the same crime ginsburg questioned the notion that the federal government and the states are separate sovereigns writing that it overlooks a basic tenet of our federal system namely that under the constitution ultimate sovereignty resides in the governed but even if the separate sovereigns theory once made sense ginsburg suggested that things changed with supreme court s decision in 1969 to apply the double jeopardy clause to the states as well as the federal government she s correct if federal and state prosecutions are governed by the same constitutional rules the double jeopardy clause prohibits successive prosecutions regardless of which level of government files the indictment in his dissent gorsuch pithily described the consequences of the majority s reasoning my colleagues say that the federal government and each state are separate sovereigns entitled to try the same person for the same crime so if all the might of one sovereign cannot succeed against the presumptively free individual another may insist on the chance to try again and if both manage to succeed so much the better they can add one punishment on top of the other the concerns expressed by ginsburg and gorsuch aren t new in a powerful dissent in a 1959 decision the late justice hugo black wrote if double punishment is what is feared it hurts no less for two sovereigns to inflict it than for one there are a few situations in which one can justify separate state and federal prosecutions arising from the same events the u s department of justice has brought federal civil rights prosecutions against defendants acquitted in state court of crimes of violence against racial minorities but ginsburg suggested in her dissent that federal civil rights laws and state laws criminalizing assault are different enough to qualify as separate offenses the state and federal charges against gamble were aimed at the same crime and motivated by the same purpose to punish felons found to be in the possession of a firearm the court should have ruled that under the constitution one prosecution was enough online ___ june 18 the boston herald on free college proposals announced by several democratic candidates for president among the panoply of giveaways promised by this election cycle s field of democrats is free college at least 15 candidates are all in and chances are that number will increase in april liz warren tweeted i m calling for universal free college and the cancellation of student loan debt for more than 95 of americans this is the kind of big structural change we need to make sure our kids have opportunity in this country the warren suite of free college and debt forgiveness would be paid for by the ultra millionaire wealth tax as would many of her other initiatives frontrunner joe biden has come out for two years of free college saying in may send everybody to a community college for free cutting in half the cost of their four year education biden s plan may fluctuate if his polling does and he has taken several positions on the issue over the years sen bernie sanders of vermont introduced legislation called the college for all act in 2017 it would have made college free for families making less than 125 000 a year if we can give a trillion dollars in tax breaks to people who don t need it we can make public colleges and universities tuition free all over this country and that s a very high priority for me he said earlier this year during a cnn town hall in march cory booker d n j declared we are going to go towards a system of debt free college free community college and make sure that certain professions like teachers if you re willing to teach or be a school professional especially in communities like orangeburg or newark we are going to forgive your debt in march sen kamala harris d calif along with dozens of members of congress reintroduced the debt free college act students in america should be able to go to college to further their careers without going deep into a financial hole she said in a press release pete buttigieg has come out against free college tuition and beto o rourke has held out supporting it wholeheartedly but has teased a preference for a two year college supplement not surprisingly none of the free college initiatives will actually be free for the taxpayers who will ultimately pay the bill also the recipients of most of this democratic goodwill will be americans who need it least middle class and somewhat wealthy students will benefit the most also what is to incentivize a student who receives free college to take courses or embark on a major that would be financially fruitful without the instant pressure of needing to address the expense of the education indeed what will incentivize students to finish a degree or certificate at all further if college is free enrollment numbers will skyrocket and more graduates will be spat out into the workforce with near identical resumes that will certainly drive down wages and reduce the prospect of employment at all for many free college will not be free for the taxpayer and will be a disservice for most students most of whom may want the handout but don t need it online ___ june 17 china daily on president xi jinping s visit to north korea courtesy demands reciprocity after kim jong un visited china four times in less than 10 months president xi jinping will pay a state visit to pyongyang on thursday and friday this would be the first visit to the democratic people s republic of korea by china s top state leader since 2005 unlike the conventional practice the foreign ministry usually briefs about xi s foreign trips in advance this time his visit to pyongyang was announced by the international department of the communist party of china central committee on monday evening highlighting the special significance attached to the trip that the foreign ministry has responded to questions on xi s possible visit to the dprk several times since last year shows the high hopes the world has pinned on china leveraging its unique influence to denuclearize the korean peninsula yet both pyongyang and beijing apparently want more than that as both define xi s visit which has been arranged despite his busy schedule in june as a crucial move to usher in a new chapter for their ties at their 70th anniversary carrying forward the camaraderie and brotherhood forged through the historical sacrifice of lives and blood given that both xi and kim are leaders of their parties armies and countries their meeting will deepen multipronged cooperation between the two sides it is noteworthy no matter how external circumstances have changed the two nations have maintained a high level of mutual trust and mutual understanding as they have always pursued close cultural and people to people exchanges during his four visits to china kim was keen to draw lessons from china s economic technological and social development the country has struck a good balance in promoting developments on all fronts through exploring a socialist path with chinese characteristics which appeals to the dprk s aspirations for independent development and its desire to improve its people s livelihoods it is believed that xi s visit to the dprk will present the opportunity for the two leaders to agree on some concrete cooperation projects based on the complementarity of the two economies also it is almost predictable as kim s previous four visits to china have indicated the two leaders will take the opportunity to further strengthen their strategic coordination on many regional and global issues concerning their common interests particularly the denuclearization process of the peninsula xi s visit is expected to inject new vitality into the ongoing peaceful resolution of the korean peninsula issues which is based on the conditions that pyongyang s core interests and security concerns are assured cherishing how far all relevant parties have come to reach this point and carrying forward the momentum of a political resolution to the peninsula denuclearization issue are in line with interests of all peoples online ___ june 15 the new york times on one city s attempt to tackle the problem of affordable housing housing is one area of american life where government really is the problem the united states is suffering from an acute shortage of affordable places to live particularly in the urban areas where economic opportunity increasingly is concentrated and perhaps the most important reason is that local governments are preventing construction don t be misled by the construction cranes that punctuate city skylines the number of housing units completed in the united states last year adjusted for the size of the population was lower than in any year between 1968 and 2008 and the problem is most acute in major urban areas along the east and west coasts housing prices and homelessness are rising across the country because there is not enough housing increasing the supply of urban housing would help to address a number of the problems plaguing the united states construction could increase economic growth and create blue collar jobs allowing more people to live in cities could mitigate inequality and reduce carbon emissions yet in most places housing construction remains wildly unpopular people who think of themselves as progressives environmentalists and egalitarians fight fiercely against urban development complaining about traffic and shadows and the sanctity of lawns that s why a recent breakthrough in minneapolis is so important the city s political leaders have constructed a broad consensus in favor of more housing and the centerpiece is both simple and brilliant minneapolis is ending single family zoning local governments regulate land use by chopping cities into zones specifying what can be built in each area this serves some valuable purposes like separating homes from heavy industry but mostly it serves to protect homeowners in many cities including minneapolis more than half of the city s land is reserved for single family homes people should be free to live in a prairie style house on a quarter acre lot in the middle of minneapolis so long as they can afford the land and taxes but zoning subsidizes that extravagance by prohibiting better more concentrated use of the land it allows people to own homes they could not afford if the same land could be used for an apartment building it is a huge entitlement program for the benefit of the most entitled residents the loose fabric of single family neighborhoods drives up the cost of housing by limiting the supply of available units it contributes to climate change by necessitating sprawl and long commutes it constrains the economic potential of cities by limiting growth in december the minneapolis city council voted 12 to 1 to allow construction of at least three residential units per lot throughout the city as part of a larger package of changes intended to increase housing construction under the plan most construction still will be concentrated in the center of the city and along transit corridors but the elimination of single family zoning was crucial in building political support for the plan ending a system under which more than 60 of minneapolis was sheltered from change cities are in constant evolution and we ve limited that evolution by mandating that two thirds of the city is exclusively single family said jacob frey the mayor who made affordable housing the key issue in his 2017 election campaign mr frey who is 37 said residents particularly younger residents want to live in a different kind of city than did their parents dense diverse vibrant and in order to achieve affordability and a diversity of housing options he said you first have to allow for it the affordable housing crisis cannot be solved by new construction alone at least not in the short term governments need to provide subsidized housing for people who cannot afford market rate housing but advocates for affordable housing should be jumping up and down and screaming for the construction of more high end apartment buildings to ease demand for existing homes those new buildings are filled with people who would otherwise be spending saturdays touring fixer uppers in neighborhoods newly named something like sofa with rapidly dwindling populations of longtime residents market rate construction also can help to reduce the need for public housing subsidies in the longer term today s market rate apartments will gradually become more affordable just as new cars become used cars the price of the average rental unit declines by 2 5 a year adjusting for inflation according to a 2014 study other regions are considering the minneapolis approach but proponents have run into stiff political opposition in california legislators from wealthy low density cities blocked a plan to increase construction that would have allowed fourplexes or four unit apartments throughout the state in seattle ambitious proposals were reduced to a bill that allows more development on about 6 of the city s residential land what went right in minneapolis the story begins with a crop of young politicians who want more housing the city is conducting an early experiment in government by and for millennials for the first time in the city s modern history more than half of its residents are renters including mayor frey many residents again younger people in particular also describe density as a necessary response to climate change environmentalism which began as an effort to protect people from cities is increasingly embracing cities as the best way to protect the planet from people linnea goderstad a 32 year old event planner who lives in a townhome just outside downtown minneapolis waited in a long line last year to testify in favor of the plan it was so stark she said of the generational divide among those who came to speak it was just so easy to guess just judging by age what side they were going to be on race also played a central role minneapolis is among the most segregated and unequal cities in america a fact at odds with its self image as a tolerant and diverse community the gap between white and black homeownership is the widest in any of the 100 cities with the largest black populations 75 of whites own their homes compared with just 25 of blacks the 2015 shooting of jamar clark a black man killed by minneapolis police officers focused the anger of the city s black residents and it persuaded some of their neighbors to listen more carefully in the ensuing debates many residents said they were surprised to learn that single family zoning in minneapolis as in other cities had deep roots in efforts to enforce racial segregation cities found that banning apartment construction in white neighborhoods was an effective proxy for racial discrimination and the practice spread after it was validated by the supreme court in 1926 in minneapolis the current political leaders argued that ending single family zoning was a necessary step to rectify that history of racial discrimination on many city lawns signs that read neighbors for more neighbors stood alongside signs that read black lives matter all of this deserves wide emulation by other american cities but minneapolis has an important advantage its housing prices still are relatively modest so its population includes a lot of middle class families housing debates in coastal cities pit the wealthy against the poor and middle ground has been hard to find lisa bender the president of the minneapolis city council lived in new york and san francisco before returning to her hometown and she is convinced that minneapolis has a narrow window to address its problems while a political consensus still is possible the hope is that all of these things together will at least slow things down enough to not reach that tipping point she said referring to the problems on the coasts if the city does not build and prices keep rising everything becomes more

powell has insisted on the central bank s political independence with no letup in pressure from the white house the federal reserve on wednesday began the final day of a policy meeting that will be closely scrutinized for signs of a critical shift in direction on interest rates most fed watchers do not expect the central bank to move rates at the conclusion of the two day meeting but nonetheless believe it will signal it is inclined to cut rates in the future possibly soon to add some juice to the economy fed chief jerome powell is walking a tightrope between economic necessity and president donald trump s insistent demands that the us central bank lower the benchmark lending rate to supercharge growth trumpn tuesday afternoon continued his jabs at the fed implying that he was considering demoting powell let s see what he does trump told reporters when asked if he was planning to remove powell from the top position that came after his top economic adviser larry kudlow denied news reports the white house was considering action against powell whom trump picked to lead the bank trump charged the fed had denied him a level playing field compared to the easy monetary policy in europe the fed has raised rates nine times in recent years as the us economy has recovered from the global financial crisis i want to be given a level playing field so far i haven t been trump said he also blasted european central bank chief mario draghi who hinted tuesday at further eurozone interest rate cuts which drove the euro down against the dollar trump criticized the dramatic signal as a way to gain an advantage over the united states regardless of trump s jawboning the fed may already be headed toward doing precisely what the president wants lowering the key lending rate for the first time in a decade walking a tightrope amid signs the global economy has begun to sputter and as trump s multi front trade wars begin their second year top policymakers have hinted in recent weeks that they could be open to easing monetary policy us federal reserve the fomc will release its updated quarterly forecasts on wednesday along with the policy announcement but economists worldwide will be focused most closely on powell s press conference after the meeting futures markets on tuesday were overwhelmingly predicting rate cuts in july and september and some economists said there was no need for the fed to wait that long jim o sullivan of high frequency economics said he expects the fed to express enough concern about downside risk for growth and inflation to encourage expectations for at least some easing before long however he said that might not be enough for markets which could be disappointed if the statements don t go far enough major us indices rose one percent or more on tuesday on optimism about the fed and upbeat comments from the us and china ahead of next week s g20 summit but opened flat on wednesday as they awaited the fed announcement the world s largest economy has given off mixed signals in recent months with slowing job gains weak manufacturing and sluggish home construction offset by healthy consumer spending very low unemployment and tepid inflation fears about a growing risk of a us recession slackening growth in europe and asia and the intensifying trade war with china have caused investors to clamor for support from the fed but kathy bostjancic chief us financial economist at oxford economics told afp the fed would likely walk a fine line of suggesting a rate cut was possible but not guaranteed so far economic data do not justify easing policy she added i also believe the downside risks have increased but they haven t yet seen the evidence in the hard data to suggest a rate cut is warranted she said

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com when a business is entering the canadian economy there are a number of international trade considerations it should be aware of for example the duties taxes and or surtaxes that may apply to the importation of products and the trade agreements that apply to reduce those border costs canada s international trade rules can have a significant impact on a business s success in entering and operating in canada a selection of those rules are examined below including international trade agreements government procurement investment treaties export and import controls sanctions customs and border administration trade remedies anti corruption laws international trade agreements canada is a trading nation that is heavily committed to a multilateral rules based system and is an active promoter of plurilateral and bilateral trade agreements it is a founding member of the world trade organization wto and is party to dozens of other trade agreements including the comprehensive economic and trade agreement ceta the north american free trade agreement nafta the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp and the canadian free trade agreement cfta canada recently signed the canada united states mexico agreement cusma which will replace nafta once it has been ratified by the three countries wto the wto was established in 1995 to create a rules based trading system it accomplished that through a number of agreements covering trade in goods services and intellectual property dispute resolution public procurement and government trade policy the core principles of these agreements are a the reduction of tariffs and b non discrimination through obligations to provide national treatment and most favoured nation treatment of the goods services and investors of the member states nafta nafta has governed trade between canada the united states and mexico since 1994 and brought about an integrated north american economic space for trade in goods and many services the agreement eliminates most tariff barriers and provides investment protection enhanced access to government procurement and effective dispute resolution among parties nafta provides a process through which us and mexican investors can use international arbitration to challenge canadian measures they consider to be expropriatory discriminatory or otherwise unfair and inequitable investors do not need the permission or support of their home state to bring forward such challenges cusma cusma was signed on november 30 2018 and is intended to replace nafta once all three countries have ratified it with some notable exceptions the scope and content of cusma reflects that of nafta so it will be business as usual for most companies the exceptions include significant changes for the auto and dairy sectors government procurement investor protection and data transfers greater north american content in autos and auto parts is now required including a requirement that certain content be produced by workers earning at least us 16 an hour and us dairy producers have been granted increased access to canada s lucrative dairy sector the nafta rules governing government procurement have been eliminated and suppliers in each of the three countries will lose the privileged access they enjoyed under nafta to the procurement markets in the other two countries the sweeping investor protection measures found in nafta have also been eliminated so us and mexican investors in canada will lose their right to use international arbitration to challenge canadian measures they will however retain their right to challenge canadian measures in canadian courts finally the new agreement bans restrictions on data transfers across borders meaning that canada cannot require companies based in the united states or mexico to store data within canada ceta ceta is a comprehensive trade agreement between canada and the european union eu and covers virtually all sectors of trade between canada and the eu it came into force provisionally on september 21 2017 and immediately eliminated 98 of customs tariffs within seven years 99 of customs tariffs on qualifying goods will be duty free in addition ceta s government procurement chapter gives canadian suppliers privileged access to the huge eu public procurement market from the eu institutional level down through national and provincial governments to public institutions at the municipal academic school board and health sector levels given ceta s massive scope and coverage and enough time for its full benefits to be realized ceta may prove to be the most significant trade agreement canada has signed since nafta cptpp the cptpp came into force on december 30 2018 and governs trade between canada and 10 countries australia brunei chile japan malaysia mexico new zealand peru singapore and vietnam privileged access to the japanese market will be the most important gain for canada in the short term especially for canada s agricultural industry the member countries obligations include a reducing tariffs and technical barriers and b providing investment protection temporary entry for certain business persons and access to government procurement to ensure compliance there is a dispute settlement process available to the member countries canadian free trade agreement cfta building on the agreement on internal trade the canadian federal government and the governments of the provinces and territories negotiated the cfta with the aim of improving trade in goods and services within canada it came into force on july 1 2017 government procurement nafta the wto agreement on government procurement ceta and the cfta each contain a chapter on government procurement that is aimed at increasing access to procurement opportunities and imposing rules on procuring entities to ensure fair and open procurement when suppliers believe the canadian procurement entity has not complied with its procurement obligations under the trade agreements they may challenge the contract award before the canadian international trade tribunal citt if the citt determines that the complaint is valid it may recommend that a new solicitation be issued the bids be re evaluated the existing contract be terminated and the contract awarded to the complainant or the complainant be compensated for its loss of the contract investment treaties investment treaties which can be stand alone agreements or contained in a comprehensive free trade agreement seek to ensure that foreign investors are treated in a non discriminatory way both compared to domestic investors and to other foreign investors such treaties also require that foreign investors be given fair and equitable treatment and prohibit expropriation without compensation virtually all of canada s investment treaties provide a dispute settlement process that allows the foreign investor to challenge a government measure before arbitration panels appointed by both the investor and the defending government if the arbitral tribunal finds that the canadian measure did not comply with canada s obligations under the treaty it may order that damage be paid to the investor such awards are enforceable against canada under international law as noted above the investor protection provisions of nafta were eliminated in cusma three years after cusma comes into force the investor state dispute resolution process established under nafta will be eliminated entities from the united states and mexico doing business in canada will no longer have access to dispute settlement procedures recourse under domestic law will however remain an option export and import controls global affairs canada administers canada s export controls pursuant to the export and import permits act eipa export controls three lists govern the exportation of goods and technology from canada the export control list the area control list and the automatic firearms country control list the export control list identifies goods and technology that require an export permit in order to be exported or transferred from canada the list is categorized into the following groups dual use items items that have both a civilian and military purpose such as computers munitions nuclear non proliferation items nuclear related dual use goods missile equipment and technology chemical and biological weapons and miscellaneous goods and technology including all us origin goods and technology certain medical products and agricultural and forest products and strategic items when exporting goods from canada it is important to first determine whether or not it is included on the export control list the area control list is a list of countries to which canada maintains a virtual prohibition of any exportation of goods technology and services currently the democratic people s republic of korea north korea is the only country on the list that said canada does maintain sanctions against a number of other countries where the exportation of goods technology and services is severely limited canada s sanctions regime is discussed below the automatic firearms country control list restricts the export of firearms weapons and devices and identifies countries for which global affairs canada might issue an export permit in terms of the type of permit exporters have three options an individual export permit a multiple destination permit or a general export permit an individual export permit allows the export of controlled goods or technology to specific recipients in a specific country a multiple destination permit allows the export of most dual use items to 26 countries including the united kingdom and south korea and a general export permit is granted to all residents of canada and allows the export to certain specified destinations under certain conditions only two such permits have been issued by the minister of foreign affairs both of which were related to cryptography technology import controls import controls are governed by the import control list which sets out a list of goods that are subject to import permit requirements the list includes firearms certain chemicals and certain agricultural products such as meat and dairy in some cases e g firearms a permit is required before the goods can be imported into canada in other cases such as agricultural goods subject to a tariff rate quota the products may be imported without a permit but will be subject to a prohibitive tariff that can be as high as 270 controlled goods program the controlled goods program is designed for companies in the defence industry companies and individuals dealing with goods or technology that are subject to the defence production act must register under the controlled goods program prior to possessing or transferring controlled goods the goods listed in the controlled goods regulations are generally ones of strategic significance or that have national security implications for canada a business involved in the export of controlled goods from canada should be aware that registration with the controlled goods program is a prerequisite to receiving an export permit from global affairs canada it is especially important for a company to be aware of the controlled goods regulations when it is acquiring a business in canada or investing in such a business involvement in the research manufacture or sale of items on the controlled goods regulations is a factor that the government will consider in assessing whether or not to conduct a national security review of an investment an unsuccessful national security review could result in an order of divestiture nuclear products one final control to be aware of when transporting goods to or from canada is the nuclear non proliferation import and export control regulations in order to import or export a controlled nuclear substance nuclear equipment or controlled nuclear information a risk significant radioactive source or any product designed or modified for a nuclear end use a licence must be obtained from the canadian nuclear safety commission businesses entering the canadian market through a merger or an acquisition or businesses that are simply changing their corporate name should know that such licences may generally be transferred to another licensee or licence applicant as long as there is no significant change in the licensed activity sanctions canada has five statutes that authorize the imposition of trade and economic sanctions the united nations act the special economic measures act the freezing assets of corrupt foreign officials act the criminal code and the justice for victims of corrupt foreign officials act global affairs canada is responsible for administering canada s economic sanctions on a number of countries sanctions giving effect to un security council resolutions are imposed under the authority of the united nations act sanctions imposed unilaterally by canada are found under the special economic measures act depending on the country and the sanctions imposed the sanctions may prohibit activities such as conducting transactions with certain individuals or entities exporting certain products to a certain country or transferring technical data to a person or an entity of a sanctioned country the sanctions may also allow the canadian government to seize or freeze assets located in canada this is a complex and constantly changing area involving multiple legislative schemes including sanctions imposed by canada measures imposed by any other countries a business operates in and us sanctions that apply extraterritorially therefore it is important for a business to screen the companies it does business with and the individuals who own or control them many businesses engage a third party screening company to conduct this due diligence customs and border administration the canada border services agency cbsa administers customs laws along with a myriad of other laws that regulate how goods may be sold on the canadian market the customs act imposes a general duty to report the importation of all goods into canada and specifies how goods are valued for duty purposes provides the tariff preferences granted under free trade agreements and regulates the authority of the cbsa the schedule to the customs tariff lists the customs duty for each item in accordance with its classification under the harmonized classification system and importers are required to correctly classify their goods and pay the appropriate duties and taxes in addition to levying duties the cbsa also administers duty relief programs and the collection of several other taxes such as the gst hst excise taxes and surtaxes as required if an importer makes a mistake in its declaration the cbsa generally has four years from the date of the importation to force the importer to correct the declaration and pay any additional duties and or taxes that may result from the correction the cbsa s decisions on most issues such as valuations classifications or tariff preference eligibility may be appealed both within the cbsa and eventually to the citt trade remedies the special import measures act protects canadian producers from the injurious effects of dumped or subsidized imports by providing rules and procedures for investigations into complaints of dumping and subsidies and the imposition of duties in response dumping occurs when a product is imported into canada at a price that is lower than the profitable selling price of the product in the exporting country or at a price that is lower than the cost of producing the product a subsidy is a financial or other benefit granted to the manufacturer of the exported goods by the government of the exporting country final anti dumping and countervailing duties will only be imposed where the cbsa has determined that the goods have been dumped and or subsidized and the citt has determined that the dumping and subsidization caused or threatened to cause material injury to the canadian industry while a full investigation may take up to a year to complete the cbsa usually imposes provisional duties within 90 days of launching an investigation canada also has a domestic safeguards regime in place to protect domestic producers in cases where no dumping or subsidization is occurring but where increased volumes of imports into canada are causing or threatening to cause serious injury to canadian producers anti corruption laws canada has a number of laws to combat corruption the corruption of foreign public officials act prohibits the payment of bribes to foreign public officials for the purpose of obtaining a business advantage within canada the act applies to both canadians and non canadians it also applies to canadian citizens permanent residents and canadian corporations in their activities outside of canada it applies to non canadians only if the offence is committed at least in part in canada the criminal code prohibits bribes to canadian officials including judges members of parliament police officers and government officials this prohibition applies to both canadians and non canadians download this chapter the content of this article

this month the u s economy recorded a milestone the economy has now expanded longer than ever before very precisely the time since the end of the last recession dated by the national bureau of economic research june 2009 is longer than for any recorded business cycle the nber whose dating is considered the most definitive has dated business cycles back to 1854 longevity is always remarkable a combination of skill and luck in this case the longevity of the expansion may have the most to do with its weakness using the nber s dates i calculated how much the u s economy grew during all of the post world war ii expansions whether i include the time of recession or not i find that the expansion of the 1960s was the largest followed by the 1990s and then the 1980s this expansion is not even close the total real gdp growth of 24 5 percent since june 2009 pales in comparison to the 51 7 percent of the 1960s or the 42 4 percent of the 1990s even if this expansion lasted another year or two it would not equal those earlier achievements to get a sense of why this expansion has been so weak we can think back to the dire situation of 2009 policymakers in most of the advanced world were throwing everything they had at the meltdown of the world financial system and the stomach churning collapse of hitherto prosperous economies governments ramped up spending and cut taxes central banks cut interest rates and bought unheard of quantities of bonds banks were rescued and the regulatory rules were rewritten recovery necessarily had to take time the damage was too great to repair quickly however in the first blush of the crisis policymakers did have a great sense of urgency in the u s the big reversal came in 2011 with the dramatic confrontation between the obama administration and the republican controlled house of representatives resulting in deficit reduction through the sequester by that time the headwinds from the greek crisis and the beginnings of the european debt crisis were also slowing u s growth these two mammoth fiscal events slowed down growth in the u s and europe both the fed and the european central bank tried their best to prevent the slowdown from turning into another recession and possibly deflation the situation in the u s was less dire and growth wobbled but never died off europe was less fortunate thanks to the few policy efforts that the obama administration was able to get through congress such as extended unemployment insurance the redoubled efforts of the fed and the sheer resilience of the u s economy the recovery chugged on the premature removal of fiscal stimulus prolonged the agony of a weak labor market costing millions opportunities to work low wage growth became chronic labor force participation fell and many americans either left the labor force or had to keep working far beyond their planned retirement age it was an even more joyless recovery than it would have been without the unforced austerity with the arrival of the new administration in 2017 the economy has continued its expansion europe was on the upswing providing a little bit of extra lift the trump administration s deregulatory onslaught probably enhanced short term growth a bit at the expense of workers and the environment the 2018 tax cuts provided a further stimulus albeit a remarkably weak one for the enormous price tag the expansion has continued at times fairly robust at times less so unlike in the late 1970s or early 1990s inflation stayed low and this kept the expansion alive as the late massachusetts institute of technology economist rudiger dornbusch once said none of the u s expansions of the past 40 years died in bed of old age every one was murdered by the federal reserve in both the 1970s and 1990s the fed s interest rate increases aimed at controlling inflation and cooling down an overheated economy caused the economy to tumble into recession this time the fed raised rates cautiously perhaps slowing the expansion but not causing recession now we are at a longevity record unemployment is low but many are still left out of the job market living long is great but it is even better when accompanied by robust health we do not have that luxury at the moment evan kraft is the economist in residence for the economics department at american university he served as director of the research department and adviser to the governor of the croatian national bank

european leaders agreed to nominate lagard director of the international monetary fund imf for the post of governor of the european central bank replacing mario draghi whose term expires in october the reaction to the eur usd performance was limited as the pair remains stable and below the support level of 1 1300 to 1 1276 the general trend of the pair as shown on the chart below is still bearish the pair s recent upward correction was very weak as the us dollar gained stronger momentum after a truce was declared to stop imposing more tariffs between the united states and china after the positive results from the trump and xi summit on the sidelines of the g20 summit in japan we have mentioned in the previous technical analysis that the bullish correction for the pair is still weak and is expected to decline again if the euro does not find stronger catalysts that is as expectations of a rate cut to the negative region by the european central bank ecb amid growing weakness in economic data from the eurozone markets are constantly questioning trump s policy and the fears still linger over its trade file with china as they have often been negotiating and eventually new tariffs were imposed us economic growth figures have not changed as expected but economists expect the us economy to start slowing from the next announcement with trump s stimulus plans evaporating the continuation of the global trade war means that the eurozone economy is slowing increasingly and the euro may lose its recent gains and more both the european central bank and the federal reserve have confirmed readiness to cut interest rates to cope with the economic slowdown the recent us economic data confirm the us economic slowdown and therefore market expectations are that the us interest rate could be reduced as soon as possible technically we had expected and recommended in the previous analysis for a long time to sell the pair from every ascending level turning to the eur usd bullish trend needs a move towards the resistance levels 1 1355 1 1440 and 1 1515 to confirm the upward correction strength on the bearish side the nearest support levels are currently 1 1240 and 1 1180 respectively there has been no signs of a strong bullish correction on the way on the economic data front the pair will watch for the eurozone retail sales data there are no important data from the u s as today is the 4th of july holiday
