international economic conditions members commenced their discussion of the global economy by noting that growth in australia s major trading partners had been above trend despite moderating in the second half of 2018 growth in major trading partners was forecast to be around trend in 2019 and 2020 however the downside risks to the global outlook had increased in the preceding few months members noted that it was difficult to predict the effectiveness of recent policy measures in china and how the authorities would balance their objectives of supporting growth and containing financial risks trade tensions and signs of slowing domestic demand had also increased the risks to the outlook for china more broadly trade tensions remained a material risk to the global growth outlook us exports to china and chinese exports to the united states had fallen sharply in late 2018 as a result of earlier tariff increases there had been ongoing speculation that the united states might impose tariffs on automotive imports which would affect imports from germany and japan some economies particularly in the east asian region had been affected by the trade tensions because they provide inputs to chinese exports as part of global supply chains a number of economies had also faced a moderation in export growth because chinese domestic demand had slowed however members noted that there had also been reports of firms accelerating existing plans to shift production from china to other low cost producers in the east asian region labour markets had tightened further in most advanced economies and wages growth had increased core inflation had picked up to be close to target in some advanced economies but remained low in others headline inflation had declined towards the end of 2018 because oil prices had fallen by almost 30 per cent from their peak in october gdp growth in the united states had remained strong over 2018 fiscal stimulus and strong employment growth had supported consumption growth the labour market had continued to tighten in early 2019 and wages growth had picked up however the outlook for investment had softened some measures of business and consumer confidence had fallen sharply in january however members noted that it was difficult to determine whether this reflected uncertainty associated with volatility in financial markets or a genuine deterioration in the circumstances facing businesses and consumers gdp growth in japan was expected to recover after the sharp slowing in the september quarter which had mainly reflected disruptions from natural disasters growth in consumption had been supported by a strong labour market and a pick up in wages growth members noted that consumption would receive a short term boost as consumers brought forward spending ahead of an increase in the consumption tax in october recent data suggested that business conditions in japan had also remained positive by contrast growth in output in the euro area had slowed over 2018 reflecting a combination of weaker external demand especially from china and some localised factors that could have persistent effects particularly if they were not resolved quickly investment intentions and surveyed business conditions had fallen recently in the euro area gdp growth in china had slowed in 2018 as had been expected given the earlier tightening in financial conditions however there were signs that underlying momentum in the chinese economy had slowed by more than suggested by the gdp data the authorities had responded with further targeted policy measures many of these measures were aimed at encouraging spending on infrastructure which had led to a lift in growth in public infrastructure investment and an upgrade to the outlook for steel demand in india crude steel production had remained high in 2018 despite an easing in gdp growth overall the improved outlook for steel demand and stockpiling ahead of the chinese new year had supported prices for iron ore at the end of 2018 and earlier increases in oil prices had boosted liquefied natural gas lng prices as a result australia s terms of trade were expected to have increased in the december quarter iron ore prices had increased further in 2019 following the collapse of a tailings dam at an iron ore mine in brazil and the subsequent closure of a number of other similar mines members observed that iron ore prices could remain high for some time but prices were still expected to decline over the medium term looking ahead the effect of higher iron ore prices on the terms of trade was expected to be offset by the effect of lower prices for lng as the decline in oil prices since october gradually feeds through domestic economic conditions the september quarter national accounts had been released the day after the december meeting members noted that growth in real gdp of 0 3 per cent in the quarter and 2 8 per cent over the year had been noticeably below expectations there had also been downward revisions to gdp growth in previous quarters which had subtracted around ¼ percentage point from the year ended growth rate taking account of this and other information the bank had revised down its forecast for growth in the australian economy by around ¼ percentage point for both 2019 and 2020 this primarily reflected a modest downgrading of the outlook for household consumption and residential construction the outlook had also become more uncertain over the preceding few months growth in gdp was expected to be around 3 per cent over 2019 supported by accommodative monetary policy and ongoing strength in public spending and business investment further gradual tightening in the labour market was expected to support growth in household income and consequently growth in household consumption gdp growth was expected to moderate to 2¾ per cent over 2020 because lng output was expected to reach targeted levels of production and would therefore no longer materially add to growth dwelling investment was also expected to decline more sharply than previously expected consistent with the decline in residential building approvals and the fall in housing prices growth in consumption had slowed to 2½ per cent over the year to the september quarter revisions to previously published data made it difficult to assess the underlying momentum of consumption over the preceding year on balance the slower reported growth in consumption together with subdued growth in retail sales in the december quarter and the likely effect of lower housing prices and reduced housing market activity on consumption warranted a downward revision to the outlook for consumption as a result year ended growth in consumption was expected to pick up only a little over the forecast period members noted that uncertainty about the recent momentum of consumption and factors affecting households future consumption decisions remained a key risk for the domestic economic outlook dwelling investment was likely to have been close to its peak in the second half of 2018 although there was still a large pipeline of residential work to be done and few signs that projects already under way were being cancelled it had become more difficult for new apartment projects to obtain finance and building approvals were the lowest they had been for five years as a result dwelling investment was expected to remain at a high level in the near term but then to decline faster than previously expected members noted the uncertainty about the extent and speed of the downturn in the dwelling investment cycle non mining investment had been flat in the september quarter non residential construction had declined but the pipeline of work yet to be done had remained relatively high suggesting that non residential construction would recover in coming quarters investment in machinery equipment and computer software had grown solidly in the september quarter a reasonably positive outlook for investment was supported by continued growth in corporate profits and accommodative financial conditions for larger firms although conditions for smaller firms had been more constrained while information from liaison implied that the economy had reasonable momentum around the turn of the year surveyed business conditions had declined to around their long run average a large pipeline of projects was expected to support growth in public investment over the following year mining investment had fallen in the september quarter liaison had suggested that very little additional spending was needed to bring the remaining lng projects on line mining investment was expected to increase over the forecast period as mining firms invest to maintain production this outlook was supported by mining firms profitability having remained strong members noted that the declines in mining investment that had weighed on growth for the previous six years were close to an end and instead mining investment was expected to make a small contribution to output growth in the forecast period recent trade data suggested that supply disruptions had continued to affect resource exports in the december quarter farm output had fallen by 8 per cent over the year to the september quarter subtracting around ¼ percentage point from year ended gdp growth members noted that the outlook for the farm sector continued to depend on the timing and magnitude of rainfall drier than average conditions in key farming areas were expected to continue in the near term recent trade data suggested that rural exports had fallen in the december quarter and the australian bureau of agricultural and resource economics and sciences had revised down its forecast for farm production in 2018 19 members noted the continued improvement in conditions in the labour market and that the labour market data had been stronger than other data on economic activity employment had continued to grow faster than the working age population in the december quarter with most of this growth in full time employment forward looking indicators had been consistent with above average employment growth over the first half of 2019 the unemployment rate had declined to 5 per cent which was the lowest rate since 2011 and lower than had been expected a year earlier labour market conditions had been particularly strong in new south wales and victoria where unemployment rates had fallen to be between 4 and 4½ per cent the national unemployment rate was expected to edge a little lower to around 4¾ per cent over the following few years tightening labour market conditions were expected to put upward pressure on wages although to date wages growth in australia and elsewhere had been slower to pick up than in previous expansions turning to the latest data on inflation members noted that inflation had remained low in the december quarter with both headline and underlying inflation a little under ½ per cent in the quarter and around 1¾ per cent over the year headline inflation had been lower than forecast largely because fuel prices had been lower than expected in the quarter domestic cost pressures had been relatively subdued partly because wages growth had remained low more recently utilities prices had increased only modestly after substantial increases in previous years and inflation in the prices of other administered services had declined noticeably as a result of government pricing decisions strong competition in the retail sector had continued to dampen inflation although deflationary pressures in the retail sector appeared to have eased somewhat in the december quarter this could have reflected some pass through of the modest depreciation of the australian dollar over 2018 the drought had also contributed to higher retail inflation for food particularly meat inflation in rents had remained subdued and data on newly advertised rents suggested there was little prospect of a pick up in the near term rent inflation had started to trend lower in sydney where the rental vacancy rate had risen and was expected to rise further in the near term as more supply becomes available rents in perth had fallen further although the pace of deflation had eased inflation in the cost of new housing construction had trended lower despite the high level of dwelling investment members noted that the inflation outcome for the december quarter had been fairly close to expectations however the forecast pick up in underlying inflation was now expected to occur a little later than previously expected mainly as a result of the lower forecast for growth in gdp and downside risks to utilities and administered price inflation in the near term underlying inflation was expected to increase to 2 per cent by the end of 2019 previously by mid 2019 and to reach 2¼ per cent by the end of 2020 headline inflation was expected to fall to 1¼ per cent in mid 2019 as a result of the fall in fuel prices since the december quarter on the assumption the lower oil price is sustained members spent some time considering a paper on the implications of recent developments in housing markets for the economic outlook after rising by almost 50 per cent over the five years to september 2017 national housing prices had fallen by around 8 per cent to be back around mid 2016 levels members noted the significantly different developments in housing prices across the country housing prices had fallen by 12 per cent in sydney and by 9 per cent in melbourne from their peaks in 2017 there had also been significant falls in housing prices in perth and darwin over recent years by contrast housing prices in hobart and canberra had increased over 2018 while housing prices in adelaide brisbane and many regional centres had been flat members noted that the cumulative falls in housing prices in sydney and melbourne were relatively large by historical standards and that it was unusual for housing prices to fall significantly in an environment of low mortgage interest rates and a declining unemployment rate members noted that some of the dynamics in housing prices could be explained by the fact that the supply of housing does not respond quickly to changes in demand in particular the run up in housing prices had occurred during a period when housing supply had not picked up sufficiently to match higher demand from more rapid population growth over time higher housing prices had eventually led to a sizeable increase in supply but this had taken longer than in previous cycles another factor weighing on prices was a noticeable decline in demand from foreign buyers in recent years which had also been apparent in housing markets in some other economies rental vacancy rates are one key indicator of the balance of supply and demand in the housing market in most states rental vacancies had been around or somewhat below average at the end of 2018 suggesting supply and demand for housing had been roughly balanced in melbourne despite the fall in prices and large increase in supply the vacancy rate had declined by contrast rental vacancies in sydney had been increasing and advertised rents had fallen members also noted that housing credit growth had declined further in preceding months and that there had been a notable drop in loan approvals by the major banks growth in lending to investors had slowed sharply since mid 2017 to be close to zero while growth in lending to owner occupiers had moderated to around 5½ per cent in six month ended annualised terms the slower growth in lending for housing over the preceding year appeared to reflect weaker demand nevertheless credit conditions for some borrowers had remained tighter than they had been for some time following the strengthening of lending policies and practices over recent years liaison with mortgage brokers suggested that the increased public scrutiny associated with the royal commission into misconduct in the banking superannuation and financial services industry may have led some individual loan assessors at banks to apply stricter criteria than specified in official lending requirements however banks reported that while loan assessors had been referring more approvals to credit officers final loan approval rates had remained high moreover lenders had continued to compete for borrowers of high credit quality by offering new loans at lower interest rates than those offered on existing loans from a longer run perspective members assessed that following such large increases in housing prices the effect of the recent price falls on overall economic activity was expected to be relatively small however members observed that if prices were to fall much further consumption could be weaker than forecast which would result in lower gdp growth higher unemployment and lower inflation than forecast from a financial stability perspective tighter lending standards an improving labour market and low interest rates were all likely to support households capacity to service their debt few households were in negative equity positions despite the falls in housing prices implying that banks losses would be limited even if household financial stress were to become more widespread financial markets turning to other financial market developments members observed that while housing credit growth had declined business credit growth had strengthened over 2018 with contributions from the foreign banks and the major banks however this growth had been driven by increased lending to large businesses members observed that conditions had tightened somewhat in a number of australian financial markets in line with global developments spreads of bank bond yields to australian government bonds had widened a little reflecting a global rise in risk premiums nevertheless yields on bank bonds were little changed around the level of the preceding few years given the decline in australian government bond yields australian equity prices had declined in the december quarter along with global equity markets but had recovered in january to be back around their october levels members noted that share prices of australian banks had risen on the morning of the meeting following the release of the final report of the royal commission and the government s response the preceding afternoon money market interest rates had remained higher than a year earlier contributing to a small increase in banks funding costs over the period since then in response most lenders had increased their standard variable mortgage interest rates a little since mid 2018 however the effect of rising standard variable rates had been partly offset by borrowers refinancing at lower rates given the strong competition for low risk borrowers members noted that overall mortgage interest rates remained relatively low turning to global financial markets members observed that financial conditions had tightened somewhat in recent months in most advanced economies with increased volatility and a general rise in equity and credit risk premiums nevertheless there had been a partial retracement of the tightening in recent weeks and financial conditions remained accommodative at its january meeting the us federal open market committee fomc had left the federal funds rate unchanged and removed its forward guidance for further interest rate increases the fomc had emphasised that it would be patient in making any future adjustments to the federal funds rate and that future monetary policy decisions would be more closely guided by the incoming data because interest rates were closer to estimates of neutral the fomc had also indicated that it would be open to slowing the pace of its planned balance sheet reduction if warranted by economic or market developments financial market pricing had shifted to imply that the next move in the federal funds rate was expected to be down although this was not expected to occur until at least late 2020 elsewhere the european central bank and the bank of japan were expected to maintain their stimulatory policy settings for an extended period members noted that government bond yields had declined across the major global markets over the preceding two months reflecting the downward shift in expectations for future policy rates along with a fall in compensation for future inflation following falls in oil prices these changes had also reflected increased concerns about downside risks to the outlook for global growth australian government bond yields had declined broadly in line with global developments with long term government bond yields in australia remaining around 50 basis points below those in the united states there had been a modest depreciation of the us dollar in nominal trade weighted terms since late 2018 reflecting the more noticeable shift in the outlook for monetary policy in the united states than in other major economies members noted that the depreciation had been more pronounced against the japanese yen which had appreciated to around its highest level in two years on a trade weighted basis the chinese renminbi had also appreciated modestly over the preceding month reflecting the depreciation of the us dollar as well as signs of some progress on us china trade negotiations the australian dollar had depreciated a little further in nominal trade weighted terms over the preceding two months largely reflecting the appreciation of the yen and renminbi however overall the australian dollar had remained within the range observed over the preceding few years members observed that there had been two broadly offsetting influences on the australian dollar exchange rate over the preceding year the increase in commodity prices and the terms of trade had been supporting the australian dollar over this period while the relative decline in australian government bond yields had been working in the opposite direction in global capital markets corporate bond spreads had risen in recent months and bond issuance had eased particularly for lower rated borrowers there had been some retracement of the increase in corporate borrowing costs in early 2019 similarly global equity markets had declined sharply in late 2018 before recovering somewhat since the widening in credit spreads and decline in equity prices had reflected lower expectations for corporate earnings growth as well as a rise in the risk premium demanded by investors however members observed that overall borrowing costs for corporations had remained low as a result of low government bond yields and the corrections in these markets had followed an extended period of elevated valuations particularly in the united states in china the authorities had implemented further targeted measures to support lending to private firms particularly small sized enterprises in the context of slowing economic growth these firms access to finance had been tightened over the course of 2018 as a result of earlier measures by the authorities to reduce risks in the financial system by restricting the availability of shadow finance since the latter part of 2018 the authorities had been encouraging banks to increase their lending to these types of firms although members noted that larger banks were less accustomed to lending to this sector members noted that conditions in other emerging markets had stabilised in recent months following a tightening in conditions during 2018 currencies had appreciated equity prices had risen bond spreads had narrowed and capital outflows had moderated across a number of emerging market economies these developments had reflected policy adjustments in some countries lower policy rate expectations in the united states and the associated depreciation of the us dollar and for oil importing countries the decline in oil prices however members noted that there remained a risk that financial conditions in emerging markets could tighten further concerns about trade tensions and a slowdown in growth particularly in china remained particularly important for emerging markets in asia financial market pricing implied that the australian cash rate was expected to remain unchanged for a considerable period with some expectation of a decrease by late 2019 considerations for monetary policy in considering the stance of monetary policy members observed that the global economy had continued to grow at an above trend pace in 2018 although growth had moderated in some economies in the second half of the year in particular growth in china had slowed further and the authorities had continued to ease policy in a targeted way to support growth while continuing to pay close attention to risks in the financial sector labour markets in the advanced economies had continued to tighten and wages growth had picked up core inflation had picked up in a number of economies including the united states globally lower oil prices had led to a decline in headline inflation growth in australia s major trading partners was expected to be around trend over the following year or so but the downside risks had increased slowing growth in china and ongoing trade tensions had led to lower growth in global trade forecasters had lowered their outlook for global growth and market participants no longer expected a further tightening of monetary policy in the united states government bond yields had also declined in most countries including australia more broadly however financial conditions had tightened somewhat in most major advanced economies but remained accommodative the terms of trade had remained above their trough in early 2016 and the australian dollar had remained within its narrow range of recent times domestically growth in output had been weaker than expected in the september quarter nevertheless growth was expected to be a little above trend over the forecast period the outlook for business investment and spending on public infrastructure was positive growth in consumption was expected to be supported by a pick up in growth in household disposable income although recent data had prompted a downward revision to the consumption outlook the outlook for consumption continued to be one of the key uncertainties for the forecasts for the domestic economy given the environment of declining housing prices low growth in household income and high debt levels following a significant increase in construction activity and a large run up in housing prices housing markets were going through a period of adjustment housing prices in sydney and melbourne had declined further and the outlook for dwelling investment had been revised lower in sydney rental vacancy rates had been increasing and rent inflation remained low across the country credit conditions had tightened for some borrowers and the demand for credit in the housing market particularly by investors had slowed noticeably as the dynamics of the housing market had changed but housing lending rates had remained low and there was strong competition for borrowers of high credit quality the labour market had tightened further over 2018 and there had been some pick up in wages growth the unemployment rate had declined by ½ percentage point to 5 per cent its lowest level in over seven years and employment growth had been above average the bank s forecast was for the unemployment rate to decline a little further over the following few years the vacancy rate was high and there were reports of skills shortages in some areas wages growth was expected to pick up gradually over the following year or so inflation had remained low and stable in both headline and underlying terms over 2018 underlying inflation was expected to pick up gradually over the forecast period although headline inflation was expected to decline in the near term because of lower petrol prices members noted that the sustained low level of interest rates over recent years had been supporting economic activity and had allowed for gradual progress to be made in reducing the unemployment rate and returning inflation towards the midpoint of the target while the labour market had continued to strengthen over the preceding year less progress had been made on inflation taking account of the available information on current economic and financial conditions as well as the revised forecasts members assessed that the current stance of monetary policy should continue to allow for further gradual progress on both unemployment and inflation to be made however members noted that there were significant uncertainties around the forecasts with scenarios where an increase in the cash rate would be appropriate at some point and other scenarios where a decrease in the cash rate would be appropriate moreover the probabilities around these scenarios were now more evenly balanced than they had been over the preceding year when an eventual increase in the cash rate had appeared more likely members would continue to assess the outlook carefully however given that further progress in reducing unemployment and lifting inflation was a reasonable expectation members agreed that there was not a strong case for a near term adjustment in monetary policy rather they assessed that it would be appropriate to hold the cash rate steady and for the bank to be a source of stability and confidence while further progress unfolds members judged that holding the stance of monetary policy unchanged at this meeting would be consistent with sustainable growth in the economy and achieving the inflation target over time the decision the board decided to leave the cash rate unchanged at 1 5 per cent to read the original rba minutes click here

shareholders meeting it will be paid on may 14 2019 with record date of may 9 2019 outlook looking ahead to 2019 global steel demand is expected to show slightly positive growth and margins are expected to normalize in the steel industry after a very strong 2018 global steel prices have been decreasing over the last few months and the iron ore market has become more challenging with rising costs for steel makers under these market conditions ternium will continue working on increasing efficiency at its operations and reducing production costs with the aim of maintaining its consistent margin leadership in the americas global steel overcapacity continues to be a risk to fair trade as steel production in china continues to increase and its economy is decelerating many countries around the world reacted to this situation putting in place safeguard duties to prevent damage to their industries this is causing a diversion of steel exports to less protected markets something that was evidenced by the recent increase in latin america s participation among china s main export destinations the expected ratification of the united states mexico canada agreement usmca in 2019 and the eventual agreement on section 232 import tariffs among the current nafta partners should help normalize steel trade flows in this region this result would have a positive effect on ternium s business in mexico which is the company s main steel market as current trade conditions are placing undue strain on the mexican market in 2019 expectations of growth in the united states should create a healthy environment for the mexican manufacturing industry although weak public and private investment in mexico will continue to negatively affect the country s construction market ternium expects ebitda to decrease slightly in the first quarter 2019 compared to the fourth quarter 2018 as a result of lower margin partially offset by higher shipments with an increased participation of slabs in the sales mix the company anticipates ebitda per ton to sequentially decrease in the first quarter 2019 mainly due to lower revenue per ton in mexico after the reset of industrial customer contract

source introduction the recent proposal of a green new deal gnd by a brand new millennial member of congress has been endorsed as a concept by many progressives including a number of presidential hopefuls cf national public radio 2019 zack colman 2019 ari natter billy house 2019 it is being presented to congress as a non binding resolution house resolution 109 government printing office 2019 and it will probably pass in the house perhaps by voice vote since it carries no weight as a resolution beyond allowing some political positioning however senate majority leader mitch mcconnell will require an on the record vote for the version being presented to the senate the resolution is breathtaking in its scope and lays out a utopian plan to take over or increase the regulation of much of the economy specifically all of the healthcare energy and utility sectors part of the real estate sector part of the manufacturing industry industrial sector all of the transportation industry industrial sector part of the agriculture industry and part of the forestry industry this is all in the service of clean and renewable energy millions of high wage jobs something vague called justice another vague concept called equity and the prevention of unfair competition etc this would imply direct government intervention and or new regulation of at least 36 of the economy some have argued that this is merely a progressive wish list for the 2020 election and not really a serious proposal some conservatives however think it may be a trojan horse for the eventual adoption of full on socialism whatever that means e g jarrett stepman 2019 we will return to the definition of socialism shortly the gnd has already been criticized as lacking scientific support for its approach to the energy sector e g james temple 2019 jesse jenkins samuel thernstrom 2019 the transportation part of the gnd resolution also took a hit within days after its announcement when california s democratic governor gavin newsom cut the state s commitment to its high speed rail project from 520 miles to just 150 miles this comes amidst huge cost overruns 77 98 billion projected cost vs an original estimate of 40 billion and substantial time delays on the dream project of former governor jerry brown which has been a rolling administrative disaster for a decade chuck devore 2019 prominent business magnate long time democratic donor and potential independent candidate for president howard schultz has roundly criticized the gnd as completely unrealistic he has also pointed out that the funding of this grandiose plan would be based on punitive taxes and impossibly large federal deficits of as much as 40 50 trillion naomi lim 2019 a few economists like glenn hubbard of columbia university think the plan is so impractical that it will be dead on arrival bill mccoll 2019 many people from all across the political spectrum including house speaker nancy pelosi quoted by adam shaw 2019 think it is either a pie in the sky dream or an outright farce put together by a starry eyed band of incompetents e g timothy p carney 2019 labor unions have even expressed reservations about the potential impact of the plan on jobs valerie volcovici 2019 many progressives and socialists subscribe to the notion that the economy is a fixed pie meaning they believe that if one group e g the 1 or mega wealthy gains an advantage or makes a disproportionate amount of money their gains have come directly at the expense of others cf mark j perry 2006 this zero sum approach may be a natural way to think but it is not accurate as nobel laureate economist milton friedman opined most economic fallacies derive from the tendency to assume that there is a fixed pie that one party can gain only at the expense of another economists proved long ago that this is absolutely not the case cf robert j barro 2000 chelsea follett 2015 matt palumbo 2015 indeed the world s level of extreme poverty has declined since 1970 simultaneously with a global increase in wealth inequality because the pie itself got bigger charts 1 2 chart 1 people living in extreme poverty now the lowest ever source chart 2 global wealth inequality has grown since 1980 source under the fixed pie fallacy president trump has claimed that a negative trade balance means that china is stealing the negative balance from us they are stealing from us but not in that way also under this fallacy democrats of a certain stripe believe that when jeff bezos and amazon amzn make big money and pay no income taxes due to their deductions for huge capital investments the money was directly taken out of the hands of government and taxpayers likewise when amazon recently negotiated a 3 billion tax incentive deal in new york a bevy of new york democrats opposed the deal because that theoretical or contingent tax accounting incentive money should have been given to someone else cf becket adams 2019 the influence of the fixed pie fallacy is rampant as well in the wording of house resolution 109 proposing the gnd investors need to pay close attention to this issue in the coming years just as the election of donald trump to the presidency caught almost everyone by surprise the next election could swing back the other way quite violently this would probably only occur under certain conditions 1 an ongoing and deep recession 2 a return to substantially higher unemployment 3 a fed response to the recession that would include a return to qe and zirp and 4 the continued growth of the already huge wealth inequality in the us but all of these things are not only possible they are likely in my opinion kevin wilson 2018a kevin wilson 2019a kevin wilson 2019b if the political pendulum swings left in 2020 investors will be treated to a great deal of uncertainty and a major market drawdown because of the crony capitalism that would be built into the gnd more on this below there would be a surge in most technology and many green energy stocks over time however the conventional energy utility healthcare and transportation sectors would likely be absolutely pummeled the banking industry would also likely suffer from greatly increased regulation what might happen on the way to utopia with respect to the specific goals of the gnd there are two likely political outcomes in the near term according to timothy p carney 2019 op cit 1 the thing fails to achieve lift off in practical political terms because of its combination of fantasy federal budgets a breathtaking grab for power over the economy unscientific energy supply goals and extremely expensive and impractical environmental goals or 2 the deal will pass in some watered down form because of its oft repeated goal of having government invest in industry which is a common democratic euphemism for crony capitalism don t get me wrong the republicans love crony capitalism just as much as democrats do and they have long practiced it michael d tanner 2015 but they call it a different thing than government investing in industry indeed the list of corporate welfare and crony capitalist laws from both parties in recent years is impressive obamacare s annual support of health insurance companies to cover their losses in 2014 2016 the tarp bailout of supposedly regulated and or insured banks in 2008 almost all paid back however the auto industry bailout in 2009 not all paid back huge energy sector subsidies e g chart 3 the fed s annual payments to banks for their reserves chart 4 and huge annual agricultural subsidies e g the ethanol requirement for motor fuels and subsidies for growing corn chart 5 the crony capitalist abuse by both parties has historically been so large it is measured cumulatively in trillions of dollars cf rand paul 2017 cato institute 2017 andrew wilford 2019 and this doesn t count the administrative state s read federal reserve s suppression of market prices over the last ten years which is a de facto rejection of capitalism in favor of something else kevin wilson 2019a op cit chart 3 taxpayers paying 14 b in subsidies to electric utilities in 2019 source chart 4 taxpayers payed banks 38 b for their reserves in 2018 source chart 5 taxpayers have paid over 395 b in farm subsidies since 1996 source this second crony capitalist possibility for the gnd is really not all that much different than what we saw under president obama s green stimulus the 90 billion semi boondoggle that was rolled into the 2009 emergency stimulus arra bill cf michael grunwald 2019 on the positive side it was characterized by many new solar and wind projects and large new energy research efforts many of which were moderately successful in producing an uptick in renewable energy projects although at pretty high cost luis mundaca jessika luth richter 2015 however on the negative side the green stimulus was also characterized by the government actively choosing corporate winners and losers and it famously helped facilitate minor disasters like the bankruptcy of solar firm solyndra for a loss of 528 million to the government wikipedia 2019a and the bankruptcy of vehicle battery firm a123 systems after an investment by the us of 249 million wikipedia 2019b the explosion of green collar jobs that the obama administration touted as part of its green stimulus didn t really happen either although a gross increase in green jobs did occur luis mundaca jessika luth richter 2015 op cit michelle chen 2014 it is unknown whether there was any net increase in jobs the cost of creating the new jobs was something like 479 000 per job using the above cited analysis by mundaca richter and the 92 billion cost for the program so to the extent that the new gnd resembles the old obama green stimulus there are reasons for some skepticism about its ultimate effectiveness socialism means different things to different people now it makes a certain amount of sense to me that some people describe crony capitalism as merely socialism lite based on the actual practices of socialist countries e g byron schlomach 2018 in other words there is commonly a government business nexus in socialist countries like china or venezuela that results in the crushing of competition and the rewarding of corporations that are friendly to the regime wikipedia 2019c still i would argue that crony capitalism as practiced by republicans could also be termed diminished capitalism because it doesn t operate competitively enough and prices are not set by the markets alone john stossel 2012 the administrative state s support from both parties for private firms is nothing new however as tax preference items for small businesses and large corporations built into the internal revenue code will likely amount to 6 121 trillion chart 6 over the ten year period from 2017 to 2026 veronique de rugy 2017 the ever expanding size of transfer payments to individuals in the federal budget which have now risen to 2 189 trillion per year chart 7 is also a sign that there are strong socialist or at least expansive welfare state tendencies already built into the system the question is whether this really constitutes a drift towards full strength socialism or something else as i listen to the renewed debate over the merits of socialism i find it a bit distracting that many people have quite different definitions of what socialism is especially compared to the people they are talking to or trying to influence chart 8 at this point then it behooves us to define what is really meant by the term socialism cf george peterson 2016 chart 6 projected huge costs of federal tax preference items for corporations and individuals 2017 2026 source chart 7 exponential growth of federal transfer payments to individuals source chart 8 what s in a name source according to wikipedia socialism can be defined as a range of economic and social systems characterized by social ownership and workers self management of the means of production as well as the political theories and movements associated with them wikipedia 2019d because socialism is really a broad spectrum of systems determining whether a country or party is socialist depends on the degree to which the means of production and distribution are owned or regulated by the state and the degree to which the state indulges in giving resources away for free council of economic advisors 2018 thus there are many varieties of socialism but they fall mainly into 1 market forms and 2 non market forms non market socialism has the goal of avoiding the presumed inefficiencies and periodic crises associated with capital accumulation and the profit system of capitalism it tries to achieve this by eliminating private property markets and other aspects of capitalism in favor of state determined allocations and distributions experiments with this form of socialism have generally met with outright disaster e g china before 1980 russia before 1998 north korea since 1950 cuba since 1962 and venezuela since 1999 cf council of economic advisors 2018 op cit so called market socialism retains the use of at least some market prices and even sometimes the operation of a profit motive but with more worker and or government control on the distribution of those profits than is seen in free market capitalism the countries of eastern europe that have been transitioning away from communism since 1989 might be examples of market socialism andrei shleifer daniel treisman 2014 lili bayer 2018 failures here cf chart 9 are a bit harder to spot for example slovenia estonia and poland have nearly matched spain s success and all three have matched or outperformed portugal and greece not stellar but much better than relatively unreformed economies like those of serbia ukraine and moldova chart 9 eastern european gdp per capita vs nordic countries iberia and germany source there is an argument i e the socialist calculation debate within socialism about how to allocate resources in the absence or partial absence of market prices and private ownership of the means of production and its distribution cf david miller 1991 david gordon 1996 this argument is difficult to settle because economic models and historical analyses have been built generally on assumptions about the behavior of the end members in the political spectrum i e pure versions of free market capitalism and socialism e g patrick tyrell 2018 although some attempts have been made to take theories and models up the middle of the road via market socialism e g pranab bardhan john e roemer 1992 one aspect of the socialist calculation is the problem that arises when there is uncertainty about policy in an economy that is centrally controlled without the known planning advantages that derive from information provided by free market prices and private ownership decisions for example how should the administrative state in china make economic decisions now given the currently great policy uncertainty chart 10 that has arisen due to a rapidly changing political and economic environment by supposedly abandoning unproductive government stimulus spending but nevertheless refusing to go full capitalist either will the chinese leadership skip along the edge of the economic abyss created by their massive credit bubble but somehow never fall i would guess that there will be a serious problem and that china will actually fall into the abyss kevin wilson 2018b indeed is the chinese government s goal of combining major economic reforms with the retention of absolute centralized control over the economy even remotely realistic turning to the us under crony capitalism and based on the massive interference of the federal reserve in the us markets and economy over the last decade there is huge uncertainty now associated with trying to return to normal chart 11 is it realistic for us to think we will reach our goal of exiting our regime of low rates and huge fed balance sheets without any major consequences i am afraid that the impending global recession will catch us unprepared and we will return to extreme monetary policies very shortly kevin wilson 2018c chart 10 chinese vs global policy uncertainty indexes source chart 11 us policy uncertainty index source if not pure socialism then what i believe that the current debate over the gnd is not really about a shift towards pure socialism but is rather about a kind of creeping drift towards either 1 a version of market socialism or 2 something called democratic socialism these labels seem a little vague but if i understand them correctly the former term refers to the retention of some market pricing and privately held means of production in an otherwise moderately socialist system as already discussed whereas the latter term refers to a democratically controlled non stalinist move to a moderately or perhaps even strongly socialist system wikipedia 2019e it would appear that these two forms of socialism are not mutually exclusive then at least in the near term in any case the stated goal of american democratic socialists like alexandria ocasio cortez aka aoc is to promulgate punitive taxes on the rich from each according to his ability and give away a lot of free stuff like college education healthcare or even perhaps ubi to each according to his needs just as karl marx suggested long ago karl marx 1875 i have already mentioned the extreme impact on the federal budget such a move to democratic socialism would have it would also likely cause great economic harm both because of the massive increase in total debt cf kevin wilson 2018d and because of huge disincentives to work or succeed cf bob funk 2014 there would also likely be serious economic inefficiencies in such a system cf david miller 1991 op cit council of economic advisors 2018 op cit plus there appear to be certain authoritarian aspects to the gnd and similar ideas at least as it is defined by scholars like juan linz cf wikipedia 2019f thus the democratic socialists through the means of a gnd appear to be 1 seeking a basis for legitimacy in emotional appeals to fight easily recognized societal problems such as climate change despite the relatively good record of the us in controlling emissions cf chart 12 using the expanded power of the state and 2 seeking to place constraints on corporate special interest groups but not on union or progressive lobbyists tim wyatt 2019 by my calculation the move towards a gnd and democratic socialism would easily satisfy two of the four criteria used by academic scholars to define authoritarianism if the bush obama and trump presidencies are any examples a third criterion may also already have been met that of informally defined executive authority with vaguely delineated specific executive powers cf erin hawley 2016 elizabeth goitein 2017 jonathan turley 2019 chart 12 the big increases in global co2 emissions since 2005 did not come from the us or europe source one real concern i have on this file is about the openly expressed goal of democratic socialists and progressives to take over and or heavily regulate major parts of the us economy we have only to remember those fine high performance i m being sarcastic government programs and bureaucracies like 1 the va wildly dysfunctional 2 obamacare aka the aca greatly increased healthcare costs and loss of choice cf chart 13 3 the epa decline in enforcement actions and a huge backlog of superfund sites cf jessica morrison 2017 and 4 the dept of education huge cost increases for little benefit cf chart 15 to gain a sense of perspective on the merits of more government control of the economy we can also recall those truly spectacular episodic government failures like the 9 11 attacks or the great financial crisis to feel a profound sense of foreboding about where this trend towards more intrusive and ever incompetent government could take us cf meghan foley 2018 it doesn t matter much at all which party is proposing this gnd idea because both believe in big government and an expansive administrative state and both have fumbled the ball many times not only that this move towards a polity best termed a market socialist state has already been in motion for many years anyway chart 13 big increases in healthcare premiums under the aca 2010 2018 source chart 14 steep decline in epa enforcement actions since 2009 source chart 15 steep increase in spending on education to little effect source the road to hell is paved with good intentions the biggest economic problem in america in recent decades has arguably been the decline of the middle class as the returns to capital have soared while the returns to labor chart 16 have stagnated kevin wilson 2017a this has been a natural outcome of globalization as a result of which over a billion new workers entered the global work force in the last three decades or so because of the increased labor supply and favorable tax treatment us companies had strong incentives to move operations overseas to obtain the cheap labor however due to inadequate support for globalization s losers i e workers in certain us industries there is a great deal of understandable resentment amongst these people regarding the way the capitalist really crony capitalist system works amina dunn 2018 this has not been improved by the massive financial bailouts and permanent job losses associated with the great financial crisis nor by the widespread perception that congress is so corrupt that it is completely dysfunctional and will not do anything whatsoever about growing wealth inequality kevin wilson 2016 kevin wilson 2017b president trump s election partially resulted from all of this frustration with the status quo ante but there is little sign today that our troubles with wealth inequality chart 17 are over chart 16 the returns to labor have stagnated source chart 17 wealth inequality back to where it was in the 1920s source the danger in my opinion is that when the next recession arrives and especially if it turns out to be a severe one cf kevin wilson 2019c a new wave of anger and frustration will likely drive a renewed surge in middle class populism this drift towards a more motivated brand of populism could theoretically lead to the landslide re election of president trump in one possible but fairly unlikely scenario but alternatively if the promise of a better life under trump is perceived to have been unfulfilled it could lead instead to the rejection of trump and the republicans and the election as yet another act of desperation by the electorate of a democrat who got their party s nomination by making big promises to the progressives e g elizabeth warren s backers the socialist democrats e g bernie sanders backers or market socialists and the democratic socialists e g alexandria ocasio cortez s backers or just plain socialists if we assume for the purposes of argument that the democrats carry the day in 2020 we can expect a big push for at least some of the major tenets of market socialism democratic socialism or socialist democracy discussed above so the problems from such a big swing of the political pendulum are not just the short term practical ones that will afflict republicans and conservatives because they will lose power and today s progressives and socialists will gain control of the political agenda i think the economic and political theories that may be put to a test by the left have the potential to profoundly change our theory of government for decades to come since democrats have not settled which kind of socialism they want we may get a hybrid monster of unknown utility and highly questionable efficacy that change could thus be far more problematic for the entire country than a single presidential election victory by one side or the other might normally imply in other words i think the socialist left has good intentions and the will to succeed but they lack any real understanding of what s wrong or how to fix it i m not suggesting that the republicans have the answers either but i think they are less inclined to throw out the baby with the bath water indeed our partisan politics right now are in my view just a symptom of the american political disease that disease the one that most needs to be treated right now is actually the failure of government to solve most of the major problems affecting the middle class for over three decades thus if the republicans don t offer voters some means of escape from the stagnation afflicting the middle class they will very likely lose power that is unless voters simply can t stomach the form of socialism being presented to them and decide begrudgingly to stay with trump and his party much as they did when they re elected nixon with mcgovern as the only real alternative if the democrats make pie in the sky promises built on their faith in some form of market socialism and they offer lots of free stuff and they even come up with enough economic mumbo jumbo e g modern monetary theory or mmt cf john mauldin 2019 to convince the masses that it can all be paid for through the magic of the federal printing press they will win an historic victory if this improbable sounding outcome but not much more improbable than donald trump s victory actually happens it will usher in a new era of political and economic transformation focused on some new hybrid form of market socialism the hard left s intentions will be to make a better society through the exercise of government power and to improve our experience of vague feel good emotional things like justice and equity as defined by them i don t know about justice and equity but i m quite certain they will use government power to get what they want just as fdr did and that is exactly the mistake that the founders were trying to prevent roger pilon 1995 robert g natelson 2018 some people will dismiss the founders concerns as out of date but i don t agree this not only has political implications it has profound economic implications republicans have been trying to counter the renewed enthusiasm for market socialism or socialist democracy cf council of economic advisors 2018 op cit by citing the track record for most historical forms of full on socialism which is of course absolutely terrible e g the ussr china venezuela etc however no one is currently proposing full on socialism although something like that is the long term goal after a transition period of the democratic socialists like alexandria ocasio cortez meagan day 2018 socialist democrats like bernie sanders have attempted to rebut the conservative argument by pointing to the great success achieved by the various nordic economies in recent decades cf jeffrey dorfman 2018 and also by noting that western european economies have much less wealth inequality than the us cf chart 18 chart 18 comparison of wealth inequality in america vs western europe source the example of the nordic economies all of which have been claimed by democrats to be some version of socialist democracies has been the more politically effective weapon in the political fight over socialism at least so far it s not clear however that this example should really be considered pertinent given the mixed nature of the evidence a number of conservatives have responded with the counter claim that these countries are not socialist at all but instead are capitalist democracies that simply have high taxes and very large welfare states anthony b kim julia howe 2018 ethan lamb 2019 certainly it is hard to explain away the fact that the nordic countries score very well on the index of economic freedom chart 19 which would hardly be expected under any brand of socialism that would seem worthy of the name e g venezuela julia howe patrick tyrrell 2018 chart 19 index of economic freedom for nordic countries vs america and the uk source the fact that there are also some interesting counterfactuals to consider just makes it harder to attach any kind of simple label to the nordic countries for example norway s percentage of government workers in its economy is more than double that of the us chart 20 the percentage of union workers in the nordic countries is 6 8x that in the us chart 21 the amount of family benefits as a percentage of gdp paid out by nordic countries is 4 5x the amount paid out in the us chart 22 at first glance the tax system in the nordic countries doesn t appear to differ much from that of the us chart 23 but when one digs a little deeper significant differences emerge chart 24 furthermore recent 2014 total tax revenues as a percentage of gdp in denmark exceeded 50 those in finland and sweden were about 44 and 43 respectively compared to only about 26 in the us chart 25 on the other hand in contradiction to the socialist label applied to the nordic countries by bernie sanders and others it is a fact that government debt gdp ratios in the nordic countries were considerably lower than that of the us in 2015 chart 26 this is likely due to a concerted effort in recent years to turn away from the unbridled spending associated with traditional nordic government budgets e g chart 27 indeed danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen recently rebutted sanders with the statement i would like to make one thing clear denmark is far from a socialist planned economy denmark is a market economy ethan lamb 2019 op cit so it is not at all clear that the so called socialist paradigm for the nordic countries is an accurate or fair description of what instead appear to be unique capitalist economies with high taxes and very expansive welfare states as already described chart 20 government workers as percent of economy for nordic countries vs us source chart 21 workers under union contracts in nordic countries vs us source chart 22 family benefits gdp for european countries vs us source chart 23 top marginal tax rates plus payroll taxes in nordic countries not much different than in the us source chart 24 top tax brackets in nordic countries may be far more progressive than they are in the us source chart 25 nordic countries total tax revenue gdp source chart 26 government debt gdp comparison in 2015 source chart 27 government spending has fallen sharply in sweden source be that as it may the coming national debate on the merits of socialism will hardly be decided on the facts of the matter nor on subtle nuances visible in complex data sets no it is far more likely that the publicly perceived impacts of the coming recession the degree of wealth inequality the viability of socialist giveaways to voters and the actions taken by the current administration to ameliorate the problems of the middle class will all be swirled around in the cauldron of public opinion and the odor and flavor of the stew that is produced

the influence of the fixed pie fallacy is rampant in the wording of house resolution 109 and in the thinking of socialists of every persuasion and this portends a massive political and economic transformation if democrats win in 2020 whether this would be a good thing or a bad thing depends on one s point of view of course but there are economic reasons to fear such an outcome investors need to pay close attention to this issue in the coming years just as the election of donald trump to the presidency caught almost everyone by surprise the next election could swing back the other way quite violently this would probably only occur under certain conditions 1 an ongoing and deep recession 2 a return to substantially higher unemployment 3 a fed response to the recession that would include a return to qe and zirp and 4 the continued growth of the already huge wealth inequality in the us but all of these things are not only possible they are likely in my opinion if the democrats do win in 2020 the gnd will pass in some watered down form because of its oft repeated goal of having government invest in industry which is a common democratic euphemism for crony capitalism this will be good for certain sectors and industries such as technology e g technology select sector spdr fund and green energy e g invesco wilderhill clean energy fund pbw invesco solar etf tan however the conventional energy e g energy select sector spdr fund xle utility e g utilities select sector spdr fund xlu healthcare e g health care select sector spdr fund xlv and transportation e g ishares transportation average etf iyt sectors would likely be absolutely pummeled the investment and commercial banking industries e g financial select sector spdr fund xlf spdr s p regional banking etf kre would also likely suffer from greatly increased regulation and perhaps even concerns about potential breakup of the biggest banks the viability of socialist giveaways to voters will be tested as well and that means a huge increase in the deficit which is already near 1 trillion and either 1 an absolute avalanche of newly issued government debt that chokes the market and triggers a sharply dropping dollar and high inflation or 2 outright debt monetization on the mmt or japanese model but without japan s advantages in the treasury avalanche case bonds e g ishares 20 year treasury bond fund tlt would sell off dramatically in the debt monetization case the same bonds would decline in yield and deliver significant capital gains much as they have in japan for many years cf kevin wilson 2018e i think debt monetization is by far the more likely scenario
china used to be the go to emerging market for investors looking for a decent return but fear has overtaken greed in recent years with concerns over a hard landing driving many away the country has experienced a slowdown in growth in recent years pushing investors to put their money elsewhere but it could be time to reappraise the situation as the chinese new year arrives china is entering the year of the sheep which has traditionally brought some of strong returns for investors so will this year follow the herd or buck the trend reason to celebrate could the chinese new year of the sheep boost stock market returns the puzzle over whether to invest in china or not is reflected in the question over its new year depending on who you speak to we are now moving into the year of the sheep or goat or ram there is debate about which animal is represented in chinese imagery but it is the symbolism that matters more those born in the year of the sheep are seen to be patient thoughtful and in good health investors also seemed to have benefited from healthy returns in previous cycles when it has come round to the year of the sheep data from researchers fundcalibre shows that in 1979 the hang seng index which lists hong kong and chinese companies returned 77 per cent during the year of the sheep compared with 5 per cent from the ftse all share in 1991 you would have got 42 per cent from the hang seng compared with 15 per cent in the ftse all share and in 2003 there was growth of 35 per cent in china compared with 17 per cent in the ftse all share chinese new year the year of the sheep has traditionally reared decent returns will the new year bring opportunities in china opening up the markets overseas investors have traditionally been barred from investing directly in chinese companies this used to mean you would need to invest indirectly through offshore firms or special purpose vehicles or through b shares which trade alongside the main a share version some chinese companies list on the hong kong stock exchange to make it easier for people from outside china to invest this doesn t really matter for fund investors as fund managers could get a special licence provided they have a certain amount of assets the chinese government is opening up its markets to attract more investment and also encourage more domestic saving there are currently three types of shares a shares a shares are mainly available to chinese domestic investors although they are slowly being opened up to international investors as well they are listed in shanghai or shenzhen and are denominated in renminbi there are over 2 500 listed chinese a shares with a total market capitalisation of 5 3 trillion h shares h shares are companies incorporated in mainland china but listed in hong kong and denominated in hk dollars they are mainly available to non chinese investors the hk currency is pegged to the us dollar there are currently 197 h share listed stocks with a total market cap of 671 bn b shares b shares trade alongside a shares on the mainland chinese exchanges and are available both to domestic and international investors there are only 100 listed securities with a total market cap of 27bn b shares are expected to disappear as the chinese market continues to open up china is the second biggest economy in the world yet there have been concerns about the effect of a slowdown in its growth its gross domestic product the measurement of how much its economy has grown was up 7 4 per cent in 2014 marking the slowest growth for 25 years a slowing property market and falling oil prices hitting its strong commodities market have all had an impact on china s growth falling inflation in developing companies has also seen less reliance on chinese exports but while its economic figures may be suffering chinese companies are still doing well its biggest stockmarket the shanghai composite index ended 2014 at a five year high funds investing in china return 9 2 per cent in 2014 but in contrast north america focused funds 17 9 per cent and property funds returned 12 9 per cent china is fighting back and is making attempts to open its economy up more to foreign investors and companies the international monetary fund is still expecting a good 2015 for china with growth of 6 8 per cent albeit below the country s target of 7 5 per cent andrew swan manager of the blackrock asia fund says investors should be looking to companies that reflect the goat s qualities the goat is a resilient animal used to solitude but not afraid of reaching higher levels we see a similar journey for asian equities in 2015 leading up to chinese new year progress of the reform program e announced in china in november 2012 continues to divide debate despite ongoing scepticism reform has progressed across a number of fronts not least fiscal budgeting reducing the systemic risks to the banks through local government debt and slowing the expansion of the shadow banking system all of this is helping to reduce the risk premium overhanging china so where are the opportunities for investors commentators have not given up on china victoria chernykh at tilney bestinvest says investors need to navigate chinese equity markets carefully return expectations for many funds heavily exposed to china relative to those enjoyed during the start of the century have been diminishing

its main regions are hong kong singapore india and australia it has returned 50 per cent over the past five years compared with 43 per cent in the sector darius mcdermott of fundcalibre says there are still opportunities for investors in china as it is the main drive of global growth he says the country will also be helped by plans to further open up its markets to foreign investors he says despite growth slowing china remains the main driver in terms of gdp of global growth no one is quite sure what the number for that series really is but china is definitely growing and with a burgeoning middle class i m confident they will eventually succeed in reducing their reliance on exports over the long term i am a fan of the asset class i think it will be volatile but rewarding mcdermott has recommended three funds below to provide exposure to china invesco perpetual hong kong and china fund ongoing charges 0 89 per cent yield 1 4 per cent the invesco perpetual hong kong and china fund offers exposure to companies in both countries as well as the surrounding region much of the portfolio will invest in companies that derive a lot of profit from china rather than being listed there

further decline in house prices could result in lower gdp higher unemployment and lower inflation rba reiterated its rate views in the february meeting minutes but sounded more cautious regarding the downturn in housing markets the central bank maintained that given that further progress in reducing unemployment and lifting inflation was a reasonable expectation members agreed that there was not a strong case for a near term adjustment in monetary policy and the minutes echoed governor philip lowe s comments too that is there were significant uncertainties around the forecasts with scenarios where an increase in the cash rate would be appropriate at some point and other scenarios where a decrease in the cash rate would be appropriate most importantly the probabilities around these scenarios were now more evenly balanced than they had been over the preceding year when an eventual increase in the cash rate had appeared more likely rba tied the subdued consumption growth in q4 to the possibility of being influenced by lower housing prices and reduced housing market activity on housing rba admitted that dwelling investment was also expected to decline more sharply than previously expected consistent with the decline in residential building approvals and the fall in housing prices and members observed that if prices were to fall much further consumption could be weaker than forecast which would result in lower gdp growth higher unemployment and lower inflation than forecast according to a reuters poll all of the 41 economists expected rba to keep interest rate unchanged at 1 50 through 2019 28 expected rba to stand pat at least until q1 of 2021 10 expected at least one cut by the end of 2020 nab economist david de garis was quoted saying for the rates

it has become a commonplace to say in the aftermath of the great recession that we are all keynesians now if this is so then keynes s great biographer robert skidelsky should have much to say about the recession its causes and the appropriate cures and so indeed he does i share with skidelsky the view that while most of the blame for the crisis should reside with those in the financial markets who did such a poor job both in allocating capital and in managing risk their key responsibilities a considerable portion of it lies with the economics profession the notion economists pushed that markets are efficient and self adjusting gave comfort to regulators like alan greenspan who didn t believe in regulation in the first place they provided support for the movement which stripped away the regulations that had provided the basis of financial stability in the decades after the great depression and they gave justification to those like larry summers and robert rubin treasury secretaries under clinton who opposed doing anything about derivatives even after the dangers had been exposed in the long term capital management crisis of 1998 we should be clear about this economic theory never provided much support for these free market views theories of imperfect and asymmetric information in markets had undermined every one of the efficient market doctrines even before they became fashionable in the reagan thatcher era bruce greenwald and i had explained that adam smith s hand was not in fact invisible it wasn t there sanford grossman and i had explained that if markets were as efficient in transmitting information as the free marketeers claimed no one would have any incentive to gather and process it free marketeers and the special interests that benefited from their doctrines paid little attention to these inconvenient truths while economists who criticised the ruling free market paradigm often still employed as a matter of convenience simple models of rational expectations that is they assumed that individuals rationally used all the information that they had available they departed from the ruling paradigm in assuming that different individuals had access to different information their aim was to show that the standard paradigm was no longer valid when there was even this seemingly small and obviously reasonable change in assumptions they showed for instance that unfettered markets were not efficient and could be characterised by persistent unemployment but if the economy behaves so poorly when such small realistic changes are made to the paradigm what could we expect if we added further elements of realism such as bouts of irrational optimism and pessimism the panics and manias that break out repeatedly in markets all over the world of course one didn t have to rely on theoretical niceties in order to criticise the faith in unfettered markets economic and financial crises have been a regular feature of capitalist economies only the period of strong financial regulation after the second world war was almost totally free of them as financial market regulations were stripped away crises became more common we have had more than 100 in the last 30 years the present crisis should lay to rest any belief in rational markets the irrationalities evident in mortgage markets in securitisation in derivatives and in banking are mind boggling our supposed financial wizards have exhibited behaviour which to use the vernacular seemed stupid even at the time if we are to design policies to prevent crises or to deal with them when they occur it is essential to understand the critical flaws in the standard paradigm it is here that skidelsky goes astray skidelsky makes much of the distinction between risk and uncertainty risk refers to situations in which we have good statistical data so that we can talk meaningfully about the probability that a particular event will happen like the probability of a 70 year old man dying within the next year uncertainty refers to situations in which we have no statistical basis to go on clearly the investment banks and rating agencies relied too heavily on flawed statistical models as did the regulators those models gave them confidence that the risk of a serious problem was negligible something that might happen once in a million years but much of the behaviour that led to the crisis the irrational and sometimes predatory lending the excesses of leverage and other forms of risk taking did not depend on this distinction more important for instance were the incentives which encouraged banks to take on too much risk and induced them not to think too deeply about the flaws in their statistical models flawed incentives inadequate regulation and a lack of scruples also help explain the abusive lending practices that played so large a role in the crisis in accounting for the crisis we have to explain both the bubble and why after the bubble burst the economy went into a deep recession we also have to explain the massively inefficent capital allocation the high level of volatility and the persistence of unemployment the distinction between risk and uncertainty unfortunately gives us little insight into the failures in the labour market why the usual laws of supply and demand which should result in full employment have failed to work it should be clear that the failure of financial markets is at the centre of this crisis but as skidelsky points out keynes himself had little to say about financial markets and their management and regulation one of the criticisms of the general theory is its simplistic treatment of capital markets some progress has been made in rectifying this over the last 75 years accordingly it might be thought that keynes s views were of only limited relevance in this crisis beyond his general scepticism as to the ability of markets to correct themselves that view of keynes is wrong however because this is an economic as well as a financial crisis there is an insufficiency of global aggregate demand explaining why this is so is more difficult than skidelsky seems to suggest it is not just a matter of the intrinsic uncertainty of the future standard economic theory the theory of demand and supply that is taught in classrooms around the world says that if prices including the price of labour or wages and the price of capital or the interest rate are fully flexible and markets function as they should then even with such uncertainty there should be full employment wages or interest rates might not be the same as they would be in the absence of uncertainty but markets would still ensure full employment markets in capitalist systems don t work that way though and the question is why skidelsky does not offer much insight here not even as to what keynes might have said about it those who today see themselves as following in the tradition of keynes especially in subscribing to his view that government action is needed to help maintain full employment are referred to as new keynesians one strand of new keynesianism argues that unemployment persists because wages and prices are rigid it isn t hard to understand why many economists were attracted to this theory in the standard demand and supply model if there is an excess supply of labour i e unemployment the reason must be that real wages are too high this theory may not only misinterpret keynes but may also be potentially dangerous because of its obvious policy implications if unemployment is caused by real wages being too high the obvious remedy is to lower wages hence the standard call of conservative economists for more labour market flexibility ensuring that the wages of workers which have stagnated in the us for a quarter of a century will drop even further but traditional keynesian economics argues that what matters is aggregate demand and that lower wages reduce aggregate demand the current crisis demonstrates what can happen countries with stronger systems of social protection and less labour market flexibility have in many ways fared better skidelsky s discussion of the various explanations that economists have come up with both for wage and price rigidity and as to why the economy does not quickly adjust to equilibrium is too unquestioning too undiscriminating there is for instance a silly theory that says prices are rigid because of the costs of changing price lists the cost of printing new menus in restaurants would be an example but these costs pale in comparison to those of hiring and firing workers or increasing or decreasing production other theories that have become more widely accepted since keynes s death are given scant attention by skidelsky efficiency wage theory which argues that wages affect productivity so that it doesn t benefit firms to pay low wages isn t even mentioned there is an alternative view also labelled new keynesian as to why an economy can be trapped for so long in a state of under utilising resources the debt deflation theory originally formulated by an american contemporary of keynes irving fisher and more recently developed by greenwald and me it perceives the key market failures to be not just in the labour market but also in financial markets because contracts are not appropriately indexed that is to say payments aren t adjusted to changing economic conditions alterations in economic circumstances can cause a rash of bankruptcies and fear of bankruptcy contributes to the freezing of credit markets the resulting economic disruption affects both aggregate demand and aggregate supply and it s not easy to recover from this one reason that my prognosis for the economy in the short term is so gloomy keynes focused as i ve said on the problems posed by an insufficiency of aggregate demand what happens when people want to buy less than the economy is able to produce even 75 years ago he saw the issue from a global perspective he was concerned for instance about the impact of the surplus countries those that produced more than they consumed on global demand today we talk about global imbalances the soaring imbalances of the last ten years are partly due to what happened during the east asia crisis of 1997 98 countries without adequate reserves lost their economic sovereignty as the us treasury and imf came to their rescue or more accurately came to the rescue of their own banks the same banks that have caused such devastation to our own economies they foisted contractionary monetary and fiscal policies higher interest rates cutbacks on expenditure on these countries the opposite of the policies the us adopted in the current crisis not surprisingly these contractionary policies led to recessions and depressions to reduce the likelihood of having to turn again to the imf and the west developing countries around the world accumulated massive reserves but while these precautionary savings may have provided them with some security money saved is money not spent it contributed to a lack of aggregate demand other factors also contributed to the build up of reserves low exchange rates can help promote exports oil exporters knew there was a significant risk that prices would not remain at the high level they had reached and the prudent choice was to save a great deal of the money that they were earning finally aggregate demand was almost certainly lowered by the huge increase in inequality which in effect redistributed money from those who would spend it to those who didn t or at least didn t spend as much these factors help explain high savings ratios but the problem of insufficiency of demand is really a matter of the balance between savings and investment the problem is sometimes described as a savings glut but could equally well be described as an investment dearth why did it seem that even with record low interest rates the only investment that could be generated was in housing for poor americans for which they couldn t afford to pay a long tradition in economics of which keynes was a part has focused on the diminution of investment opportunities the path breaking work of schumpeter another of keynes s contemporaries emphasised the role of innovation the world is currently faced with serious challenges that also present investment opportunities retrofitting the world economy to face the challenges of global warming or making the investment necessary to reduce global poverty there is no shortage of opportunities for investments with high social returns here there have been both market failures and policy failures a failure for instance of governments to make carbon emissions sufficiently costly for there to be an incentive to invest in reducing them or of financial markets to devise better instruments for transferring risk from those in less developed countries to those in more advanced ones who can better absorb it the central policy message of keynesian economics is that in a deep recession monetary policy is likely to be ineffective and fiscal stimulation is required this the argument goes is because monetary authorities find it increasingly difficult to lower real interest rates even if nominal interest rates go to zero deflation can mean that there is a positive real interest rate and even at low interest rates investment may not be much stimulated it s like pushing on a string when interest rates were lowered after the technology bubble burst the effect was mostly foolish real estate investment but since keynes our understanding of the limitations of monetary policy has increased for instance even if central banks succeed in getting treasury bill rates close to zero the interest rates at which banks lend can remain high and it is now recognised that availability of credit matters as much as interest rates especially for small and medium sized businesses that depend on the ability and willingness of banks to lend this is one of the reasons there is so much focus on the recapitalisation of banks and one of the reasons the bush obama policy of giving money to the banks but allowing them to pay it out in dividends and bonuses did not rekindle lending as promised today few look to monetary policy to reignite the economy the achievement of our central banks has been a more modest one having brought the global economy to the brink of disaster they succeeded in avoiding a complete collapse by throwing enough money at the financial system fiscal policy worked not in preventing a great recession but in preventing the great recession from turning into another great depression but now the very actions that saved the economies of the world have presented a new problem for fiscal policy as questions are being raised about governments ability to finance their deficits there are speculative attacks against the weakest countries which find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place they worry that deficits will lead to higher interest rates not because as is usually argued public spending will crowd out private spending but because of growing risk premiums but the effect is much the same more government spending will force cutbacks in private spending with the obvious adverse effects on the economy the financial markets that caused the crisis which in turn caused the deficits went silent as money was being spent on the bail out but now they are telling governments they have to cut public spending wages are to be cut even if bank bonuses are to be kept the hooverites the advocates of the pre keynesian policies according to which downturns were met with austerity are having their revenge in many quarters the keynesians having enjoyed their moment of glory just a year ago seem to be in retreat if markets were rational there would be an easy policy response spending on investments that yielded even moderate real returns say of 5 to 6 per cent would lower long term debt levels such spending increases output in the short run thus garnering more tax revenue and the future returns generate still more tax revenue if markets could be convinced for example that european governments can and will meet their debt obligations interest rates would fall and even the countries with the highest levels of debt would find it easy to meet their obligations but markets are not necessarily rational and even when they are they are not always well intentioned the objective of a speculative attack is to generate profits for the speculators regardless of the cost to the rest of society they can make money by inducing panic and then feel pleased with their insight their concerns were justified but only because of the responses to which their actions gave rise since the time of keynes the ability of markets to mount such speculative attacks has increased enormously but governments are not powerless to tame them and in some cases can counter attack as hong kong did in foiling wall street s famous hong kong double play when speculators simultaneously sold short both the currency and the stock market the speculators knew that governments traditionally respond to a currency attack by raising interest rates which lowers stock prices if hong kong failed to raise interest rates they would make money by shorting the currency if hong kong did raise them to save its currency the speculators would make money by shorting the stock market hong kong outsmarted them by simultaneously raising interest rates and supporting the stock market by buying shares taxes on short term capital gains regulations on the ever more powerful speculative instruments like credit default swaps and especially for developing countries the imposition of barriers on the uncontrolled movement of short term capital across borders can reduce the scope for and returns from this kind of behaviour keynes created modern macroeconomics and as i ve indicated he gave short shrift to the financial markets we can accordingly only conjecture what he might have thought about one of the critical issues of our day how to regulate the financial sector in ways that will make a recurrence of the present crisis less likely and increase the likelihood that the financial sector will do what it is supposed to do manage risk allocate capital run the payments mechanism and all at a low cost here the views of skidelsky immersed as he is in keynes the macroeconomist are less than convincing and far from complete he is for example sceptical of regulations that attempt to prevent excessive lending in booms the so called macro prudential regulatory framework towards the end of his book skidelsky writes that his chief argument has been that underlying the escalating succession of financial crises we have recently experienced is the failure of economics to take uncertainty seriously in the end he fails to make this case overconfidence in the flawed mathematical models used by rating agencies and investment banks did account for many of the horrendous mistakes of this particular crisis especially in the united states but these models played little role in the multitude of other bubbles booms and crashes that have marked the past quarter century western banks have repeatedly had to be bailed out because of their bad lending decisions we can t pass laws that ensure that people won t suffer from irrational optimism or pessimism we can t even be sure that banks will make good lending decisions what we can do however is ensure that those who make mistakes bear more of the consequences of their decisions and that others bear less we can ensure that those entrusted with the care of other people s money do not use that money for gambling this is true whether those decisions are based on flawed models of risk or irrational perceptions of uncertainty taxpayers workers retirees and homeowners all over the world suffered because of the mistakes of america s financial markets that is unacceptable and it is avoidable keynes s great contribution was to save capitalism from the capitalists if they had had their way they would have imposed policies that weakened the economy and undermined political support for capitalism the regulations and reform adopted in the aftermath of the great depression worked capitalism took on a more human face and market economies became more stable but these lessons were forgotten thatcher and reagan ushered in a new era of deregulation growing inequality and weakening social protection we are now seeing the consequences and not just in greater instability keynes s insights are needed now if we re to save capitalism once again from the capitalists

and ecommerce business together an additionally connected seamless way that make shopping easier we experienced a favorable economic environment in the u s for much of the year and our associates made a lot happen to draw the strength of our results brett will go into more detail on our results shortly i am particularly encouraged by our sales results in the quarter in q4 walmart u s grew comp sales 4 2 excluding fuel ecommerce sales increased 43 and we gained market share in key categories such as grocery and toys according to nielsen and the npd group sam s club finished the year with another strong quarter with comp sales growth of 5 3 excluding fuel and tobacco and in international comps were positive in the majority of our markets strong top line results allow us to reiterate the fy 2020 sales and profit guidance we gave in october even as we landed fy 2019 ahead of where we expected we strive to make every day easier for busy families as we increase convenience and save them money and time part of our strategy is to build on our existing strengths such as having a broad assortment including fresh and perishable foods within 10 miles of 90 of the u s population our stores and clubs are becoming more digital and we re using technology to change how we work more customers can now access our brand through multiple channels and it s important that we engage them in different ways we ve learned that those customers who shop with us both in stores and online spend about twice as much in total and they spend more in our stores across the business you can see examples of how we re meeting the changing needs of customers and delivering solutions that are increasing customer engagement in the u s we offer grocery pick up at more than 2 100 locations and grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations which represents about 69 and 36 of the population respectively feedback from customers about these services continues to be very positive which speaks of the capabilities of roughly 37 000 personal shoppers in mexico we re delighting customers with new experiences such as a secured digital payment option it s available on their mobile phones and in store kiosks that offer a broad assortment of products with flexible pickup times in addition through our investment in the crowdsourced delivery platform dada jd daojia customers in china get their merchandise in less than an hour of placing the order and it s picked from a network of more than 280 locations we continue to build trust which we believe will become even more of a competitive advantage around the world walmart plays an important role in the communities we serve by using our scale for good whether it s our work to promote small businesses and local farmers in places like india or a larger scale initiatives such as our effort to double our use of renewable energy in u s by 2025 customers can feel good about walmart the company that starts everyday with a goal of earning their business it s nice to be recognized for the work we re doing to promote shared value in fact the company recently received an a minus rating on the cdp s annual environmental scorecard up from a b rating last year and we re ranked as the survey s top performing u s based food retailer shared value is an important concept and something that we have fully embraced as we think about how to best allocate our time and capital deliver strong efficient growth reduce costs and operate with discipline within this construct customers associates communities and shareholders can win now let s move on to highlights from the year for our operating segments i ll begin with walmart u s where the team had a great year comp sales growth of 3 6 for fiscal year 2019 exceeded our expectations the work that team has done to balance inventory levels within stock rates is impressive the team leveraged operating expenses overall even as we invested in wages training technology and ecommerce store level productivity is strong due in part to the training we are providing our associates as the nature of work continues to change we re innovating to empower associates to better serve customers as they develop new skills thriving their jobs and growing their careers this coming year we ll add new ways for associates to better manage their schedules and earn greater incentive payouts and will introduce new training options including through advances in technology and the gamification of educational experiences overall i m pleased with what i see operationally and with our merchandizing the investments we re making in our people remodels and technology are helping to ensure that our stores are easy to navigate fast friendly and fun to shop having a great store or site starts with having great merchandise in our stores you can see the quality improvements in fresh food and in apparel with our new private brands we re also doing well in our seasonal businesses and toys we are making progress in ecommerce our focus remains on earning repeat visits and strengthening our assortment of merchandise we re expanding our assortment improving search enhancing our website and executing better on the fundamentals such as product reviews inventory mirroring and on time delivery to accomplish this and of course we remain committed to providing a superior value proposition as we compete aggressively on price across a broad spectrum of products sales in ecommerce increased 40 for the year we will continue to play off and innovate as we shape the future of our omni retail this includes the expansion of innovative services like online grocery pickup and delivery our previous investments in fulfillment centers and systems plus our acquisitions are helping us drive strong sales but we need to make more progress to improve profitability our fulfillment shipping costs were improving as we continue to enhance our assortment repeat visits should increase and contribute to improved profitability we might get progress during the year to add more brands and exclusive items through new partnerships with lord taylor ellen degeneres advance auto sofia vergara and fanatics to name a few these initiatives are contributing to the improvements we see in key metrics like the customer value index as well as nps which is now more than 10 points ahead of last year many opportunities exist mainly driven by data and we ll look to leverage our unique assets and capability better than we do today at sam s club the team has taken bold steps to transform the business by focusing on people products and working in a more digital way excluding fuel and tobacco comp sales for the year increased 5 7 and ecommerce sales grew 27 when someone downloads the app shops on samsclub com or uses our scan go they re more likely to renew we re encouraged by the trends we see in membership as of year end we saw improvements in sign ups and plus penetration and membership count is essentially flat to what it was a year ago despite the closure of nearly 10 of the fleet in international eight of our markets posted positive comp sales for the year including the four major markets and overall sales increased 2 9 in constant currency it s been a big year for international as we run the business while shaping the portfolio walmex continues to be strong the improvements we re making are helping drive traffic and we saw improvements in nps in each of our formats similar to the u s we re now leveraging our store base to offer same day delivery we recently expanded the available assortment to offer more than 5 000 general merchandise items to this service we continue to invest in our stores and in ecommerce to build an omni channel experience tailored to customers in this market our business in canada also continues to perform well the team s moving quickly to modernize the store base and expand omni channel capabilities with a focus on gaining greater access to urban markets for example we ve entered into new partnerships this year in cities like toronto and vancouver to help expand our delivery options in grocery and general merchandise in the u k brexit and the potential implications of a hard brexit is increasingly on the mind of everyone no matter the situation asda will always work to keep prices as low as possible for its customers i visited our team in the u k a few weeks ago and i m really impressed with their performance their attitudes and the leadership they re amazing in india we remain optimistic about the ecommerce opportunity given the size of the market the low penetration of ecommerce and the retail channel and the pace at which it s growing in the future we hope to work with the government for pro growth policies that can allow this nascent industry and the domestic manufacturers farmers and suppliers to benefit from it develop and prosper in terms of the regulatory environment we were disappointed in the recent change in law and the lack of consultation but the team has worked to ensure that we re in compliance with the new rules we are committed to providing sellers with a world class platform to sell on and customers with a high quality of service we hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward which results in a level playing field turning to china we continue to see significant growth opportunities overall we ve identified provinces that are priority for us and we re improving the value proposition through better quality of fresh items as well as a new store designs and omni channel initiatives uncertainties with trade or other macro factors can make for a more challenging environment but i like the things we re doing to position ourselves in this important market across international we re accelerating omni channel capabilities with the farthest along in china due to the partnership with jd com our relationship with tencent and the investments we ve made in last mile delivery we re also accelerating omni growth in canada mexico chile and japan through partnerships and acquisitions international team has the talent and scale to deliver sustainable growth for the company and to make a difference in communities across the globe in closing let me say how pleased i am about all that we ve accomplished over the last year and how excited i m about what s still to come we see the future as a frictionless experience across stores and ecommerce but we have more work to do as customers raise their expectations competition persist and the omni retail story continues to evolve we fully expect the pace of change to accelerate in the next five years versus the last five years with emerging technologies come together to transform retail even further and we re adapting but we once could only imagine a decade ago will increasingly become reality we will embrace new technologies to solve problems for customers in a seamless way and equip associates with tools to make them more productive within our ecosystem we will pursue to grow adjacent businesses to increase customer engagement and will leverage core capabilities to deliver services to other that can generate new revenue streams our commitment to the customers is clear we ll be there when where and how they want to shop our distinctive set of assets financial strength and innovative culture are delivering the customers new experiences that are uniquely walmart brett you want to pick it up there brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer you bet thanks doug good morning everybody i m excited to talk about our results this morning walmart had a really good year and we re pleased with the fourth quarter results as well we have momentum as we entered the new fiscal year and will continue to execute against our strategic plan which we believe is the winning formula long term i ll start this morning by highlighting some key accomplishments for the full year total revenue and constant currency was just over 515 billion and increased 14 8 billion or 3 walmart u s comp sales grew 3 6 the highest annual growth rate in 10 years walmart u s e commerce sales grew 40 nearly doubling the sales of that business over the past two years we made a number of strategic choices to position walmart international for success including the acquisition of a majority stake in flipkart and the sale of the majority of our business in brazil we made progress on expenses and are particularly proud of the leverage in walmart u s stores excluding discrete items from last year we leverage total company expenses slightly as we expected coming into the year adjusted eps increased 11 to 4 91 operating cash flow was strong at 27 8 billion and the company returned 13 5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we re pleased with what we ve accomplished but not satisfied this year and quarter are further proofs that our financial strength gives us the ability to deliver near term results while positioning the business for the longer term we re leveraging our scale unique assets and financial strength in ways others can t now let s move on to the fourth quarter we delivered strong fourth quarter topline growth the total constant currency revenue grew 3 1 to 140 5 billion with currency having a negative effect of approximately 1 7 billion walmart u s comp sales growth of 4 2 was a bit better than expected as strong holiday results and early release of government assistance benefited sales international grew net sales 2 7 in constant currency led by strength at walmex and sam s club had solid comp sales growth of 5 3 excluding fuel and tobacco consolidated gross margins gross profit margin declined 21 basis points due primarily to the mix effect from e commerce growth in india and the u s and price investments in certain markets we had some benefit in the quarter from lapping last year s discrete items sg a leverage and operating income benefited from lapping last year s discrete items but was partially offset by dilution from flipkart excluding these items we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have increased slightly on a constant currency basis the adjusted tax rate was within our expectations for the year at 24 6 as a reminder the adjusted tax rate excludes the effect of the value change in our investment in jd com adjustments related to the tax reform and the change for the divestiture of a majority stake in walmart brazil for the fourth quarter the adjusted tax rate was 22 8 and benefited eps by about 0 04 per share primarily due to the effect of the numerous federal tax regulations issued late in q4 adjusted eps increased 6 to 1 41 and gaap eps was 1 27 now let s discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment walmart u s continued to have greater sales momentum comp sales excluding fuel grew 4 2 in the quarter and 6 8 on two year stack basis the best result in nine years we started the quarter with strong thanksgiving and holiday shopping and finished the quarter with strong winter seasonal sales although bases sales were strong we did experience a benefit to comp sales of about 40 basis points from early snap funding clearly we re operating in a healthy consumer environment but our integrated omni offering provided the convenience customers were looking for during the holiday season we had solid traffic and ticket up 0 9 and 3 3 respectively while ecommerce sales grew 43 and contributed approximately 180 basis points of segment comp we re encouraged by the market share gains we saw in key categories according to nielsen and the npd group our strong mid single digit comp growth in grocery led to the best tier stack in nine years health and wellness delivered a low single digit comp sales gain and general merchandise comp sales were up mid single digit percentage with a strong holiday performance in toys and seasonal categories our inventory position is good as we enter the new year in walmart u s ecommerce we ve made good progress on a number of initiatives as doug mentioned we are still working to optimize our margin mix so that we can achieve the long term profit profile we want the team is working with a great sense of urgency to increase sales in key areas like home and apparel which will help margin rate as well simultaneously investing in new innovative solutions as we outlined in october we expect our losses in ecommerce to increase this coming year reflecting investments in infrastructure people online grocery and store number 8 initiatives while we ve made good progress against our strategy in recent years we still have great opportunity in front of us we remain excited about the opportunity in grocery pickup and delivery and plan to double the current number of stores that offer same day grocery delivery in the coming year while also adding grocery pick up to another 1000 stores the boundaries between physical and online retail continue to blur and we re in a great position to capitalize on that walmart u s gross margin rate declined 27 basis points due primarily to the increasing mix of ecommerce growth pricing strategy and higher transportation expenses expense leverage was strong reflecting strong sales increased productivity and overlap from last year s discrete items the walmart u s stores team has leveraged expenses for an impressive eight consecutive quarters even after raising the starting wage rate earlier this year operating income increased by more than 7 during the quarter overall we re really pleased with the momentum we have in the walmart u s business moving to international net sales in constant currency increased 2 7 but declined 2 3 on a reported basis due to the negative currency effects of approximately 1 7 billion the deconsolidation of brazil was a self head wind offset by the inclusion of flipkart sales for full quarter our major markets was saw positive comps from walmex canada and the u k results in mexico were strong again with comp sales growth of 4 6 in the quarter and we continued to grow faster than the market in key traffic driving categories including food and staples according to antad in the u k asda s progress on improving the value proposition growing online grocery share and expanding private label penetration contributed to its seventh consecutive quarter of positive comps in china we saw slightly negative comp in the quarter as the calendar shift to the mid autumn festival and a slower economic environment effected sales growth without the calendar shift comp sales would have been positive as expected international operating income declined 2 8 in constant currency and 9 9 on reported basis factors affecting our fourth quarter comparison include the dilution from flipkart partially offset by the positive effect from lapping last year s discrete charges flipkart s results were in line with our expectations overall very pleased with the progress being made in walmart international sam s club delivered solid comp sales growth of 3 3 excluding fuel and 5 3 when excluding fuel and tobacco the transfer of sales from closed clubs to existing clubs contributed approximately half of the comp growth and ecommerce sales grew 21 we re seeing improved membership sign ups and nps scores and in fact despite closing 10 of our clubs at the end of last year overall membership counts are about flat year over year sam s operating income increased primarily due to lapping last year s discrete charges for club closures excluding these items operating income would have been flat excluding fuel and up about 9 with fuel i ll close today with guidance for fiscal year 2020 as always we have several assumptions in our guidance including the economic conditions currency rates and the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest and most important markets remain generally consistent as always we have not included any potential change in the value of our investment in jd com we re also continuing to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions as we mentioned in october we will actively manage pricing and margins as warranted with our customers and shareholders in mind regarding flipkart with any change like this there can be some disruption to the business but we feel good about our ability to transition with minimal interruption there ll be some additional costs to comply with the new regulations but we don t currently believe they will be significant enough to impact total company guidance for the year you ll recall we issued fiscal year 2020 guidance last october while there s been some growing uncertainty in the overall macro economic and political environment we re confident in our ability to operate our business and serve customers effectively in most any economic climate we finished the year with good momentum so today we re reiterating the previous guidance provided in october which speaks to the consistency of our business i ll highlight a few of the key guidance metrics and you can find a complete listing in this morning s press release i ll start with sales guidance we expect to deliver total net sales growth of at least 3 on a constant currency basis in fy 2020 with the back half of the year a little stronger than the first half due to some timing and comparison including the deconsolidation of brazil and the addition of flipkart keep in mind on a reported basis we ve seen increased pressure from currency as noted in our fourth quarter results if the current spot rates were to continue into next year there will be currency headwind to reported sales of around 3 billion with most of that impact in the first half of the year for walmart u s we still expect comp store growth of 2 5 to 3 despite the more difficult comparisons we expect the quarterly cadence of comp store growth to be fairly consistent throughout the year ranging from approximately 2 5 to 3 5 in any given quarter walmart u s ecommerce is expected to grow sales around 35 in fy 2020 and we expect the quarterly growth to range from around 30 to below 40 range we still expect the leverage expenses by approximately 20 basis points in fy 2020 we ll continue to make progress on being more efficient at lowering cost especially in walmart u s stores where we expect leverage to be even higher than the 20 basis points due to continuing strong sales and improved productivity on a consolidated basis we expect to slightly lever in q1 with leverage improving each quarter during the year timing of expenses can impact leverage quarter to quarter versus our expectations turning to profitability we continue to expect consolidated operating income dollars to decline by low single digit percentage primarily due to flipkart being included for the full year versus the partial year in fiscal 2019 we would expect operating income to increase excluding the flipkart effects we expect eps to decline by low single digit percentage which assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 26 5 to 27 5 keep in mind that increase in the rate relative to fy 2019 adjusted tax rate relates to the flipkart losses having very little tax benefit in the near term which we ve mentioned previously excluding the full year eps dilution expected from flipkart we would expect eps to grow by a low to mid single digit percentage as you would expect the quarterly year over year change in operating income and eps will be quite varied during the year due primarily to the impact of flipkart only being in our results in part q3 and all of q4 last year we currently expect operating income and eps to decrease by around 10 in q1 decrease by a low to mid single digit percentage in q2 and q3 and increase in q4 to achieve our full year guidance as always the growth quarter to quarter can change due to timing and other factors our priorities for capital allocation remains unchanged we ll focus first on investing in our business and growth initiatives we also remain committed to our dividend as evidenced by the increase we announced today and we continue with our current share repurchase program before i close i want to share a change in the communication cadence with the analysts and investors similar to the past we will host the question and answer session in northwest arkansas in june in conjunction with our annual shareholders meeting however instead of hosting an investment community meeting in october as we typically have we plan to have an event in february 2020 in new york in conjunction with our q4 earnings release this meeting will be similar to the format we typically had where you ll hear updates on our performance guidance and strategy and interact with key leaders but a location that s closer to many of you as always we ll continue to assess the optimal approach to communicating with our investors and analysts let me close by saying thank you for your support of our company i m as optimistic as i have ever been about what walmart can become it s a great company with a long history of transformation and we expect to win and with that i d be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting the question and answer session operator instructions thank you and our first question is coming from the line of simeon gutman with morgan stanley simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst hey good morning guys my first question is on expense leverage you mentioned the 20 basis points and i think you just clarified in your comments brett it s total company so can we dig a little bit more into what s driving it and if we back into gross margin then within the context of your overall guidance that implies gross margins will be down and so my question is if gross margin pressure is lets say more acute than you expect how much flexibility do you have on the expense line over the course of the year brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks simeon we talked a lot over the last few months about last few quarters about expense leverage it comes from a number of different places we ve seen great expense leverage in the u s certainly good comp sales helps a lot with that but as the technology and the training that we ve done over the past technology put in place and the training we ve done in the past several years is really paying dividends in the stores with our associates and how we serve our customers so as you saw even in october some of the technology that s coming something s we keep doing with our stores we expect the productivity in the u s stores will continue to be a big part of what we do when you look at a really around the world we re seeing good results and leverage around the world in different pockets as you know with leverage it could be a lot of small things that add up but we re doing some bigger things as well i talked recently about the work we re doing in shared services that we re reviewing that as more of a real strength of the company this past year we hired a chief procurement officer for the first time for goods not for resale and so we re putting more effort toward using our scale to benefit our leverage so i feel good about the numbers we ve put out and i think there s going to be room for us the timing of that is always challenging to figure out you re correct on gross margin and that s the implication that we have we re going to continue to invest in price for the customer which we ve done the mix of the business will continue to change which changes about the nature of our company and we ve always said a couple of things one is getting our expenses right allows us to do what we need to do from a gross margin perspective to remain competitive and be there for our customers and so that s the main think we want to do with expenses and we have a lot of leverage to pull as a company then we can make changes throughout the year hope i answered your question simeon simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst yes yes so my follow up with regards to ecommerce and online and i think doug made a comment around profitability and maybe repeat customer purchases and i think you did as well brett so look it s taking longer than it sounds like it s taking longer than you think to get to profitability i think we know that already but can you talk about what s been the biggest surprise is it you re making less on the consumables mix than you thought you re just not seeing enough long tail yet i think doug insinuated we should make progress on the repeat rate i assume that means it s not as strong as you think is it costing you more to run these mega dcs any more clarity on what line of progress we need to see most on to get to that profitability doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer yeah simeon this is doug i think the headline answer is mix and that mix has got to generate a customer experience that drives repeat business so if you break it down into pieces we got this advantage of having the stores and fresh and perishables in the assortment of supercenters close to customers we re trying to drive that advantage and i believe we ve got good traction there in parallel we re trying to build an ecommerce business in apparel general merchandise you saw recently a new home launch from us with the brand modern for example trying to build an apparel home hard lines business that brings customers back and generates a positive contribution margin for the basket and there are different components of that basket there s the pick cost the shipping cost and then just the gross margin on the products and the thing that s taking longer than what i would have guessed is to build that merchandise assortment including the brands that we re trying to add to a place where we got a repeatable healthy mix of business online so we re pedaling fast trying to make that happen and disappointed it s taken us long as it has simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst thank you operator the next question is from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim securities proceed with your question bob drbul guggenheim securities analyst hey good morning guys doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer hi bob bob drbul guggenheim securities analyst i guess the first question is on the ecommerce side can you talk a little but about the success the quarterly success and your confidence in 35 and how much of the toy category helped both in the fourth quarter when you think about the next year guidance on ecommerce doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer bob this is doug we re confident in that 35 number for ecommerce and we ll drive that as i just mentioned earlier with the food and perishables business coming out of the supercenters and we ll also drive it with the fulfillment center assortment that we re working on toys was a help in the fourth quarter there was an opportunity there and the team did a good job of seizing it in total across stores and online bob drbul guggenheim securities analyst okay and then can you spend a little bit of time you ve given us a lot on the flipkart performance but i guess can you talk about the topline of the flipkart since the regulatory changes and sort of how you re thinking about the business in terms of the trends you said you re in line with the plan in the fourth quarter but when you think about where we are today heading into 2019 doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer i can t comment on the future the guidance for flipkart in the first quarter i ll just say that the things that have happened have been disappointed in some way but they haven t shaken our confidence and excitement about what this is going to mean to the company long term and this isn t a story about one quarter or even one year we hope to have an effective productive dialogue as it relates to future changes that happen but in terms of how the business has behaved it s in line with what we thought it would be operator thank you the next question is coming from the line of peter benedict with baird please proceed with your question peter benedict baird analyst hey guys good morning first doug at that tail end of your comments on your prepared remarks you mentioned new revenue streams as part of the longer term opportunity for walmart so can you expand on that thought a little bit and perhaps speak to how you envision these potentially playing in the longer term roi equation for the company that s my first question doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer sure in fact i will take you back to the october analyst meeting peter we put up a chart that we referred to as an ecosystem chart and our thought process is that we ve got this core merchandising capability that we can continue to strengthen and we can transform in some ways in terms of how we work differently how we use technology and build on that with data and other components of our business to grow health and wellness where we ve got an opportunity to be more important in that space and financial service is another area where we ve historically done some things but there appeared to be more opportunities there for us and there are some others that were represented on that chart that we re currently working on in a global fashion to create a business model by market that not only resonates with customers but also delivers return for shareholders peter benedict baird analyst okay thanks for that and then brett i just the u s average ticket up 3 3 another great number there can you maybe unpack that a little bit inflation mix and is there any tariff pass through that we ve seen or that we re going to see as we look out to 2019 thank you brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer hey you bet thanks peter yes in traffic and ticket you probably heard me say this every quarter traffic and ticket quarter to quarter can go back and forth and certainly we re focused on both and we re focused on the total happy with both if you look at traffic it s a two and a half year stack so we re continuing to see good traffic coming at our stores this is going to be influenced some by the continuing shift of our business with online grocery with e commerce you get a little different mix of basket in there and category by category peter you re seeing some categories that are deflating we always have some of that electronics will be one of those and we ve had some tariffs and there are places in which that does gets passed along and that does impact ticket we re not seeing a great deal of inflation i would call it fairly modest at this point when you look at what we re doing from a price perspective i think our customers really aren t seeing much inflation because of what we re doing operator thank you the next question comes from kelly bania with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking the questions just going back to the operating expense leverage you talked about some of the training and technology impact on that but can you give us more color in terms of the rollout and some of the technologies that you highlighted at the analyst day what we should expect this year and over the next couple of years doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer this is doug kelly i think it s going to take us some time to sort that out and communicate specifically with some of the pieces of equipment that you saw but it will happen and we re just going to take our time roll it from store group to store group i m really pleased and excited with how our managers are responding to all these new tools they re now out in the stores there is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for it so that is a key part of our plan and we ll update you as things go on but it will take us some time to put all of the pieces together that we shared with you and some others that we ve got coming brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer and kelly this is brett we do as we said in october we do feel like that as we see technologies developed and the processes we re coming up with we do see opportunities to leverage over the next period of time as well kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst great and just a follow up on the last comment about your customers not maybe seeing that much inflation just curious if that s really specific to grocery and what you re seeing from your vendors there in terms of price increases it sounds like your customers are not really seeing that but maybe can you just elaborate on what you re seeing and what categories you are seeing inflation or deflation doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer i don t think we should get too specific by category i think i would just say that the combination of cost pressures that we re feeling with the price reductions that we re making has worked out in a way that the customers are not feeling very much impacted brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer and our merchants it changes every year but our merchants are always working through something that s inflating something that s deflating they re really good at managing mix in various different situations operator thank you the next question is from the line of karen short with barclays please proceed with your question karen short barclays analyst hi thanks just looking at u s in the fourth quarter obviously i mean it was a very impressive leverage number and i guess what i m asking is when i look through 2020 i guess i don t really see anything that changes the cadence on the gross margin decline if any thing maybe it gets a little bit easier because you lap transport and then it seems like you kind of hit your stride on the expense leverage so is 4q kind of something we should expect in terms of the composition going forward because of those numbers are finally getting you to that tipping point where you can see past the flipkart dilution i guess brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll speak first specifically to the u s because i think that was the main question we re really seeing the productivity loop back in action in walmart u s where you get the sales and it allows you to do what we want to do in prices allows you to lower expenses the productivity loop is alive and well in the u s the mix of our business continues to change as you look at ecommerce growing in the u s the acquisition of flipkart and so that does change when you look at the total company but as for leverage i mentioned from a total company perspective we expect to slightly lever in q1 and that just to get progressively better as we get through those through the year and we certainly couldn t do that or couldn t make that statement if we didn t feel pretty comfortable with what we re seeing in the u s again we ve assumed this kind of sales growth to get that leverage sales growth has helped a lot in getting that leverage but that s how we see the year playing out karen short barclays analyst okay that s helpful and my second question is just on ecommerce i guess i was wondering if there was anything about the fourth quarter i guess that surprised you on ecommerce in terms of either losses well specifically losses but i also was just wondering if you could give us an update on a number of skus total number of skus both 1p and then 3p and then maybe just little a update on the mirroring of skus that your fcs because it seems to me that that s also one of the things that will help from the losses that is going a little slower than expected doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer karen this is doug i think that s right we re making good progress on mirroring and our total count is in the 75 million range now there wasn t anything that i can think of that really surprised us in the fourth quarter as it relates to e commerce i would mention that you may remember a year ago we had some fulfillment center challenges and the team did a great job of preparing for peak and executing it this year and the customer experience was a lot better so i was really pleased to see that operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robbie ohmes with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question robbie ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks just another follow up on e commerce so you guys called out doubling delivery again this year can you maybe doug remind us how you guys are executing that who the key partners are and maybe how the math is working on that how do you make that leverageable is there any scale opportunity there doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer sure hi robbie we re using a combination of last mile solutions we re using crowd source companies and we have our own platform that s called spark that we re experimenting with and we re still playing around with some associate deliveries in a small way trying to figure that out but it s the crowd source delivery platforms they re really helping us achieve scale generally speaking the delivery cost cover the cost and we right now are operating with something like breakeven mentalities it relates to delivery cost so customers are bearing that but they really do like the convenience and i m excited about figuring all this out and the combination of great stores that can increasingly function as productive fulfillment centers which by the way is helping keep pressure on in stocks which is what we saw from the u k years ago really like that healthy pressure together with pickup which continues to have a high nps score and people love it now with delivery and future enhancements in the future as it relates to the service end of that caused me to be really excited it looks to me like there s a long runway here where our supercenters can double as fulfillment centers and stores and also generate a great store experience so it looks promising robbie ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst that sounds great and just a follow up question for you i think in the presentation on china you called that intensifying competition and i think also just mentioned slower growth overall in china can you just maybe fill us in on what you guys are seeing in china with the consumer overall over there doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer if you just read the headlines you might imagine things are pretty tough but that s not really what we re seeing and if you look at our comp performance brett talked about a calendar change but that aside things have held up pretty well and the sam s clubs continue to be a really strong i m excited about the fact we ve got more of those in the pipeline and the comp performance in sam s is great the supercenters have been performing better and they look better i think operationally we ve improved and then we ve been playing around with some supermarkets and may find an opportunity there which can play a key role in last mile delivery this relationship that we mentioned on last mile they are resulting in incredible customer experiences in terms of both the value for delivery which is still think around of 1 and the speed with which it can get delivered given the density of the market is incredible so that feels ok and i think if you look at the overall relationship considering all the things are happening in china we re in pretty good shape so i m still i m optimistic and recognize the tremendous opportunity that market has and we re constantly trying to think through our position in that market and how we might improve it operator thank you the next question comes from the line of seth sigman with credit suisse please proceed with your question seth sigman credit suisse analyst thanks very much good morning guys i want to follow up on the online grocery conversation so i think you said that you re going to add another 1 000 stores this year i m curious more about how the ramp curve in the new stores maybe changing as you see growth in consumer interest and awareness of the offering and then the second piece of the question on the topic of mix i think when you purchase something through the online grocery app you can actually add things outside of just grocery i m just curious are you seeing any major change in mix there in the context of maybe improving profitability over time thanks doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer i think two dimensions there one is the customer enthusiasm for those kinds of offers and it s a loud and clear to us that customers no surprise are really busy and that if we can find a way to make things more convenient for them with pick up and delivery they re all over it so i think the ramp there in terms of how our comp stores will behave in addition to the roll out that we re doing for additional stores is going to continue to be strong we have been adding assortment over time some of the happiest customers that i have come across are customers that can place their back to school order and a grocery order together and go through pickup and knockout that list of things that you need for your kids as they go back to school so that includes a lot of items that are not food items and then over time we just keep adding as the stores learn how to pick categories that are different in nature than food it s a different situation to go and pick light bulbs our go to pick some of these categories that may not have as much shelf capacity as we have in food so we have to learn how to adjust our modulars so that you can expand the categories and the items and i do think that will help mix over time and we may have seen that already i haven t been tracking that part of it that closely but it makes sense that that basket would change shape and the profitability would look better seth sigman credit suisse analyst okay thanks for that and then just one follow up question on the inventory growth up 0 8 on a comp basis in the u s i think the first time in the recent memory strength of sales obviously very clear but anything else to highlight there that maybe driving that doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer at first i would say the job that greg and the team have done on the inventory over last few years has been phenomenal i mean being a merchant for so much of my career i have so much respect for the way that they have driven in stock levels reduced inventory reduce deletive inventory for quarter after quarter now what happened in this case is that we saw the snap shift into the end of january we build food inventories at the end of the quarter to make sure that we were maximizing that opportunity and there s a little bit of pull forward of inventory in anticipation of what tariffs could mean in a worse case scenario but we certainly hope and expect that that won t happen so i m not worried about inventory level it s high quality and there s a bit of timing difference there and overall that picture still looks really good operator the next question is coming from the line of michael lasser with ubs please proceed with your question michael lasser ubs analyst good morning thanks a lot for taking my question so if we look at the midpoint of your u s comp guidance it s 2 5 to 3 for 2020 it s about 100 basis points below what you achieved in 2019 should we take that to mean that s what you think the healthy spending environment driven in part by all the tax reform contributed to your sales in the year ago period at about 100 basis points doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer i think that s exactly right i think we re just recognizing that this last year had some tailwinds and that this year we won t have brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah obviously there is some more challenging comparisons because of what we did this year but i think what doug s saying on healthy economic environment you put a number of things together i think this is the range that we feel good about going into the year but still obviously a very very healthy growth michael lasser ubs analyst my follow up question is on flipkart how much is the regulatory environment going to influence your investment posture in that market so if we see no change and the competition eases up are you going to look to maybe moderate your investments in the end market over time brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think we ll see how the year goes and respond appropriately but i would remind everybody that flipkart is already an ecosystem there s the phonepe a payment platform there s a last mile delivery there s a myntra and jabong businesses in apparel so it s not just one thing and it s just not an ecommerce business in the traditional sense there s a lot of dimension to it so there just like here we ve got a lot of different variables we can play what demands the total and i think we ve forecasted it appropriately and we ll respond as the year goes on doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer michael when you look at i mean all the reasons we cited for going into india acquiring flipkart when you look at the continued ecommerce growth in india the size of the market the growing middle class all those things are still as true today as they were six months ago so the reasons we re excited about the market are still there michael lasser ubs analyst thank you operator the next question comes from the line of oliver chen with cowen company please proceed with your question oliver chen cowen company analyst hi thank you good morning a lot of our data is showing really great adoption of curbside grocery pickup as well as satisfaction here as well what are your thoughts on how incrementality is unfolding also as this continues to be a very popular and widespread service what s the future in terms of packing and taking in labor as you balance just making sure your in store experience is very good for those who aren t using curbside and also leveraging what you can with automation and robotics to optimize the total experience doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer good questions oliver i think the mix of new customers in online grocery is positive and encouraging to us it s not just existing customer using the service so that s an exciting development and as it relates to productivity we re continuing to learn how to pick more efficiently using the apps and the tools that you ve seen in the stores plus we ve got a few experiments going on with more automation to try and solve for future higher volumes you can get to a point and we do cap in some store locations a place where we have too many pickers in the store and it gets they get in the way of our customer shopping and site counter so we got to manage that effectively and we had a salem a project alert i forgot what we call it alphabot maybe the announcement that we made last year that s one to keep an eye on but we re actively sorting out how to increase our in stocks increase productivity and how the customer experience continue to improve from an nps point of view that will be an ongoing stream of work brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer and we re learning from the stores that were early in the process as they get larger and larger we re able to take those learnings from those stores that have been in the system a little longer to stores that are just coming online oliver chen cowen company analyst well brett on the topic of curbside how are you thinking about roic and payback and as you make judgments you re rapidly rolling this out and people like it but i m curious about your thoughts on the multi year and the investment versus the long term share gains as well as customer reception brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer i do think about roi a lot you re correct i when we re together as a team i am talking about doug s team we spend as you can imagine most of our time thinking through the prioritization of the various things that are going on inside the company and as we go through those discussions we always have the p l and the balance sheet and roi in front of us as part of those discussions and it s our job as the management team to make these things work together over time the customer acceptance we re seeing with online grocery in particular is a one where you look at it and say we are going to lean into this and there maybe things along the line and we delay this or can we stop something else but we re going to lean into things like this and see when we see them working for the customer and as a team we will ensure that it works out for our shareholders over the mid to long term oliver chen cowen company analyst thank you operator the next question comes from the line of scott mushkin with wolfe research please proceed with your questions scott mushkin wolfe research analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions so i have one kind of just shop keeping item with the discrete items in the fourth quarter i m trying to understand comparability i think it s 47 point leverage we had in the u s business is that including or excluding the discrete items and if it s inclusive what how many basis points were the discrete items doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer yeah scott we had mentioned and that we ve of course you ve just heard it for the first time we mentioned in the script that we that leverage is higher than it would normally be because of those discrete items last year if you back those out we still levered slightly in the quarter and for the year but clearly fourth quarter was higher than you would normally expect because of those discrete items scott mushkin wolfe research analyst so there was just slight and would u s ebit have grown without the discrete items brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer i am sorry what did you say scott i missed the question scott mushkin wolfe research analyst would u s ebit have grown without the discrete items brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer it would have been roughly flat scott mushkin wolfe research analyst roughly flat okay great then my second question is regarding just kind of the strategy in the u s i mean it seems like if i back away a little bit you guys talked about omni channel pressuring probably little bit more seems like the international business is pressuring a little bit more if i kind of add those things up it doesn t seem like there s a lot of wiggle room to invest a lot in price in the u s am i missing that or is that how you would frame it as well brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer scott i think we ve got enough room as you know we ve been on a multi year plan to reduce pricing in the u s and we re just continuing that there are some price investments in sam s and in some international markets but i m comfortable when you look at our forecast that we ve got an appropriately aggressive price investment remaining as we finish off what we started years ago scott mushkin wolfe research analyst thank you operator the next question is from the line of paul trussell with deutsche bank please proceed with your question paul trussell deutsche bank analyst good morning and good quarter just wanted to maybe touch on guidance certainly you are reiterating fiscal 2020 just given the moving parts in the business but maybe just a little more detail around the cadence of the guide specifically i think in 1q you mentioned operating income to be down 10 just to what extent is that flipkart versus currency or how should we think about the top line headwinds from snap or tax refunds just one going kind of cadence and improvement you expect to see over the balance of the year what does that come from brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer yes paul this is brett so if you look at the cadence primarily what you are seeing in q1 is going to be related to flipkart if you look at the guidance we ve given last year and just look at how that would play out over the quarter you can get pretty quickly to that number there s always going to the timing of other parts of the business they go from one quarter to another based on how expenses are flowing but that s the biggest part of q1 and q2 as well because it did not come in our results until partway through q3 there s always we can have things move around between quarters 50 million here 60 million there and it can make a difference in how that number looks from a profitability standpoint but flipkart is the biggest part of that next year paul trussell deutsche bank analyst got it and then just on as we look toward fiscal 2020 just your outlook on transportation expenses and the headwind there and what you re seeing also on the wage front doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer on the wage side paul we ve just been moving up market by market our average now is about 17 50 for an hourly associate in the u s and i m comfortable that we ve got appropriate wage investments to get the talent we need baked into the plan transportation costs i m not really close to what s happening right now i would expect based on what s happening with the drivers if we re going to be better shape from a transportation point of view as we go through the year and it is helpful that gas prices are in the range that they are in and hope that continues to be the case i think that s one of the things that benefited this last year so glad to see them where they are operator thank you your next question is from the line of edward kelly with wells fargo please proceed with your question edward kelly wells fargo analyst yes hi good morning i just wanted to ask a follow up question actually on price investments so there has been some early signs i guess that food inflation beginning to couple a bit and i m just as curious as to what your thoughts are on allowing inflation to flow through if they were to continue to strengthen i guess as you think about that right holding the line would require a potential i guess incremental investment above what s planned is that something you d be willing to do just help us understand how you think about the dynamic of food price inflation versus universe s price investment and what s budgeted for the year doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer before i mention i just want to clarify what i mentioned earlier 17 50 is actually 17 55 is the average hourly associate number with wages and benefits as it relates to pricing i think as i mentioned earlier we got an appropriately aggressive plan baked in and it would depend on what happened with competition and the severity of the price increases i think we would manage margins as we bring all these variables together and don t anticipate having a lot more inflation on the food side and on the non food side we re continuing to experience deflation in that part of the basket kind of works out edward kelly wells fargo analyst okay and then just one follow up going on online grocery pickup and delivery how are you thinking about the end goal here is it one to two hour delivery for our customers how do you think about the cost to get where you want to go and how it impacts the timeframe around eventually improving e commerce losses doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer i think we ll end up in a position where the customer can pick depending on the occasion how they want to shop there will be families that come into stores once a week or twice a month or whatever and they ll also use pickup they ll also use delivery and we ll have the ability to serve them in all those ways there s an interesting opportunity if you could get to a point where customers pick their delivery window in the home or to the door unattended you can decouple speed of delivery in a way that helps us manage costs so as the volume goes up and density improves we ll try to figure out how to drive a basket business it looks more like dense route than a one hour or a 30 minute race to deliver to somebody s house that maybe different for restaurant delivery than it is for grocery delivery it seems like those use cases are different enough so we ve got some tests going on and real time learning here to try and do it in a way that customers want it to be done and create that optionality for them and it s kind of one more mix opportunity for us we grew up managing merchandise mix and still do and now we re managing a service mix and the good news is that once customers are in your ecosystem they ll use you in some way as i mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks you get the opportunity to expand on that relationship and that s what we re trying to do brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer scott i want to this is brett i want to come back and clear myself i said that u s income u s operating income ex one items was flat i misspoken that it was up a little bit in the fourth quarter operator thank you your next question is from the line of edward yruma with keybanc please proceed with your question edward yruma keybanc analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my question i guess two quick ones first on macro obviously less tailwinds this year but are you starting to see any changes in consumer behavior that would indicate that we re starting to level off or seeing some deterioration and i guess as a follow up you re running a dual time strategy with the jet i guess how would you score your kind of jet business and serving those urban millennials thank you brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer edward this is brett i ll start off in the consumer i think it feels pretty good to us you see all the numbers that we see wages are still pretty good unemployment rate s low gas prices are down year on year so there s a number of things i think are still working in favor of the consumer like you mentioned we re watching it as we always do we re monitoring it and making sure that we re in the right place with the customer i think no matter of the environment we tend to do pretty well and are able to react and be there for those customers but we re monitoring it as we always do doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer the first quarter is always a challenge because you got an easter change there s weather that s a little more impactful than it s volatility we got the snap moving into the first quarter the tax rebates i mean different windows of times sometimes they are concentrated in a few days sometimes they are spread out over a week so it makes it exciting to manage q1 but underneath all that i ll agree with what brett said they re in pretty good shape on jet i m really pleased with the role that it s playing attracting new brands and our focus as we mentioned before is on urban markets so it s an opportunity to learn and to try new items and different items in some cases that we have at wallmart com so that s the role it s playing operator thank you the next question is from the line of charles grom with gordon haskett please proceed with your question charles grom gordon haskett analyst hey thanks good morning and great quarter here just one near term question brett do you guys expect that 40 basis points snap benefit to reverse in the first quarter and then long term question just with regard to digital when you think about 2019 losses being greater than 2018 would you expect the 2019 losses to be the peak based on what you know now and then as a follow up to that when you think about mix being issue when you think about correcting that you guys were pretty active a couple of years ago acquiring more of the digitally native brands do you feel like you need to do more of that to sort of fix that issue brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer chuck there s a lot in that question i ll take the first two and then i ll hand off to doug on the snap benefits i mean we are clear you know that we believe that it did pull forward some into the fourth quarter again with all the things that happened in the first quarter i think we did pull that forward but there s other things that can potentially make up for that but that s why we ve given the quarterly guidance any quarter it can be kind of 2 5 and 3 2 5 3 5 for the year on the ecommerce loss guidance where we ve said that we expect losses to be a little more in this next year we re not going to give guidance past that which i think probably won t surprise you doug you want to talk about the doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer yes preserving flexibility there i think it s important we have never let a digital transformation at this scale before so we re figuring this out as we go but if there s an opportunity to be more aggressive given the total balance of the business i mean we would be thinking about that adding digital brands we re after assortment we re after a repetitive customer relationship and we re looking constantly at various acquisitions and i think what you ve seen from us in the past will continue to some extent it s impossible to predict the pace of it or the number so we ll just have to see at the end of the year how it will work out dan binder investor relations okay that will conclude our q a session and our call today we thank you for your time and interest in walmart doug mcmillon

a man walks past the flags of the european union and united kingdom outside the houses of parliament in london tolga akmen afp two major divorces are in the making in march the obvious one is brexit which officially occurs on march 29 the other is the deadline for the us china trade negotiations on march 1 when us tariffs on 200 billion worth of chinese imports will increase from 10 per cent to 25 per cent even though a trade deal is likely as both sides want to have a deal and the market is expecting one this will come down to the wire as the gap in what can be achieved in the deal is still daunting both negotiations have profound implications for years to come like all divorces the disagreements are acrimonious with second and third order costs on on everyone else involved so far britain seems to be bracing for a major slowdown deal or no deal the british statistics office reported that the british economy grew only 0 2 percent during the fourth quarter of 2018 with growth falling in december as bank of england governor mark carney warned in his global outlook this week the global expansion is now weakening and risks are intensifying because global monetary policy has been tightening trade tensions increasing and china is also slowing the more important risk he identified is the reversal of globalisation caused by growing imbalance on the trade side due to the continued us current account deficit in a situation when the us dollar has been more dominant than ever interesting enough the chinese are no longer major buyers of dollars as their foreign exchange reserves have remained flat whereas going forward the us current account deficit will be funded more than ever by the japanese through their quantitative easing and also the eurozone expect us trade pressure also on japan and the eurozone the second globalisation risk is social with greater imbalance in income and wealth in many countries because the benefits of free trade are shared unequally consumers overall benefit from global trade but many workers in advanced countries have either lost their jobs or seen fall in real wages the third globalisation risk is the loss of control and trust in democracy and sovereignty in many countries part of the problem is that barriers to trade have increased three times higher for services than for products and this hurts countries that are strong in the services trade such as the us and uk this is where the growing protectionism is going to hurt everyone the bank of england estimates that an increase in tariffs of 10 percentage points between us and its trading partners would take 2 5 per cent of us output and one per cent off global output through just the trade channel alone if non trade factors are taken into account such as tighter financial conditions greater uncertainty and permanent tariff increases the output losses could double to five per cent for us gdp and half that for global gdp cushion long term shocks it is thus not surprising that despite the recovery in the advanced economies business sector investments have not increased commensurately indeed uk business investments growth has fallen by 3 7 per cent in the past year despite a recovery in growth profits and accommodative monetary policy carney s conclusion is that it isn t easy to win a trade war what is true for brexit is also true for us china trade disputes the barriers to reconciliation are huge because there are now fundamental differences in outlook approaches and territorial sovereignty on both sides of the atlantic english channel and the pacific business confidence cannot be good because in the case of investors in britain no one can predict with any certainty what deal is going to be struck including the possibility of a no deal either way investors will take on a low risk approach by avoiding long term investments and sticking to cash there is little doubt that in the short run britain will be the loser but with a flexible exchange rate she will be able to cushion any long term trade shocks with a competitive sterling at the same the eurozone which sells a large portion of its cars and other products to britain would also have to deal with a trade shock on top of the internal complexities of keeping the union intact the yellow vest protests in france has weakened the ability of the french government to negotiate strongly with the germans on european fiscal discipline issues at a time when the italians are now making very different noises from the other partners on austerity immigration and foreign policy issues in the pacific zone the longer the us china trade tensions persists the worse will be the investment climate overall the major trading partners of both nations do not wish to make clear partnership choices given the huge potential size of the china market and limits to the growth in the mature us market what is unspoken at the present moment is that if no deal is made exchange rate flexibility of the rmb cannot be ruled out no one wants to go this route because a competitive devaluation as the solution to a trade war can only lead to another global recession that is reminiscent of the 1930s so even though the west worries like carney about the risk of china s debt overhang the reality is that if china truly undertakes the structural reforms that almost everyone agrees on she will emerge more productive and competitive than before even in the face of higher trade tariffs us wins by losing with a balanced current account situation china has both the fiscal space and the monetary policy potential to undertake the necessary structural reforms and reflate domestic consumption at the same time this is because even if china buys more from the us the rest of the world would worry if that increase in imports comes at their expense all this means is that not only is the trade war negative directly for us consumers it will hurt trade and jobs for the rest of the world this is why feuding parties need to be realistic and come to terms that cannot be ideologically pure on either side for the us hawks to expect that the us can enforce standards on china is as realistic as china enforcing ideas on us hawks even for the mightiest military force in the world to sit down with the taliban is to admit that the us wins by losing wars negotiations are now down to the wire without any illusion as anything will be solved in the medium term as that is the negotiation style in washington expect nothing but higher political risks in the near future asia news

a lot happen to draw the strength of our results brett will go into more detail on our results shortly i am particularly encouraged by our sales results in the quarter in q4 walmart u s grew comp sales 4 2 excluding fuel ecommerce sales increased 43 and we gained market share in key categories such as grocery and toys according to nielsen and the npd group sam s club finished the year with another strong quarter with comp sales growth of 5 3 excluding fuel and tobacco and in international comps were positive in the majority of our markets strong top line results allow us to reiterate the fy 2020 sales and profit guidance we gave in october even as we landed fy 2019 ahead of where we expected we strive to make every day easier for busy families as we increase convenience and save them money and time part of our strategy is to build on our existing strengths such as having a broad assortment including fresh and perishable foods within 10 miles of 90 of the u s population our stores and clubs are becoming more digital and we re using technology to change how we work more customers can now access our brand through multiple channels and it s important that we engage them in different ways we ve learned that those customers who shop with us both in stores and online spend about twice as much in total and they spend more in our stores across the business you can see examples of how we re meeting the changing needs of customers and delivering solutions that are increasing customer engagement in the u s we offer grocery pick up at more than 2 100 locations and grocery delivery at nearly 800 locations which represents about 69 and 36 of the population respectively feedback from customers about these services continues to be very positive which speaks of the capabilities of roughly 37 000 personal shoppers in mexico we re delighting customers with new experiences such as a secured digital payment option it s available on their mobile phones and in store kiosks that offer a broad assortment of products with flexible pickup times in addition through our investment in the crowdsourced delivery platform dada jd daojia customers in china get their merchandise in less than an hour of placing the order and it s picked from a network of more than 280 locations we continue to build trust which we believe will become even more of a competitive advantage around the world walmart plays an important role in the communities we serve by using our scale for good whether it s our work to promote small businesses and local farmers in places like india or a larger scale initiatives such as our effort to double our use of renewable energy in u s by 2025 customers can feel good about walmart the company that starts everyday with a goal of earning their business it s nice to be recognized for the work we re doing to promote shared value in fact the company recently received an a minus rating on the cdp s annual environmental scorecard up from a b rating last year and we re ranked as the survey s top performing u s based food retailer shared value is an important concept and something that we have fully embraced as we think about how to best allocate our time and capital deliver strong efficient growth reduce costs and operate with discipline within this construct customers associates communities and shareholders can win now let s move on to highlights from the year for our operating segments i ll begin with walmart u s where the team had a great year comp sales growth of 3 6 for fiscal year 2019 exceeded our expectations the work that team has done to balance inventory levels within stock rates is impressive the team leveraged operating expenses overall even as we invested in wages training technology and ecommerce store level productivity is strong due in part to the training we are providing our associates as the nature of work continues to change we re innovating to empower associates to better serve customers as they develop new skills thriving their jobs and growing their careers this coming year we ll add new ways for associates to better manage their schedules and earn greater incentive payouts and will introduce new training options including through advances in technology and the gamification of educational experiences overall i m pleased with what i see operationally and with our merchandizing the investments we re making in our people remodels and technology are helping to ensure that our stores are easy to navigate fast friendly and fun to shop having a great store or site starts with having great merchandise in our stores you can see the quality improvements in fresh food and in apparel with our new private brands we re also doing well in our seasonal businesses and toys we are making progress in ecommerce our focus remains on earning repeat visits and strengthening our assortment of merchandise we re expanding our assortment improving search enhancing our website and executing better on the fundamentals such as product reviews inventory mirroring and on time delivery to accomplish this and of course we remain committed to providing a superior value proposition as we compete aggressively on price across a broad spectrum of products sales in ecommerce increased 40 for the year we will continue to play off and innovate as we shape the future of our omni retail this includes the expansion of innovative services like online grocery pickup and delivery our previous investments in fulfillment centers and systems plus our acquisitions are helping us drive strong sales but we need to make more progress to improve profitability our fulfillment shipping costs were improving as we continue to enhance our assortment repeat visits should increase and contribute to improved profitability we might get progress during the year to add more brands and exclusive items through new partnerships with lord taylor ellen degeneres advance auto sofia vergara and fanatics to name a few these initiatives are contributing to the improvements we see in key metrics like the customer value index as well as nps which is now more than 10 points ahead of last year many opportunities exist mainly driven by data and we ll look to leverage our unique assets and capability better than we do today at sam s club the team has taken bold steps to transform the business by focusing on people products and working in a more digital way excluding fuel and tobacco comp sales for the year increased 5 7 and ecommerce sales grew 27 when someone downloads the app shops on samsclub com or uses our scan go they re more likely to renew we re encouraged by the trends we see in membership as of year end we saw improvements in sign ups and plus penetration and membership count is essentially flat to what it was a year ago despite the closure of nearly 10 of the fleet in international eight of our markets posted positive comp sales for the year including the four major markets and overall sales increased 2 9 in constant currency it s been a big year for international as we run the business while shaping the portfolio walmex continues to be strong the improvements we re making are helping drive traffic and we saw improvements in nps in each of our formats similar to the u s we re now leveraging our store base to offer same day delivery we recently expanded the available assortment to offer more than 5 000 general merchandise items to this service we continue to invest in our stores and in ecommerce to build an omni channel experience tailored to customers in this market our business in canada also continues to perform well the team s moving quickly to modernize the store base and expand omni channel capabilities with a focus on gaining greater access to urban markets for example we ve entered into new partnerships this year in cities like toronto and vancouver to help expand our delivery options in grocery and general merchandise in the u k brexit and the potential implications of a hard brexit is increasingly on the mind of everyone no matter the situation asda will always work to keep prices as low as possible for its customers i visited our team in the u k a few weeks ago and i m really impressed with their performance their attitudes and the leadership they re amazing in india we remain optimistic about the ecommerce opportunity given the size of the market the low penetration of ecommerce and the retail channel and the pace at which it s growing in the future we hope to work with the government for pro growth policies that can allow this nascent industry and the domestic manufacturers farmers and suppliers to benefit from it develop and prosper in terms of the regulatory environment we were disappointed in the recent change in law and the lack of consultation but the team has worked to ensure that we re in compliance with the new rules we are committed to providing sellers with a world class platform to sell on and customers with a high quality of service we hope for a collaborative regulatory process going forward which results in a level playing field turning to china we continue to see significant growth opportunities overall we ve identified provinces that are priority for us and we re improving the value proposition through better quality of fresh items as well as a new store designs and omni channel initiatives uncertainties with trade or other macro factors can make for a more challenging environment but i like the things we re doing to position ourselves in this important market across international we re accelerating omni channel capabilities with the farthest along in china due to the partnership with jd com our relationship with tencent and the investments we ve made in last mile delivery we re also accelerating omni growth in canada mexico chile and japan through partnerships and acquisitions international team has the talent and scale to deliver sustainable growth for the company and to make a difference in communities across the globe in closing let me say how pleased i am about all that we ve accomplished over the last year and how excited i m about what s still to come we see the future as a frictionless experience across stores and ecommerce but we have more work to do as customers raise their expectations competition persist and the omni retail story continues to evolve we fully expect the pace of change to accelerate in the next five years versus the last five years with emerging technologies come together to transform retail even further and we re adapting but we once could only imagine a decade ago will increasingly become reality we will embrace new technologies to solve problems for customers in a seamless way and equip associates with tools to make them more productive within our ecosystem we will pursue to grow adjacent businesses to increase customer engagement and will leverage core capabilities to deliver services to other that can generate new revenue streams our commitment to the customers is clear we ll be there when where and how they want to shop our distinctive set of assets financial strength and innovative culture are delivering the customers new experiences that are uniquely walmart brett you want to pick it up there brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer you bet thanks doug good morning everybody i m excited to talk about our results this morning walmart had a really good year and we re pleased with the fourth quarter results as well we have momentum as we entered the new fiscal year and will continue to execute against our strategic plan which we believe is the winning formula long term i ll start this morning by highlighting some key accomplishments for the full year total revenue and constant currency was just over 515 billion and increased 14 8 billion or 3 walmart u s comp sales grew 3 6 the highest annual growth rate in 10 years walmart u s e commerce sales grew 40 nearly doubling the sales of that business over the past two years we made a number of strategic choices to position walmart international for success including the acquisition of a majority stake in flipkart and the sale of the majority of our business in brazil we made progress on expenses and are particularly proud of the leverage in walmart u s stores excluding discrete items from last year we leverage total company expenses slightly as we expected coming into the year adjusted eps increased 11 to 4 91 operating cash flow was strong at 27 8 billion and the company returned 13 5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases we re pleased with what we ve accomplished but not satisfied this year and quarter are further proofs that our financial strength gives us the ability to deliver near term results while positioning the business for the longer term we re leveraging our scale unique assets and financial strength in ways others can t now let s move on to the fourth quarter we delivered strong fourth quarter topline growth the total constant currency revenue grew 3 1 to 140 5 billion with currency having a negative effect of approximately 1 7 billion walmart u s comp sales growth of 4 2 was a bit better than expected as strong holiday results and early release of government assistance benefited sales international grew net sales 2 7 in constant currency led by strength at walmex and sam s club had solid comp sales growth of 5 3 excluding fuel and tobacco consolidated gross margins gross profit margin declined 21 basis points due primarily to the mix effect from e commerce growth in india and the u s and price investments in certain markets we had some benefit in the quarter from lapping last year s discrete items sg a leverage and operating income benefited from lapping last year s discrete items but was partially offset by dilution from flipkart excluding these items we would have leveraged expenses in the quarter and operating income would have increased slightly on a constant currency basis the adjusted tax rate was within our expectations for the year at 24 6 as a reminder the adjusted tax rate excludes the effect of the value change in our investment in jd com adjustments related to the tax reform and the change for the divestiture of a majority stake in walmart brazil for the fourth quarter the adjusted tax rate was 22 8 and benefited eps by about 0 04 per share primarily due to the effect of the numerous federal tax regulations issued late in q4 adjusted eps increased 6 to 1 41 and gaap eps was 1 27 now let s discuss the quarterly results for each operating segment walmart u s continued to have greater sales momentum comp sales excluding fuel grew 4 2 in the quarter and 6 8 on two year stack basis the best result in nine years we started the quarter with strong thanksgiving and holiday shopping and finished the quarter with strong winter seasonal sales although bases sales were strong we did experience a benefit to comp sales of about 40 basis points from early snap funding clearly we re operating in a healthy consumer environment but our integrated omni offering provided the convenience customers were looking for during the holiday season we had solid traffic and ticket up 0 9 and 3 3 respectively while ecommerce sales grew 43 and contributed approximately 180 basis points of segment comp we re encouraged by the market share gains we saw in key categories according to nielsen and the npd group our strong mid single digit comp growth in grocery led to the best tier stack in nine years health and wellness delivered a low single digit comp sales gain and general merchandise comp sales were up mid single digit percentage with a strong holiday performance in toys and seasonal categories our inventory position is good as we enter the new year in walmart u s ecommerce we ve made good progress on a number of initiatives as doug mentioned we are still working to optimize our margin mix so that we can achieve the long term profit profile we want the team is working with a great sense of urgency to increase sales in key areas like home and apparel which will help margin rate as well simultaneously investing in new innovative solutions as we outlined in october we expect our losses in ecommerce to increase this coming year reflecting investments in infrastructure people online grocery and store number 8 initiatives while we ve made good progress against our strategy in recent years we still have great opportunity in front of us we remain excited about the opportunity in grocery pickup and delivery and plan to double the current number of stores that offer same day grocery delivery in the coming year while also adding grocery pick up to another 1000 stores the boundaries between physical and online retail continue to blur and we re in a great position to capitalize on that walmart u s gross margin rate declined 27 basis points due primarily to the increasing mix of ecommerce growth pricing strategy and higher transportation expenses expense leverage was strong reflecting strong sales increased productivity and overlap from last year s discrete items the walmart u s stores team has leveraged expenses for an impressive eight consecutive quarters even after raising the starting wage rate earlier this year operating income increased by more than 7 during the quarter overall we re really pleased with the momentum we have in the walmart u s business moving to international net sales in constant currency increased 2 7 but declined 2 3 on a reported basis due to the negative currency effects of approximately 1 7 billion the deconsolidation of brazil was a self head wind offset by the inclusion of flipkart sales for full quarter our major markets was saw positive comps from walmex canada and the u k results in mexico were strong again with comp sales growth of 4 6 in the quarter and we continued to grow faster than the market in key traffic driving categories including food and staples according to antad in the u k asda s progress on improving the value proposition growing online grocery share and expanding private label penetration contributed to its seventh consecutive quarter of positive comps in china we saw slightly negative comp in the quarter as the calendar shift to the mid autumn festival and a slower economic environment effected sales growth without the calendar shift comp sales would have been positive as expected international operating income declined 2 8 in constant currency and 9 9 on reported basis factors affecting our fourth quarter comparison include the dilution from flipkart partially offset by the positive effect from lapping last year s discrete charges flipkart s results were in line with our expectations overall very pleased with the progress being made in walmart international sam s club delivered solid comp sales growth of 3 3 excluding fuel and 5 3 when excluding fuel and tobacco the transfer of sales from closed clubs to existing clubs contributed approximately half of the comp growth and ecommerce sales grew 21 we re seeing improved membership sign ups and nps scores and in fact despite closing 10 of our clubs at the end of last year overall membership counts are about flat year over year sam s operating income increased primarily due to lapping last year s discrete charges for club closures excluding these items operating income would have been flat excluding fuel and up about 9 with fuel i ll close today with guidance for fiscal year 2020 as always we have several assumptions in our guidance including the economic conditions currency rates and the tax and regulatory landscape in our largest and most important markets remain generally consistent as always we have not included any potential change in the value of our investment in jd com we re also continuing to monitor the ongoing tariff discussions as we mentioned in october we will actively manage pricing and margins as warranted with our customers and shareholders in mind regarding flipkart with any change like this there can be some disruption to the business but we feel good about our ability to transition with minimal interruption there ll be some additional costs to comply with the new regulations but we don t currently believe they will be significant enough to impact total company guidance for the year you ll recall we issued fiscal year 2020 guidance last october while there s been some growing uncertainty in the overall macro economic and political environment we re confident in our ability to operate our business and serve customers effectively in most any economic climate we finished the year with good momentum so today we re reiterating the previous guidance provided in october which speaks to the consistency of our business i ll highlight a few of the key guidance metrics and you can find a complete listing in this morning s press release i ll start with sales guidance we expect to deliver total net sales growth of at least 3 on a constant currency basis in fy 2020 with the back half of the year a little stronger than the first half due to some timing and comparison including the deconsolidation of brazil and the addition of flipkart keep in mind on a reported basis we ve seen increased pressure from currency as noted in our fourth quarter results if the current spot rates were to continue into next year there will be currency headwind to reported sales of around 3 billion with most of that impact in the first half of the year for walmart u s we still expect comp store growth of 2 5 to 3 despite the more difficult comparisons we expect the quarterly cadence of comp store growth to be fairly consistent throughout the year ranging from approximately 2 5 to 3 5 in any given quarter walmart u s ecommerce is expected to grow sales around 35 in fy 2020 and we expect the quarterly growth to range from around 30 to below 40 range we still expect the leverage expenses by approximately 20 basis points in fy 2020 we ll continue to make progress on being more efficient at lowering cost especially in walmart u s stores where we expect leverage to be even higher than the 20 basis points due to continuing strong sales and improved productivity on a consolidated basis we expect to slightly lever in q1 with leverage improving each quarter during the year timing of expenses can impact leverage quarter to quarter versus our expectations turning to profitability we continue to expect consolidated operating income dollars to decline by low single digit percentage primarily due to flipkart being included for the full year versus the partial year in fiscal 2019 we would expect operating income to increase excluding the flipkart effects we expect eps to decline by low single digit percentage which assumes an effective tax rate of approximately 26 5 to 27 5 keep in mind that increase in the rate relative to fy 2019 adjusted tax rate relates to the flipkart losses having very little tax benefit in the near term which we ve mentioned previously excluding the full year eps dilution expected from flipkart we would expect eps to grow by a low to mid single digit percentage as you would expect the quarterly year over year change in operating income and eps will be quite varied during the year due primarily to the impact of flipkart only being in our results in part q3 and all of q4 last year we currently expect operating income and eps to decrease by around 10 in q1 decrease by a low to mid single digit percentage in q2 and q3 and increase in q4 to achieve our full year guidance as always the growth quarter to quarter can change due to timing and other factors our priorities for capital allocation remains unchanged we ll focus first on investing in our business and growth initiatives we also remain committed to our dividend as evidenced by the increase we announced today and we continue with our current share repurchase program before i close i want to share a change in the communication cadence with the analysts and investors similar to the past we will host the question and answer session in northwest arkansas in june in conjunction with our annual shareholders meeting however instead of hosting an investment community meeting in october as we typically have we plan to have an event in february 2020 in new york in conjunction with our q4 earnings release this meeting will be similar to the format we typically had where you ll hear updates on our performance guidance and strategy and interact with key leaders but a location that s closer to many of you as always we ll continue to assess the optimal approach to communicating with our investors and analysts let me close by saying thank you for your support of our company i m as optimistic as i have ever been about what walmart can become it s a great company with a long history of transformation and we expect to win and with that i d be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now be conducting the question and answer session operator instructions thank you and our first question is coming from the line of simeon gutman with morgan stanley simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst hey good morning guys my first question is on expense leverage you mentioned the 20 basis points and i think you just clarified in your comments brett it s total company so can we dig a little bit more into what s driving it and if we back into gross margin then within the context of your overall guidance that implies gross margins will be down and so my question is if gross margin pressure is lets say more acute than you expect how much flexibility do you have on the expense line over the course of the year brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah thanks simeon we talked a lot over the last few months about last few quarters about expense leverage it comes from a number of different places we ve seen great expense leverage in the u s certainly good comp sales helps a lot with that but as the technology and the training that we ve done over the past technology put in place and the training we ve done in the past several years is really paying dividends in the stores with our associates and how we serve our customers so as you saw even in october some of the technology that s coming something s we keep doing with our stores we expect the productivity in the u s stores will continue to be a big part of what we do when you look at a really around the world we re seeing good results and leverage around the world in different pockets as you know with leverage it could be a lot of small things that add up but we re doing some bigger things as well i talked recently about the work we re doing in shared services that we re reviewing that as more of a real strength of the company this past year we hired a chief procurement officer for the first time for goods not for resale and so we re putting more effort toward using our scale to benefit our leverage so i feel good about the numbers we ve put out and i think there s going to be room for us the timing of that is always challenging to figure out you re correct on gross margin and that s the implication that we have we re going to continue to invest in price for the customer which we ve done the mix of the business will continue to change which changes about the nature of our company and we ve always said a couple of things one is getting our expenses right allows us to do what we need to do from a gross margin perspective to remain competitive and be there for our customers and so that s the main think we want to do with expenses and we have a lot of leverage to pull as a company then we can make changes throughout the year hope i answered your question simeon simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst yes yes so my follow up with regards to ecommerce and online and i think doug made a comment around profitability and maybe repeat customer purchases and i think you did as well brett so look it s taking longer than it sounds like it s taking longer than you think to get to profitability i think we know that already but can you talk about what s been the biggest surprise is it you re making less on the consumables mix than you thought you re just not seeing enough long tail yet i think doug insinuated we should make progress on the repeat rate i assume that means it s not as strong as you think is it costing you more to run these mega dcs any more clarity on what line of progress we need to see most on to get to that profitability doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer yeah simeon this is doug i think the headline answer is mix and that mix has got to generate a customer experience that drives repeat business so if you break it down into pieces we got this advantage of having the stores and fresh and perishables in the assortment of supercenters close to customers we re trying to drive that advantage and i believe we ve got good traction there in parallel we re trying to build an ecommerce business in apparel general merchandise you saw recently a new home launch from us with the brand modern for example trying to build an apparel home hard lines business that brings customers back and generates a positive contribution margin for the basket and there are different components of that basket there s the pick cost the shipping cost and then just the gross margin on the products and the thing that s taking longer than what i would have guessed is to build that merchandise assortment including the brands that we re trying to add to a place where we got a repeatable healthy mix of business online so we re pedaling fast trying to make that happen and disappointed it s taken us long as it has simeon gutman morgan stanley analyst thank you operator the next question is from the line of bob drbul with guggenheim securities proceed with your question bob drbul guggenheim securities analyst hey good morning guys doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer hi bob bob drbul guggenheim securities analyst i guess the first question is on the ecommerce side can you talk a little but about the success the quarterly success and your confidence in 35 and how much of the toy category helped both in the fourth quarter when you think about the next year guidance on ecommerce doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer bob this is doug we re confident in that 35 number for ecommerce and we ll drive that as i just mentioned earlier with the food and perishables business coming out of the supercenters and we ll also drive it with the fulfillment center assortment that we re working on toys was a help in the fourth quarter there was an opportunity there and the team did a good job of seizing it in total across stores and online bob drbul guggenheim securities analyst okay and then can you spend a little bit of time you ve given us a lot on the flipkart performance but i guess can you talk about the topline of the flipkart since the regulatory changes and sort of how you re thinking about the business in terms of the trends you said you re in line with the plan in the fourth quarter but when you think about where we are today heading into 2019 doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer i can t comment on the future the guidance for flipkart in the first quarter i ll just say that the things that have happened have been disappointed in some way but they haven t shaken our confidence and excitement about what this is going to mean to the company long term and this isn t a story about one quarter or even one year we hope to have an effective productive dialogue as it relates to future changes that happen but in terms of how the business has behaved it s in line with what we thought it would be operator thank you the next question is coming from the line of peter benedict with baird please proceed with your question peter benedict baird analyst hey guys good morning first doug at that tail end of your comments on your prepared remarks you mentioned new revenue streams as part of the longer term opportunity for walmart so can you expand on that thought a little bit and perhaps speak to how you envision these potentially playing in the longer term roi equation for the company that s my first question doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer sure in fact i will take you back to the october analyst meeting peter we put up a chart that we referred to as an ecosystem chart and our thought process is that we ve got this core merchandising capability that we can continue to strengthen and we can transform in some ways in terms of how we work differently how we use technology and build on that with data and other components of our business to grow health and wellness where we ve got an opportunity to be more important in that space and financial service is another area where we ve historically done some things but there appeared to be more opportunities there for us and there are some others that were represented on that chart that we re currently working on in a global fashion to create a business model by market that not only resonates with customers but also delivers return for shareholders peter benedict baird analyst okay thanks for that and then brett i just the u s average ticket up 3 3 another great number there can you maybe unpack that a little bit inflation mix and is there any tariff pass through that we ve seen or that we re going to see as we look out to 2019 thank you brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer hey you bet thanks peter yes in traffic and ticket you probably heard me say this every quarter traffic and ticket quarter to quarter can go back and forth and certainly we re focused on both and we re focused on the total happy with both if you look at traffic it s a two and a half year stack so we re continuing to see good traffic coming at our stores this is going to be influenced some by the continuing shift of our business with online grocery with e commerce you get a little different mix of basket in there and category by category peter you re seeing some categories that are deflating we always have some of that electronics will be one of those and we ve had some tariffs and there are places in which that does gets passed along and that does impact ticket we re not seeing a great deal of inflation i would call it fairly modest at this point when you look at what we re doing from a price perspective i think our customers really aren t seeing much inflation because of what we re doing operator thank you the next question comes from kelly bania with bmo capital markets please proceed with your question kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst hi thanks for taking the questions just going back to the operating expense leverage you talked about some of the training and technology impact on that but can you give us more color in terms of the rollout and some of the technologies that you highlighted at the analyst day what we should expect this year and over the next couple of years doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer this is doug kelly i think it s going to take us some time to sort that out and communicate specifically with some of the pieces of equipment that you saw but it will happen and we re just going to take our time roll it from store group to store group i m really pleased and excited with how our managers are responding to all these new tools they re now out in the stores there is a tremendous amount of enthusiasm for it so that is a key part of our plan and we ll update you as things go on but it will take us some time to put all of the pieces together that we shared with you and some others that we ve got coming brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer and kelly this is brett we do as we said in october we do feel like that as we see technologies developed and the processes we re coming up with we do see opportunities to leverage over the next period of time as well kelly bania bmo capital markets analyst great and just a follow up on the last comment about your customers not maybe seeing that much inflation just curious if that s really specific to grocery and what you re seeing from your vendors there in terms of price increases it sounds like your customers are not really seeing that but maybe can you just elaborate on what you re seeing and what categories you are seeing inflation or deflation doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer i don t think we should get too specific by category i think i would just say that the combination of cost pressures that we re feeling with the price reductions that we re making has worked out in a way that the customers are not feeling very much impacted brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer and our merchants it changes every year but our merchants are always working through something that s inflating something that s deflating they re really good at managing mix in various different situations operator thank you the next question is from the line of karen short with barclays please proceed with your question karen short barclays analyst hi thanks just looking at u s in the fourth quarter obviously i mean it was a very impressive leverage number and i guess what i m asking is when i look through 2020 i guess i don t really see anything that changes the cadence on the gross margin decline if any thing maybe it gets a little bit easier because you lap transport and then it seems like you kind of hit your stride on the expense leverage so is 4q kind of something we should expect in terms of the composition going forward because of those numbers are finally getting you to that tipping point where you can see past the flipkart dilution i guess brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll speak first specifically to the u s because i think that was the main question we re really seeing the productivity loop back in action in walmart u s where you get the sales and it allows you to do what we want to do in prices allows you to lower expenses the productivity loop is alive and well in the u s the mix of our business continues to change as you look at ecommerce growing in the u s the acquisition of flipkart and so that does change when you look at the total company but as for leverage i mentioned from a total company perspective we expect to slightly lever in q1 and that just to get progressively better as we get through those through the year and we certainly couldn t do that or couldn t make that statement if we didn t feel pretty comfortable with what we re seeing in the u s again we ve assumed this kind of sales growth to get that leverage sales growth has helped a lot in getting that leverage but that s how we see the year playing out karen short barclays analyst okay that s helpful and my second question is just on ecommerce i guess i was wondering if there was anything about the fourth quarter i guess that surprised you on ecommerce in terms of either losses well specifically losses but i also was just wondering if you could give us an update on a number of skus total number of skus both 1p and then 3p and then maybe just little a update on the mirroring of skus that your fcs because it seems to me that that s also one of the things that will help from the losses that is going a little slower than expected doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer karen this is doug i think that s right we re making good progress on mirroring and our total count is in the 75 million range now there wasn t anything that i can think of that really surprised us in the fourth quarter as it relates to e commerce i would mention that you may remember a year ago we had some fulfillment center challenges and the team did a great job of preparing for peak and executing it this year and the customer experience was a lot better so i was really pleased to see that operator thank you our next question comes from the line of robbie ohmes with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question robbie ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst thanks just another follow up on e commerce so you guys called out doubling delivery again this year can you maybe doug remind us how you guys are executing that who the key partners are and maybe how the math is working on that how do you make that leverageable is there any scale opportunity there doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer sure hi robbie we re using a combination of last mile solutions we re using crowd source companies and we have our own platform that s called spark that we re experimenting with and we re still playing around with some associate deliveries in a small way trying to figure that out but it s the crowd source delivery platforms they re really helping us achieve scale generally speaking the delivery cost cover the cost and we right now are operating with something like breakeven mentalities it relates to delivery cost so customers are bearing that but they really do like the convenience and i m excited about figuring all this out and the combination of great stores that can increasingly function as productive fulfillment centers which by the way is helping keep pressure on in stocks which is what we saw from the u k years ago really like that healthy pressure together with pickup which continues to have a high nps score and people love it now with delivery and future enhancements in the future as it relates to the service end of that caused me to be really excited it looks to me like there s a long runway here where our supercenters can double as fulfillment centers and stores and also generate a great store experience so it looks promising robbie ohmes bank of america merrill lynch analyst that sounds great and just a follow up question for you i think in the presentation on china you called that intensifying competition and i think also just mentioned slower growth overall in china can you just maybe fill us in on what you guys are seeing in china with the consumer overall over there doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer if you just read the headlines you might imagine things are pretty tough but that s not really what we re seeing and if you look at our comp performance brett talked about a calendar change but that aside things have held up pretty well and the sam s clubs continue to be a really strong i m excited about the fact we ve got more of those in the pipeline and the comp performance in sam s is great the supercenters have been performing better and they look better i think operationally we ve improved and then we ve been playing around with some supermarkets and may find an opportunity there which can play a key role in last mile delivery this relationship that we mentioned on last mile they are resulting in incredible customer experiences in terms of both the value for delivery which is still think around of 1 and the speed with which it can get delivered given the density of the market is incredible so that feels ok and i think if you look at the overall relationship considering all the things are happening in china we re in pretty good shape so i m still i m optimistic and recognize the tremendous opportunity that market has and we re constantly trying to think through our position in that market and how we might improve it operator thank you the next question comes from the line of seth sigman with credit suisse please proceed with your question seth sigman credit suisse analyst thanks very much good morning guys i want to follow up on the online grocery conversation so i think you said that you re going to add another 1 000 stores this year i m curious more about how the ramp curve in the new stores maybe changing as you see growth in consumer interest and awareness of the offering and then the second piece of the question on the topic of mix i think when you purchase something through the online grocery app you can actually add things outside of just grocery i m just curious are you seeing any major change in mix there in the context of maybe improving profitability over time thanks doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer i think two dimensions there one is the customer enthusiasm for those kinds of offers and it s a loud and clear to us that customers no surprise are really busy and that if we can find a way to make things more convenient for them with pick up and delivery they re all over it so i think the ramp there in terms of how our comp stores will behave in addition to the roll out that we re doing for additional stores is going to continue to be strong we have been adding assortment over time some of the happiest customers that i have come across are customers that can place their back to school order and a grocery order together and go through pickup and knockout that list of things that you need for your kids as they go back to school so that includes a lot of items that are not food items and then over time we just keep adding as the stores learn how to pick categories that are different in nature than food it s a different situation to go and pick light bulbs our go to pick some of these categories that may not have as much shelf capacity as we have in food so we have to learn how to adjust our modulars so that you can expand the categories and the items and i do think that will help mix over time and we may have seen that already i haven t been tracking that part of it that closely but it makes sense that that basket would change shape and the profitability would look better seth sigman credit suisse analyst okay thanks for that and then just one follow up question on the inventory growth up 0 8 on a comp basis in the u s i think the first time in the recent memory strength of sales obviously very clear but anything else to highlight there that maybe driving that doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer at first i would say the job that greg and the team have done on the inventory over last few years has been phenomenal i mean being a merchant for so much of my career i have so much respect for the way that they have driven in stock levels reduced inventory reduce deletive inventory for quarter after quarter now what happened in this case is that we saw the snap shift into the end of january we build food inventories at the end of the quarter to make sure that we were maximizing that opportunity and there s a little bit of pull forward of inventory in anticipation of what tariffs could mean in a worse case scenario but we certainly hope and expect that that won t happen so i m not worried about inventory level it s high quality and there s a bit of timing difference there and overall that picture still looks really good operator the next question is coming from the line of michael lasser with ubs please proceed with your question michael lasser ubs analyst good morning thanks a lot for taking my question so if we look at the midpoint of your u s comp guidance it s 2 5 to 3 for 2020 it s about 100 basis points below what you achieved in 2019 should we take that to mean that s what you think the healthy spending environment driven in part by all the tax reform contributed to your sales in the year ago period at about 100 basis points doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer i think that s exactly right i think we re just recognizing that this last year had some tailwinds and that this year we won t have brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah obviously there is some more challenging comparisons because of what we did this year but i think what doug s saying on healthy economic environment you put a number of things together i think this is the range that we feel good about going into the year but still obviously a very very healthy growth michael lasser ubs analyst my follow up question is on flipkart how much is the regulatory environment going to influence your investment posture in that market so if we see no change and the competition eases up are you going to look to maybe moderate your investments in the end market over time brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think we ll see how the year goes and respond appropriately but i would remind everybody that flipkart is already an ecosystem there s the phonepe a payment platform there s a last mile delivery there s a myntra and jabong businesses in apparel so it s not just one thing and it s just not an ecommerce business in the traditional sense there s a lot of dimension to it so there just like here we ve got a lot of different variables we can play what demands the total and i think we ve forecasted it appropriately and we ll respond as the year goes on doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer michael when you look at i mean all the reasons we cited for going into india acquiring flipkart when you look at the continued ecommerce growth in india the size of the market the growing middle class all those things are still as true today as they were six months ago so the reasons we re excited about the market are still there michael lasser ubs analyst thank you operator the next question comes from the line of oliver chen with cowen company please proceed with your question oliver chen cowen company analyst hi thank you good morning a lot of our data is showing really great adoption of curbside grocery pickup as well as satisfaction here as well what are your thoughts on how incrementality is unfolding also as this continues to be a very popular and widespread service what s the future in terms of packing and taking in labor as you balance just making sure your in store experience is very good for those who aren t using curbside and also leveraging what you can with automation and robotics to optimize the total experience doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer good questions oliver i think the mix of new customers in online grocery is positive and encouraging to us it s not just existing customer using the service so that s an exciting development and as it relates to productivity we re continuing to learn how to pick more efficiently using the apps and the tools that you ve seen in the stores plus we ve got a few experiments going on with more automation to try and solve for future higher volumes you can get to a point and we do cap in some store locations a place where we have too many pickers in the store and it gets they get in the way of our customer shopping and site counter so we got to manage that effectively and we had a salem a project alert i forgot what we call it alphabot maybe the announcement that we made last year that s one to keep an eye on but we re actively sorting out how to increase our in stocks increase productivity and how the customer experience continue to improve from an nps point of view that will be an ongoing stream of work brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer and we re learning from the stores that were early in the process as they get larger and larger we re able to take those learnings from those stores that have been in the system a little longer to stores that are just coming online oliver chen cowen company analyst well brett on the topic of curbside how are you thinking about roic and payback and as you make judgments you re rapidly rolling this out and people like it but i m curious about your thoughts on the multi year and the investment versus the long term share gains as well as customer reception brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer i do think about roi a lot you re correct i when we re together as a team i am talking about doug s team we spend as you can imagine most of our time thinking through the prioritization of the various things that are going on inside the company and as we go through those discussions we always have the p l and the balance sheet and roi in front of us as part of those discussions and it s our job as the management team to make these things work together over time the customer acceptance we re seeing with online grocery in particular is a one where you look at it and say we are going to lean into this and there maybe things along the line and we delay this or can we stop something else but we re going to lean into things like this and see when we see them working for the customer and as a team we will ensure that it works out for our shareholders over the mid to long term oliver chen cowen company analyst thank you operator the next question comes from the line of scott mushkin with wolfe research please proceed with your questions scott mushkin wolfe research analyst hey guys thanks for taking my questions so i have one kind of just shop keeping item with the discrete items in the fourth quarter i m trying to understand comparability i think it s 47 point leverage we had in the u s business is that including or excluding the discrete items and if it s inclusive what how many basis points were the discrete items doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer yeah scott we had mentioned and that we ve of course you ve just heard it for the first time we mentioned in the script that we that leverage is higher than it would normally be because of those discrete items last year if you back those out we still levered slightly in the quarter and for the year but clearly fourth quarter was higher than you would normally expect because of those discrete items scott mushkin wolfe research analyst so there was just slight and would u s ebit have grown without the discrete items brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer i am sorry what did you say scott i missed the question scott mushkin wolfe research analyst would u s ebit have grown without the discrete items brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer it would have been roughly flat scott mushkin wolfe research analyst roughly flat okay great then my second question is regarding just kind of the strategy in the u s i mean it seems like if i back away a little bit you guys talked about omni channel pressuring probably little bit more seems like the international business is pressuring a little bit more if i kind of add those things up it doesn t seem like there s a lot of wiggle room to invest a lot in price in the u s am i missing that or is that how you would frame it as well brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer scott i think we ve got enough room as you know we ve been on a multi year plan to reduce pricing in the u s and we re just continuing that there are some price investments in sam s and in some international markets but i m comfortable when you look at our forecast that we ve got an appropriately aggressive price investment remaining as we finish off what we started years ago scott mushkin wolfe research analyst thank you operator the next question is from the line of paul trussell with deutsche bank please proceed with your question paul trussell deutsche bank analyst good morning and good quarter just wanted to maybe touch on guidance certainly you are reiterating fiscal 2020 just given the moving parts in the business but maybe just a little more detail around the cadence of the guide specifically i think in 1q you mentioned operating income to be down 10 just to what extent is that flipkart versus currency or how should we think about the top line headwinds from snap or tax refunds just one going kind of cadence and improvement you expect to see over the balance of the year what does that come from brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer yes paul this is brett so if you look at the cadence primarily what you are seeing in q1 is going to be related to flipkart if you look at the guidance we ve given last year and just look at how that would play out over the quarter you can get pretty quickly to that number there s always going to the timing of other parts of the business they go from one quarter to another based on how expenses are flowing but that s the biggest part of q1 and q2 as well because it did not come in our results until partway through q3 there s always we can have things move around between quarters 50 million here 60 million there and it can make a difference in how that number looks from a profitability standpoint but flipkart is the biggest part of that next year paul trussell deutsche bank analyst got it and then just on as we look toward fiscal 2020 just your outlook on transportation expenses and the headwind there and what you re seeing also on the wage front doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer on the wage side paul we ve just been moving up market by market our average now is about 17 50 for an hourly associate in the u s and i m comfortable that we ve got appropriate wage investments to get the talent we need baked into the plan transportation costs i m not really close to what s happening right now i would expect based on what s happening with the drivers if we re going to be better shape from a transportation point of view as we go through the year and it is helpful that gas prices are in the range that they are in and hope that continues to be the case i think that s one of the things that benefited this last year so glad to see them where they are operator thank you your next question is from the line of edward kelly with wells fargo please proceed with your question edward kelly wells fargo analyst yes hi good morning i just wanted to ask a follow up question actually on price investments so there has been some early signs i guess that food inflation beginning to couple a bit and i m just as curious as to what your thoughts are on allowing inflation to flow through if they were to continue to strengthen i guess as you think about that right holding the line would require a potential i guess incremental investment above what s planned is that something you d be willing to do just help us understand how you think about the dynamic of food price inflation versus universe s price investment and what s budgeted for the year doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer before i mention i just want to clarify what i mentioned earlier 17 50 is actually 17 55 is the average hourly associate number with wages and benefits as it relates to pricing i think as i mentioned earlier we got an appropriately aggressive plan baked in and it would depend on what happened with competition and the severity of the price increases i think we would manage margins as we bring all these variables together and don t anticipate having a lot more inflation on the food side and on the non food side we re continuing to experience deflation in that part of the basket kind of works out edward kelly wells fargo analyst okay and then just one follow up going on online grocery pickup and delivery how are you thinking about the end goal here is it one to two hour delivery for our customers how do you think about the cost to get where you want to go and how it impacts the timeframe around eventually improving e commerce losses doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer i think we ll end up in a position where the customer can pick depending on the occasion how they want to shop there will be families that come into stores once a week or twice a month or whatever and they ll also use pickup they ll also use delivery and we ll have the ability to serve them in all those ways there s an interesting opportunity if you could get to a point where customers pick their delivery window in the home or to the door unattended you can decouple speed of delivery in a way that helps us manage costs so as the volume goes up and density improves we ll try to figure out how to drive a basket business it looks more like dense route than a one hour or a 30 minute race to deliver to somebody s house that maybe different for restaurant delivery than it is for grocery delivery it seems like those use cases are different enough so we ve got some tests going on and real time learning here to try and do it in a way that customers want it to be done and create that optionality for them and it s kind of one more mix opportunity for us we grew up managing merchandise mix and still do and now we re managing a service mix and the good news is that once customers are in your ecosystem they ll use you in some way as i mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks you get the opportunity to expand on that relationship and that s what we re trying to do brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer scott i want to this is brett i want to come back and clear myself i said that u s income u s operating income ex one items was flat i misspoken that it was up a little bit in the fourth quarter operator thank you your next question is from the line of edward yruma with keybanc please proceed with your question edward yruma keybanc analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my question i guess two quick ones first on macro obviously less tailwinds this year but are you starting to see any changes in consumer behavior that would indicate that we re starting to level off or seeing some deterioration and i guess as a follow up you re running a dual time strategy with the jet i guess how would you score your kind of jet business and serving those urban millennials thank you brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer edward this is brett i ll start off in the consumer i think it feels pretty good to us you see all the numbers that we see wages are still pretty good unemployment rate s low gas prices are down year on year so there s a number of things i think are still working in favor of the consumer like you mentioned we re watching it as we always do we re monitoring it and making sure that we re in the right place with the customer i think no matter of the environment we tend to do pretty well and are able to react and be there for those customers but we re monitoring it as we always do doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer the first quarter is always a challenge because you got an easter change there s weather that s a little more impactful than it s volatility we got the snap moving into the first quarter the tax rebates i mean different windows of times sometimes they are concentrated in a few days sometimes they are spread out over a week so it makes it exciting to manage q1 but underneath all that i ll agree with what brett said they re in pretty good shape on jet i m really pleased with the role that it s playing attracting new brands and our focus as we mentioned before is on urban markets so it s an opportunity to learn and to try new items and different items in some cases that we have at wallmart com so that s the role it s playing operator thank you the next question is from the line of charles grom with gordon haskett please proceed with your question charles grom gordon haskett analyst hey thanks good morning and great quarter here just one near term question brett do you guys expect that 40 basis points snap benefit to reverse in the first quarter and then long term question just with regard to digital when you think about 2019 losses being greater than 2018 would you expect the 2019 losses to be the peak based on what you know now and then as a follow up to that when you think about mix being issue when you think about correcting that you guys were pretty active a couple of years ago acquiring more of the digitally native brands do you feel like you need to do more of that to sort of fix that issue brett biggs executive vice president and chief financial officer chuck there s a lot in that question i ll take the first two and then i ll hand off to doug on the snap benefits i mean we are clear you know that we believe that it did pull forward some into the fourth quarter again with all the things that happened in the first quarter i think we did pull that forward but there s other things that can potentially make up for that but that s why we ve given the quarterly guidance any quarter it can be kind of 2 5 and 3 2 5 3 5 for the year on the ecommerce loss guidance where we ve said that we expect losses to be a little more in this next year we re not going to give guidance past that which i think probably won t surprise you doug you want to talk about the doug mcmillon president and chief executive officer yes preserving flexibility there i think it s important we have never let a digital transformation at this scale before so we re figuring this out as we go but if there s an opportunity to be more aggressive given the total balance of the business i mean we would be thinking about that adding digital brands we re after assortment we re after a repetitive customer relationship and we re looking constantly at various acquisitions and i think what you ve seen from us in the past will continue to some extent it s impossible to predict the pace of it or the number so we ll just have to see at the end of the year how it will work out dan binder investor relations okay that will conclude our q a session and our call today we thank you for your time and interest in walmart doug mcmillon

sen bernie sanders i vt center joined from left by rep peter welch d vt rep elijah cummings d md and sen cory booker d n j speaks to reporters as he prepares to introduce new legislation that aims to reduce what americans pay for prescription drugs especially brand name drugs deemed excessively priced during a news conference on capitol hill in washington thursday jan 10 2019 ap photo j scott applewhite washington sen bernie sanders i vt will run for president proposing to enact a medicare for all health care system stave off catastrophic climate change through a green new deal and other climate measures and implement a 15 an hour minimum wage for all american workers according to aides to the senator sanders will also tout proposals to mandate breaking up the biggest wall street banks free tuition at public colleges lower drug prices with aggressive government intervention new labor law to encourage union formation curbed corporate spending on elections paid family and medical leave gender pay equity and expanded social security benefits for the elderly and disabled aides said sanders criminal justice platform will include legalizing marijuana ending cash bail throughout the u s and abolishing private prisons while he will also run on the standard democratic policy goals of protecting young immigrants brought to the u s as children and limiting the sale and distribution of guns sanders policies would require trillions of dollars in additional government spending the senator has previously called for dramatic cuts to u s military spending and a number of plans to ramp up taxes including through heavy taxation of wealthy estates corporations the 1 percent richest americans and off shore tax havens some of his plans like medicare for all would also require higher taxes on the middle class though supporters say they would on net help everyday americans by entirely eliminating their private health care costs these policies are unlikely to be enacted in the form proposed by sanders even if he wins the white house given opposition from centrist democrats and the difficulty of moving legislation through the senate the vermont senator who announced his bid for the democratic presidential primary in an email to supporters on tuesday lost to hillary clinton in the 2016 democratic presidential primary but is frequently ranked near the top of a wide open early primary field republicans and centrist democrats have said sanders promotes socialism sanders identifies as a democratic socialist and that his policies would bankrupt the united states at a time of already mounting fiscal deficits every 50 years there is someone who can fundamentally alter the course of american politics bernie sanders has the chance to reorient our economic policy toward workers and communities left behind instead of corporate interests said rep ro khanna d calif who has encouraged sanders to run others say a sanders nomination is more likely to get trump re elected with think tanks such as third way arguing ultra progressive candidates did less well in the 2018 midterm elections here are some of the policies sanders hopes power him to the white house medicare for all sanders plans to campaign on a promise to move america to a single payer medicare for all system in which every american would be enrolled on a government plan in fall of 2017 16 senate democrats co sponsored sanders bill which previously garnered zero senate co sponsors and was criticized by clinton s campaign in 2016 as wildly unrealistic medicare for all would give health insurance to the approximately 30 million americans who currently lack it while also eliminating all premiums co pay and deductibles u s health care spending per capita is more than two times larger than the average for developed nations despite america having below average life expectancy at birth and lagging on a number of other key health outcomes single payer advocates say one government insurer would have the bargaining power to drive down costs while giving health care for free to those who lack it critics say the plan would require prohibitive impossibly large new taxes and question the political wisdom of forcing nearly half the country to switch from the current private plan to a public insurer even democrats who have signed onto sanders bill have balked at its core feature of eliminating private insurance with sen cory booker d n j saying he does not favor doing so sanders has argued that virtually eradicating private health insurance excepting things like cosmetic surgery you want to get your nose fixed sanders has said is essential to preventing the costs of a medicare for all system from becoming prohibitive conservatives have also warned that a single payer system could also impede quality of care for those who have it pointing to long wait times in the canadian system drastic climate action including the green new deal sanders has repeatedly called climate change the single greatest threat facing our planet and in 2016 campaigned on cutting carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2013 in part through an aggressive carbon tax on pollution sanders will sometime in the next few months also introduce a proposal to fight climate change through a green new deal which will similarly aim to slash emissions with an enormous public works program that would create tens of millions of jobs the effort is moving on a parallel track to that unveiled earlier this month by rep alexandria ocasio cortez d n y and a number of 2016 presidential candidates in the senate including sanders and sens kamala harris d calif cory booker d n j and kirsten gillibrand d n y the upcoming sanders plan is expected to contain significantly more details on how a green new deal would move america s economy to one that zeroes out carbon emissions according to aides to the senator while the ocasio cortez resolution supported by the other 2020 candidates mostly laid out ambitious targets for carbon reduction the white house said in a recent statement that the green new deal would be a central planning disaster and a roadmap to destroy the american economy with president trump calling it a a high school term paper that got a low mark the trump administration has not unveiled a plan to address climate change and trump has repeatedly dismissed the scientific consensus behind it but the plan has also faced some criticism from proponents of action to address global warming including some who ve called for a greater focus on exporting renewable energy technology to developing countries and others who ve argued the problem can be addressed more cost effectively through market based mechanisms in the fall the top scientific body studying climate change found that the world had to take unprecedented steps to reduce carbon levels with the globe on pace to warm by 1 5 degrees celsius 2 7 degrees fahrenheit over preindustrial levels scientists called the report a deafening piercing smoke alarm going off in the kitchen 15 an hour minimum wage as he did in 2016 sanders will also campaign on a national 15 an hour minimum wage for all u s workers america s existing 7 25 an hour minimum wage has not been raised since 2009 although a number of states have passed their own increases that includes typically conservative places like arkansas and missouri suggesting their potential popularity with parts of trump s base critics of higher minimum wages say they drive up business costs and reduce employment and can also cut hours for workers according to one study on seattle s 15 an hour minimum wage other research has contradicted those results with left leaning economists questioning results showing negative impacts from seattle s 15 an hour minimum wage in 2016 clinton pushed a 12 an hour minimum wage at the federal level the number of democrats in congress supporting sanders legislation to achieve a 15 an hour minimum wage has risen from about 60 in 2015 to more than 200 in 2018 according to sanders aides larry kudlow the president s top economic adviser has called the federal minimum wage a terrible idea tuition free colleges and universities reduce student loan debt sanders has pushed legislation to abolish tuition and fees at public four year colleges and universities and intends to run on the plan in 2020 according to aides the amount of total student debt held has ballooned from 480 billion in 2006 to 1 5 trillion in 2018 affecting home ownership rates and delaying young people from starting families a 2017 report found the price of college has increased more than 100 percent since 2001 sanders has also proposed cutting all student loan interest rates in half and allowing americans to refinance student loans at low interest rates researchers with the levy economic institute has proposed retiring the 1 5 trillion in outstanding student loan debt a measure not embraced by sanders the committee for a responsible federal budget a non partisan organization said in 2016 that sanders free college plan would cost about 800 billion over 10 years sanders has proposed paying for it with a transaction tax on large wall street firms which would raise 600 billion over a decade crfb found some more centrist democrats have stopped short of calling for that dramatic overhaul fo nation s higher education system with presidential candidate sen amy klobuchar d minn saying at a cnn town hall on monday night no i am not for free four year college for all no break up biggest wall street banks in october 2018 sanders released an update to his plan to break up the largest wall street banks barring them from holding assets worth more than 584 billion at least six different banks including jpmorgan goldman sachs and citigroup would be broken up by federal regulators under the proposal which aides say is expected to play a prominent role in sanders campaign sanders touts the plan as a way to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis of a decade ago but it has been criticized by some analysts and allies of the financial industry who pointed to dramatic improvements in the capital cushions that banks now hold to ward against collapse dodd frank obama s banking law put new capital requirements into effect for the largest financial institutions criminal justice overhaul sanders will also be pushing a slew of measures intended to overhaul america s criminal justice system including to legalize marijuana end private prisons and dramatically reduce cash bail last summer sanders introduced legislation to end bail in federal proceedings while giving grants to states in an attempt to get them to reduce the number of prisoners they hold on bail in 2016 he also called for automatic federal investigations of deaths in police custody cash bail disproportionately jails poor americans in particular black americans who cannot afford to make court ordered payments paid family leave gender pay equity right now america is alone in the developed world in not requiring businesses to give paid leave to new mothers according to the organization for economic cooperation and development while mothers are not guaranteed time off by the government families that do get time off from their employer tend to be more affluent said heather boushey executive director and chief economist at the washington center for equitable growth in 2013 sen gillibrand released a bill to create america s first universal paid family leave program it would pay workers while they take time off if they have to take care of a sick child parent or spouse give birth to a child or get sick themselves sanders is a cosponsor of the bill and talked about the need for paid family leave in his 2016 presidential campaign sanders has also cosponsored legislation titled the paycheck fairness act that would bar employers from retaliating against workers who ask about their wages as well as making employers liable to civil litigation stein is a policy reporter for the washington post before joining the post stein was a congressional reporter for vox where he wrote primarily about the democratic party and the left in 2014 he founded the local news nonprofit the ithaca voice in upstate new york

hyperpower was getting its comeuppance the fact that the city of london was imploding too added to the deliciousness of the moment it was convenient for the europeans to shift responsibility across the channel and then across the atlantic in fact it was a script prepared ahead of time economists inside and outside america critical of the bush presidency including many of the leading macroeconomists of our time had prepared a disaster script it revolved around america s twin deficits its budget deficit and its trade deficit and their implications for america s dependence on foreign borrowing the debts run up by the bush administration were the bomb that was expected to go off and the idea of 2008 as a distinctively anglo american crisis received a backhanded confirmation 18 months later when europe experienced its own crisis which appeared to follow a rather different script centred on the politics and the constitution of the eurozone thus the historical narrative seemed to neatly arrange itself with a european crisis following an american crisis each with its own distinct economic and political logic platformed this newsletter tackles hot topics with boldness

chiefly through its impact on america is to fundamentally misunderstand and underestimate its economic and historical significance ground zero was america s housing market for sure millions of american households were among those hit earliest and hardest but that disaster was not the crisis that had been widely anticipated before 2008 namely a crisis of the american state and its public finances instead it was a financial crisis triggered by the humdrum market for american real estate that threatened the world economy the crisis spilled far beyond america it shook the financial systems of some of the most advanced economies in the world the city of london east asia eastern europe and russia and it went on doing so contrary to the narrative popular on both sides of the atlantic the eurozone crisis is not a separate and distinct event but follows directly from the shock of 2008 the redescription of the crisis as one internal to the eurozone and centered on the politics of public debt was itself an act of politics in the years after 2010 it would become the object of something akin to a transatlantic culture war in economic policy a minefield that any history of the epoch must carefully navigate advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content photo by matt cardy getty images one might be tempted to conclude that the crisis of globalization had brought a reaffirmation of the essential role of the nation state and the emergence of a new kind of state capitalism but if we look closely not at the periphery but at the core of the 2008 crisis it is clear that this diagnosis is partial at best among the emerging markets the two that struggled most with the crisis of 2008 were russia and south korea what they had in common apart from booming exports was deep financial integration with europe and the united states that would prove to be the key what they experienced was not just a collapse in exports but a sudden stop in the funding of their banking sectors as a result countries with trade surpluses and huge currency reserves supposedly the essentials of national economic self reliance suffered acute currency crises writ spectacularly larger this was also the story in the north atlantic between europe and the united states hidden below the radar and barely discussed in public what threatened the stability of the north atlantic economy in the fall of 2008 was a huge shortfall in dollar funding for europe s oversized banks and a shortfall in their case meant not tens of billions or even hundreds of billions but trillions of dollars it was the opposite of the crisis that had been forecast not a dollar glut but an acute dollar funding shortage the dollar did not plunge it rose advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content when it comes to analyzing the onset of financial crises in an age of deep globalization the standard macroeconomic approach has its limits if we are to grasp the dynamics of this unforecasted storm we have to move beyond the familiar cognitive frame of macroeconomics that we inherited from the early twentieth century forged in the wake of the first world war and the second world war the macroeconomic perspective on international economics is organized around nation states national productive systems and the trade imbalances they generate it is a view of the economy that will forever be identified with john maynard keynes predictably the onset of the crisis in 2008 evoked memories of the 1930s and triggered calls for a return to the master and keynesian economics is indeed indispensable for grasping the dynamics of collapsing consumption and investment the surge in unemployment and the options for monetary and fiscal policy after 2009 but when it comes to analyzing the onset of financial crises in an age of deep globalization the standard macroeconomic approach has its limits in discussions of international trade it is now commonly accepted that it is no longer national economies that matter what drives global trade are not the relationships between national economies but multinational corporations coordinating far flung value chains the same is true for the global business of money to understand the tensions within the global financial system that exploded in 2008 we have to move beyond keynesian macroeconomics and its familiar apparatus of national economic statistics as hyun song shin chief economist at the bank for international settlements and one of the foremost thinkers of the new breed of macrofinance has put it we need to analyze the global economy not in terms of an island model of international economic interaction national economy to national economy but through the interlocking matrix of corporate balance sheets bank to bank as both the global financial crisis of 2007 2009 and the crisis in the eurozone after 2010 would demonstrate government deficits and current account imbalances are poor predictors of the force and speed with which modern financial crises can strike this can be grasped only if we focus on the shocking adjustments that can take place within this interlocking matrix of financial accounts for all the pressure that classic macroeconomic imbalances in budgets and trade can exert a modern global bank run moves far more money far more abruptly advertisement 6 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content photo by bryan r smith afp getty images what the europeans the americans the russians and the south koreans were experiencing in 2008 and the europeans would experience again after 2010 was an implosion in interbank credit as long as your financial sector was modestly proportioned big national currency reserves could see you through that is what saved russia but south korea struggled and in europe not only were there no reserves but the scale of the banks and their dollar denominated business made any attempt at autarkic self stabilization unthinkable none of the leading central banks had gauged the risk ahead of time they did not foresee how globalized finance might be interconnected with the american mortgage boom the fed and the treasury misjudged the scale of the fallout from the bankruptcy of lehman on september 15 never before not even in the 1930s had such a large and interconnected system come so close to total implosion but once the scale of the risk became evident the u s authorities scrambled not only did the europeans and americans bail out their ailing banks at a national level the u s federal reserve engaged in a truly spectacular innovation it established itself as liquidity provider of last resort to the global banking system it provided dollars to all comers in new york whether banks were american or not through so called liquidity swap lines the fed licensed a hand picked group of core central banks to issue dollar credits on demand in a huge burst of transatlantic activity with the european central bank ecb in the lead they pumped trillions of dollars into the european banking system advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content this response was surprising not only because of its scale but also because it contradicted the conventional narrative of economic history since the 1970s the decades prior to the crisis had been dominated by the idea of a market revolution and the rollback of state interventionism government and regulation continued of course but they were delegated to independent agencies emblematically the independent central banks whose job was to ensure discipline regularity and predictability politics and discretionary action were the enemies of good governance the balance of power was hardwired into the normality of the new regime of deflationary globalization what ben bernanke euphemistically referred to as the great moderation the question that hung over the dispensation of neo liberalism was whether the same rules applied to everyone or whether the truth was that there were rules for some and discretion for others from crashed by adam tooze published by viking an

implement a 15 an hour minimum wage for all american workers according to aides to the senator sanders will also tout proposals to mandate breaking up the biggest wall street banks free tuition at public colleges lower drug prices with aggressive government intervention new labor law to encourage union formation curbed corporate spending on elections paid family and medical leave gender pay equity and expanded social security benefits for the elderly and disabled aides said sanders criminal justice platform will include legalizing marijuana ending cash bail throughout the u s and abolishing private prisons while he will also run on the standard democratic policy goals of protecting young immigrants brought to the u s as children and limiting the sale and distribution of guns sanders policies would require trillions of dollars in additional government spending the senator has previously called for dramatic cuts to u s military spending and a number of plans to ramp up taxes including through heavy taxation of wealthy estates corporations the 1 percent richest americans and off shore tax havens some of his plans like medicare for all would also require higher taxes on the middle class though supporters say they would on net help everyday americans by entirely eliminating their private health care costs these policies are unlikely to be enacted in the form proposed by sanders even if he wins the white house given opposition from centrist democrats and the difficulty of moving legislation through the senate the vermont senator who announced his bid for the democratic presidential primary in an email to supporters on tuesday lost to hillary clinton in the 2016 democratic presidential primary but is frequently ranked near the top of a wide open early

than the average for developed nations despite america having below average life expectancy at birth and lagging on a number of other key health outcomes single payer advocates say one government insurer would have the bargaining power to drive down costs while giving health care for free to those who lack it critics say the plan would require prohibitive impossibly large new taxes and question the political wisdom of forcing nearly half the country to switch from the current private plan to a public insurer even democrats who have signed onto sanders bill have balked at its core feature of eliminating private insurance with sen cory booker d n j saying he does not favor doing so sanders has argued that virtually eradicating private health insurance excepting things like

researchers with the levy economic institute has proposed retiring the 1 5 trillion in outstanding student loan debt a measure not embraced by mr sanders the committee for a responsible federal budget a non partisan organisation said in 2016 that mr sanders free college plan would cost about 800bn 515 over 10 years mr sanders has proposed paying for it with a transaction tax on large wall street firms which would raise 600 billion over a decade crfb found some more centrist democrats have stopped short of calling for that dramatic overhaul of the nation s higher education system with presidential candidate senator amy klobuchar d minn saying at a cnn town hall on monday night no i am not for free four year college for all no break up biggest wall street banks in october 2018 mr sanders released an update to his plan to break up the largest wall street banks barring them from holding assets worth more than 584bn 450bn at least six different banks including jpmorgan goldman sachs and citigroup would be broken up by federal regulators under the proposal which aides say is expected to play a prominent role in mr sanders campaign mr sanders touts the plan as a way to

off if they have to take care of a sick child parent or spouse give birth to a child or get sick themselves mr sanders is a cosponsor of the bill and talked about the need for paid family leave in his

president and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today 2018 represents our fifth consecutive year of adjusted ebitda growth and i am confident that the operational progress that we ve made in the year has set the foundation for consistent profitable growth of jeld wen during 2018 we completed three acquisitions adding to our family of leading brands these acquisitions bring a combination of new and exciting products increased channel access and best in class manufacturing capability we also invested in new product development during the year launching a number of key new window and door products some of which will be on display this week in las vegas at the international builders show in november we announced a comprehensive facility rationalization and modernization plan and also outlined and enhanced deployment of our business operating system the jeld wen excellence model or jem together these initiatives will reduce our cost structure by 200 million increasing our ability to respond to changing market conditions and improving both the quality of our products and the safety of our manufacturing operations as you can see on page 4 we are beginning to see the signs of this transformation at jeld wen i m pleased to report that we delivered our most recent revenue and adjusted ebitda guidance i ll also highlight that we delivered core adjusted ebitda margin expansion in both north america and australasia in the fourth quarter and we have successfully implemented price increases to offset raw material cost inflation which will support accelerating core margin improvement as we progress through 2019 we recognize that 2018 also presented its fair share of challenges our core volumes were impacted by the lingering effects of prior service issues in our north america and europe segments as well as from unfavorable mix for most of the year we were playing catch up on price versus raw material and freight inflation the actions we re taking to reduce our cost structure driving productivity throughout the organization and developing a lean focused problem solving culture will allow us to better serve our customers and respond to changing market conditions these actions built on jem and on our productivity culture give me full confidence that we will achieve our 15 adjusted ebitda margin target by 2022 please turn to page 5 for a brief summary of our fourth quarter and full year financial results john will follow up with a more detailed view shortly net revenues for the quarter increased by 11 8 driven primarily by contribution from acquisitions which continue to perform in line with our expectations core revenue growth was unchanged for both the fourth quarter and full year as compared to prior year periods as positive pricing was offset by volume and mix headwinds our net income during the quarter increased by 133 4 million year over year due to the non recurrence of charges related to tax reform taken in 2017 and contributions from acquisitions made during the year adjusted ebitda during the quarter of 109 6 million was above the midpoint implied in our most recent guidance for the full year adjusted ebitda was 465 3 million net leverage at year end of approximately 2 9 times is now within the upper end of our targeted range and our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong during the fourth quarter we repurchased 2 2 million shares of our common stock for 41 4 million we will remain disciplined and balanced deploying excess cash flow in 2019 on page 6 i d like to provide you with a brief update on the steps that we took in 2018 to accelerate the deployment of our business operating system the jeld wen excellence model or jem during the year we significantly increased the cadence of jem implementation across the business by training over 2 000 of our associates on a3 problem solving and doubling the number of facilities that utilize jem tools these tools include visual management problem solving demand planning and rapid improvement events as part of our standard work as a result of these efforts we have already witnessed a significant improvement in our service levels with over 90 of all facilities exhibiting improvement in 2018 i m proud of our associates who have embraced jem and who have built a deep pipeline of cost saving projects to drive meaningful productivity gains in 2019 the jem culture and tools are critical to achieving our productivity target of 3 net reduction in cost of goods sold annually jem is the cornerstone of our business and it begins with a simple philosophy of eliminating waste in all aspects of our operations and processes on page 7 i ll provide a brief update of our facility footprint rationalization and modernization program which leverages the collective knowledge and experience of our associates from over 40 acquisitions and nearly 60 years in business to develop the best way to manufacture and distribute our products we ve recently announced the closure of two north american manufacturing facilities and a handful of smaller sites in australia and we will execute the consolidation of additional facilities later this year we currently have projects at various stages of completion within each of our three geographic segments as you can see we ve provided an outline of our existing manufacturing footprint on a square footage basis along with the expected reduction in square footage for 2019 and through the completion of our rationalization plans in 2022 savings from these efforts will begin in the second half of 2019 and yield approximately 100 million in annual run rate savings by 2022 as we execute our plans we are taking all necessary precautions to minimize any potential disruption to our associates and our customers including carrying excess inventory and retaining supplemental capacity as needed this footprint rationalization process involves far more then consolidating square footage as we are also modernizing many of our production capabilities and deploying standard work across the organization which will improve our cost flexibility quality and safety while reducing cycle time and waste leading to higher quality products and improved customer experience before turning it over to john on page 8 i want to acknowledge and celebrate jeld wen s track record over the last five years of double digit annual ebitda growth in less than one year we ve accelerated deployment of jem tools to create a lean manufacturing organization and establish a global footprint rationalization and modernization plan to reduce cost and increased throughput and our execution is improving we remain committed to our 15 adjusted ebitda margin target by 2022 and to our legacy of profitable growth with that i ll turn it over to john linker to provide a detailed review of our financial results for the quarter and full year 2018 john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks gary i ll start on slide 10 for the fourth quarter net revenues increased to 11 8 to 1 1 billion the increase was driven primarily by the contribution of our recent acquisitions partially offset by a 2 headwind from foreign currency we reported net income of 39 7 million for the fourth quarter an increase of 133 4 million the increase in net income was driven by the addition of recent acquisitions and the absence of a 98 million charge associated with tax reform that was taken in the same period last year for the quarter diluted earnings per share was 0 38 an increase of 1 27 compared to prior year and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 41 an increase of 0 15 compared to prior year adjusted ebitda increased 6 3 to 109 6 million adjusted ebitda margins declined by 60 basis points in the quarter to 10 while year over year consolidated margins declined we did see sequential improvements in many areas of our business the margin decline seen in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by lower margins in our core business where our core adjusted ebitda margin decreased approximately 60 basis points primarily due to underperformance in europe partially offset by core margin improvement in north america and australasia i will elaborate a bit more on the segment performance in the next few slides slide 11 provides detail of our revenue drivers for the fourth quarter and full year here you can see that our consolidated core revenue growth was unchanged in the fourth quarter we realized positive price of 2 that was offset by equal decline in volume and mix for the full year consolidated core revenue growth was up 1 with total full year revenue up 15 5 primarily coming from our recent acquisitions please move to slide 12 where i ll take you through the segment detail beginning with north america net revenues in north america for the fourth quarter increased 13 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to a 14 contribution from the acquisition of abs core revenue declined by 1 as unfavorable volume mix more than offset our 3 price realization volume headwinds were most pronounced in our windows and canada businesses in our door business we did see some volume growth but it was driven by a shift in mix from traditional distribution toward our retail channel i will also note the 3 benefit pricing in north america was consistent with third quarter price realization indicating stabilization of our recent previous pricing actions adjusted ebitda in north america increased by 11 6 to 68 2 million adjusted ebitda margins decreased 10 basis points to 11 margin dilution from the abs acquisition was mostly offset by core adjusted ebitda margin expansion of 40 basis points marking our first quarter of core margin expansion in north america since the third quarter of 2017 moving on to slide 13 net revenues in europe for the fourth quarter increased 9 4 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to a 12 contribution from the acquisition of domoferm offset by a 4 unfavorable impact of foreign exchange core revenues increased 1 from improved pricing adjusted ebitda in europe decreased 16 9 to 29 3 million adjusted ebitda margins decreased 310 basis points to 9 7 margins were impacted by the dilution from the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange as well as 210 basis points of margin compression in the core business core business margins were negatively impacted by a significant mix shift toward less profitable channels as well as higher costs in certain countries on slide 14 net revenues in australasia for the fourth quarter increased to 11 9 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to a 19 increase from the a l windows acquisition partially offset by a 6 unfavorable impact from foreign exchange core revenue declined by 1 due to unfavorable volume mix similar to what we saw in the third quarter with the continued softening of the australia residential new construction housing market adjusted ebitda in australasia increased 13 to 24 0 million adjusted ebitda margins expanded by 20 basis points to 14 4 primarily as a result in improvement in core margins of 10 basis points from productivity and cost controls on page 15 our free cash flow for the year totaled 101 0 million down versus prior year primarily due to capital investments increasing to more normalized levels funding productivity and growth initiatives on the balance sheet we ended 2018 with total net debt of 1 36 billion an increase of 307 million compared with year end 2017 the increase in our net debt was primarily driven by the cash used to fund the three acquisitions we closed during the first quarter and the 125 million of cash used to return capital shareholders through share repurchases during the year at year end our net leverage ratio was 2 9 times at the upper end of our target range up from 2 4 times at year end 2017 our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong to fund our strategic initiatives now i will turn it back over to gary to go through our 2019 outlook and provide closing comments gary s michel president and chief executive officer thank you john on page 17 i will provide you with a brief update on our segment outlook for 2019 we expect core revenue growth in 2019 in our north america and europe segments with a modest core revenue decline in our australasia segment in north america we anticipate a stable repair and remodel market with core growth in the low to mid single digits and modest growth in new construction in europe we expect moderating economic growth to yield low single digit market growth and in australasia we expect a contraction in residential new construction driven by tightening consumer credit standards to result in low single digit market declines turning to page 18 on a consolidated basis we expect 2019 revenue growth of 1 to 5 including core revenue growth of 1 to 3 core revenue growth will be driven by recently implemented pricing actions and modest volume growth in north america partially offset by moderate new construction contraction in australasia our outlook for adjusted ebitda in 2019 is a range of 470 million to 505 million which assumes approximately 40 basis points of core margin expansion at the midpoint the growth in adjusted ebitda and the improvement in adjusted ebitda margins are driven by productivity initiatives and previously implemented pricing actions i ll also note that the impact of the stronger us dollar will be a meaningful headwind to our results in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018 we expect capital expenditures of 140 million to 160 million in 2019 compared to the 118 7 million in 2018 capex will remain at approximately 3 5 of sales roughly a 100 basis points higher than normalized levels through 2020 to fund our facility rationalization and modernization plan the investments we are making will simplify operations drive efficiencies throughout the business and result in improved return on invested capital on page 19 i d like to wrap up with our approach to shareholder value creation first we ll continue to deploy capital to profitably grow our revenues through investments in r d and new products by expanding our channel opportunities and remaining disciplined on pricing second we ll continue to focus on our cost structure by driving productivity throughout the business great companies find ways to drive productivity improvements year in and year out and we are building the cultural mindset to do just that at jeld wen we will also remain disciplined allocators of shareholder capital balancing returns between organic growth strategic m a share repurchases and net debt reduction i d like to provide you with a brief update on our steves litigation however we will be unable to take any questions during the q a session on this matter as many of you are aware in december we received final judgment in the company s ongoing litigation with steves sons we remain steadfast in our opposition to the jury s original verdict as well as the remedies set forth in the final judgment and we believe that we have a strong basis for appeal procedural steps to pursue the appeal have begun however there is no material update since our last public disclosure we expect the appeals process to last 12 to 18 months before we open the line for your questions i d like to take a moment to thank kirk hachigian on behalf of our board of directors and all jeld wen associates for his outstanding leadership and dedication to our company we announced this morning that kirk has informed us of his intention to retire from the board of directors and his role as non executive chairman in may at the conclusion of our annual meeting kirk was instrumental in the company s transformation into a publicly traded company and was the driving force behind many of the initiatives that resulted in consistent revenue growth and margin expansion i d like to personally thank kirk for his coaching and mentorship since i joined the company as ceo last year and his dedication to a continued smooth transition we re all very pleased that matt ross will succeed kirk as non executive chairman matt has been on our board since 2011 and has a deep knowledge of the company and our industry with that i d like to open up the call for q a operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of tim wojs from baird your line is open tim wojs baird analyst hey guys good morning gary s michel president and chief executive officer hey tim tim wojs baird analyst hey so i just had a couple of questions more on the margin side but i guess as you look at 2019 is there any way to kind of tease out what we should think the headwind from inflation should be and if you can maybe bucket that into raw materials wages and other inflation that d be helpful john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer tim it s john here so as we think about the inflationary environment the big picture i would say 2019 still looks inflationary but certainly stabilized from the rapid pace of inflation that we had in 2018 some of the biggest areas of impact for us in 2018 were around freight particularly in north america we were and for the year we averaged our freight was up about 13 in north america i think in one quarter we peaked as high as 18 increases we are expecting that to still be inflationary this year but moderate into the mid single digits range and similarly on some of our other key inputs around glass and hardware and metals and things like that so what i would say is we do expect price cost tailwind for 2019 we ve taken price actions here at the end of the year and into the early part of this year that would more than offset what we expect to see in inflation we do i would include in that the tariff aspects we expect included in my inflation number would be probably 12 million to 17 million of impact from the 25 tariffs on chinese goods if that goes through at 25 so what i would say the big picture is moderation and as opposed to be in a headwind on price cost on materials and freight this coming years looking like it will be a tailwind for us tim wojs baird analyst okay great and then when we think about the productivity savings is 15 million still the right kind of ballpark to think about for 2019 and will most of that hit in the second half of the year gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah we re still good with 10 million to 15 million range second half of the year and really the time the amount is just based on the timing or our ability to take plants offline and the commissioning of new plants so we re still on track and we like that number tim wojs baird analyst okay and then just lastly if i can sneak one more in free cash flow in 2019 just how should we think about free cash flow conversion with the higher capex and then probably some cash restructuring charges or payouts john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean certainly our aspiration is to deliver 100 of conversion we fell short of that this year on a couple of aspects as we ramped up ramped up some spending capex but thinking about 2019 you re right we got some extra we do have some extra capex as well as some cash restructuring we re going to work pretty hard to offset that with working capital i d say there s been so much focus that margin improvement this business the last five years that working capital is an area of opportunity for us particularly as we lean out the operations and work with our supplier base both on inventory and ap so what i would tell you is our aspiration is still to deliver 100 conversion we re just going to have to work a lot harder with to get some tailwind from working capital to offset the higher capex and cash restructuring tim wojs baird analyst sounds good congrats on 2018 and good luck on 2019 ph john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks tim gary s michel president and chief executive officer thanks tim operator our next question comes from the line of phil ng from jefferies your line is open maggie grady jefferies analyst good morning guys it s actually maggie on for phil can you talk about some of the volume headwinds in us windows and canada and whether you see that inflecting in 2019 or what s assumed in your full year guidance for those two pieces john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me start off and then i ll have gary sort of talk about where the pipeline is looking like i would say within the q4 for north america volume and mix we kind of lump those together for windows and canada it was in the high single digit range for kind of the headwind coming out of that obviously we got a little bit of price to offset it from a core growth standpoint but it was a pretty meaningful headwind i would characterize a lot of that again with hangover from some of our service issues that we had back in 2017 and i don t know maybe gary can kind of speak to how the pipeline is building but i think as we move into 2019 we re starting to lap some pretty favorable comps there gary s michel president and chief executive officer yes so when you think about it it s a little bit of a mixed story as well between retail and traditional channels that we saw and when we think about the service issues that we saw in 2017 we re starting to see we ve got that behind us we re seeing revenue come back we re seeing that share recapture coming back primarily in windows and that s looking favorable for us and supporting our revenue projections for 2019 so got those service issues as i said earlier we saw improvements in operations in almost all of our plants through the second half of last year those issues are all behind us customers are coming back to us and we re starting to win some project business so we feel pretty good about the support there maggie grady jefferies analyst okay got it that s really helpful and then in terms of pricing can you talk about what kind of traction you ve gotten so far on the december price increase and kind of what the competitive response to the increase has been have your competitors been matching that just what s going on there gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah so we ve announced and deployed pricing really across all our channels really across all geographies kind of got ahead of it this year it has been very disciplined in the marketplace as well so we feel pretty good about where we stand no real pushback at this point inflation has been pretty well documented through last year as i said earlier we were a little bit behind through most of 2018 we got ahead of that in 2019 and got really all of our seasonal pricing and deployed at this point or in the process of being deployed we got a couple of certainly on a global basis we got a couple of price changes that are seasonal but ahead of us and that s just kind of normal course of business so feeling much much better about this year s position than we did last year maggie grady jefferies analyst all right thanks guys gary s michel president and chief executive officer thanks maggie operator our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut from jpmorgan your line is open elad hillman jpmorgan analyst hi this is elad on for mike i wanted to drill down a little bit more into the pricing comments you were just mentioning and i was curious if the pricing which you re getting in 2019 which is now being mentioned was ahead of some of the cost inflation was that only or was that primarily in the wholesale channel or are we also able get some of the price in the retail channel gary s michel president and chief executive officer we ve been able to get in the wholesale channel and in the retail channel as well so done pretty well across all of our channels in north america as well as in europe and australasia i tell you with the slowdown in australasia it s probably going to be a little harder to get the price but we do expect to see realization in all of our segments elad hillman jpmorgan analyst okay great and then could you also expand a little bit more on the shift i think you mentioned the shift to retail from wholesale volumes in 4q and you re starting to see that come back in 2019 and maybe how that split between the windows and the doors business if you re seeing a similar trend in both of those and really kind of what you re seeing on the wholesale side thanks gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah so the mix issue is really between traditional and retail so where some of that s a little bit of the hangover that we had from service issues not primarily windows doors is actually up so we got the share recapture piece for windows it took a little bit longer to come back after the service issues as i mentioned those are all behind us we have a good pipeline in fact a very strong pipeline of business coming into 2019 which includes that share recapture as well as additional share gain with customers that we have not done business with previously so this is business that based on our segment ph products and some other new product developments are highly desirable and customers are coming for those as well john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer i would just add on elad our windows business in north america while we do do some retail it is predominantly weighted toward your traditional distribution channel as you think about the product they re being more of a primarily more of a make the order type of a product that s more suited for distribution so when i spoke earlier about seeing negative volumes and windows a lot of that was felt on the traditional distribution side so where we were getting the growth was more on the retail side elad hillman jpmorgan analyst okay great and in the in your north america guidance the 3 to 4 growth is that assuming the windows business had some of this volume growth and regained share or would that represent some incremental upside to the guide john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say that we ve been pretty conservative about our assumptions for volume growth in north america in that 3 to 4 you got to remember there is some canada in that north america it s only about 10 to 15 of north america but it is a headwind through the rest of north america so we have really good visibility around that 3 to 4 from where we sit today based on the pricing actions that have already been taken and implemented and so with some level of modest assumptions around core growth and share recapture in north america we ve got good confidence around that 3 to 4 number elad hillman jpmorgan analyst great thank you john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of truman patterson from wells fargo your line is open truman patterson wells fargo analyst hey guys good morning just hoping you know in north america i was hoping you guys could talk about the nice turnaround in your fourth quarter margins really outside of kind of the pricing cost relationships or kind of the core operational improvements and then also just bigger picture on your margin expectations for 2019 from here really hoping that you can give us some update kind of the doors versus windows businesses as i know windows has really been a problem area john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer hey truman yes so i would say in north america we did we did get some productivity and cost reductions in the fourth quarter as we already talked about price cost being a slight tailwind in the quarter so we were able to deliver that core margin improvement in north america of 40 basis points even with the headwind of the volume mix i would say that that volume mix headwind for north america segment ebitda margins was definitely over 100 basis points just from that alone so we were successful on the price costs we are successful on the productivity but lost a lot of that back on the volume mix side of things and i think what was a pretty good quarter could have been a great quarter had we had some more contribution from volume mix gary s michel president and chief executive officer so yeah our focus on really putting jem our jeld wen excellence model business operating system tools out into more plants and driving a productivity program in the second half of the year started to pay off we re seeing great improvements in the factories that we deployed jem and are starting to see some continuous improvement in each one of those so that productivity pipeline really started to build in the latter half of the year and that s really what we re also looking at 2019 we ve got a stronger pipeline as we continue to deploy the jem tools across really all of our operations across the enterprise truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thanks for that guys second question more on europe north america margins seem to be turning the corner but europe continues to face pressures could you just discuss what the drivers of this are is it weakening demand is there brexit impact and then how should we really think about europe specifically on the margin front in 2019 and what s kind of baked in your guidance john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think what we ve seen in europe is a shift toward some of the lower margin project business away from some of the higher margin resi channels and in those resi channels we ve seen some greater price competition quite frankly and it s primarily been in the north and the central we still have a pretty strong business in the uk that s done fairly well so as we look as we look into 2019 which is the second half of your question we do think it s moderating a bit we ll see probably a little bit of the same type of mix pressure but still modest growth as we re or low growth i guess as we re looking at 2019 is what s built into our plan gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah i would just say that and just add on that we are expecting some core margin improvement in europe this year i mean i would strike a cautious tone particularly in the first half but as we get into the back half clearly you re going to have some pretty favorable comps given the last couple of quarters in europe but just to confirm we are looking at core margin improvement in europe truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of susan maklari from credit suisse your line is open christopher kalata credit suisse analyst hi this is actually chris on for susan thanks for taking my questions so my first question is just on your capex outlook given that much of the footprint rationalization is expected to come through after 2020 how does your future capex spend relate to or compare to your current 2019 estimate john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we there s a repeat back there our normalized capex run rate is around 2 5 of sales and it is what we think we need to run the business both for sustaining as well as growth in productivity investments as we mentioned before we think we ve got about two years of 3 5 of sales capex to fund the footprint projects it s a bit front end loaded so if you think about what we re doing here we re not only consolidating sites but we are also modernizing some of the equipment in the sites that we re consolidating and so there s a fair amount of investment on the front end as we sort of optimize some previous processes that were pretty labor intensive and some of the legacy plants and consolidate that into centralized plants for best in class manufacturing capabilities so after about two years of higher investment to fund the footprint projects we do see it going back to normalized to sort of 2 5 of sales run rate but the savings around the footprint reduction don t match year on year with the capital investment it s a little we got to spend some money upfront to get the savings and so you will see the run rate of the savings start to accelerate as we get into 2021 and 2022 gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah it is important to also underscore that as we re doing this rationalization and modernization we re actually because we are deploying standard we are modernizing the plants even though we re consolidating rationally adding capacity in our system for our product supply so i think that s an important point christopher kalata credit suisse analyst got it thanks for that and then just my second question is on capital allocation for 2019 given these internal investments could you just rank order your preferences right now currently in terms of deleveraging share repurchases m a just given your current outlook gary s michel president and chief executive officer you know i think it s important to have first and foremost we are investing in our own consolidation and modernization programs in profitable growth second we made a number of acquisitions last year and certainly over the last 18 months we re in the process of consolidating those and getting getting the benefits out of those part of that acquisition last year is giving us a foundation for the rationalization program as well so that s helping us saying that those are our two primary focuses right now the consolidation and the profitable growth investment we continue to scan the horizon there are some opportunities out there for m a and obviously it has got a higher bar at this point for us to make a decision to make an acquisition versus buying our stock back at this point so that s where we would have to make that decision so first and foremost investing in profitable growth and in our rationalization program second would be really looking at share repurchase but scanning strategic m a against that christopher kalata credit suisse analyst got it appreciate the color operator our next question comes from the line of matthew bouley from barclays your line is open matthew bouley barclays analyst hi thank you for taking my questions i wanted to ask about the first quarter guidance the 18 5 full year ebit how should we think about north america specifically in that thinking specifically about the core growth side in light of what s been a pretty clear soft patch in housing over the past couple of months thank you john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so what i would tell you about the first quarter we do have one quarter of carryover of the three acquisitions that we did in the first quarter of last year so embedded in our guidance is we re assuming we pick up that benefit that s mostly offset by the fx the stronger dollar that gary mentioned it s a pretty significant headwind for us here in the first quarter revenue headwind we re currently estimating in the 45 million 50 million range from a from a fx standpoint in the first quarter so if you kind of net those two things out we are still implying some some modest core improvement in the business i would tell you from a from a north america standpoint while we don t guide specifically on segments we are forecasting some modest core growth in the first quarter and we can get there through pricing and then some conservative assumptions around starting to get the share back on the window side matthew bouley barclays analyst okay that s helpful and then i wanted to ask about the australasia business you re obviously being pretty measured in the 2019 guide there as well but a lot of moving pieces around macro and housing there so just any additional detail about what you re hearing from customers in australia and kind of how you re managing through this i guess housing softness there thank you gary s michel president and chief executive officer yes so the housing softness is really what we have been talking about apparently for a couple of years here but we ve seen a slowdown there our business is indexed more it has been historically indexed more toward residential new construction what s interesting about our business in australia versus our other two segments is that we are we have a broader product portfolio beyond windows and doors which allows us to spread our revenue around and as we re reindexing the business toward repair and replace there is still a good market there plus that s a lot of that is gain for us it s new business that we re they have done a real nice job down there of being able to to secure new business in those new areas with that we are because of our index toward residential new construction and the newness of moving toward a greater repair and replace business yeah we are optimistic we re a little cautious on the growth levels there but we have a really good team down there they ve done a great job on cost containment and on restructuring the business for the markets that we serve matthew bouley barclays analyst all right appreciate that color congrats on the quarter and to kirk as well on his retirement thank you gary s michel president and chief executive officer thanks john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of steven ramsey from thompson research group your line is open brian biros thompson research group analyst hey good morning this is brian biros on for steven thanks for taking my questions i wanted to ask about the 2019 outlook i think you touched on various aspects of this question in responses to other people just wanted to see if i can phrase a little differently is there anything to call out between windows and doors that might be materially different between the two going into 2019 whether that be industry dynamics volume pricing anything that comes to mind to call out between the two that would be different in the guidance john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer not really i would say that they re going to act similarly we look at pricing in the channels certainly by product and by channel but the one thing that i mentioned earlier is that the overhang from service issues in 2017 and the share recapturing share gain is probably a little more indexed toward windows than doors but we continue to see growth in both of those and we see the same productivity program and the opportunities for rationalization and modernization both gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah i would just add onto that exactly right i mean the cost savings opportunities are similar the price cost dynamics are similar as you think about the guidance that we ve outlined here for 2019 to deliver the midpoint we got a headwind on fx that we already talked about for the full year we ve got the contribution of acquisitions and so on that core improvement we told you we ve made some modest assumptions around volume and the rest of it we ve got very good visibility to through our productivity pipeline of projects that are phased throughout the year as well as the price cost side of things which again we ve already taken action on brian biros thompson research group analyst got you and second one also on the 2019 guidance the 40 basis points of margin improvement at the midpoint if you could just add some color or give us some confidence around the levers behind that whether that d be volume price cost takeout and say if volumes underperform are there enough moving pieces on the other side to make up for that lag john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so the 40 basis points you re referring to that s the kind of the core margin improvement the all in margin improvement at the midpoint is 20 basis points if you take out acquisitions and fx but to your point i think it s kind of where i was going with my answer to the last question is there are some investments we re going to have to make next year on the g a side product development side ic sides that are based on some of the projects we re working on so it s not all tailwinds from price and productivity there are some investments we re going to have to make but if you think about sort of breaking down that 40 basis points again with that with a modest assumption around how much volume we re going to get while we ve got good visibility to that 40 basis points through the price costs as well as the productivity pipeline i think in terms of what what could move faster is you know as gary mentioned earlier just the as we re working through this facility rationalization project just the timing of when we actually take some of those new facilities online and the timing of when we are able to take some of the old facilities offline i mean that could be a piece that could move the needle one direction or the other in terms of how much savings drop through into 2019 but again good visibility on that 40 basis points brian biros thompson research group analyst understood thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of john lovallo from bank of america your line is open john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thank you for taking my questions the first question is on slide 7 one of the comments there was that there is going to be some buffer stock built just to avoid disruption i mean john how does that kind of play into the opportunity for working capital improvement and then also in that same sentence i think it talks about new facilities coming online i m just curious are these actually new facilities that are being brought on or is it just new capacity within existing facilities john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer let me answer the specific question first and i will ask gary to kind of elaborate on how the process is working and from a strategy standpoint but the specific comment around inventory was really more of an intra year sort of a comment so for example we re in a process in north america we have a project going on right now where we re getting ready to bring some capacity online and in the facilities that we believe will be impacted by that in terms of being taken offline of course one of the strategies before you do that is to build a little extra stock before you take the old facility offline sp i would consider that more of an intra year type of move as opposed to something that would impact a full year working capital but do you want to elaborate on that gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah so one of the things that we wanted to make sure in the certainly in the early phases of this project is that we made sure that our new facilities that come online are at full capacity and fully able to handle customer demand as well before we take latent capacity offline so we are just trying to take a go slow to go fast approach in the first phases with that being said we ve got we re building a lot of standard work we re building a little bit of as john said inventory to buffer that but overall really just looking to make sure that we don t affect our ability to deliver for customers as we re making these transfers john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay got it thank you and then second question is you guys talked about a shift or somewhat of a shift from distribution to retail can you just help us kind of think about the margin differential between distribution and retail channels john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer it s certainly the margin profile in north america of retail versus traditional is pretty significant i would say it s largely due to the nature of what s being bought in the two channels so in the retail channel we sell a much higher proportion of stock goods as opposed to make to order or special order goods by nature that s going to be a lower margin profile and on the flipside traditional distribution we re going to see a higher percentage of special order or make to order type products which is going to carry a higher profile so it s sort of less about one channel being structurally less profitable than the other or anything like that it s just more about the mix of what s going through those channels we haven t disclosed margins by channel but it is a pretty significant shift obviously enough to move our margins here in the fourth quarter in north america yeah and you look at some of our new product launches and the things that we re doing particularly what was shown in ibs you will see that the types of products that we re launching and where we launched them in both of the channels also have an effect on shaping that demand and shaping that margin picture so we re always looking to improve both the mix within the channel as well as the mix across the channels john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you guys john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator we have no further questions in queue i will turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks gary s michel president and chief executive officer i d like to thank you all for joining us today we delivered our guidance for ebitda in the fourth quarter we re looking good for 2019 and we appreciate all of your support and your

michel president and chief executive officer good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today 2018 represents our fifth consecutive year of adjusted ebitda growth and i am confident that the operational progress that we ve made in the year has set the foundation for consistent profitable growth of jeld wen during 2018 we completed three acquisitions adding to our family of leading brands these acquisitions bring a combination of new and exciting products increased channel access and best in class manufacturing capability we also invested in new product development during the year launching a number of key new window and door products some of which will be on display this week in las vegas at the international builders show in november we announced a comprehensive facility rationalization and modernization plan and also outlined and enhanced deployment of our business operating system the jeld wen excellence model or jem together these initiatives will reduce our cost structure by 200 million increasing our ability to respond to changing market conditions and improving both the quality of our products and the safety of our manufacturing operations as you can see on page 4 we are beginning to see the signs of this transformation at jeld wen i m pleased to report that we delivered our most recent revenue and adjusted ebitda guidance i ll also highlight that we delivered core adjusted ebitda margin expansion in both north america and australasia in the fourth quarter and we have successfully implemented price increases to offset raw material cost inflation which will support accelerating core margin improvement as we progress through 2019 we recognize that 2018 also presented its fair share of challenges our core volumes were impacted by the lingering effects of prior service issues in our north america and europe segments as well as from unfavorable mix for most of the year we were playing catch up on price versus raw material and freight inflation the actions we re taking to reduce our cost structure driving productivity throughout the organization and developing a lean focused problem solving culture will allow us to better serve our customers and respond to changing market conditions these actions built on jem and on our productivity culture give me full confidence that we will achieve our 15 adjusted ebitda margin target by 2022 please turn to page 5 for a brief summary of our fourth quarter and full year financial results john will follow up with a more detailed view shortly net revenues for the quarter increased by 11 8 driven primarily by contribution from acquisitions which continue to perform in line with our expectations core revenue growth was unchanged for both the fourth quarter and full year as compared to prior year periods as positive pricing was offset by volume and mix headwinds our net income during the quarter increased by 133 4 million year over year due to the non recurrence of charges related to tax reform taken in 2017 and contributions from acquisitions made during the year adjusted ebitda during the quarter of 109 6 million was above the midpoint implied in our most recent guidance for the full year adjusted ebitda was 465 3 million net leverage at year end of approximately 2 9 times is now within the upper end of our targeted range and our balance sheet and liquidity remained strong during the fourth quarter we repurchased 2 2 million shares of our common stock for 41 4 million we will remain disciplined and balanced deploying excess cash flow in 2019 on page 6 i d like to provide you with a brief update on the steps that we took in 2018 to accelerate the deployment of our business operating system the jeld wen excellence model or jem during the year we significantly increased the cadence of jem implementation across the business by training over 2 000 of our associates on a3 problem solving and doubling the number of facilities that utilize jem tools these tools include visual management problem solving demand planning and rapid improvement events as part of our standard work as a result of these efforts we have already witnessed a significant improvement in our service levels with over 90 of all facilities exhibiting improvement in 2018 i m proud of our associates who have embraced jem and who have built a deep pipeline of cost saving projects to drive meaningful productivity gains in 2019 the jem culture and tools are critical to achieving our productivity target of 3 net reduction in cost of goods sold annually jem is the cornerstone of our business and it begins with a simple philosophy of eliminating waste in all aspects of our operations and processes on page 7 i ll provide a brief update of our facility footprint rationalization and modernization program which leverages the collective knowledge and experience of our associates from over 40 acquisitions and nearly 60 years in business to develop the best way to manufacture and distribute our products we ve recently announced the closure of two north american manufacturing facilities and a handful of smaller sites in australia and we will execute the consolidation of additional facilities later this year we currently have projects at various stages of completion within each of our three geographic segments as you can see we ve provided an outline of our existing manufacturing footprint on a square footage basis along with the expected reduction in square footage for 2019 and through the completion of our rationalization plans in 2022 savings from these efforts will begin in the second half of 2019 and yield approximately 100 million in annual run rate savings by 2022 as we execute our plans we are taking all necessary precautions to minimize any potential disruption to our associates and our customers including carrying excess inventory and retaining supplemental capacity as needed this footprint rationalization process involves far more then consolidating square footage as we are also modernizing many of our production capabilities and deploying standard work across the organization which will improve our cost flexibility quality and safety while reducing cycle time and waste leading to higher quality products and improved customer experience before turning it over to john on page 8 i want to acknowledge and celebrate jeld wen s track record over the last five years of double digit annual ebitda growth in less than one year we ve accelerated deployment of jem tools to create a lean manufacturing organization and establish a global footprint rationalization and modernization plan to reduce cost and increased throughput and our execution is improving we remain committed to our 15 adjusted ebitda margin target by 2022 and to our legacy of profitable growth with that i ll turn it over to john linker to provide a detailed review of our financial results for the quarter and full year 2018 john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks gary i ll start on slide 10 for the fourth quarter net revenues increased to 11 8 to 1 1 billion the increase was driven primarily by the contribution of our recent acquisitions partially offset by a 2 headwind from foreign currency we reported net income of 39 7 million for the fourth quarter an increase of 133 4 million the increase in net income was driven by the addition of recent acquisitions and the absence of a 98 million charge associated with tax reform that was taken in the same period last year for the quarter diluted earnings per share was 0 38 an increase of 1 27 compared to prior year and adjusted diluted earnings per share was 0 41 an increase of 0 15 compared to prior year adjusted ebitda increased 6 3 to 109 6 million adjusted ebitda margins declined by 60 basis points in the quarter to 10 while year over year consolidated margins declined we did see sequential improvements in many areas of our business the margin decline seen in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by lower margins in our core business where our core adjusted ebitda margin decreased approximately 60 basis points primarily due to underperformance in europe partially offset by core margin improvement in north america and australasia i will elaborate a bit more on the segment performance in the next few slides slide 11 provides detail of our revenue drivers for the fourth quarter and full year here you can see that our consolidated core revenue growth was unchanged in the fourth quarter we realized positive price of 2 that was offset by equal decline in volume and mix for the full year consolidated core revenue growth was up 1 with total full year revenue up 15 5 primarily coming from our recent acquisitions please move to slide 12 where i ll take you through the segment detail beginning with north america net revenues in north america for the fourth quarter increased 13 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to a 14 contribution from the acquisition of abs core revenue declined by 1 as unfavorable volume mix more than offset our 3 price realization volume headwinds were most pronounced in our windows and canada businesses in our door business we did see some volume growth but it was driven by a shift in mix from traditional distribution toward our retail channel i will also note the 3 benefit pricing in north america was consistent with third quarter price realization indicating stabilization of our recent previous pricing actions adjusted ebitda in north america increased by 11 6 to 68 2 million adjusted ebitda margins decreased 10 basis points to 11 margin dilution from the abs acquisition was mostly offset by core adjusted ebitda margin expansion of 40 basis points marking our first quarter of core margin expansion in north america since the third quarter of 2017 moving on to slide 13 net revenues in europe for the fourth quarter increased 9 4 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to a 12 contribution from the acquisition of domoferm offset by a 4 unfavorable impact of foreign exchange core revenues increased 1 from improved pricing adjusted ebitda in europe decreased 16 9 to 29 3 million adjusted ebitda margins decreased 310 basis points to 9 7 margins were impacted by the dilution from the unfavourable impact of foreign exchange as well as 210 basis points of margin compression in the core business core business margins were negatively impacted by a significant mix shift toward less profitable channels as well as higher costs in certain countries on slide 14 net revenues in australasia for the fourth quarter increased to 11 9 the increase in net revenues was primarily due to a 19 increase from the a l windows acquisition partially offset by a 6 unfavorable impact from foreign exchange core revenue declined by 1 due to unfavorable volume mix similar to what we saw in the third quarter with the continued softening of the australia residential new construction housing market adjusted ebitda in australasia increased 13 to 24 0 million adjusted ebitda margins expanded by 20 basis points to 14 4 primarily as a result in improvement in core margins of 10 basis points from productivity and cost controls on page 15 our free cash flow for the year totaled 101 0 million down versus prior year primarily due to capital investments increasing to more normalized levels funding productivity and growth initiatives on the balance sheet we ended 2018 with total net debt of 1 36 billion an increase of 307 million compared with year end 2017 the increase in our net debt was primarily driven by the cash used to fund the three acquisitions we closed during the first quarter and the 125 million of cash used to return capital shareholders through share repurchases during the year at year end our net leverage ratio was 2 9 times at the upper end of our target range up from 2 4 times at year end 2017 our balance sheet and liquidity remains strong to fund our strategic initiatives now i will turn it back over to gary to go through our 2019 outlook and provide closing comments gary s michel president and chief executive officer thank you john on page 17 i will provide you with a brief update on our segment outlook for 2019 we expect core revenue growth in 2019 in our north america and europe segments with a modest core revenue decline in our australasia segment in north america we anticipate a stable repair and remodel market with core growth in the low to mid single digits and modest growth in new construction in europe we expect moderating economic growth to yield low single digit market growth and in australasia we expect a contraction in residential new construction driven by tightening consumer credit standards to result in low single digit market declines turning to page 18 on a consolidated basis we expect 2019 revenue growth of 1 to 5 including core revenue growth of 1 to 3 core revenue growth will be driven by recently implemented pricing actions and modest volume growth in north america partially offset by moderate new construction contraction in australasia our outlook for adjusted ebitda in 2019 is a range of 470 million to 505 million which assumes approximately 40 basis points of core margin expansion at the midpoint the growth in adjusted ebitda and the improvement in adjusted ebitda margins are driven by productivity initiatives and previously implemented pricing actions i ll also note that the impact of the stronger us dollar will be a meaningful headwind to our results in the first half of 2019 compared to 2018 we expect capital expenditures of 140 million to 160 million in 2019 compared to the 118 7 million in 2018 capex will remain at approximately 3 5 of sales roughly a 100 basis points higher than normalized levels through 2020 to fund our facility rationalization and modernization plan the investments we are making will simplify operations drive efficiencies throughout the business and result in improved return on invested capital on page 19 i d like to wrap up with our approach to shareholder value creation first we ll continue to deploy capital to profitably grow our revenues through investments in r d and new products by expanding our channel opportunities and remaining disciplined on pricing second we ll continue to focus on our cost structure by driving productivity throughout the business great companies find ways to drive productivity improvements year in and year out and we are building the cultural mindset to do just that at jeld wen we will also remain disciplined allocators of shareholder capital balancing returns between organic growth strategic m a share repurchases and net debt reduction i d like to provide you with a brief update on our steves litigation however we will be unable to take any questions during the q a session on this matter as many of you are aware in december we received final judgment in the company s ongoing litigation with steves sons we remain steadfast in our opposition to the jury s original verdict as well as the remedies set forth in the final judgment and we believe that we have a strong basis for appeal procedural steps to pursue the appeal have begun however there is no material update since our last public disclosure we expect the appeals process to last 12 to 18 months before we open the line for your questions i d like to take a moment to thank kirk hachigian on behalf of our board of directors and all jeld wen associates for his outstanding leadership and dedication to our company we announced this morning that kirk has informed us of his intention to retire from the board of directors and his role as non executive chairman in may at the conclusion of our annual meeting kirk was instrumental in the company s transformation into a publicly traded company and was the driving force behind many of the initiatives that resulted in consistent revenue growth and margin expansion i d like to personally thank kirk for his coaching and mentorship since i joined the company as ceo last year and his dedication to a continued smooth transition we re all very pleased that matt ross will succeed kirk as non executive chairman matt has been on our board since 2011 and has a deep knowledge of the company and our industry with that i d like to open up the call for q a operator questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of tim wojs from baird your line is open tim wojs baird analyst hey guys good morning gary s michel president and chief executive officer hey tim tim wojs baird analyst hey so i just had a couple of questions more on the margin side but i guess as you look at 2019 is there any way to kind of tease out what we should think the headwind from inflation should be and if you can maybe bucket that into raw materials wages and other inflation that d be helpful john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer tim it s john here so as we think about the inflationary environment the big picture i would say 2019 still looks inflationary but certainly stabilized from the rapid pace of inflation that we had in 2018 some of the biggest areas of impact for us in 2018 were around freight particularly in north america we were and for the year we averaged our freight was up about 13 in north america i think in one quarter we peaked as high as 18 increases we are expecting that to still be inflationary this year but moderate into the mid single digits range and similarly on some of our other key inputs around glass and hardware and metals and things like that so what i would say is we do expect price cost tailwind for 2019 we ve taken price actions here at the end of the year and into the early part of this year that would more than offset what we expect to see in inflation we do i would include in that the tariff aspects we expect included in my inflation number would be probably 12 million to 17 million of impact from the 25 tariffs on chinese goods if that goes through at 25 so what i would say the big picture is moderation and as opposed to be in a headwind on price cost on materials and freight this coming years looking like it will be a tailwind for us tim wojs baird analyst okay great and then when we think about the productivity savings is 15 million still the right kind of ballpark to think about for 2019 and will most of that hit in the second half of the year gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah we re still good with 10 million to 15 million range second half of the year and really the time the amount is just based on the timing or our ability to take plants offline and the commissioning of new plants so we re still on track and we like that number tim wojs baird analyst okay and then just lastly if i can sneak one more in free cash flow in 2019 just how should we think about free cash flow conversion with the higher capex and then probably some cash restructuring charges or payouts john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean certainly our aspiration is to deliver 100 of conversion we fell short of that this year on a couple of aspects as we ramped up ramped up some spending capex but thinking about 2019 you re right we got some extra we do have some extra capex as well as some cash restructuring we re going to work pretty hard to offset that with working capital i d say there s been so much focus that margin improvement this business the last five years that working capital is an area of opportunity for us particularly as we lean out the operations and work with our supplier base both on inventory and ap so what i would tell you is our aspiration is still to deliver 100 conversion we re just going to have to work a lot harder with to get some tailwind from working capital to offset the higher capex and cash restructuring tim wojs baird analyst sounds good congrats on 2018 and good luck on 2019 ph john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks tim gary s michel president and chief executive officer thanks tim operator our next question comes from the line of phil ng from jefferies your line is open maggie grady jefferies analyst good morning guys it s actually maggie on for phil can you talk about some of the volume headwinds in us windows and canada and whether you see that inflecting in 2019 or what s assumed in your full year guidance for those two pieces john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah let me start off and then i ll have gary sort of talk about where the pipeline is looking like i would say within the q4 for north america volume and mix we kind of lump those together for windows and canada it was in the high single digit range for kind of the headwind coming out of that obviously we got a little bit of price to offset it from a core growth standpoint but it was a pretty meaningful headwind i would characterize a lot of that again with hangover from some of our service issues that we had back in 2017 and i don t know maybe gary can kind of speak to how the pipeline is building but i think as we move into 2019 we re starting to lap some pretty favorable comps there gary s michel president and chief executive officer yes so when you think about it it s a little bit of a mixed story as well between retail and traditional channels that we saw and when we think about the service issues that we saw in 2017 we re starting to see we ve got that behind us we re seeing revenue come back we re seeing that share recapture coming back primarily in windows and that s looking favorable for us and supporting our revenue projections for 2019 so got those service issues as i said earlier we saw improvements in operations in almost all of our plants through the second half of last year those issues are all behind us customers are coming back to us and we re starting to win some project business so we feel pretty good about the support there maggie grady jefferies analyst okay got it that s really helpful and then in terms of pricing can you talk about what kind of traction you ve gotten so far on the december price increase and kind of what the competitive response to the increase has been have your competitors been matching that just what s going on there gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah so we ve announced and deployed pricing really across all our channels really across all geographies kind of got ahead of it this year it has been very disciplined in the marketplace as well so we feel pretty good about where we stand no real pushback at this point inflation has been pretty well documented through last year as i said earlier we were a little bit behind through most of 2018 we got ahead of that in 2019 and got really all of our seasonal pricing and deployed at this point or in the process of being deployed we got a couple of certainly on a global basis we got a couple of price changes that are seasonal but ahead of us and that s just kind of normal course of business so feeling much much better about this year s position than we did last year maggie grady jefferies analyst all right thanks guys gary s michel president and chief executive officer thanks maggie operator our next question comes from the line of michael rehaut from jpmorgan your line is open elad hillman jpmorgan analyst hi this is elad on for mike i wanted to drill down a little bit more into the pricing comments you were just mentioning and i was curious if the pricing which you re getting in 2019 which is now being mentioned was ahead of some of the cost inflation was that only or was that primarily in the wholesale channel or are we also able get some of the price in the retail channel gary s michel president and chief executive officer we ve been able to get in the wholesale channel and in the retail channel as well so done pretty well across all of our channels in north america as well as in europe and australasia i tell you with the slowdown in australasia it s probably going to be a little harder to get the price but we do expect to see realization in all of our segments elad hillman jpmorgan analyst okay great and then could you also expand a little bit more on the shift i think you mentioned the shift to retail from wholesale volumes in 4q and you re starting to see that come back in 2019 and maybe how that split between the windows and the doors business if you re seeing a similar trend in both of those and really kind of what you re seeing on the wholesale side thanks gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah so the mix issue is really between traditional and retail so where some of that s a little bit of the hangover that we had from service issues not primarily windows doors is actually up so we got the share recapture piece for windows it took a little bit longer to come back after the service issues as i mentioned those are all behind us we have a good pipeline in fact a very strong pipeline of business coming into 2019 which includes that share recapture as well as additional share gain with customers that we have not done business with previously so this is business that based on our segment ph products and some other new product developments are highly desirable and customers are coming for those as well john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer i would just add on elad our windows business in north america while we do do some retail it is predominantly weighted toward your traditional distribution channel as you think about the product they re being more of a primarily more of a make the order type of a product that s more suited for distribution so when i spoke earlier about seeing negative volumes and windows a lot of that was felt on the traditional distribution side so where we were getting the growth was more on the retail side elad hillman jpmorgan analyst okay great and in the in your north america guidance the 3 to 4 growth is that assuming the windows business had some of this volume growth and regained share or would that represent some incremental upside to the guide john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say that we ve been pretty conservative about our assumptions for volume growth in north america in that 3 to 4 you got to remember there is some canada in that north america it s only about 10 to 15 of north america but it is a headwind through the rest of north america so we have really good visibility around that 3 to 4 from where we sit today based on the pricing actions that have already been taken and implemented and so with some level of modest assumptions around core growth and share recapture in north america we ve got good confidence around that 3 to 4 number elad hillman jpmorgan analyst great thank you john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of truman patterson from wells fargo your line is open truman patterson wells fargo analyst hey guys good morning just hoping you know in north america i was hoping you guys could talk about the nice turnaround in your fourth quarter margins really outside of kind of the pricing cost relationships or kind of the core operational improvements and then also just bigger picture on your margin expectations for 2019 from here really hoping that you can give us some update kind of the doors versus windows businesses as i know windows has really been a problem area john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer hey truman yes so i would say in north america we did we did get some productivity and cost reductions in the fourth quarter as we already talked about price cost being a slight tailwind in the quarter so we were able to deliver that core margin improvement in north america of 40 basis points even with the headwind of the volume mix i would say that that volume mix headwind for north america segment ebitda margins was definitely over 100 basis points just from that alone so we were successful on the price costs we are successful on the productivity but lost a lot of that back on the volume mix side of things and i think what was a pretty good quarter could have been a great quarter had we had some more contribution from volume mix gary s michel president and chief executive officer so yeah our focus on really putting jem our jeld wen excellence model business operating system tools out into more plants and driving a productivity program in the second half of the year started to pay off we re seeing great improvements in the factories that we deployed jem and are starting to see some continuous improvement in each one of those so that productivity pipeline really started to build in the latter half of the year and that s really what we re also looking at 2019 we ve got a stronger pipeline as we continue to deploy the jem tools across really all of our operations across the enterprise truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thanks for that guys second question more on europe north america margins seem to be turning the corner but europe continues to face pressures could you just discuss what the drivers of this are is it weakening demand is there brexit impact and then how should we really think about europe specifically on the margin front in 2019 and what s kind of baked in your guidance john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think what we ve seen in europe is a shift toward some of the lower margin project business away from some of the higher margin resi channels and in those resi channels we ve seen some greater price competition quite frankly and it s primarily been in the north and the central we still have a pretty strong business in the uk that s done fairly well so as we look as we look into 2019 which is the second half of your question we do think it s moderating a bit we ll see probably a little bit of the same type of mix pressure but still modest growth as we re or low growth i guess as we re looking at 2019 is what s built into our plan gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah i would just say that and just add on that we are expecting some core margin improvement in europe this year i mean i would strike a cautious tone particularly in the first half but as we get into the back half clearly you re going to have some pretty favorable comps given the last couple of quarters in europe but just to confirm we are looking at core margin improvement in europe truman patterson wells fargo analyst okay thanks guys operator our next question comes from the line of susan maklari from credit suisse your line is open christopher kalata credit suisse analyst hi this is actually chris on for susan thanks for taking my questions so my first question is just on your capex outlook given that much of the footprint rationalization is expected to come through after 2020 how does your future capex spend relate to or compare to your current 2019 estimate john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so we there s a repeat back there our normalized capex run rate is around 2 5 of sales and it is what we think we need to run the business both for sustaining as well as growth in productivity investments as we mentioned before we think we ve got about two years of 3 5 of sales capex to fund the footprint projects it s a bit front end loaded so if you think about what we re doing here we re not only consolidating sites but we are also modernizing some of the equipment in the sites that we re consolidating and so there s a fair amount of investment on the front end as we sort of optimize some previous processes that were pretty labor intensive and some of the legacy plants and consolidate that into centralized plants for best in class manufacturing capabilities so after about two years of higher investment to fund the footprint projects we do see it going back to normalized to sort of 2 5 of sales run rate but the savings around the footprint reduction don t match year on year with the capital investment it s a little we got to spend some money upfront to get the savings and so you will see the run rate of the savings start to accelerate as we get into 2021 and 2022 gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah it is important to also underscore that as we re doing this rationalization and modernization we re actually because we are deploying standard we are modernizing the plants even though we re consolidating rationally adding capacity in our system for our product supply so i think that s an important point christopher kalata credit suisse analyst got it thanks for that and then just my second question is on capital allocation for 2019 given these internal investments could you just rank order your preferences right now currently in terms of deleveraging share repurchases m a just given your current outlook gary s michel president and chief executive officer you know i think it s important to have first and foremost we are investing in our own consolidation and modernization programs in profitable growth second we made a number of acquisitions last year and certainly over the last 18 months we re in the process of consolidating those and getting getting the benefits out of those part of that acquisition last year is giving us a foundation for the rationalization program as well so that s helping us saying that those are our two primary focuses right now the consolidation and the profitable growth investment we continue to scan the horizon there are some opportunities out there for m a and obviously it has got a higher bar at this point for us to make a decision to make an acquisition versus buying our stock back at this point so that s where we would have to make that decision so first and foremost investing in profitable growth and in our rationalization program second would be really looking at share repurchase but scanning strategic m a against that christopher kalata credit suisse analyst got it appreciate the color operator our next question comes from the line of matthew bouley from barclays your line is open matthew bouley barclays analyst hi thank you for taking my questions i wanted to ask about the first quarter guidance the 18 5 full year ebit how should we think about north america specifically in that thinking specifically about the core growth side in light of what s been a pretty clear soft patch in housing over the past couple of months thank you john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so what i would tell you about the first quarter we do have one quarter of carryover of the three acquisitions that we did in the first quarter of last year so embedded in our guidance is we re assuming we pick up that benefit that s mostly offset by the fx the stronger dollar that gary mentioned it s a pretty significant headwind for us here in the first quarter revenue headwind we re currently estimating in the 45 million 50 million range from a from a fx standpoint in the first quarter so if you kind of net those two things out we are still implying some some modest core improvement in the business i would tell you from a from a north america standpoint while we don t guide specifically on segments we are forecasting some modest core growth in the first quarter and we can get there through pricing and then some conservative assumptions around starting to get the share back on the window side matthew bouley barclays analyst okay that s helpful and then i wanted to ask about the australasia business you re obviously being pretty measured in the 2019 guide there as well but a lot of moving pieces around macro and housing there so just any additional detail about what you re hearing from customers in australia and kind of how you re managing through this i guess housing softness there thank you gary s michel president and chief executive officer yes so the housing softness is really what we have been talking about apparently for a couple of years here but we ve seen a slowdown there our business is indexed more it has been historically indexed more toward residential new construction what s interesting about our business in australia versus our other two segments is that we are we have a broader product portfolio beyond windows and doors which allows us to spread our revenue around and as we re reindexing the business toward repair and replace there is still a good market there plus that s a lot of that is gain for us it s new business that we re they have done a real nice job down there of being able to to secure new business in those new areas with that we are because of our index toward residential new construction and the newness of moving toward a greater repair and replace business yeah we are optimistic we re a little cautious on the growth levels there but we have a really good team down there they ve done a great job on cost containment and on restructuring the business for the markets that we serve matthew bouley barclays analyst all right appreciate that color congrats on the quarter and to kirk as well on his retirement thank you gary s michel president and chief executive officer thanks john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator our next question comes from the line of steven ramsey from thompson research group your line is open brian biros thompson research group analyst hey good morning this is brian biros on for steven thanks for taking my questions i wanted to ask about the 2019 outlook i think you touched on various aspects of this question in responses to other people just wanted to see if i can phrase a little differently is there anything to call out between windows and doors that might be materially different between the two going into 2019 whether that be industry dynamics volume pricing anything that comes to mind to call out between the two that would be different in the guidance john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer not really i would say that they re going to act similarly we look at pricing in the channels certainly by product and by channel but the one thing that i mentioned earlier is that the overhang from service issues in 2017 and the share recapturing share gain is probably a little more indexed toward windows than doors but we continue to see growth in both of those and we see the same productivity program and the opportunities for rationalization and modernization both gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah i would just add onto that exactly right i mean the cost savings opportunities are similar the price cost dynamics are similar as you think about the guidance that we ve outlined here for 2019 to deliver the midpoint we got a headwind on fx that we already talked about for the full year we ve got the contribution of acquisitions and so on that core improvement we told you we ve made some modest assumptions around volume and the rest of it we ve got very good visibility to through our productivity pipeline of projects that are phased throughout the year as well as the price cost side of things which again we ve already taken action on brian biros thompson research group analyst got you and second one also on the 2019 guidance the 40 basis points of margin improvement at the midpoint if you could just add some color or give us some confidence around the levers behind that whether that d be volume price cost takeout and say if volumes underperform are there enough moving pieces on the other side to make up for that lag john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah so the 40 basis points you re referring to that s the kind of the core margin improvement the all in margin improvement at the midpoint is 20 basis points if you take out acquisitions and fx but to your point i think it s kind of where i was going with my answer to the last question is there are some investments we re going to have to make next year on the g a side product development side ic sides that are based on some of the projects we re working on so it s not all tailwinds from price and productivity there are some investments we re going to have to make but if you think about sort of breaking down that 40 basis points again with that with a modest assumption around how much volume we re going to get while we ve got good visibility to that 40 basis points through the price costs as well as the productivity pipeline i think in terms of what what could move faster is you know as gary mentioned earlier just the as we re working through this facility rationalization project just the timing of when we actually take some of those new facilities online and the timing of when we are able to take some of the old facilities offline i mean that could be a piece that could move the needle one direction or the other in terms of how much savings drop through into 2019 but again good visibility on that 40 basis points brian biros thompson research group analyst understood thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of john lovallo from bank of america your line is open john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey guys thank you for taking my questions the first question is on slide 7 one of the comments there was that there is going to be some buffer stock built just to avoid disruption i mean john how does that kind of play into the opportunity for working capital improvement and then also in that same sentence i think it talks about new facilities coming online i m just curious are these actually new facilities that are being brought on or is it just new capacity within existing facilities john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer let me answer the specific question first and i will ask gary to kind of elaborate on how the process is working and from a strategy standpoint but the specific comment around inventory was really more of an intra year sort of a comment so for example we re in a process in north america we have a project going on right now where we re getting ready to bring some capacity online and in the facilities that we believe will be impacted by that in terms of being taken offline of course one of the strategies before you do that is to build a little extra stock before you take the old facility offline sp i would consider that more of an intra year type of move as opposed to something that would impact a full year working capital but do you want to elaborate on that gary s michel president and chief executive officer yeah so one of the things that we wanted to make sure in the certainly in the early phases of this project is that we made sure that our new facilities that come online are at full capacity and fully able to handle customer demand as well before we take latent capacity offline so we are just trying to take a go slow to go fast approach in the first phases with that being said we ve got we re building a lot of standard work we re building a little bit of as john said inventory to buffer that but overall really just looking to make sure that we don t affect our ability to deliver for customers as we re making these transfers john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay got it thank you and then second question is you guys talked about a shift or somewhat of a shift from distribution to retail can you just help us kind of think about the margin differential between distribution and retail channels john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer it s certainly the margin profile in north america of retail versus traditional is pretty significant i would say it s largely due to the nature of what s being bought in the two channels so in the retail channel we sell a much higher proportion of stock goods as opposed to make to order or special order goods by nature that s going to be a lower margin profile and on the flipside traditional distribution we re going to see a higher percentage of special order or make to order type products which is going to carry a higher profile so it s sort of less about one channel being structurally less profitable than the other or anything like that it s just more about the mix of what s going through those channels we haven t disclosed margins by channel but it is a pretty significant shift obviously enough to move our margins here in the fourth quarter in north america yeah and you look at some of our new product launches and the things that we re doing particularly what was shown in ibs you will see that the types of products that we re launching and where we launched them in both of the channels also have an effect on shaping that demand and shaping that margin picture so we re always looking to improve both the mix within the channel as well as the mix across the channels john lovallo bank of america merrill lynch analyst okay thank you guys john linker executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you operator we have no further questions in queue i will turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks gary s michel president and chief executive officer i d like to thank you all for joining us today we delivered our guidance for ebitda in the fourth quarter we re looking good for 2019 and we

investor relations section of our website at ir leidos com with that i ll turn the call over to roger krone roger a krone chairman chief executive officer thank you kelly and thank you all for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018 earnings conference call 2018 was a continuation of our great execution and was a year of transition as we pivoted the organization to focus on growth we saw many successes and i am proud of our employees for driving these achievements the government shutdown had a negligible effect on our fourth quarter results and is expected to have an immaterial effect to our first quarter 2019 results as well now i d like to start this morning by discussing four key highlights from our results bookings growth profitability and cash generation before focusing on what we see going forward in 2019 and beyond first 2018 was a record year for us in bookings and backlog we booked 13 7 billion in net awards into backlog resulting in a 1 3 book to bill for the year and a record backlog of 20 8 billion these bookings along with other single award idiq positions we won will drive our growth this year and beyond the strong momentum in our business development results has continued into 2019 with nasa s recent award of the nasa end user services technology program to leidos this is new work for us a competitive takeaway furthering our market share gains although it is still subject to a protest nest is a single award firm fixed price idiq contract with a potential value of 2 9 billion over 10 years second in terms of growth the improving win rates and ramp of revenues from our new awards allowed us to close out the year on a strong note with year over year revenue growth in q4 at the highest pace we ve had in two years for the third quarter in a row revenues grew year over year as new awards increasingly contribute to the expansion of our base business third profitability was also a highlight for the year as we again exceeded our target of 10 or higher for long term adjusted ebitda margin and delivered margins of 10 4 for the year we continue to balance margin and growth as we drive to our long term targets in both areas with revenue growth of 3 or more while maintaining adjusted ebitda margins at 10 or higher finally we continue to maximize the cash generated from the organization through the fourth quarter for 2018 we generated more than three quarters of a billion dollars of operating cash flow a 46 increase from the prior year s level despite the revenue growth in the fourth quarter driving cash collections from the business is truly a cross functional effort these results show that our teams across the organization did a great job in driving cash conversion throughout the year and continuing into the fourth quarter we benefited from many initiatives to monetize our balance sheet we will continue to explore additional such opportunities in 2019 cash generation is important and smart deployment of that cash is essential to driving shareholder value in 2018 our performance allowed us to return over 600 million to our shareholders or nearly 90 of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases we returned 200 million to our shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and nearly 420 million in share repurchases which allowed us to retire 6 5 million shares during the year we also repaid 59 million of debt these actions are consistent with our stated capital deployment philosophy now we look forward to 2019 as we are focused on accelerating growth while continuing to execute our book of business to drive this growth we will leverage the strong defense budget and outlays ramp ups from our new program wins and a strong pipeline of submitted bids waiting decisions we ve entered the year with roughly 28 billion of bids outstanding this pipeline includes several multi billion dollar bids such as our department of energy hanford mission support contract recompete our disa global solutions management operations program recompete as well as the nasa nest bid which i mentioned earlier we re also submitting proposals on several other large new business and takeaway bids during 2019 and expect decisions by many of these large programs during the year we ve analyzed what s driven our improving win rates and our success in capturing new work while it s clear that no single factor has led to this success the three most prevalent areas are the strength of our technical solution the competitiveness of our cost structure and our past performance credentials all made possible by our talented and dedicated employees further it s clear that customers have confidence in our ability to solve their large complex problems because of our size scale and depth we continue to strengthen across all of these areas including investing in our internal r d so we can offer increasingly advanced technical solutions one particular area where we have seen strong customer enthusiasm is in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning these technologies drive efficiencies in our customers mission through automation and also provide deep analytical insight at speed we also invest in aiml security to make all of our data rich information technology offerings the most reliable and secure in the industry our aiml capabilities have already been instrumental to several recent program wins with our defense and intelligence customers with our anticipated growth we ll need more people to join the company i m pleased to say we have seen improvement in our hiring statistics as our recruiting and hr teams had implemented innovative methods to improve our success and efficiency in hiring new employees as well as improved retention rates of our existing employees we are also optimistic on the potential for a more efficient security clearance process with a renewed focus on this effort by the department of defense which recently assumed the function from the office of personnel management when in place this increased efficiency will mean that our employees spend less time waiting to start work on classified programs refining the process is a complex undertaking that will take time to implement but we are encouraged by the initial progress now we all continue to watch what is going on in the federal government we are pleased with the last week s budget agreement that averts another shutdown even a partial shutdown impacts a broad array of vital government services that touch millions of americans and impacts the important mission of our customers while there is still uncertainty on the debt ceiling limits and the sequester caps we remain optimistic about the actual budgets that will be agreed upon and the spending priorities in government fiscal 2020 and beyond as we analyze the budgetary activity beyond the headlines we re encouraged that the government spending priorities align well with our strategy and our areas of technical strength keeping us well positioned to drive growth finally i m pleased to announce that we have set may 14 as the date of our investor day which will be held in new york city as well as being webcast the leadership team and i look forward to sharing our vision for the company and more details about our strategy at the event i hope you will find time to join us with that i ll turn the call over to jim reagan our chief financial officer for more details on our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook james reagan chief financial officer thank you roger and thanks everyone for joining us today we re pleased with our full year 2018 results and i ll start by highlighting a few of our accomplishments for the fourth quarter and the full year fourth quarter revenues increased 5 2 from the prior year and 2 8 sequentially our third consecutive quarter of growth and another proof point in our growth trajectory in 2018 our adjusted ebitda margins of 10 4 again exceeded our long term target of 10 or higher fourth quarter margins were 9 7 in line with our expectations and reflects typical seasonality in the margin profile due to a higher proportion of materials revenues compared with other quarters this strong operational performance coupled with lower than expected tax rate drove a non gaap diluted eps of 1 10 in the quarter non gaap diluted eps for the year was 4 38 at the upper end of our guidance range operating cash flows for the full year of 768 million increased 46 from the prior year and resulted in a 104 free cash flow conversion of non gaap net income in line with our long term goal the slight miss versus our guidance target was driven by unexpected timing slips in the fourth quarter due to year end payment system transitions at a couple of our key customers during the fourth quarter we continued to monetize our balance sheet by selling our old headquarters building in san diego for net proceeds of 79 million the cash proceeds from this were received and recognized in two tranches 14 million in financing inflows in q4 of 18 and 65 million in investing in flows that will be in q1 of 2019 in addition just after the close of the year we also closed on the sale of the old is gs headquarters in gaithersburg for 31 million proceeds will be recognized as a cash flow from investing item during the first quarter of 2019 and these two transactions are an extension of our focus on monetizing non core assets and increasing our return on invested capital now let me share some comments on our segment results revenues in the defense solutions segment increased 3 6 in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period driving the third consecutive quarter of growth in the business this growth largely reflects new program activity that expands our revenue base non gaap operating margins in our defense solutions segment decreased 160 basis points from the prior year quarter to 7 7 reflecting a lower level of net profit write ups now as a reminder there s typically a fair amount of variability in the quarterly timing of profit write ups for the full year the segment s margins were 8 4 flat with the prior year reflecting a similar level of profit write ups awards activity was a highlight in the defense solutions segment net bookings were over 7 billion in 2018 a 56 increase from 2017 book to bill for the year was 1 4 a substantial increase over the prior year level of 0 9 in our civil segment the new program wins and on contract growth contributed notably to fourth quarter results driving revenue growth of 3 6 over the prior year period the start up of new programs was the primary cause of the roughly 100 basis point decline in non gaap operating margins to 9 7 overall we are pleased in the growth in this business and are confident in our ability to drive margins higher over time in this segment bookings in our civil business increased in the fourth quarter with roughly 1 billion in net bookings which resulted in a 1 1 book to bill for the quarter and 1 0 for the year turning now to our health segment fourth quarter results were again very strong across all metrics revenue growth margins and bookings revenue grew nearly 13 over the prior year and roughly 12 sequentially this growth largely reflects the slippage of some revenues from the third quarter into the fourth quarter as we discussed in our third quarter call margins in our health business expanded in tandem with the revenue growth non gaap operating income margins of 16 1 in the fourth quarter increased more than 400 basis points from the prior year and 190 basis points sequentially for the full year non gaap operating margins of 15 2 increased 30 basis points from the prior year the margin expansion reflects a greater mix of on contract growth in certain quick turn fixed unit price contracts the health segment also had a very strong year in awards activity with full year net bookings of 3 2 billion roughly 75 higher than the prior year level resulting in a 1 7x book to bill for the year during the fourth quarter we booked 1 1 billion into backlog in the health segment resulting in a book to bill of 2 2 overall all of our businesses demonstrated solid progress in the fourth quarter toward our growth targets and we expect all segments to grow in 2019 but before i talk about 2019 guidance i want to comment on the government shutdown and its impacts to our business for fiscal year 2018 the shutdown was in effect for four working days at the very end of the year where we typically see heavy vacation usage so there was minimal impact to our business the shutdown did however force the closure of the committee on foreign investments in the united states or cfius which was the last approval needed to allow for the closure of our commercial cyber sale we continue to work the process and we expect that deal to close within the first quarter of 2019 for 2019 the shutdown impacts to our business are also relatively immaterial but given the volume of questions we ve received on this i ll provide some context first we estimate our aggregate revenue impact resulting from the shutdown to be approximately 11 million this effect is largely isolated to our civil segment where some of our work for the faa and the department of homeland security were deemed nonessential causing us to furlough some employees we realize the effect that this had on those employees and it was not a step taken lightly we may be able to recover some of this revenue loss throughout the year but it is too early to estimate any recovery now the shutdown also caused some delays in the billing and collections cycle as well as with award decisions but these effects are more timing related and we don t expect any permanent impacts to our business from those delays now on to our guidance for 2019 we expect revenue in the range of 10 5 billion to 10 9 billion reflecting growth of 3 to 7 from 2018 we expect 2019 to be a year in which we will exceed our 3 long term revenue target growth due to the strength of our backlog entering the year and our focus on driving on contract growth and winning new business throughout the year although we do not guide on a quarterly basis i would like to provide some context on the quarterly phasing of revenues for the year and particularly for the first quarter similar to 2018 we expect revenues to build sequentially throughout the year starting from a low point in the first quarter historically q1 revenues decline sequentially due to the lower level of material volumes compared to q4 this year however we expect a greater sequential decline in the high single digit range due to the combined effects of low materials buying in the first quarter program transitions in our health segment and the shutdown from the first quarter low however we expect revenues to grow sequentially throughout the year and to drive to our full year revenue guidance we expect adjusted ebitda margins of 9 9 to 10 1 for the year a slight decrease compared to 2018 and as we ve said in the past there is a trade off between margin and revenue growth and the ramp up of our new awards will drive slightly lower margin levels in the near term we expect non gaap eps between 4 25 and 4 60 we expect operating cash flow of at least 725 million a slight increase from 2018 levels after adjusting for the interest rate swap monetization and the unusually low cash tax rate we experienced in 2018 following the fourth quarter sale of our san diego building we will move into the more material phase of our real estate consolidation activities in 2019 we will continue to streamline our footprint and reduce owned facilities allowing us to work more efficiently and increase the level of collaboration across our functions as a result of these actions we expect a lot of moving parts to the different components of our cash flow statement this year so we ve added a slide slide 10 in our earnings deck which is available on our website to help you with some of the details some of the real estate actions increased capex and therefore reduced the free cash flow metric while others resulted in inflows in cash in investing and financing activities at the end of the day the net of all of our balance sheet monetization activities and our real estate investments will yield a positive cash inflow for the company and we will continue to deploy our excess cash from those transactions consistent with our stated capital deployment plan all that said we expect 2019 capital expenditures of between 135 million and 140 million roughly 60 million of that is related to real estate investments and leasehold improvements which will drive better asset utilization as we ve said earlier between the san diego and gaithersburg real estate sales we have already closed on transactions that will drive 95 million in inflows to cash from investing in the first quarter these inflows will more than offset the one time 60 million capex item that i referred to earlier beyond leaning out our real estate portfolio we will continue to look for opportunities to monetize the balance sheet which increases our flexibility and drives value for our shareholders now a couple of other comments to help you with modeling 2019 we expect net interest expense between 135 million to 140 million and a non gaap tax rate between 23 and 24 to wrap up we closed the year on strong footing we generated over three quarters of 1 billion of cash from operations our margins were again over target for the second year in a row and we exited the year with a revenue growth rate of 5 2 and record backlog we remain focused on continuing this momentum into 2019 by driving profitable growth and generating cash to drive long term value with that i ll turn the call over to kevin so we can take some questions questions and answers operator thank you we ll now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question today is coming from cai von rumohr from cowen and company your line is now live cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst yes thank you very much good quarter maybe you can help us understand like what is in your guide for 2019 does it include anything for nest does it include the commercial cyber business that you hope to close and then maybe some color on the adjusted ebitda margin which looks like it s at the bottom of your expectations james reagan chief financial officer good morning cai thanks for joining us yeah first the guide does include our expectations for the ramp up of nasa nest the guide does not include the commercial cyber business and in terms of our ebitda margin expectations for the year it reflects the fact that in 2019 we ve got a number of programs the army corps of engineers program nasa nest just to name a couple of them where the ramp up of those programs typically has lower margins than for the life of the program and we ve been historically pretty conservative in setting those profit take up levels early in the program as we plan on some contingencies as programs reach the end of their lives and we start to wind them down that s typically when you get more liquidation of risk and we pick up some write ups as you ve seen us historically have in the past cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst terrific and then for a last one maybe update us on where you are with genesis roger a krone chairman chief executive officer great cai i ll be happy to take that one we re really pleased with the program our relationship with the customer solid support in dha for moving forward a lot of enthusiasm over what s happened to the ioc sites and how we ve learned from our initial deployments we have agreement on a full schedule for deployments we re currently working on what we call wave 1 we ve identified the different groups of hospitals we re going to deploy to we expect wave 1 to go live in the fall the next wave not to confuse you is actually going to be wave 4 and we ll expect to start that later in the year and then we should be running a new wave about every six months and at any one time we will be in deployment of two waves concurrently a lot of great discussions with our customers we ve got agreement on the go forward plan we should be fully deployed by 2025 and cai as you know the program is expected to extend to about excuse me 2023 fully deployed and the program runs through 2025 i know you ve often asked in the past about sort of a ramp up in revenues and we expect to see that this year that maybe will give us sort of a point at the top line something like that and again very enthusiastic about the program a great relationship with our customer at dha there a strong commitment to put this technology in place to increase the healthcare for our active military cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst thank you very much operator our next question is coming from krishna sinha from vertical research partners your line is now live krishna sinha vertical research partners analyst hi thank you on your operating cash flow guidance for the year obviously i see the slide about the real estate but i m just talking about the operating cash flow can you just give us some puts and takes there about what you re expecting what s not being included or not recurring from 2018 to 2019 and just kind of what we can expect from the forward trajectory maybe beyond 2019 in terms of cash flow for the business on an underlying basis james reagan chief financial officer sure krishna thanks for the question the two big things that occurred in 2018 which are not recurring in 2019 and that s reflected in the go forward guide first as part of monetizing the balance sheet we took 60 million of cash for interest rate swaps that we could monetize in conjunction with extending the term of our term loan facility the second thing is we had some opportunities to monetize some deferred tax assets now these were tax assets that were fully reserved anyway but that was 65 million of cash that we pulled in that s also reflected in the gaap effective tax rate of about 4 5 so those things aren t recurring although we re always looking for opportunities to improve on our tax rate so those are the big things and then there are also a couple of items and they are primarily program related one of the large contracts that we just won will require us to buy some assets and that s a roughly 40 million cash flow headwind that we will end up recouping over the life of the program krishna sinha vertical research partners analyst that s great thank you james reagan chief financial officer sure operator thank you our next question is coming from robert spingarn from credit suisse your line is now live robert spingarn credit suisse analyst good morning roger a krone chairman chief executive officer good morning robert spingarn credit suisse analyst i wanted to ask a high level question about the guidance from a segment perspective in other words how are you thinking about the growth across the segments and then the same for the margins and this has to do with just some of the movement that we see in 2018 especially sequentially with regard to margin so jim if you could give us some understanding some color there by segment james reagan chief financial officer sure well rob i ll remind you we don t guide by segment but what i can give you is some color on is first of all because we re expecting all of the segments to be growing with some fairly large program wins as i mentioned when i was answering cai s question some of these larger programs tend to have margin profiles that ramp up as we increase the operating efficiency of these contracts we re probably expecting a little bit more growth in the health segment and in the defense segment as compared to the other segments of the business because of the large program wins that we ve had and the pace of the ramp up in both defense and in health as roger mentioned we re getting a full point of growth just off of the dhmsm program so i think that that helps you with kind of setting up what the growth profile is like of the segments robert spingarn credit suisse analyst and what are the biggest swings in your revenue guide that 400 million program wise or how do we think about what you re assuming at the low and high end james reagan chief financial officer well i think what i am understanding you re wondering well what could give rise to the low end what could give rise to the high end well robert spingarn credit suisse analyst yeah the 10 5 billion versus the 10 9 billion james reagan chief financial officer yeah we ve got a lot of bids that are 28 billion of bids outstanding at the end of the year one of them we ve already pulled in from bids outstanding and into backlog and that s the nasa nest program which was a takeaway meaning it s obviously additive to our growth profile that s reflected in our guide and i think the high end would be achieved if we kind of ran the table on the big ones and set us up for a 2020 that is growing at or potentially above what we re guiding to now on the low end it would be a significant drop in our win rates for the last year we ve been experiencing win rates that reflect first the very competitive cost position that is now showing up in the velocity of new awards the second it is we have a well defined set of technical differentiators that is probably more prominent in our win rates than the cost competitiveness and third the efficiency of our business development process is not only yielding great technical scores but it is reducing the cost that we need to put into winning x dollars of new backlog so those three things are really bearing out what i think gives us the confidence of at least the midpoint of our revenue guide if not a little bit more roger a krone chairman chief executive officer hey rob it s roger just a quick follow up on the nasa program we re still in that kind of unique period between announcement and debrief and the protest period so we have a couple more days to go to see whether one of the competitors is going to file a protest so we haven t exactly booked that into backlog yet and when we do it s a single award idiq and we ll probably book the first task order just so that people don t go out and put 2 9 billion in backlog it s probably likely in the quarter of in the hundreds of millions not in the billions but just as a technical point i wanted to make sure that i was clear in my comments that it s still subject to protest thanks robert spingarn credit suisse analyst and roger just on the back of that are there any specific awards that you would call out as being within the revenue synergies that at the time of the deal you weren t yet ready to talk about but now a few years in here what are you seeing revenue synergy wise roger a krone chairman chief executive officer well rob that s a great question it s one we haven t had for a while nasa nest is clearly won that is a program that really has come out of capabilities that came across in the merger with is gs and the combination of some of the things that we have done on the technology side and the cyber and the relationship that is gs had with the end user at nasa as part of that i would say i think our probability of win on hanford is enhanced by bringing the company together clearly that was a heritage is gs contract but i think we added more innovation in our offering you can look at navy next gen i think with the same view a program we might or might not have bid as stand alone leidos but clearly felt we had a compelling offering to bring forward to the program and just to kind of round out the sens3 program and the department of homeland security one that we won last year i think i would put in synergy we won an abis contract which is an army biometrics win which is a collection of sort of it and technology to be able to recognize individuals based upon biometrics and there s a whole host of classified wins i talked to aiml in my comments and that has been of particular interest in the intelligence community and it s led to some wins there as well so really a lot of again we don t talk a lot about synergy but a lot of cross linkages of the two business and a lot of strength in things that we can go after that we couldn t have gone before and then overall increasing our inaudible robert spingarn credit suisse analyst thank you both roger a krone chairman chief executive officer thank you rob operator thank you operator instructions our next question is coming from jon raviv from citi your line is now live jon raviv citigroup analyst hey good morning roger a krone chairman chief executive officer good morning jon raviv citigroup analyst jim can you just walk us through just some of a little bit more on the risks and opportunities in this year s sales guidance and i m thinking about it specifically in relation to a year ago where obviously fell a bit short in 2018 i just want to make sure that the bias is really more to the upside in this year s guidance versus last year s guidance thank you james reagan chief financial officer sure well we always like to hit the guidance down the middle of the fairway the nasa nest win certainly gives us a little bit more confidence as it s yet another takeaway win which builds the revenue volume and adds to our growth so just to put a little bit more color on my comments of just a minute ago i will repeat continuing to run at high win rates on takeaway and new business work new contract awards that are kind of new to our peer group that s one and we continue to see really great results in win rates that reflect the execution in our business development teams going back to kind of what are the things that could be a dampener of our growth rate and that would be if the clearance process slows down or if the handoff from opm to dod doesn t go as i think dod or we would expect i think that that could be one risk factor to revenue growth and then the second one would be kind of a change in the success that we ve been experiencing in business development that and our hiring processes so far we re pleased with what we re seeing out of our recruiting teams but if the labor market has a sudden tightening from where we see it today that could slowdown down our ability to hire people needed to execute on contract backlog jon raviv citigroup analyst okay and then in terms of some of the bigger recompetes this year can you just potentially give a little more color perhaps even quantify some of that exposure in terms of sales but also in terms of profits the docs make it look like hanford big on sales but doesn t add much income could you just level set us on those please james reagan chief financial officer yeah you just mentioned hanford and probably the other large recompete that we have is gsm o which we don t disclose the dollar values of both the revenue run rate or the margin details at the contract level but clearly gsm o would be one that we re planning on rewinning and if we get surprised on that one that could be a dampener not so much for 2019 though but more for 2020 that contract regardless of the outcome is going to continue to run well into 2019 for us jon raviv citigroup analyst thanks i ll stick to the two james reagan chief financial officer okay thanks jon operator thank you our next question is coming from noah poponak from goldman sachs your line is now live gavin parsons goldman sachs analyst hey good morning everyone it s gavin on for noah roger a krone chairman chief executive officer hey gavin james reagan chief financial officer hey gavin gavin parsons goldman sachs analyst hey guys nice to see bookings strength translating to revenue growth but i think the margin pressure is kind of right in line with that 10 plus you re talking about which maybe seems like a lot of pressure just on the rate of growth you re experiencing so i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your strategy to grow ebitda dollars and roger i appreciate the color that earlier on the contracts have lower margins and later on you can book them at a higher margin but whether or not these will be accretive on average over the life of the contracts and how you think about bidding when the margin initially is this low roger a krone chairman chief executive officer okay complex question let me see if i can unpack it a little bit and then i ll look to jim let s see we have a pipeline and we kind of filter against the pipeline and we look at the structure of a contract and our ability to generate at or our target over the life of the program we are in a fortunate position where we can decide what to bid and what not to bid we ve talked in the past about staying away from what we used to call lowest price technically acceptable because it traditionally has lower margin and frankly it s probably not the work that we are best equipped to do we become more interested in a program where we can create a point of difference through our discriminators our technology our cost structure and our size and as such we hope over the life of the program right to be accretive to our long term ebitda margin i think it was jon who talked about hanford there are some programs just by their nature are going to be lower hanford is one of them has always been that particular customer just views the programs differently hanford is a very important program to us we use it for a lot of past performance quals it s a hugely important program for the nation and cleaning up the 600 square mile site in southeast washington is really really important work but generally we are looking at the portfolio and the pipeline with an eye to 10 or better on ebitda i think you reemphasized is that often when we get started we are more thoughtful about our booking rate and how we ramp up and if programs are going to have transition issues it s usually in the first year or so so it behooves us and i think everyone in the industry does that to be more thoughtful about our earnings rate in the early contract but because of our technological differentiators we have the luxury to go after higher value added work which typically carries more margin with it gavin parsons goldman sachs analyst got it and then roger you talked about the dod budget aligning well with your portfolio can you give us a little bit more color on kind of how you d expect those priorities to go between hardware and kind of your addressable market roger a krone chairman chief executive officer well secretary shanahan is in i think in the first year or two they were looking at operational capability rate and getting the fleet and other hardware back up to a higher operational tempo we certainly benefited from that they are now focused toward buying end items ships and tanks and airplanes but not necessarily at the expense of their operational tempo but what really excites me is the digital transformation that s going on not only in the department of defense but across federal space writ large they have gotten to operate more efficiency to open up more sort of obligation authority to buy hardware and to pay troops and to defend the country and that s right in our sweet spot we re really really good at digital transformation move to the cloud software defined networks and that gets us excited but we re also seeing a bit of a shift in how i think the department views the threat and a lot of discussion if you read the national security strategy is what we call the physical and the kinetic threat is still important but the virtual threat is becoming even more important what s going on in cyberspace some of the newer technologies and that fits really well with where we are we re not necessarily a company that builds tanks and big aircraft carriers and things like that we are much more in the soft technologies software cyber areas like that electronic warfare and we see increased spending in those areas gavin parsons goldman sachs analyst thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from greg konrad from jefferies your line is now live greg konrad jefferies analyst a really strong booking year and quarter can you maybe talk about some of the initiatives outside of dhmsm in place that s supporting both the improvement in bookings and the revenue outlook for next year roger a krone chairman chief executive officer yeah i think so so this is roger and if you ve been following our story for a while you know that about two years ago we had lost some programs that we thought were franchise and it really caused us to go back and look at our whole business development process from cradle to grave and we looked at what we call our win plan how we write proposals the staff that we had how we view the competitive discriminators and as we ve said frankly often on this call over the past several quarters we kind of started over and we took a clean sheet and gerry fasano and now roy stevens in business development and we looked at why we were winning and why we were losing and how we presented our competitive discriminators even down to what bids that we were bidding on and whether we really felt we had a compelling point of difference on those bids and i would say i think we ve gotten better across the board better in identifying the opportunity putting it in the pipeline working early in the bid process with the customer to understand what their compelling needs actually were and then just the way we go about actually structuring and writing a proposal how we deal with the proposal center how well we represent our capabilities in between the front cover and the back cover of the proposal another point that we made that s really all the way through this journey from the acquisition is there was i think a thought that is gs the lockheed business had become less cost competitive in some of the bids that they had made kind of being tucked inside a large oem and we had huge emphasis on bringing their overhead and sg a therefore their wrap rates down to where we had been historically and we look at our wins and our losses we do a lot of forensics and i wouldn t say we have not lost any bids based upon price but the number of bids that we have lost based upon our cost structure is down to just a very and so we are pleased with how we have used our cost structure to solve that problem and that has allowed us to focus on superior technical offerings that create a point of difference for the customer greg konrad jefferies analyst thank you and just a follow up on your commentary around employees and employment is there any way to think about headcount growth for the year and are you seeing any signs of any type of wage inflation james reagan chief financial officer yeah greg we don t provide headcount targets i can tell you that compared to what our internal targets are we re doing well in growing our direct employees compared to our plan and then the other thing on wage inflation we do put a plan in place for growth in in market salaries that is consistent with the benchmarks that we see published externally and so far we re not seeing any pressure on those assumptions that we have in our plan the market is obviously pretty competitive for the kinds of people we are hiring but given our scale and given the breadth of different things that people can work on here and a competitive salary and benefit structure so far we re able to achieve our hiring numbers operator thank you our next question today is coming from rick eskelsen from wells fargo securities your line is now live richard eskelsen wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning thank you for taking my question just to clarify on the guidance commentary for the dhmsm contract it s 1 point to growth throughout the guidance or is it a 1 point addition at the high end and then also can you talk about any grow over amount for the commercial cyber which i believe you said was not in the forward guidance thank you james reagan chief financial officer thank you yeah so the way first of all we think about dhmsm is that 1 point of growth is inclusive of the our guidance implies 5 growth that number includes roughly a point for our dhmsm the second point to commercial cyber the commercial cyber number that midpoint of growth would be higher if you back the commercial cyber number out of our 2018 results but at this point we have to keep those numbers confidential for terms of our agreement with the buyer richard eskelsen wells fargo securities analyst thank you operator your next question is coming from tobey summer from suntrust your line is now live tobey summer suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks with respect to your comment on the budget and having a constructive outlook does your commentary for the defense and intelligence budget hold true for the whole budget including civil and could you comment if currencies take a little bit of the edge off of your revenue growth guidance for 19 roger a krone chairman chief executive officer i ll do the first one i think that was a foreign exchange question on the second one let s see here s a comment that i want to make sure everybody understands is that so i think we re all comfortable with what s going on in the department of defense clearly there s been a lot of attention in what s going on in the department of homeland security we are optimistic in the parts of border security in which we operate our vacis system what we do relative to vehicle inspections we believe that has a significant role to play in the vision of this government in securing the borders and so not only are we pleased with what we re seeing out of the department of defense in those areas in our civil business where we have visibility into the budget we are also quite pleased we think there was a large amount of fentanyl that was used at the border a couple of weeks ago and it is those technologies which we think we will be able to provide to the government and they will fuel our top line growth by the way we kind of feel the same way about what s going on in doe and faa and a lot of the other civil organizations james reagan chief financial officer yeah and then relative to the currency question we don t see currency as being a material headwind or tailwind for 2019 there was a little bit of a headwind in 2018 but i wouldn t call it material with respect to the overall number just a reminder that international or foreign denominated contracts are roughly 10 of our overall business operator thank you our next question is coming from joseph denardi from stifel your line is now live joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst yeah good morning jim i think you ve talked in the past a little bit about your m a focus and not having much of a desire just to acquire pure play services businesses and maybe want to increase your exposure to products and hardware i m wondering if that means looking at services business that may have a product or hardware component to them or whether you d be willing to acquire kind of or look at pure play hardware and products businesses james reagan chief financial officer joe great question and the short answer to both parts of your question is yes for us we have less interest in a pure play services business especially one that looks in terms of its customer footprint a lot like us we don t need more of what we ve got we can compete and expand the business that we have just fine on our own the things that we re looking for to build the company inorganically would be the kind of company with both the services and a product differentiator that bolts in well with the kind of work that both the target company and we do a pure product company could also be of interest to us although i would say that the ones that we ve been interested in to this point tends to have some kind of service element to them but i wouldn t say that we re not interested in i wouldn t say we d shy away from a pure product business if it was strategically if it fit our strategic criteria operator thank you our next question is a follow up from jon raviv from citi your line is now live jon raviv citigroup analyst hi thanks for taking the follow up roger in your prepared remarks you had mentioned 2019 and beyond could you talk a little bit more about that beyond by any chance maybe a small preview for the event in may especially now that the combination is done roger a krone chairman chief executive officer a little bit is we kind of came out of the merger and we talked about 3 growth and 10 and of course now we re printing a little bit better than that as you know we are a long cycle business and with 28 billion if you take the 2 9 billion out for nasa nest 25 billion in unawarded most of that is going to impact beyond 2019 the way things work if they make an award to us this year we ramp up you really don t see those revenues until 2020 and beyond and as excited as we are about 2019 if you just run your model as we do and you ll run similar models you can see that that the submits unawarded is going to have a larger impact on 2020 than it will on 2019 and it s the government s need for the types of solutions that we provide that gives us enthusiasm about the future and our strong balance sheet and cash conversion gives us the currency if you will to invest in the future and to grow the business and so as excited as i was five years ago when i came excited and as excited as i was about the merger with is gs i look at the budget prospects and the needs of the government and 2019 is going to be year for us but i think 2020 will be even better james reagan chief financial officer yeah and to pile on there jon about two thirds of our pipeline is either new work or what i call opb other people s business and so with two thirds of that representing things that are other than just keeping and recompeting our existing work to roger s point i think the profile of the pipeline certainly speaks well for some growth opportunity operator thank you our next question is a follow up from krishna sinha from vertical research partners your line is now live krishna sinha vertical research partners analyst i just wanted to get an update on capital deployment obviously you ve made some comments that you re just going to try and maintain the dividend at a kind of steady rate but just focusing more on the buybacks and the m a opportunity and how you re thinking about those in 2019 are you close to any sort of bolt on deals or have any in the pipe that you think could close within the next 12 months that we should be aware of or since you d be generating cash here should we think about the buyback sort of staying at this pretty high cadence that you ve been generating in the last two quarters james reagan chief financial officer yeah krishna i think that if you compare where we sit today and looking at the m a pipeline i wouldn t say anything different about it compared to what i said last quarter or the quarter before that we ve got an m a team internally that is looking at ideas that are consistent with our strategy but we re very focused on doing good deals not just deals for the sake of prosecuting a pipeline so a couple of other factors that i would point out to answer your question we re very comfortable with our leverage today and we have plenty of dry powder and ability to take on more leverage particularly today s rates to buy the right kinds of assets but with that said we re also not going to sit around waiting for something to come under contract before we make a decision on whether to deploy so you could see a year we could be looking back on 2019 as being a year when we made a couple of acquisitions or an acquisition but we also were able to deploy capital with some buyback and the normal level of debt buyback operator thank you our next question is coming from joseph denardi from stifel your line is now live joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst yeah my follow up was going to be if roger you can just talk about the sensitivity to a cr in 2020 and maybe just the mechanics of how that would look i think kind of the impact to spending would be more pronounced because the budget would get set at the sequestration level whereas fy 19 just got set at fy 18 s level so maybe i m wrong can you just kind of walk us through what your expectations there would be if there is a cr to start fy 20 i know it s a long way away but just want to get your thoughts thank you roger a krone chairman chief executive officer joe you have it just about right if we end up with a cr we could snap back and if we don t do this right we could be back to the sequester caps and i touched on that in my remarks i m not the best person to predict what s going to happen in the government i will tell you i have been encouraged by what the department of defense has done and their ability to cross the river and talk to the hill and to explain to our elected officials how important it is to get a budget i ve been optimistic before about the ability of the department to actually get a budget passed i m also optimistic moving into what is going to be a presidential election season that people are not going to be distracted by a continuing resolution which snaps us back to the sequester caps and requires the department to curtail programs and so if i was up funded ph i would tell you i think it s more likely that we re going to get some kind of a negotiation and we will get a budget rather than a cr but the mechanics of what happens in a cr you have about right and if we win all the way back to the sequester caps i think the department would have to take some significant measures to be able to get their budgets back underneath that as you know once they start spending on aircraft carriers and f 35s and things there is a future bill to be paid and when they commit to like a bulk buy of two aircraft carriers that s with the assumption that they re going to get most of what they ask for in their budget request in the future if you snap the budget back to sequester caps they re already committed to build those aircraft carriers and it creates a real planning dilemma for the department and because of that because i think our elected officials understand the importance of defending the country and they don t want this to become a topic in the presidential debate i think we ll probably end up with a budget operator thank you we ve reached end of our question and answer session i d like to turn the floor back over to kelly for any further closing comments kelly hernandez senior vice president of

t boone picken s little green deal remembering a stillborn crony scheme by robert bradley jr february 19 2019 mr pickens s original vision had something for everyone first he would build a wind farm in texas with 2 700 turbines costing upward of 10 billion that would pump power into the national grid allowing huge amounts of natural gas to be diverted from power plants to newly equipped cars and trucks the result he promised would be a sharp reduction in the country s dependence on middle east crude this to me is like a war without guns says mr pickens neil king pickens s windmills tilt against market realities wall street journal january 13 2009 a decade ago a rent seeking vainglorious texas oil man named t boone pickens spent tens of millions of dollars to promote what today might be called the little green deal it was nicely summarized in the wall street journal at the time by neil king pickens s windmills tilt against market realities subtitled texas oilman s plan for renewable energy faces strong headwinds as oil prices subside and the credit crisis makes landfall king s feature is worth revisiting as one of many strands of what today has evolved into a socialist totalitarian hodgepodge know as the green new deal there are many lessons to be learned from t boone s ill fated expensive distracting venture here are several industry cronyism from ken lay to t boone to james e rogers gave the progressive left plenty of cover to get going and incrementally get to where they are now green new deal et al the old energy security argument against oil imports long considered a market failure never strong was refuted by the very ingenuity that t boone himself was incapable of comprehending bad ideas have many roots even from those who would otherwise extol the virtues of free markets and competition neil king s 1 400 word article from 2009 follows to get the full flavor of pickens s mega ego and the scheme itself he boasts his own self declared army and the support of 13 governors 53 congressmen and 180 mayors along with the sierra club and the american lung association he has plugged his cause on countless news shows and spent 60 million of his own money on a massive ad spree now t boone pickens is about to find out which has more oomph all of the above or a 100 drop in the price of oil the flinty dallas billionaire is going all out to sell lawmakers and the next administration on his plan to wean the u s off middle east oil by ramping up the use of wind power and natural gas trouble is energy markets and a fair share of skeptics keep tilting against him when the 80 year old oil magnate launched his vaunted pickens plan on july 8 crude oil was at 136 a barrel and rising crude has since slumped to below 40 a barrel as have public concerns over oil supplies and the urgent need for alternatives cheap oil doesn t help says mr pickens who predicted in july that oil would never again dip below 100 a barrel it just means we have to work harder not since fellow texas oilman h ross perot dropped 65 million on his 1992 presidential quest to block the north american free trade agreement and rid the country of its national debt has any lone citizen thrown similar cash and zeal into a public cause this to me is like a war without guns says mr pickens between a flurry of meetings one recent morning in his hotel suite across from the white house the folksy oklahoma native and his much touted energy plan have hit some rough spots recently mr pickens now hopes that a last burst of advertising plus grassroots help from his growing legion of volunteers will get the new congress to turn at least parts of his plan into law he is in washington tuesday to meet with lawmakers including house speaker nancy pelosi mr pickens s original vision had something for everyone first he would build a wind farm in texas with 2 700 turbines costing upward of 10 billion that would pump power into the national grid allowing huge amounts of natural gas to be diverted from power plants to newly equipped cars and trucks the result he promised would be a sharp reduction in the country s dependence on middle east crude but the credit crunch gutted the wind project s financing putting all those turbines on hold the wind stuff is deader than hell right now he concedes by october the value of mr pickens s own equity hedge fund bp capital fell by around 60 from its peak in late june mr pickens suffered another jolt in november when california voters resoundingly defeated a ballot measure he supported to put 5 billion in bond money into promoting natural gas vehicles in the golden state mr pickens s own company clean energy fuels corp the country s largest owner of natural gas filling stations sponsored the plan and put up 19 million to back it then there was the long swoon in oil prices which have now driven fuel costs down to their lowest level in years mr pickens pitched his plan as the best way to slash the country s foreign oil tab by a third within 10 years plunging prices managed to do that work it turns out in less than six months a rangy man who still works out almost every morning mr pickens banks heavily on his own mystique for bucking adversity and making vast fortunes i have lived through 14 presidents one depression and as many booms and busts as you can imagine he says in his most recent tv spot set to air extensively in the washington area this month a lifelong republican who helped fund the swiftboat attacks on sen john kerry during the 2004 presidential campaign mr pickens took his plan first to president bush the two men met in the oval office in april the president sat and listened for an hour and a half mr pickens says and then nothing happened no call back nothing so i decided to do it myself he didn t fare much better with the two presidential nominees when he sat down with sen john mccain in august the arizona republican chastised him for trying to pick winners by so openly favoring natural gas president elect barack obama seemed more amenable when the two met in a hotel conference room in reno nev a few weeks later mr pickens sketched out his plan in series of pie charts on a white board he didn t do any back flips or anything but he did seem to like what i was saying mr pickens says mr pickens hasn t been shy about tweaking his plan to keep abreast of critics and the collapsing market he first proposed that congress mandate that all new fleet vehicles run on natural gas that went down with a loud thud among critics such as fred smith chief executive of fedex corp whose massive fleet includes 672 aircraft and more than 80 000 motorized vehicles mr smith who declined to comment argues that the best way to curb america s oil use is to convert to electric cars and delivery trucks he opposes the pickens plan s heavy focus on natural gas saying it would require onerous additions to the country s infrastructure and deepen the reliance on fossil fuels an influential group of corporate ceos and former generals that he co chairs called securing america s energy future is of the same view so mr pickens shifted his focus to the country s truckers saying that all new long haul trucks should be required to run on natural gas that didn t sit well with former kansas gov bill graves who heads the american trucking association the son of a truck operator mr graves laid out his objections over breakfast recently in mr pickens s suite many companies he noted are already turning to diesel hybrids natural gas run trucks are about a third more expensive than traditional diesel trucks nationwide filling stations for natural gas don t exist how do you just airlift in the infrastructure to make this happen he said mr pickens has recently taken to labeling his critics as un american mr graves got the full dose bill i just want to warn you on this mr pickens said putting down his fork i m going to make you look unpatriotic for supporting foreign oil i just want to make sure you understand that taken aback mr graves pointed out raspberries and croissants arrayed before them the foreign oil helped deliver the food he said we wouldn t have any of this here if our trucks hadn t delivered it he said so what s more patriotic boone since july mr pickens has logged more than 300 hours aboard his personal jet and spent five days a week outside of dallas his office says that to date word of his plan has reached 1 8 billion u s newspaper readers and tv watchers every american that is six times over mr pickens is also amassing a nationwide cadre of supporters including a pickens army of 1 3 million online adherents one such foot soldier is ryan jones a 32 year old automation student at idaho state university in pocatello the goal is to have one designated foot soldier in all 435 congressional districts mr jones who helped convert pocatello s mayor is now planning a recruitment party at the local brewery to get some people signed up he says some top lawmakers credit the pickens publicity barrage for solidifying support for updating the u s electricity grid among other things majority leader harry reid once labeled mr pickens a mortal enemy but now calls him a pal mr reid talks with mr pickens every few weeks aides say mainly to update him on energy related legislation still for all his labors mr pickens appears likely to fall short in his quest to force some mass conversion to natural gas fueled transportation anytime soon legislation now in the works top congressional aides say will probably include some tax incentives to get companies to reduce their oil consumption but not much more mr pickens promises to push on we ve been on this energy yo yo for 40 years he says we are going to pay an unbelievable price if we don t get this right

investors are selling us dollars ahead of wednesday s fomc minutes this move should not be a surprise to our readers as we talked about how the dollar is past its prime the economy is slowing and two of the most important measures for the fed retail sales and cpi retreated further last week while equity market traders were happy that another government shutdown was averted the deal in washington failed to have any meaningful impact on the dollar no one expects tomorrow s fed minutes to help the dollar because when the central bank last met they made it very clear that there will be no rate hikes anytime soon they had been talking about being patient for weeks but made it official last month by removing the reference to further gradual rate increases from their monetary policy statement this is a big shift for a central bank that just raised interest rates in december according to the fomc statement they said that in light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures they would be patient as they determine what future adjustments to interest rates would be appropriate they also removed the balance of risk assessment from their statement in in response eur usd soared to 1 15 as usdjpy broke below 109 we can t expect these same levels to be tested tomorrow but the dollar should fall as the fed minutes remind us that there is no rate hike in foreseeable future the best performing currency today was sterling which jumped more than 1 against the greenback ahead of tomorrow s meeting between may and juncker the strength of sterling throughout the brexit crisis has astounded us and today is no different although the european commission continues to say they will not accept a time limit to the backstop investors remain hopeful that a deal will be reached or an extension will be requested before the march 29th deadline juncker expects the talks to be friendly but the eu has been firm on denying changes to the withdrawal agreement and its wishful thinking to assume he will budge tomorrow the eu s strategy from day 1 is to run down the clock and force the government to accept the current deal or hold a second referendum uk data was marginally negatively for the pound which sold off initially but recovered quickly jobless claims increased but less than the previous month and while average weekly earnings held steady instead of rising like economists hoped excluding bonuses november wage growth was revised slightly upwards fundamentally the uk economy is weak and brexit uncertainty persists but technically gbp usd is exceptionally strong especially after today s move which took the pair above all major moving averages sentiment is certainly on the side of sterling bulls but if tomorrow s talks between may and juncker end with no concessions from the eu we could see gbp usd slide back below 1 30 quickly investors also bought euros but the rally was modest compared to the move in gbp while the eurozone has been plagued by softer data including this morning s german zew survey which fell to its lowest level since december 2014 and the ez s current account balance which was the weakest in 2 years the expectation component of the german zew rebounded for the fourth straight month as a measure of investor sentiment these upticks suggest that there could be light at the end of the tunnel the decline in us 10 year yields is finally outpacing the decline in german yields but the two main reasons for the euro s gains is a weaker dollar and improved risk appetite us stocks hit a fresh year to date high today lifting all the high beta currencies the us commerce department completed its confidential report on the auto industry over the weekend and no news is good news for now as president trump hasn t made any comments on car tariffs last but certainly not least it is becoming more and more likely that president trump will extend the march 1st deadline for china trade talks with the vice premier back in washington trump continues to say the talks are going well he added today that march 1st is not a magical date a lot of things can happen president trump is clearly open to extending the deadline and he even said last week that the tariffs could be removed if a deal is done while we are skeptical until an agreement is signed sealed and delivered this language is a move in the right direction aud and nzd are up on the back of trade talk optimism and another rise in dairy prices unfortunately new zealand producer prices are due for release this afternoon and the risk is to the downside after the softer than expected cpi report

has been made on us auto tariffs but european and japanese officials seem to be playing down the threat separately boj s kuroda said there was more room to lower rates or buy more assets if needed while the minutes from the reserve bank of australia confirmed the shift to a neutral stance sweden s softer than expected cpi weighed on the krona the dollar is sporting a firmer profile against most of the major and emerging market currencies global equity markets are narrowly mixed and benchmark 10 year yields are mostly a little softer gold has edged higher to trade at fresh 10 month highs while oil firms to a new three month high asia pacific bank of japan governor kuroda took a dovish tact and warned that although the yen is not targeted if yen appreciation knocks the economy more assets could be bought and rates could be lowered this would be a policy reversal insofar as the boj has been slowly reducing the amount of bonds it buys note that the generic 10 year yield has not been above zero this month and the bid cover at today s 20 year bond auction 4 67x was the strongest in five years japan s economic minister was quoted in the press playing down the likelihood of auto targets while us japanese trade talks have just begun lastly prime minister abe indicated this will be his last term as head of the ldp and prime minister the minutes from the reserve bank of australia meeting early this month confirmed a shift to neutrality going forward investors may be sensitive to consumption data as this is the concern of officials weakening property prices high household debt and weak income growth work their way through the economy in part by weakening consumption the people s bank of china is still expected to ease policy in the near term there had been talks of another cut in required reserves but some participants are now looking for a cur in the reverse repo rate the dollar traded higher against the yen after kuroda s comments the intraday technical readings suggest that a push toward last week s highs near jpy111 15 may be too far today the downside may be protected by a 780 mln option struck at jpy110 60 expiring today and trendline support near jpy110 45 the rba minutes stopped the australian dollar s rally in its tracks the strong pre weekend recovery saw follow through buying that lifted the aussie to 0 7160 yesterday its best level in a couple of weeks however it closed poorly and selling has taken it to almost 0 7100 today a convincing break of this area would encourage a test on the recent lows near 0 7050 europe there have been two developments in the uk first reports indicate that there is some effort to redraft the language regarding the irish backstop in the uk withdrawal agreement in hopes of finding a way forward meanwhile prime minister may is under pressure from within her party to stop using the no deal exit as a threat second the uk employment data was in line with expectations the december unemployment rate was unchanged ilo measures 4 0 and weekly earnings averaged 3 4 with and without bonus payments the january claimant count rose 14 2k after a 20 2k increase in december the german

was dealt a setback in his bid to be re elected later this year one of his top aides and principal secretary gerald butts resigned over accusations of that the government pressured the attorney general to drop a case the attorney general wilson raybould resigned last week the polls show a tight race between trudeau s liberal and the conservatives ahead of the october election a scandal in the new brazilian government has forced president bolsonaro to accept the resignation of a close political ally bebianno over campaign financing irregularities bebianno may be sorely missed as the government tries to ensure that pension reform stays on track pension reform is seen as key to a host of other reforms but in order to secure it the government is willing to tactically retreat on measures so as not to antagonize the needed support this includes shelving plans to cut subsidies and open the economy to more foreign competition the pension reform may be submitted as early as tomorrow to the lower house the us dollar found support last week near cad1 3200 and recorded a high in the second half of last week near cad1 3330 the us dollar has not gotten much traction from the widening two year us canada differentials we look for an eventual upside break for the us dollar the dollar appears to be moving in a higher range against the mexican peso it had been mostly mxn19 00

live webcast at ir cosan com br the slides can also be downloaded from the webcast platform before proceeding let me mention that forward looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of cosanâ s management and on information currently available to the company they involve risks uncertainties and assumptions because they relate to future events and therefore depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future investors should understand that general economic conditions industry conditions and other operating factors could also affect the future results of cosan and could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward looking statements now iâ ll turn the conference over to mr phillipe casale mr casale you may begin the call phillipe casale good afternoon everyone and welcome to cosan s a s fourth quarter and 2018 earnings conference call this conference call will be a bit different as we have already announced to the market there are few operations underway in the capital markets involving the group cosan announced the voluntary tender offer for the acquisition of comgã s preferred shares and raã zen is in the process of issuing agribusiness receivable certificates for this reason we are suspending the disclosure of guidance for now presentation and the q a session will strictly be about the fourth quarter and 2018 results and we will not be able to talk about expectations on future results once these operations are concluded we will resume guidance this quarter now let s move to slide four to discuss results starting with raã zen downstream operation recently acquired in argentina this is the first quarter that we released the results of refining and distribution operations in argentina this acquisition was completed on october 1 2018 which means we will be talking about the full quarter before we start i would like to give two disclaimers first downstream operationsâ functional currency in argentina is the u s dollar so we will report the results in this currency second we will not disclose comparative periods prior to the acquisition since shell s operation in the upstream and downstream were consolidated and we don t have this required separation for comparison purpose let s now discuss the figures 2018 was quite a difficult year for argentina severe economic distress resulted in the depreciation of argentinean peso inflation and high interest rates in the fourth quarter of 2018 the economic scenario improved from previous quarters but a sharp drop in oil prices in the period directly impacted raã zen s results total volumes processed by raã zen s refinery was 75 5 barrels a day the utilization factor in the refinery was 75 this water impacted by a scheduled maintenance in one of its plants the normalized level for refinery utilization will be around 85 it s worth mentioning that the operations have already been reestablished after the downtime moving to the volume sold diesel and gasoline dropped 10 compared to 4q â 17 due to the lower economic activity that impacted demand in the period volume of aviation fuel grew 22 due to the increasing customer base and greater market share the quarterly ebitda was 22 million adversely affected by oil price drop as well as a downtime in the refineryâ s production plants in december which resulted in one time higher origination of fuel volume supply to service stations capital expenditures in the quarter totaled 36 million of which nearly 9 relates to refinery operations and maintenance letâ s now move to the next slide to discuss raã zen combustã veis operations in brazil 2018 was a challenging year for the fuel distribution industry in brazil as well besides the high price volatility fx rate and oil price fluctuation the truckers strike and subsequent effects added up to the current slowdown and weaker demand for fuels the demand for fuels is gradually recovering since the truckersâ strike in may total sales volume grew by 4 in the quarter and 2 in the year the highlights being diesel and jet fuel in 2018 diesel sales reflected greater demand for agribusiness and b2b clients the jet fuels followed the upturn trend of this segment the otto cycle measured by gasoline equivalent sales were down by 5 and 2 respectively in 2018 and in the quarter affected by lower demand in the country ethanol parity remained below 70 in a few regions boosting a higher consumption of the biofuel versus gasoline now referring to ebitda the sharp drop in international oil prices at the end of 2018 impacted the average inventory in the quarter and required additional efforts and an assertive supply and commercialization strategy from raã zen as a result adjusted ebitda in the quarter grew 1 to r 817 but it went down 6 to r 2 8 billion in 2019 in line with the guidance announced iâ d just like to remind that we reduced the guidance in november of 2018 since the volatility of the commodity price would bring an additional challenge for us to offset trackersâ strike negatively impacted the results now capex we ended 2018 with 6 500 shell service stations a net addition of 252 stations and total investment of r 857 million ki in the year in line with the projections these actions involve maintenance conversion of new station and contractual renewal now letâ s discuss raã zen energia results on slide six in the third quarter of 2018 2019 crop year traditionally at the end of the crushing season in brazil central south region raã zen crushed 60 million tons in this crop year down 2 from the previous year according to unica figures crushing decreased 4 in the central south region in brazil dry weather had a negative impact on agriculture yield which reached 9 1 kilos of trs per hectare in the accumulated crop at raã zen and therefore impacting the volume of cane crushed production mix was 53 for ethanol from 45 in the previous crop year in line with our strategy of focusing on higher profitability products letâ s now talk about sales volumes of each product starting with sugar as you can see in the graph on the right side sales volume dropped 46 from 4q â 17 we concluded a few storage investments in our plants which gives us greater flexibility to optimize sugar commercialization strategy with higher profitability sugar inventory volume grew 8 when compared to 3q â 18 in line with the sales trend for this crop average sales price in brazilian reals came 3 lower from 4q â 17 following a sharp drop in international sugar prices now ethanol the sales were 31 higher this quarter driven by higher demand for the product in line with commercialization strategy for this crop with the higher concentration of volumes on the fourth quarter of 2018 average sales price came 12 higher than the same period of the previous crop and slightly above the industry average due to the portion of the sales that were hedged at prices better than those seen in domestic market on the electricity side as mentioned in the previous quarter co generation results are impacted by wx operations our electricity trading company just reminding that we now break down own products and with sale trading volumes like we do for sugar and ethanol since this operation brings a significant impact on revenue when its margins are substantially lower than the sale of electricity generated by high using thus own products sold declined 16 reflecting lower biogas availability related to reduced crushing average sales price also decreased especially in the spot price before discussing ebitda i d like to highlight the unit cash cost excluding the consecana effect in the quarter unit cash costs increased by 14 reflecting the higher diesel prices reduced agricultural yield lower dilution of fixed costs due to the lower crushing as well as inflation in the period adjusted ebitda reached r 835 million 6 lower than the 4q â 17 mainly reflecting the lower sugar price and drop of sugar sales volume in addition to the higher costs incurred in the quarter once again it is worth noting that the commercialization strategy defined for this crop will concentrate a higher sales volume in the last quarter of the crop year which impacts raã zen energiaâ s results and cash flow regarding sugar hedge we are fully hedged for sugar exports for the current crop at an average price of r 0 50 of per pound for the 2019 2020 crop year we reached nearly 50 to 55 of the total fleet to exported with an average price of r 0 57 per pound a 15 improvement from current crop price regarding sugar global scenario we are still surrounded by uncertainties concerning the size of the next crop and depending on the climate and production mix there are consulting firms talking about deficit in the global sugar balance calling for better pricing environment lastly raã zen energia capex rose 16 to r 616 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to the higher planning and fuel renewal expense is in line with expectations for the quarter now let s move to slide seven talking about comgã s and comgã s released its results on tuesday so weâ ll go straight to the highlights here natural gas volume excluding thermal power advanced 6 both in the quarter and in 2018 with growth in all segments higher sales reflect commercial efforts to increase volume in the current customer base jointly with network expansion and saturation this quarter recorded a nonrecurring positive effect on the ebitda of r 716 related to the conclusion of legal disputes resulting in the yearend normalized ebitda of r 2 7 billion excluding these effects normalized adjusted ebitda totaled r 546 million in the 4q â 18 12 higher than the same period last year mainly due to the higher volume sold in 2018 normalized ebitda advanced 12 to r 1 9 billion already excluding the same nonrecurring effect already mentioned comgã s accumulated regulatory current account ending the quarter with a current balance of r 251 million in favor of comgã s due to the gas price movement in period lastly capex totaled r 148 in the quarter and r 530 million in the year in line with the capex plan of comgã s let s move to slide eight and before discussing moove s result i would like to remind you that as announced to the market on december 21 2018 moove will receive a capital contribution up to r 562 million from cvc fund corresponding to a 30 stake in the company the entry of a strategic partner will contribute to expanding the company s lubricant business besides optimizing its capital structure we also would like to remind you that we recently initiated lubricants distribution operations in france portugal argentina and united states besides expanding our business in the uk the business model is similar to the model of the other countries focused on the commercialization and distribution of lubricants and other products to different types clients with marginal investments now let s discuss moove s results the improvement of performance of finished lubricant sales in brazil and in other countries boosted ebitda growth which reached to r 61 million in the quarter and r 238 million in 2018 also in line with the guidance announced the better results reflect the better product mix with more contribution from finished lubricants as well as synergies captured by the expansions of international operations moving to the corporate segment on the right side of the slide cosan s corporate g a expenses declined 14 in 2018 as a result of the company s effort to cut costs other operating revenues and expenses came in positive at r 96 million in the quarter impacted by a reversal of provisions and by a positive one off effect deriving from the exclusion of icms which is the state tax from the calculation basis of pis cofins which is a federal tax from the past periods moving to slide nine we present consolidated results of cosan s a on a pro forma basis considering 50 of raã zen s results cosan s pro forma adjusted ebitda grew by 23 in the quarter but went down 2 in 2018 reaching r 5 billion in line with the guidance adjusted ebitda reduction reflects lower results of raã zen combustã veis mainly impacted by the truckersâ strike in may and raã zen energia affected by lower production and average prices in the period cosanâ s adjusted net income totaled r 730 million in the fourth quarter also benefited by the non cash effect of tax variation of the un hedged portion of the perpetual bond in 2018 adjusted net income totaled r 1 2 billion 35 higher than 2017 benefited by an improvement in net income of comgã s and moove letâ s move to the next slide to discuss the main impacts on the cash flow starting with the operating cash flow which increased in the quarter compared to 4q â 17 mainly due to improved working capital dynamics at raã zen combustã veis brazil on the back of supply dynamics in the period and the renegotiation of agreements which extended payment terms this effect was offset by raã zen energia commercialization strategy with higher inventory volumes in the quarter in 2018 operating cash generation advanced 9 to r 5 3 billion cash flow from investment was effected by disbursement on the second installment of 370 million related to the acquisition of shellâ s asset in argentina itâ s worth nothing that upon the operation signing in april last year raã zen paid 100 million to shell and there is still one less installment to be paid by december â 19 in the approximate amount of 450 million these amounts that i mentioned previously are equivalent to 100 but we only consolidated 50 of raã zenâ s result which is equivalent to our stake in the company moove recorded a disbursement of r 61 million referring to investments to start its operations in u s on cash flow from financing activity there is a miss match between funding and debt amortization at comgã s and raã zen with a non recurring effect on cash generation in the period thus the company posted negative free cash flow through equity in the quarter of r 560 million while in 2018 pro forma free cash flow to equity was almost double the figures from 2017 totaling r 1 4 billion cosan pro forma gross debt including 50 of raã zen results came in line with the third quarter with an average cost of 104 of cdi lastly i would like to point out that our leverage normalized by the current account effect of comgã s ended the year at 2 1 times net debt considering the pro forma ebitda before concluding the presentation i would like to remind you that due to the transactions in progress that i mentioned at the beginning of the call the company decided to suspend the disclosure of the guidance and weâ ll also not be able to discuss expectations relating to plans future events and trends affecting our activities once these operations are concluded we will resume disclosing guidance last but not least our cosan day of 2019 will take place on march 19 in sao paulo and march 22nd in new york we will disclose more details soon but i would like to take this opportunity to invite you all to save the date for our annual meeting that concludes my presentation and we can now start the q a session thank you question and answer session operator operator thank you as we donâ t have questions this concludes cosan s audio conference for today thank you and have a good afternoon

imagine that i am a seafaring tyrant who has moored my galleon off a large island through my telescope i see a healthy population creating wealth and improving their lives through work and trade i decide to extract all the value they are creating perhaps because i m greedy or perhaps because i am convinced i know better than they do what is good for them all i need to do is to somehow make them conduct all their transactions in a currency that only i can create then i can appropriate their wealth and acquire anything they produce by simply creating money to buy from them whatever goods or services i want whenever i want them doing so would cause a bit of inflation on the island but that i don t care about that because as prices go up i can always create more money whenever i want to buy something from the islanders in the future i call my currency the dollar assuming i land on the island with a near monopoly of force i can easily make the islanders take my dollars without intervening in every transaction they perform with each other how i simply require all of them to give me some of my own currency back on a regular basis to avoid some threatened punishment i ll call this requirement to pay on pain of incarceration tax now everyone who is subject to this tax to get their hands on dollars to discharge their tax obligation in fact my system is even better than that as i only need the workers who acquire the most dollars because they produce the most goods or do the most work to pay this tax that is enough to ensure that my dollars will be the demanded currency on the island allowing me to extract whatever wealth i want by printing more of them to purchase whatever goods or services i want whenever i want them and the really neat thing about my print and tax system is that when i print currency to give to islanders in exchange for their products or services they don t feel like i m stealing anything from them they re actually happy to get the money and give me things for it because it enables them to get more things for themselves in short by imposing my tax on some of the islanders i guarantee a demand for the currency that only i can create and so i can acquire any of the island s resources without effort you can call me king although i think i prefer to call myself the government at first glance the fact that my brilliant scheme of fiat money creation causes inflation looks like a flaw since if i over do all the money printing all the islanders may lose confidence in my dollars as a means of exchange and start doing some of their trading using some other kind of money that no one can create like conch shells or gold if they have any but i ve thought of that you see my clever tax system does more than just create demand for my currency when the islanders pay their taxes those dollars completely disappear from the economy as king i could keep them in a box but there s really no point because i ll just print new ones whenever i need them so i just burn them as long as the taxes are high enough to drain enough money from the islanders economy the inflation caused by all the money i m creating doesn t get out of control and i the king of the island continue to control the island s entire economic life and resources pretty neat heh and did you notice which came first taxes or spending it s the spending my spending or to be precise my creation of money to purchase goods from the islanders came before i got the money back in taxes it couldn t be any other way because the money had to be created and spent into the islanders economy before it could be taxed and here s a very elegant fact the total amount of money held by all the islanders is the total amount of currency that i the king have created minus all the money they ve given me back in taxes the islanders have a phrase for that it s the king s deficit because it s the amount the king has spent by buying things from the islanders in excess of the money he s received back from them in taxes it s a kind of deficit but not the normal kind because unlike the islanders users of currency i the king issuer of currency don t have to earn the money i spend because i can create it at will i can t go bankrupt as long as i don t owe anyone anything in any other currency and this so called king s deficit is the exact same amount as the total financial wealth of the islanders to the penny island assets all currency ever created by the king all the taxes ever collected by the king meanwhile the islanders quaintly believe that the taxes they pay fund all the things i the king like to buy for the island like the roads and the healthcare system i decided to build as if i need money from them to be able to spend it silly islanders not only do i not need their money it was never their money i created all of it in the past when i wanted to buy things from them and i can create more in the future whenever i need it whether i m collecting taxes from them or not this is the world that modern monetary theory mmt describes it is also a precise analogy to the monetary system of every single country that like the usa is a sovereign monopoly issuer of its own fiat currency which is almost every country on earth in the analogy i the king am the american government although the government s money printing is done by the federal reserve the system as whole functions exactly as described here because the federal reserve never refuses to create money to fund deficit government spending this fact is unchanged by the reality that the feds charge the government interest on the money it creates for it and then hands nearly all of the profits from that interest back to the treasury the tax paying islanders like american citizens constitute the private sector or the productive economy or the free market when the us government wants to buy let s say a fighter jet its spends the money into existence by crediting a bank account of boeing increasing its public deficit by the exact amount of the net increase in financial assets in the private sector that s all mmt says it doesn t tell you how policy should be conducted in such a world even though unsurprisingly many of those who are interested in it are economic leftists like alexandria ocasio cortez who are excited to discover that yes in fact the government can technically spend without constraint in other words socialists and others use mmt as a description of our monetary system to make political and economic prescriptions which do not follow from the theory but are allowed by it and by our monetary system the absolutely critical point for those of us who love voluntary action free exchange and free markets is that just because our current system of money creation allows unconstrained economic action by government doesn t mean that the theory that describes that state of affairs is wrong any more than the fact that the theory of gravity means that we can drop bricks on people s heads makes the theory of gravity wrong therefore most of the recent apoplexy of many free marketeers in response to aoc s comments and invocation of mmt has been aimed at exactly the wrong thing the theory rather than the system that the theory describes in which our government creates fiat currency without limit subject only to the soft constraint of inflation lovers of liberty and free markets should be thankful for mmt as a description of our monetary system precisely because it so clearly elucidates how it is a system of economic totalitarianism dramatic as that term sounds it is justified because all of the money that anyone uses to conduct any voluntary economic exchange and entrepreneurs use to create new products and services and all that is good in our material world exists only because our government spends it is a mind boggling fact it completely turns upside down common sense notions of tax government debt and most fundamentally the relationship between government and taxpayers etc it explains why government debt will never be fully paid off meaning that the government s total revenues over time equaled its total spending over time because then the net financial assets held by the private sector would be precisely zero for all of these reasons when wrested from the political intentions of leftists and statists mmt is a powerful tool for demonstrating the government s total economic control over every aspect of every single american life therefore mmt shouldn t be rejected by those who love liberty and understand that prosperity and wealth creation depend on the voluntary transactions of free people rather it should be embraced as one of the most efficient tools available for getting people to appreciate just how terrifyingly unconstrained the power of government is and has been since we came off the gold standard in 1971 so don t attack mmt as a description of america s economic system but attack an economic system that can be described by mmt at all

in addition to its reported results and guidance calculated in accordance with gaap the company has included in this release adjusted net income and adjusted diluted eps performance measures that the securities and exchange commission defines as non gaap financial measures management believes that such non gaap financial measures when read in conjunction with the company s reported or forecasted results in each case calculated in accordance with gaap can provide useful supplemental information for investors because they facilitate a period to period comparative assessment of the company s operating performance relative to its performance based on reported or forecasted results under gaap while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance and eliminate certain charges that management believes do not reflect the company s operations and underlying operational performance the company s definition of adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner as the company does and should not be viewed in isolation from nor as alternatives to net income or diluted eps calculated in accordance with gaap the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in venezuela and the price increases the company implements as a result of the highly inflationary economy in that market can each when considered in isolation have a disproportionately large impact to the company s consolidated results despite the offsetting nature of these drivers and that net sales in venezuela which represent less than 1 of the company s consolidated net sales are not material to our consolidated results therefore in certain instances the company believes it is helpful to provide additional information with respect to these factors as reported and excluding the impact of venezuela to illustrate the disproportionate nature of venezuela s individual pricing and foreign exchange impact to the company s consolidated results however excluding the impact of venezuela from these measures is not in accordance with u s gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to the presentation and discussion thereof calculated in accordance with u s gaap the

6 421 3 402 6 the following table is a reconciliation of diluted shares outstanding as presented and reported in accordance with gaap to adjusted diluted shares outstanding adjusted to include the impact of outstanding capped call transactions and the impact of outstanding equity awards the company s outstanding capped call transactions are anti dilutive and not included in gaap earnings per share but are expected to mitigate the dilutive effect of the company s convertible notes due 2019 if the trading price of the company s stock exceeds the conversion price up to a certain level therefore the company has adjusted the diluted shares outstanding to include the impact of the capped calls based on the average share price for the period that the capped calls are anti dilutive outstanding equity awards were excluded from the number of reported diluted outstanding shares for the fourth quarter of 2017 because the company reported a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 and their inclusion would be anti dilutive however because the company s adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 as calculated in the table above was positive inclusion of outstanding equity awards would not be anti dilutive therefore the company has adjusted the diluted shares outstanding for the fourth quarter of 2017 to include equity awards as set forth below so the calculation of adjusted diluted eps is not overstated for the fourth quarter of 2017 and such number is comparable to adjusted diluted eps for the current year period three months ended twelve months ended 12 31

to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forecasts although we believe the expectations reflected in the forecasts are based upon reasonable assumptions we can give no assurance that the expectations will be attained or that the results will not be materially different risks that may affect these assumptions and forecasts include the following potential changes in overall economic outlook make it inherently difficult to forecast the level of revpar and margin growth the amount and timing of acquisitions and dispositions of hotel properties is an estimate that can substantially affect financial results including such items as net income depreciation and gains on dispositions the level of capital expenditures may change significantly which will directly affect the level of depreciation expense and net income the amount and timing of debt payments may change significantly based on market conditions which will directly affect the level of interest expense and net income the amount and timing of transactions involving shares of our common stock may change based on market conditions and other risks and uncertainties associated with our business described herein and in our annual report on form 10 k quarterly reports on form 10 q and current reports on form 8 k filed with the sec comparable hotel operating statistics to facilitate a quarter to quarter comparison of our operations we present certain operating statistics i e revpar average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues expenses hotel ebitda and associated margins for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis because these statistics and operating results relate only to our hotel properties they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments we define our comparable hotels as properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption or undergone large scale capital projects as further defined below during the reporting periods being compared the hotel business is capital intensive and renovations are a regular part of the business generally hotels under renovation remain comparable hotels a large scale capital project that would cause a hotel to be excluded from our comparable hotel set is an extensive renovation of several core aspects of the hotel such as rooms meeting space lobby bars restaurants and other public spaces both quantitative and qualitative factors are taken into consideration in determining if the renovation would cause a hotel to be removed from the comparable hotel set including unusual or exceptional circumstances such as a reduction or increase in room count rebranding a significant alteration of the business operations or the closing of the hotel during the renovation we do not include an acquired hotel in our comparable hotel set until the operating results for that hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year for example we acquired the 1 hotel south beach in february 2019 the hotel will not be included in our comparable hotels until january 1 2021 hotels that we sell are excluded from the comparable hotel set once the transaction has closed similarly hotels are excluded from our comparable hotel set from the date that they sustain substantial property damage or business interruption or commence a large scale capital project in each case these hotels are returned to the comparable hotel set when the operations of the hotel have been included in our consolidated results for one full calendar year after completion of the repair of the property damage or cessation of the business interruption or the completion of large scale capital projects as applicable of the 93 hotels that we owned on december 31 2018 85 have been classified as comparable hotels the operating results of the following hotels that we owned as of december 31 2018 are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods the phoenician acquired in june 2015 and beginning in the second quarter of 2016 and into 2017 business disruption due to extensive renovations including all guestrooms and suites a redesign of the lobby and public areas renovation of pools recreation areas and a restaurant and a re configured spa and fitness center the don cesar and beach house suites complex acquired in february 2017 w hollywood acquired in march 2017 andaz maui at wailea resort acquired in march 2018 grand hyatt san francisco acquired in march 2018 hyatt regency coconut point resort and spa acquired in march 2018 the ritz carlton naples removed in the second quarter of 2018 business disruption due to extensive renovations including restoration of the façade that required closure of the hotel for over two months coordinated with renovation and expansion of restaurant areas and renovation to the spa and ballrooms and san francisco marriott marquis removed in the third quarter of 2018 business disruption due to renovations of guestrooms ballrooms meeting space and extensive renovations of the main lobby the operating results of eight hotels disposed of in 2018 and 2017 are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein these operations are also excluded from the hotel operating data for all owned hotels on pages 9 and 10 operating statistics for the non comparable hotels listed above are included in the hotel operating data for all owned hotels by definition the revpar results for these properties are not comparable due to the reasons listed above and therefore are not indicative of the overall trends for our portfolio the operating results for the five hotels acquired in 2017 and 2018 are included in the all owned hotel operating data on a pro forma basis which includes operating results assuming the hotels were owned as of january 1 2017 and based on actual results obtained from the manager for periods prior to our ownership for these hotels since the year over year comparison includes periods prior to our ownership the changes will not necessarily correspond to changes in our actual results all owned hotel operating statistics are provided for completeness and to show the difference between our comparable hotel information upon which we usually evaluate performance and all of our hotels including non comparable hotels also while they may not be illustrative of trends as compared to comparable hotel operating statistics changes in all owned hotel statistics will have an effect on our overall revenues constant us and nominal us operating results denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the prevailing exchange rates on the date of the transaction or monthly based on the weighted average exchange rate for the period for comparative purposes we also present the revpar results for the prior year assuming the results for our foreign operations were translated using the same exchange rates that were effective for the comparable periods in the current year thereby eliminating the effect of currency fluctuation for the year over year comparisons for the full year forecast results we use the applicable forward currency curve as published by bloomberg l p for each monthly period to estimate forecast foreign operations in u s dollars and have restated the prior year revpar results using the same forecast exchange rates to estimate year over year growth in revpar in constant us we believe this presentation is useful to investors as it shows growth in revpar in the local currency of the hotel consistent with how we would evaluate our domestic portfolio however the estimated effect of changes in foreign currency has been reflected in the actual and forecast results of net income ebitda adjusted ebitdare earnings per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share nominal us results include the effect of currency fluctuations consistent with our financial statement presentation non gaap financial measures included in this press release are certain non gaap financial measures which are measures of our historical or future financial performance that are not calculated and presented in accordance with gaap within the meaning of applicable sec rules they are as follows i ffo and ffo per diluted share both nareit and adjusted ii ebitda iii ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare and iv comparable hotel property level operating results the following discussion defines these measures and presents why we believe they are useful supplemental measures of our performance nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share we present nareit ffo and nareit ffo per diluted share as non gaap measures of our performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share as our nareit ffo defined as set forth below for a given operating period as adjusted for the effect of dilutive securities divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period in accordance with nareit guidelines nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains and losses from sales of real estate the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles real estate related depreciation amortization and impairments and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect our pro rata share of the ffo of those entities on the same basis we believe that nareit ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance and that the presentation of nareit ffo per diluted share when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share provides beneficial information to investors by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation amortization impairments and gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance we believe that such measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and with other reits even though nareit ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of our common stock historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted by nareit in its april 2002 white paper on funds from operations since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves for these reasons nareit adopted the ffo metric in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance adjusted ffo per diluted share we also present adjusted ffo per diluted share when evaluating our performance because management believes that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance management historically has made the adjustments detailed below in evaluating our performance in our annual budget process and for our compensation programs we believe that the presentation of adjusted ffo per diluted share when combined with both the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share and ffo per diluted share as defined by nareit provides useful supplemental information that is beneficial to an investor s understanding of our operating performance we adjust nareit ffo per diluted share for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ffo per diluted share gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt we exclude the effect of finance charges and premiums associated with the extinguishment of debt including the acceleration of the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the original issuance of the debt being redeemed or retired and incremental interest expense incurred during the refinancing period we also exclude the gains on debt repurchases and the original issuance costs associated with the retirement of preferred stock we believe that these items are not reflective of our ongoing finance costs acquisition costs under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company litigation gains and losses we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance in unusual circumstances we may also adjust nareit ffo for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the company s current operating performance for example in 2017 as a result of the reduction of corporate income tax rates from 35 to 21 caused by the tax cuts and jobs act we remeasured our domestic deferred tax assets as of december 31 2017 and recorded a one time adjustment to reduce the deferred tax assets and increase the provision for income taxes by approximately 11 million additionally similar corporate income tax rate reductions affected our european joint venture causing the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets and liabilities in france and belgium resulting in a net tax benefit to us of 5 million we do not consider these adjustments to be reflective of our on going operating performance and therefore excluded these items from adjusted ffo ebitda earnings before interest expense income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties after removing the impact of the company s capital structure primarily interest expense and its asset base primarily depreciation and amortization management also believes the use of ebitda facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits hotel owners that are not reits and other capital intensive companies management uses ebitda to evaluate property level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and like ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share it is widely used by management in the annual budget process and for our compensation programs ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare we present ebitdare in accordance with nareit guidelines as defined in its september 2017 white paper earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate to provide an additional performance measure to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of the company s results with other reits nareit defines ebitdare as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding interest expense income tax depreciation and amortization gains or losses on disposition of depreciated property including gains or losses on change of control impairment write downs of depreciated property and of investments in unconsolidated affiliates caused by a decrease in value of depreciated property in the affiliate and adjustments to reflect the entity s pro rata share of ebitdare of unconsolidated affiliates we make additional adjustments to ebitdare when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitdare when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income is beneficial to an investor s understanding of our operating performance adjusted ebitdare also is similar to the measure used to calculate certain credit ratios for our credit facility and senior notes we adjust ebitdare for the following items which may occur in any period and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitdare property insurance gains we exclude the effect of property insurance gains reflected in our consolidated statements of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitdare is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our assets in addition property insurance gains could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset book value written off in connection with the calculation of the property insurance gain often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets acquisition costs under gaap costs associated with completed property acquisitions that are considered business combinations are expensed in the year incurred we exclude the effect of these costs because we believe they are not reflective of the ongoing performance of the company litigation gains and losses we exclude the effect of gains or losses associated with litigation recorded under gaap that we consider outside the ordinary course of business we believe that including these items is not consistent with our ongoing operating performance in unusual circumstances we also may adjust ebitdare for gains or losses that management believes are not representative of the company s current operating performance the last such adjustment was a 2013 exclusion of a gain from an eminent domain claim limitations on the use of nareit ffo per diluted share adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare we calculate nareit ffo per diluted share in accordance with standards established by nareit which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or do not calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance in addition although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits we also calculate adjusted ffo per diluted share which is not in accordance with nareit guidance and may not be comparable to measures calculated by other reits ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare as presented may also not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income operating profit cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures interest expense for ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare purposes only and other items have been and will be made and are not reflected in the ebitda ebitdare adjusted ebitdare nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share presentations management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense capital expenditures and other excluded items all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures additionally nareit ffo per diluted share adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitda ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make cash distributions in addition nareit ffo per diluted share and adjusted ffo per diluted share do not measure and should not be used as a measure of amounts that accrue directly to stockholders benefit similarly ebitdare adjusted ebitdare nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of our equity investments and nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share include adjustments for the pro rata share of non controlling partners in consolidated partnerships our equity investments consist of interests ranging from 11 to 67 in seven domestic and international partnerships that own a total of 10 properties and a vacation ownership development due to the voting rights of the outside owners we do not control and therefore do not consolidate these entities the non controlling partners in consolidated partnerships primarily consist of the approximate 1 interest in host lp held by outside partners a 15 interest held by outside partners in a partnership owning one hotel for which we do control the entity and therefore consolidate its operations and an interest of 48 held by an outside partner for one hotel that we sold during the year these pro rata results for nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share ebitdare and adjusted ebitdare were calculated as set forth in the definitions above readers should be cautioned that the pro rata results presented in these measures for consolidated partnerships for nareit ffo and adjusted ffo per diluted share and equity investments may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our investments in these entities comparable hotel property level operating results we present certain operating results for our hotels such as hotel revenues expenses food and beverage profit and ebitda and the related margins on a comparable hotel or same store basis as supplemental information for investors our comparable hotel results present operating results for hotels owned during the entirety of the periods being compared without giving effect to any acquisitions or dispositions significant property damage or large scale capital improvements incurred during these periods we present comparable hotel ebitda to help us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our comparable properties after removing the impact of the company s capital structure primarily interest expense and its asset base primarily depreciation and amortization corporate level costs and expenses are also removed to arrive at property level results we believe these property level results provide investors with supplemental information into the ongoing operating performance of our comparable hotels comparable hotel results are presented both by location and for the company s comparable properties in the aggregate we eliminate depreciation and amortization because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses these non cash expenses which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as noted earlier because real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions many real estate industry investors have considered presentation of historical cost accounting for operating results to be insufficient by themselves because of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues expenses operating profit or net income and should not be used to evaluate the performance of our company as a whole management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners in particular these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance this measure is not used to allocate resources or to assess the operating performance of each of these hotels as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable hotel results for these reasons we believe that comparable hotel operating results when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit revenues and expenses provide useful information to investors and management michael d bluhm chief financial officer 240 744 5110 gee lingberg senior vice president 240 744 5275 a pdf accompanying this announcement is available at

could russian bonds get the venezuela bond treatment in the senate s latest draft of a new sanctions bill the short answer to that question is yes does that mean it is happening the market is betting in favor of much stricter sanctions on russian bonds pushing russian 10 year bond yields higher on friday but not sending the ruble much lower on monday the ruble was relatively flat on monday down just 0 06 to 66 286 rubles to the dollar ruble strength may be because american traders were off yesterday due to the president s day holiday europe didn t send the ruble packing it s still one of the strongest emerging market currencies around even outperforming the brazilian real which is the hottest of the bric equity markets i have no idea what new sanctions would look like maybe they will just limit investment on russian sovereign debt says alina sychova head of capital markets origination for sova capital a russian investment bank in london over 40 of russian government bonds are held by foreign investors so if you cut them out of that you re punishing both sides new bond issues by sanctioned russian banks sberbank and vtb bank cannot be purchased by americans except in the secondary market the secondary market is where the pain really kicks in because it freezes out the potential for anyone to realize any gains in those bonds they become dead money the u s did this with venezuelan sovereign bonds and its quasi sovereign pdvsa just last week those bonds are now untradable by americans if they banned secondary trading you re potentially limiting the owners from the u k to germany because now they lose the american market to sell to and maybe even transact with she says assuming u s intermediaries would be unable to facilitate in the trade banning the trading of russian bonds has been tossed around ever since trump got elected anti russian politicians on both sides of the aisle have taken full advantage of trump being caught in a russian scandal to force the president to play super hardball with vladimir putin and anyone within a country mile of him since taking office trump has already signed harsher sanctions against russian individuals and russian companies making some of them extraterritorial extraterritorial means sanctions apply to non u s citizens and entities transacting with the sanctioned firm are subject to penalties bnp paribas got served with an 8 9 billion sentence in 2015 for violating iran sanctions china s huawei is currently in hot water for doing the same trump is boxed in if he doesn t sign new sanctions he will be made to look like he is favoring putin president trump s willful paralysis in the face of kremlin aggression has reached a boiling point in congress senator bob menendez the top democrat on the foreign relations committee and a sponsor of the legislation said in a statement bloomberg news what exactly that willful paralysis is menendez doesn t mention menendez signed onto a resolution by another anti russia democrat in the senate chuck schumer last month to keep sanctions on en group the london listed holding company was majority owned by sanctioned russian businessman oleg deripaska sanctions on deripaska remain but schumer and menendez s attempt to keep sanctions on en group an important aluminum exporter to europe failed last month the company is no longer facing sanctions as deripaska complied with the treasury department to relinquish majority ownership of the company the stock price rose over 55 on the news russian bonds might rally but not that much and they will have to wait until the senate decides what they are going to do with their latest round of corporate russia bashing according to a report by bloomberg on february 13 senators like republican lindsey graham want to target new russian government bond issues if so that means americans would be banned from participating you can t buy them you can t underwrite them other sanctions seem more commercial in nature and impact private companies as much as they do the state controlled behemoths in the oil and gas space the senate wants to sanction individuals and companies from investing in russian lng projects outside of russia as well as punish the two big state owned energy plays gazprom and rosneft for operations overseas it is unclear what exactly this would entail 2018 bloomberg finance lp the senate has already made it clear that it is at treasury s discretion to fine gazprom s partners in nord stream ii the new natural gas pipeline being built from russia into germany meanwhile nord stream ii while not sailing smoothly is still sailing i know the government doesn t want us to buy new russian corporate debt says katherine renfrew a bond fund manager for tiaa investments she co leads the tiaa cref emerging market debt mutual fund if they take that second step and say we don t want you trading in the old issues either it s a bit daunting to think about she says if you re an investor in russia you definitely don t need new sanctions but you don t need to have exposure to those sanctioned bonds and can still buy russia the timing of the new sanctions coincided with the annual munich security conference which ended this weekend and the meeting of a european foreign affairs committee on monday it gives the officials some new official meat to chew on despite the tough language from menendez and maybe even lindsey graham who has made himself more of trump s trusty sidekick since the matt kavanaugh hearings of last summer investors are more likely to wait and see what gets put in a final bill the biggest fear for now is that the new sanctions will borrow from the venezuela playbook making it illegal to trade in certain bond issues in the secondary market the secondary market is a market between investors rather than an investor buying directly from the issuer moreover concerns that washington will block russia from u s dollar settlements are greatly exaggerated and a threat to the dollar as russia could easily make the switch to euros and europe not all that in love with trump itself wouldn t bat an eye if putin did that given that en group the holding company behind aluminum firm rusal had sanctions removed following loud outcries from european automakers who were forced to buy chinese aluminum instead it is unlikely that systemically important companies in russia will be punished in other words pipelines may get spitballs thrown at them but that s about it on the energy front if the u s makes it legally impossible for american firms to work with or provide some level of funding for russian oil and gas firms then they run the risk of russia banning the americans from the oil and gas sector there opening up the door to china russian based macro advisory a big picture investment research firm says gaz group is the entity to watch in the latest round of sanctions gaz is an important supplier and subcontractor for foreign companies operating in russia the question now is whether treasury will view this category of company as exempt or not it is also known that the russian government is actively looking at options like attracting a new strategic investor russia is a very important market for china but more so for europe so far russia has been quiet finance minister anton siluanov was rather sanguine about the whole thing saying in a nutshell that they will have to find a way to cope with it there has been little commentary by other officials although that may change in the days ahead the hope appears to be that the next round will be for the optics rather than economically damaging macro advisory founder christopher weafer wrote in a recently published report if damaging sanctions are put in place then an appropriate russian response will almost certainly be forthcoming russia s economic development ministry estimated yesterday that the country has lost at least 6 billion due to sanctions and trade restrictions
edinburgh finance minister tito mboweni warned that south africa is at a crossroads when he delivered the medium term budget policy statement in october and one of south africa s sharpest investment minds portfolio manager sandy mcgregor of allan gray agrees like mboweni mcgregor is gravely concerned about the country s mountain of debt dwindling tax collections and an economy that has stalled mcgregor shares a broad brushtrokes plan on how president cyril ramaphosa and his team can boost business development and in so doing fire up economic growth and reduce poverty for mcgregor the risks of south africa slipping into a serious mess are rising jackie cameron by sandy mcgregor faced with sky high debt a stagnant economy and disappointing tax collections south africa is on an unsustainable fiscal path difficult choices have to be made that can no longer be postponed one of the most astute insights on bankruptcy was provided by american writer ernest hemingway in his 1926 novel the sun also rises a character named mike campbell was asked how he went bankrupt two ways mike responded gradually then suddenly what is true for individuals also holds for nations a long period of economic mismanagement in which unpayable debts and unaffordable obligations accumulate can be followed by a sudden financial crisis in which the state finds it cannot fund itself two examples of the possible consequences of such financial mismanagement are zimbabwe in the first decade of this century and more recently venezuela both of which imploded into hyperinflation south africa s financial metrics have also significantly deteriorated in the past decade and while we are hopefully still in a position to reverse these trends they are very concerning the risk of entering the second sudden stage of bankruptcy is increasing in presenting to parliament the government s medium term budget policy statement mtbps on 24 october 2018 finance minister tito mboweni delivered a very good speech titled south africa at a crossroads while the response of the market was negative with the rand immediately weakening from r14 18 us to r14 50 us mboweni s maiden address was an honest appraisal of the difficult circumstances in which south africa finds itself it is clear from the mtbps that we face difficult choices that can no longer be postponed if financial disaster is to be avoided the rise in the public sector wage bill during the zuma presidency there was a massive increase in the state s remuneration bill between the fiscal years 2006 7 and 2017 18 the compensation of government employees grew at an annual rate of 11 2 in the same period the current value of the gross domestic product gdp expanded by an average of 8 6 annually over 11 years wages have grown 3 2 times while the value of economic activity from which taxes are levied grew only 2 5 times this inexorable rise in the wage bill was a consequence of above inflation annual wage settlements with the public sector trade unions a system of automatic additional increases linked to length of service and an increase in the number of employees clearly former president jacob zuma and others in the anc leadership regarded inflating the public sector wage bill as a politically rewarding exercise in patronage however as a consequence other expenditures have been crowded out and the ambitious social plans of the anc rendered unaffordable bringing the spiralling public sector wage bill under control is essential if fiscal sustainability is to be restored this will require difficult negotiations with a key anc support base public servants and their trade unions tax collections disappoint in recent years tax collections have disappointed in part this is a consequence of a political climate that has promoted a culture of non compliance when large numbers of politically connected persons are blatantly looting public institutions it is difficult to promote the message that all citizens are obliged to pay their taxes also as the nugent commission has detailed in a cogent and well documented report the mismanagement of the south african revenue service sars by tom moyane whom zuma appointed commissioner in september 2014 has proven disastrous tax collections have underperformed relative to what would normally have been expected from the actual level of economic activity and have been artificially boosted by a failure to make timeous vat refunds president cyril ramaphosa has acted to fix this mess he has dismissed moyane and appointed mark kingon an experienced long serving sars executive as acting commissioner until a new hopefully competent permanent appointment is made equally important is ramaphosa s strong message that looting state institutions is unacceptable and that the perpetrators of such crimes will be actively prosecuted fixing the tax collection system can be done but it will take a number of years however even if the tax system is fixed the problem of insufficient state revenues will persist as long as south africa remains trapped in economic stagnation national treasury s forecast of economic growth in 2019 included in the mtbps is 1 7 up from 0 7 in 2018 historically growth in south africa has been highly correlated with global growth rates one of the great disappointments of 2017 and 2018 has been the economy s failure to escape from its current stagnation despite strong synchronised global growth given that there are increasing signs that the world economy is now slowing it is difficult to be more optimistic than the treasury about economic growth in 2019 or to expect better than its cautious revenue projections a deteriorating debt outlook projections in the recent mtbps are that the ratio of south african government debt to gdp will rise from 52 7 in march 2018 to 55 8 in march 2019 to 56 1 in march 2020 and peak at 59 6 in march 2024 however the treasury has a credibility problem because for many years it has predicted that things will get better a few years out but since 2009 they never have for example in february 2017 it projected gross debt to gdp in march 2020 will be 52 4 now the estimate is 56 1 while the treasury has done a very credible job in difficult circumstances since jacob zuma became president in 2009 it has had to manage the nation s finances within a political system that has continually undermined its efforts to be fiscally prudent this is one of the serious concerns international ratings agencies have about south africa s longer term financial stability in addition to its own gross debt the government has also guaranteed parastatal debt principally borrowings by eskom equal to about 10 of gdp were it not for government guarantees eskom saa and the sabc would all be trading in insolvency accordingly these guarantees add about 10 to the national debt increasing the 2024 debt projection to about 70 of gdp a market imposed debt ceiling a key question is what level of debt will push south africa over the tipping point and precipitate a financial crisis will a debt level of 70 in 2024 prove to be unfundable in many other countries the ratio of national debt to gdp is much higher at the extremes in japan and italy it is about 250 and 130 respectively south africa struggles to service a proportionally much smaller debt burden because it has a very low savings rate and runs a large balance of payments current account deficit whereas in many other countries interest rates are low and often close to zero the annual cost of debt in south africa is between 8 and 10 which puts a lower ceiling on how much we can afford to borrow we are dependent on continuing inflows of foreign capital to balance the books already about 40 of south african government domestically issued rand debt is owned by foreigners domestic political acrimony and in particular issues such as confiscation of land without compensation make such investors nervous it will be very difficult to persuade them to finance a massive unaffordable increase in our national debt in practice the stagnation of the domestic economy puts a limit on how much we can borrow and we may be closer to this limit than we realise the eskom risk one of the immediate challenges facing president ramaphosa is what to do about eskom in the 12 months to 30 september 2018 eskom s borrowings increased by r52bn to r419bn it required r45bn to service this debt but only generated a cash flow from operations of r27bn eskom is effectively bankrupt and can only remain in business by raising government guaranteed debt its new management faces formidable challenges and has proposed to government a rescue plan involving a substantial increase in tariffs and the transfer of r100bn of debt to the treasury naturally such proposals are extremely unwelcome in the treasury mboweni has openly stated that he does not favour the state assuming this burden which would cost about r9 billion annually probably the flaw in eskom s proposal is that it does not go far enough the reality is that its debt has become an obligation of government trying to repay it by increasing tariffs will merely exacerbate the downward spiral whereby higher tariffs reduce consumption further eroding eskom s competitive position and reducing its operating profit the economic damage of higher tariffs will erode economic growth and impose unintended collateral damage on tax collections if increased tariffs are not the answer then the only effective solution is to take a much larger proportion of eskom s debt perhaps r300 billion onto the books of the national fiscus apart from recognising an existing reality this solution will allow eskom to keep its tariff increases in line with inflation and thus promote economic growth however such a dramatic step will require vigilant control of government spending to keep the level of its debt under control economic growth is the only panacea at the heart of south africa s problems is the fact that the economy is not growing president ramaphosa clearly recognises this and is trying to kick start the economy by promoting new business investment however what is needed is an honest debate about why the economy is stagnating economic growth is largely a matter of making things cheaper business in south africa is subjected to the widespread and growing cost of the anc s social agendas while everyone recognises the pressing needs that these agendas are trying to address the collateral damage caused by the negative impact rising business costs are having on economic growth is largely ignored without greater prosperity it will be impossible to resolve the problem of poverty there are many issues that need to be tackled urgently to prevent south africa s debt problem from spiralling out of control to expand on the message that south africa is at a crossroads we should remember the wisdom of yogi berra who said when you come to a fork in the road take it sandy mcgregor is a portfolio manager at allan gray visited 384 times 2 visit s today
us media ignore and applaud economic war on venezuela gregory shupak examines the silences that organize the mainstream media s coverage of the crisis in the caribbean nation by gregory shupak fair february 19 2019 fair org the us media chorus supporting a us overthrow of the venezuelan government has for years pointed to the country s economic crisis as a justification for regime change while whitewashing the ways in which the us has strangled the venezuelan economy fair org 3 22 18 a un rapporteur declares that sanctions kill independent 1 26 19 but few in western media are listening to his message sister eugenia russian president of fundalatin a venezuelan human rights ngo that was established in 1978 and has special consultative status at the un told the independent 1 26 19 in contact with the popular communities we consider that one of the fundamental causes of the economic crisis in the country is the effect the unilateral coercive sanctions that are applied in the economy especially by the government of the united states while internal errors also contributed to the nation s problems russian said it s likely that few countries in the world have ever suffered an economic siege like the one venezuelans are living under while the new york times and the washington post have lately professed profound and definitely 100 percent sincere concern for the welfare of venezuelans neither publication has ever referred to fundalatin alfred de zayas the first un special rapporteur to visit venezuela in 21 years told the independent 1 26 19 that us canadian and european union economic warfare has killed venezuelans noting that the sanctions fall most heavily on the poorest people and demonstrably cause death through food and medicine shortages lead to violations of human rights and are aimed at coercing economic change in a sister democracy de zayas un report noted that sanctions hind the imports necessary to produce generic medicines and seeds to increase agricultural production de zayas also cited venezuelan economist pasqualina curcio who reports that the most effective strategy to disrupt the venezuelan economy has been the manipulation of the exchange rate the rapporteur went on to suggest that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as possible crimes against humanity given that de zayas is the first un special rapporteur to report on venezuela in more than two decades one might expect the media to regard his findings as an important part of the venezuela narrative but his name does not appear in a single article ever published in the post the times has mentioned him once but not in relation to venezuela economist francisco rodríguez wola 9 20 18 points out that oil production in both venezuela and colombia dropped when oil prices fell in 2016 but venezuelan production plummeted when the us imposed financial sanctions in 2017 the economist francisco rodríguez points out that the sanctions the trump administration issued in august 2017 prohibited us banks from providing new financing to the venezuelan government a key part of the toxification of financial dealings with venezuela rodríguez notes that in august 2017 the us financial crimes enforcement network warned financial institutions that all venezuelan government agencies and bodies appear vulnerable to public corruption and money laundering and recommended that some transactions originating from venezuela be flagged as potentially criminal many financial institutions then closed venezuelan accounts concerned about the risk of being accused of participating in money laundering rodríguez says that this handcuffed venezuela s oil industry the sector most crucial to its economy with lost access to credit preventing the country from obtaining financial resources that could have been devoted to investment or maintenance and whereas previously the venezuelan government would raise production by signing joint venture agreements with foreign partners who would finance investment trump s sanctions effectively put an end to these loans mark weisbrot the nation 9 7 17 the trump administration has made an open and firm commitment to regime change through the destruction of an already debilitated venezuelan economy mark weisbrot the nation 9 7 17 also an economist raised a related issue if we step back and look at venezuela from a bird s eye view how does a country with 500 billion barrels of oil and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of minerals in the ground go broke the only way that can happen is if the country is cut off from the international financial system otherwise venezuela could sell or even collateralize some of its resources in order to get the necessary dollars the 7 7 billion in gold held in central bank reserves could be quickly collateralized for a loan in past years the us treasury department used its clout to make sure that banks who wanted to finance a swap such as jpmorgan chase and bank of america did not do so sanctions have kept the venezuelan government from accessing financing and dealing with its debt while hamstringing its most important industry given that us media are writing for a principally us audience the damage done by washington and its partners sanctions should be front and center in their coverage exactly the opposite is the case virginia lopez glass of the new york times 1 25 19 uses 920 words to describe the challenges facing venezuelans but sanctions isn t one of them even as she writes about matters to which as i ve shown above sanctions are directly relevant food and medicine shortages are widespread hundreds have died from malnutrition and illnesses that are easily curable with the appropriate treatment weaponizing hunger in venezuela in this manner is dishonest and misleading christina m schiavoni a doctoral researcher at the international institute of social studies in the hague and ana felicien and liccia romero both of whom are venezuelan scholars wrote in monthly review 6 1 18 on overt us aggression toward venezuela in the form of the intensifying economic sanctions imposed by the obama and trump administrations as well as an all out economic blockade that has made it extremely difficult for the government to make payments on food imports and manage its debt torture advocate bret stephens new york times 1 25 19 mocks the idea that sanctions and not socialism are responsible for venezuela s economic crisis bret stephens column in the times 1 28 19 only mentions the word sanctions to complain that the media supposedly isn t blaming socialism for the crisis in venezuela alleging that what you re likelier to read is that the crisis is the product of corruption cronyism populism authoritarianism resource dependency us sanctions and trickery even the residues of capitalism itself after dismissing the idea that the sanctions are a key part of the problems in venezuela stephens went on to advocate using them to bring about regime change in the country writing that the trump administration should enhance s political standing by providing access to funds that can help him establish an alternative government and entice wavering figures in the maduro camp to switch sides it can put venezuela on the list of state sponsors of terrorism these funds presumably refer the money that the us has seized from venezuela and adding the country to list of state sponsors of terrorism automatically entails hitting it with further sanctions the editorial board of the washington post 1 24 19 alleged that venezuela s government has subject the country s 32 million people to a humanitarian catastrophe without referring to what scholars whose research and writing focuses on latin america such as laura carlsen sujatha fernandes greg grandin francisco dominguez noam chomsky aviva chomsky gabriel hetland and venezuelan born historian miguel tinker salas describe common dreams 1 24 19 as sanctions cut off the means by which the venezuelan government could escape from its economic recession while causing a dramatic falloff in oil production and worsening the economic crisis and causing many people to die because they can t get access to life saving medicines later the editorial said that a us boycott of venezuelan oil could endanger ordinary venezuelans already coping with critical shortages of food power and medicine an absurd remark given that the sanctions they are occluding have had precisely these effects a washington post op ed 1 24 19 urges trump to ratchet up pressure on venezuela while insisting that the country has been driven into the ground by the repressive socialist policies pursued by nicolás maduro henry olsen in the post 1 24 19 wrote as if sanctions are a benign tool that can be used to usher in a brighter future for venezuelans rather than a key reason that so many of them find themselves in such a grim condition trump has many levers to pull short of military intervention to topple maduro he could use us pressure on the global financial system to cut off regime access to international banks freezing access to any secret accounts that the regime and probably its highest ranking leaders established offshore he can as sen marco rubio r fla has suggested work with american oil companies that purchase venezuelan oil to provide the profits from those purchases to accounts controlled by guaidó s national assembly he can also pressure china which has a far more valuable relationship with the united states than it does with venezuela to withdraw its support any or all of these measures would ratchet up pressure directly on the regime decreasing its ability to finance itself and buy support from security and military figures odds are that increasing financial pressure on the regime will finally bring about its collapse even if one momentarily sets aside that the sanctions are illegal under international law and violatethe charter of the organization of american states and that the us has no right whatsoever to decide who governs venezuela these measures don t just ratchet up pressure on the regime they also kill and immiserate ordinary venezuelans a the post s charles lane 1 28 19 wrote apologists for the regime blame us sanctions and destabilization for venezuela s problems the truth is that with the exception of the george w bush administration s brief halfhearted support for a coup attempt in 2002 washington learning the lessons of ill fated cold war interventions has shown restraint in dealing with the caracas regime he went on to write that until the trump administration announced limitations on imports of venezuelan oil that day the united states had traded with venezuela and focused economic pressure on regime leaders and key institutions which suggests that the sanctions exclusively harm the regime again even if that were true it would still be illegal and amounts to a lie given the evidence that the sanctions are crushing the venezuelan masses unlike lane and the rest of the media s regime change choir the us government has acknowledged what it s doing to venezuela schiavoni felicien and romero point to a telling remark that a senior state department official made last year the financial sanctions we have placed on the venezuelan government has forced it to begin becoming in default both on sovereign and pdvsa its oil company s debt and what we are seeing because of the bad choices of the maduro regime is a total economic collapse in venezuela so our policy is working our strategy is working and we re going to keep it on the venezuelans thus the us government acknowledges that it is knowingly consciously driving the venezuelan economy into the ground but us media make no such acknowledgment which sends the message that the problems in venezuela are entirely the fault of the government and that the us is a neutral arbiter that wants to help venezuelans call this elision what it is war propaganda source us media ignore and applaud economic war on venezuela
for many millions of americans winning decent safe and affordable housing is an urgent necessity housing costs are putting the squeeze on working families in urban and suburban settings alike especially in communities of color that have long been targeted by predatory housing schemes since the financial crisis housing affordability has grown even worse for workers as gentrification rising rents and the corporatization of rental properties both multifamily and single family homes displace communities of color and increase homelessness it s time for the american union movement to put the issue of affordable housing at the center of its quest to better the lives of american workers in much of the country the wage gains that its members may win in their contracts lag far behind the increasing costs they confront when they rent or try to purchase a home by expanding the scope of the issues they bargain for by making common cause with the many community organizations demanding more affordable housing unions can play a crucial role in creating more such housing for their members and the broader public in the process establishing new connections with a working class badly in need of unions in the years following the 2008 recession developers and private equity landlords such as blackstone and cerberus seized the opportunity to buy up recently foreclosed homes in key markets heavily populated by working class and poor people of color residents in these communities have seen landlords raise rents to unreasonable levels while systematically neglecting building maintenance to force out working class tenants and gentrify their neighborhoods these problems are markedly worse in communities hammered by hurricanes rising oceans wildfires and other climate change induced weather after each climate related disaster profiteers have moved in looking for ways to build luxury properties to replace the affordable housing destroyed by storms communities in puerto rico houston north carolina florida the new jersey shore and new york s rockaways have all witnessed this pattern despite the acute shortage of affordable housing national and local real estate lobbies still advocate trickle down housing solutions that mirror the failed theory of trickle down economics finance and real estate companies often in partnership with so called nonprofit housing champions have won bipartisan political support for the idea that we can build our way out by removing red tape and giving tax breaks and incentives for developers to create market rate housing which most people can t afford and luxury housing with minimal affordable housing requirements these forces have also used their wealth and political power to beat back progressive efforts like california s 2018 proposition 10 a citizen led initiative that would have allowed local governments to expand rent control to cover more tenants adding insult to injury developers and private equity firms have tapped the capital of public employee pension funds and college endowments using workers retirement savings to oppose progressive legislation buy up housing and price workers out of the cities where they work unions have an undeniable interest in confronting the housing crisis raises won through collective bargaining aren t keeping up with ballooning housing costs all too often workers whose wages have stagnated are forced out of their communities and into sometimes hours long commutes to work leading to increased transportation costs declines in mental and physical health worsened traffic congestion deteriorating roads and greater air pollution nor can unions help their members borrow their way into better housing many are already saddled with crushing student debt that leaves them little disposable income to apply to a mortgage yet while racial justice housing and community groups have been leading the fight for affordable housing in recent years unions have been slow to join the struggle we argue that labor should prioritize housing justice partner with groups that are fighting for it and build a broader housing movement that addresses inequality and racial injustice not only will reducing the cost of housing prevent landlords lenders and developers from pocketing the lion s share of collectively bargained raises from union members but it will also weaken the political power of those groups a necessity if unions hope to build meaningful power of their own in recent years coalitions across the country have been using an innovative tool we can apply to the housing issue bargaining for the common good bcg built around the idea that unions in partnership with community allies need to expand collective bargaining demands to include issues that go beyond wages and benefits to confront the structural forces that are driving inequality and worker disempowerment bcg first emerged among public sector unions in the aftermath of the financial crisis bcg campaigns have seen unions bring community partners into the bargaining process to help define the goals of bargaining and raise demands that confront structural inequalities and target the powerful financial interests that are invested in perpetuating them recent months have witnessed an upsurge in strikes that include common good demands from the teacher walkouts of 2018 to afscme local 3299 s work stoppage at the university of california and most recently the teachers strike in los angeles these and other struggles have helped shape bcg demands on issues from creating community centers and green spaces in inner cities to ending the school to prison pipeline to hiring from disadvantaged communities and ending predatory banking relationships the bcg approach is now expanding into the private sector as the communications workers of america cwa and the cwa backed committee for better banks organize around the idea that workers can play a central role in stopping banks from engaging in predatory lending practices organizing and bargaining for common good on housing can build on and expand the work of developing broad labor community alignments and add a new dimension to the housing fight why should community and tenant organizing groups and housing advocates include bcg campaigning in their housing justice fights to win massive increases in affordable housing they have to expand the base of housing advocates and bcg campaigns bring in unions at a critical moment bcg campaigns open up another arena in which to battle for affordable housing the collective bargaining table public sector employers universities hospitals and major corporations have not been confronted in contract negotiations or organizing campaigns with housing demands the audacity of a well run bcg fight like the recent la teachers strike makes wins possible at a larger scale than we have been able to win through more established housing campaign strategies why should unions prioritize the housing issue in addition to their obvious interest in preserving the value of the wage increases they win and ensuring their members can find affordable housing in the communities where they work five reasons stand out fighting for affordable housing offers public sector unions the opportunity to recruit and retain members in this post janus environment by addressing an issue vital to public workers lives the same entities with which unions negotiate collective bargaining agreements play a role in making housing unaffordable the private equity giant blackstone for example employs 500 000 workers and is also the nation s biggest landlord universities and hospitals where unions are either organized or organizing are often drivers of gentrification and destruction of affordable housing non union corporations like amazon and other new economy firms help drive rising rents and gentrification by holding them accountable for their impact on housing unions lay the groundwork for making them accountable for their labor policies as well public pensions are currently investing workers capital in companies that are destroying affordable housing redirecting that capital toward affordable housing will end this self defeating practice focusing on housing will allow unions to partner with and support the work of racial and housing justice groups recasting bargaining as not just for those covered by the contract but the entire community strengthening the unions ability to win economic and other gains at the bargaining table what would a national bargaining for housing justice fight look like and what themes should inform it right to the city frames housing as a human right people s action calls for guaranteed housing the partnership for working families asserts thathousing is a necessity not a commodity and that everyone has a right to safe affordable housing where they choose to live these and other groups working on housing justice seek to lift up the idea that people s access to housing shouldn t be determined solely by market forces this must also be one of any campaign s central themes the campaign should include these six elements expanding and connecting city state and national work in addition to robust statewide campaigns in new york and california for universal rent control a growing consortium of groups is working on affordable housing all over the country it is essential to ground labor s efforts by supporting and expanding the ongoing work in cities like detroit minneapolis and chicago and other places where housing is now a priority for organizers on the ground in these cities the crisis gives organizers an opportunity to expand their bases and to connect to other cities fighting similar fights linking work in different geographies by focusing on common landlords investors developers and banks that finance them offers the potential to magnify the work nationally and increase the power of local work organizing tenant unions to negotiate directly with corporate landlords private equity landlords like blackstone and cerberus operate all over the country blackstone is the nation s largest single family landlord and the largest owner of housing more generally with investments in tens of thousands of single family homes apartments manufactured home communities and mortgages a number of private equity companies have been buying up manufactured housing parks and then jacking up the rent on the land and inflating other charges for people unable to move their homes to new locations unions know how to confront corporate giants like these both hilton hotel workers and office building janitors have successfully faced off against blackstone before tenants who live in homes owned by blackstone and similar entities have also successfully confronted these behemoths in recent years a number of tenant unions have pulled off successful rent strikes mhaction an organization of mobile home tenants in rural and exurban areas from california to florida to new york has won rent victories in humboldt county california and is conducting an ongoing rent strike in akron new york tenant unions can and should negotiate over rent control needed repairs and a grievance procedure to address ongoing disputes labor unions and tenant unions could partner on national campaigns demanding that private equity companies respect the rights of unionized and non union workers alike and agree to bargain with newly formed tenant unions together tenant unions and labor unions could pressure endowments and public employee pension funds that invest in private equity to divest from companies that won t respect the rights of their tenants and workers fighting for universal rent control and state and local rent control laws rent control is critical to protecting the existing stock of affordable housing there is growing support and political pressure to pass and expand rent control policies around the country while california s rent control initiative proposition 10 was defeated in 2018 it received nearly five million votes despite the misinformation spread by the landlord lobby and the more than 70 million raised by its corporate opponents the proposition 10 fight nonetheless lifted up the importance of rent control as a critical tool to save affordable housing other fights must follow in new york there is now a statewide effort to strengthen rent laws legislation for rent control is also being introduced in illinois minneapolis philadelphia and orlando targeting corporate landlords reliance on tax breaks and public pension fund capital corporate landlords benefit from huge local and federal tax breaks and get much of their capital from public employee pension funds both the local and national campaigns should prioritize persuading pension funds to divest from corporate landlords invest in affordable housing and push to change laws that subsidize luxury development at the expense of working class communities this effort must demonstrate the long term economic benefit of increasing affordable housing even if initial returns are lower than investing in predatory corporate landlords continued investment in predatory housing schemes threatens the long term stability of pension funds and undermines the interests of the workers whose retirement incomes they invest experimenting with innovative community centered solutions community organizations and policy partners over the past years have developed many strategies to reverse the housing crisis a major part of the campaign will be expanding these efforts nationally this includes but is not limited to strengthening the community reinvestment act developing stable community land trusts and housing trust funds and funding and expanding public housing in 2018 the california based community organization alliance of californians for community empowerment acce was able to organize against a local predatory landlord and working with the oakland community land trust acquire that landlord s properties for the trust thereby making the housing permanently affordable and avoiding yet another bay area eviction for profit such efforts need to be duplicated in other settings working for federal housing legislation introducing a federal housing bill that addresses rent control and massively expands funding for public housing will help nationalize the issue setting the stage for housing justice as a central theme in the 2020 elections such legislation will also help highlight the role corporations are playing in driving up rents and challenge the idea that the solution to the crisis in public housing is to privatize it or dismantle it altogether making housing a key issue in 2020 will be critical to building momentum and support for increased affordable housing we do not claim to offer a silver bullet by presenting these strategies nor suggest that one initiative alone can address the overall housing crisis yet knitting together the elements of local and national housing fights and illuminating how they interconnect is crucial to figuring out where traditional housing groups and labor can work together to build the power necessary to address this issue this would not be the first time that unions have grappled with the housing issue historically unions have played a role in the development of affordable housing in cities with significant union membership in addition unions are involved in a variety of ongoing efforts to fund and support affordable housing the amalgamated clothing workers and the international ladies garment workers union developed cooperative housing units for their members in new york in the late 1920s subsequent to this ibew local 3 built upon their model in the late 1940s and 1950s developing 38 buildings with roughly 2 500 units in 1951 19 unions worked alongside community organizations to create the united housing foundation building tens of thousands of cooperative housing units over the ensuing two decades the afl cio s housing investment trust hit fund has put taft hartley pension funds to work in developing affordable housing and elderly housing using an exclusively union workforce building upon the work of its predecessor the mortgage investment trust the hit has focused on boston chicago new york minneapolis st paul st louis and the bay area investing in more than 70 000 affordable units some for designated groups of workers such as teachers others for that sector of the public priced out of much market rate housing in seattle locals of afscme the laborers the teamsters seiu uaw and unite here have worked together with community allies including the low income housing institute transit riders union sierra club the church council of greater seattle and the coalition of immigrants refugees and communities of color as members of the u district alliance for equity and livability a coalition focused on ensuring that existing communities stand to benefit from the substantial growth and expansion of the university of washington the u district alliance has won seattle city council support for a uw expansion plan that includes free transit passes for over 10 000 uw workers and 450 units of affordable workforce housing the chicago teachers union ctu has proposed in its upcoming contractual bargaining that the city s board of education support rent control efforts and ensure the city enacts a real estate transfer tax a corporate head tax and a millionaire s tax to fund more affordable housing central to any labor effort to advance housing justice must be the development of bargaining campaigns that expose the role key employers may play in making housing unaffordable and identify ways they can contribute to creating affordable housing in order to do this unions must ascertain whether the employer s expansion is eliminating affordable housing whether its pension plan or endowment is invested in institutions banks private equity firms that are driving housing unaffordability and whether the employer s board members are involved in business activities that lead to displacement and higher rent unions must also prepare their members for this kind of innovative community centered campaign so members are engaged and committed tacking on community demands that members haven t invested in doesn t work if these demands are to be more than mere window dressing jettisoned when bargaining gets tough the union must go deep with members long before negotiations begin to make clear how such demands could benefit them as both union members and members of the community specific bargaining demands can then be tailored to employers of different kinds consider these possibilities universities and hospitals often eliminate affordable housing through expansion into surrounding neighborhoods unions could develop bargaining demands and bargaining campaigns that call on these institutions to finance and rebuild any affordable housing lost to expansion develop workforce housing that allows workers to live closer to their jobs and end support for or membership in business associations such as the chamber of commerce or alec that oppose rent control and affordable housing initiatives public sector unions can expand their ongoing battle against privatization to fight the selling off of public property to private developers often with additional tax subsidies that undermine government s revenue streams these unions could demand that public property be preserved for community land trusts and affordable housing insist that governments secure workforce housing that allows their workers to live in the communities they serve and use their pension funds to advance affordable housing amazon s announcement that it is canceling its hq2 in new york in the face of community and labor protests over the 3 billion in subsidies the company demanded shows how a community labor alliance can flip the script future amazon targeted campaigns can link demands for better working conditions with demands that amazon invest in affordable housing and other community benefits this is already happening in minneapolis and st paul there the atwood center has demanded that amazon contribute millions of dollars to local initiatives determined by community groups in the twins cities east african community which provides the majority of amazon s warehouse workers in the region banks have long played a major role in undermining affordable housing through foreclosures redlining and other forms of discrimination as part of a campaign to organize bank workers cwa and the committee for better banks are exposing practices that force bank workers into selling products that aren t in their customers best interest bank workers could demand the right to refrain from peddling predatory mortgages as part of bargaining unions can demand that employers stop investing in and partnering with private equity firms that destroy jobs and affordable housing some might argue that it is foolhardy for unions to challenge corporations on multiple fronts beyond wages and benefits to the contrary we believe that an unambitious strategy condemns unions to a continued slide toward irrelevance and that it was precisely the boldness of the teachers hotel workers and other campaigns over the past year that led to their successes only by engaging in campaigns that confront the unjust structures that increasingly dominate every part of workers lives can unions hope to rebuild power and transform the country organizing and bargaining for housing justice will be central to that task

one step closer to ruin blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt herbert hoover today we pause to acknowledge a sad mile marker another waypoint on the road to the poorhouse this week for the first time in its 244 years total united states debt exceeds 22 trillion the last 2 trillion has piled on since mr trump donned the imperial purple the united states required 205 years to ring up its first 1 trillion debt but only 11 months for its 22nd that is what was previously the work of two centuries is now the work of 11 months here is progress of a peculiar and exotic sort but large numbers exert a dulling effect on the sober senses like large bottles of wine a 10 000 dinner bill for example will freeze your blood it will torment you stagger you hagride you kill you because though extravagant you can relate to figures in this range but a trillion dollar bill will glaze your eyes not in 100 lifetimes could you hope to satisfy it a trillion ranges beyond all fathoming all imagination you would laugh it away and depart the restaurant instructing the owner where he can place his bill so let us attempt to reduce the airy abstract to solid concrete how to imagine 1 trillion the nonprofit employment policies institute places 1 trillion into this perspective let s say someone told you to wait for something if you waited 1 000 seconds it d only take about 17 minutes if you waited 1 million seconds you d have to wait about 11 5 days but if you waited 1 trillion seconds you d have to wait 31 688 years returning to our poor example perhaps you can tell the restaurateur he will have his money in 1 trillion seconds your offer would likely appear very reasonable let us mix the figure some assume for the moment you are placed in command of the printing press but you are limited to 1 bills being exceptionally energetic you produce one 1 bill each second of the day 365 days of the year how long would you require to print 1 trillion 1 bills author bill bryson if you initialed 1 per second you would make 1 000 every 17 minutes after 12 days of nonstop effort you would acquire your first 1 million thus it would take you 120 days to accumulate 10 million and 1 200 days something over three years to reach 100 million after 31 7 years you would become a billionaire but not until after 31 709 8 years would you count your trillionth dollar but your sole concern is the national welfare you therefore consecrate yourself to retiring the national debt in that case you multiply the preceding by 22 here is what you find writing off today s 22 trillion debt would require 697 615 6 years of ceaseless labor assume the almighty grants you your threescore and 10 70 years in 9 965 9 lifetimes you would complete the business heaven indeed can wait fortunately so must hell but you say we conjure a phantom menace the united states gdp is 20 trillion put next to it a 22 trillion debt is not half so daunting but the trend is debt is growing faster than the economy michael peterson ceo of the nonpartisan peter g peterson foundation reaching this unfortunate milestone so rapidly is the latest sign that our fiscal situation is not only unsustainable but accelerating gdp has increased some 35 since 2008 but the national debt 122 meantime average real annual economic growth since 2009 runs to 2 23 and the congressional budget office cbo estimates gdp growth will limp along at an average 1 9 per annum the next decade but it estimates debt is expanding at a 6 annual rate once again the trend but cbo s growth forecast may be optimistic it fails to account for possible recession the current expansion is the second longest in u s history by july it will become the longest if the gods are merciful how much longer can the economy peg along without a recession permanent deficits are the new religion in a growing economy the old keynesians preach a gospel of fiscal restraint it is the time to squirrel away acorns and save against a season of lean kine when recession inevitably arrives the government can then meet the emergency with a full war chest countercyclical policy academic men term it but even the old keynesian religion has gone behind a cloud in its place we find the religion of perpetual deficit analyst john rubino on the new catechism even keynesianism generally the most debt friendly school of economic thought views deficit spending as a cyclical stabilizer that is in bad times governments should borrow and spend to keep the economy growing while in good times governments should scale back borrowing and ideally run surpluses to keep things from overheating but now we seem to have turned that logic on its head with fiscal stimulus ramping up in the best of times when unemployment is low stock prices high and inflation stirring new fiscal policy seems to call for continuous and growing deficits pretty much forever when recession is finally upon us depend on it the spending floodgates will open and today s trillion dollar deficits will trifle in comparison we get a recession affirms analyst sven henrich and you are looking at 2 3 trillion deficits a tripartisan approach to government spending but perhaps we can plug the holes to keep current debt levels even it is possible in theory but impossible in practice cbo estimates congress would have to increase revenues 11 each year while simultaneously slicing the budget 10 will congress spend 10 less each year as well imagine a circular square a flying whale or an honest liar within 10 years cbo projects federal spending will surge from today s 20 8 of gdp to 23 0 this is of course a bipartisan effort rather it is a tripartisan effort we the people are as responsible as the politicians we elect meantime the united states spent 523 billion servicing its debt in fiscal year 2018 a record and cbo projects debt service will rise to 915 billion by 2028 nearly 25 of the entire budget 915 billion roughly approximates last year s combined medicare and medicaid costs rising debt service will likely lower the curtain on the entire show as rising borrowing costs swamp the economic machinery at that point the entire illusion that deficits do not matter will crash upon the rocks of mathematical fact as we have written before the divine wrath is slow indeed in vengeance said roman historian valerius maximus nearly 2 000 years ago but it makes up for its tardiness by the severity of the punishment the current recovery is nine years old and counting regards brian maher managing editor the daily reckoning

once upon a time in a land far far away there grew a magical fruit this fruit could be squeezed to produce a very special kind of oil that made cookies more healthy soap more bubbly and crisps more crispy the oil could even make lipstick smoother and keep ice cream from melting because of these wondrous qualities people came from around the world to buy the fruit and its oil in the places where the fruit came from people burned down the forest so they could plant more trees that grew the fruit making lots of nasty smoke and sending all of the creatures of the forest scurrying away when the trees were burned they emitted a gas that heated up the air then everybody was upset because they loved the forest s creatures and thought the temperature was warm enough already a few people decided they shouldn t use the oil any more but mostly things went on as before and the forest kept burning this is a true story except that it is not magic the fruit of the oil palm tree elaeis guineensis which grows in tropical climates contains the world s most versatile vegetable oil it can handle frying without spoiling and blends well with other oils its combination of different types of fats and its consistency after refining make it a popular ingredient in packaged baked goods its low production costs make it cheaper than frying oils such as cottonseed or sunflower it provides the foaming agent in virtually every shampoo liquid soap or detergent cosmetics manufacturers prefer it to animal tallow for its ease of application and low price it is increasingly used as a cheap raw material for biofuels especially in the european union it functions as a natural preservative in processed foods and actually does raise the melting point of ice cream palm oil can be used as an adhesive that binds together the particles in fibreboard oil palm trunks and fronds can be made into everything from plywood to the composite body of malaysia s national automobile worldwide production of palm oil has been climbing steadily for five decades between 1995 and 2015 annual production quadrupled from 15 2m tonnes to 62 6m tonnes by 2050 it is expected to quadruple again reaching 240m tonnes the footprint of palm oil production is astounding plantations to produce it account for 10 of permanent global cropland today 3 billion people in 150 countries use products containing palm oil globally we each consume an average of 8kg of palm oil a year of this 85 comes from malaysia and indonesia where worldwide demand for palm oil has lifted incomes especially in rural areas but at the cost of tremendous environmental devastation and often with attendant labour and human rights abuses fires set to clear forests and create land for more palm plantations are the top source of greenhouse gas emissions in indonesia a country of 261 million people the financial incentive to produce more palm oil is helping to warm the planet while destroying the only habitat of sumatran tigers sumatran rhinos and orangutans driving them towards extinction yet consumers are often unaware they are even using the stuff palm oil investigations which dubs itself the palm oil watchdog lists more than 200 common ingredients in food and home and personal care products containing palm oil only about 10 of which include the telltale word palm how did palm oil insinuate itself into every corner of our lives no single innovation caused palm oil consumption to soar instead it was the perfect commodity at the right moment for industry after industry each of which adopted it to replace ingredients and never turned back at the same time producing nations view palm oil as a poverty reduction scheme while international finance organisations view it as a growth engine for developing economies the international monetary fund imf has pushed malaysia and indonesia to produce more as the palm industry expanded conservationists and environmental organisations such as greenpeace started to raise the alarm about its devastating effects on carbon emissions and wildlife habitat however it is not impossible to produce palm oil sustainably and several organisations certify sustainable producers in response a backlash against palm oil has developed last april the supermarket iceland pledged that it would cut palm oil from all its own brand foods by the end of 2018 in december norway banned imports for biofuel production but by the time awareness of palm oil s impact had spread it was so deeply embedded in the consumer economy that it now may be too late to remove it tellingly iceland found it impossible to fulfill its 2018 pledge instead the company ended up removing its branding from foods containing palm oil rather than removing palm oil from all of its branded foods determining which products contain palm oil let alone how sustainably it has been sourced requires an almost supernatural level of consumer consciousness in any case greater consumer awareness in the west will not have much impact given that europe and the us account for less than 14 of global demand more than half of global demand comes from asia it was a good 20 years after the first alarms about deforestation in brazil that consumer action slowed not stopped the destruction with palm oil the reality is that the western part of world is of palm oil consumption and the rest of the world doesn t give a shit said neil blomquist managing director of colorado based natural habitats which produces palm oil in ecuador and sierra leone to the highest level of sustainability certification so there s not much incentive to change palm oil s world domination is the result of five factors first it has replaced less healthy fats in foods in the west second producers have pushed to keep its price low third it has replaced more expensive oils in home and personal care products fourth again because it is cheap it has been widely adopted as cooking oil in asian countries finally as those asian countries have grown richer they have begun to consume more fat much of it in the form of palm oil widespread adoption of palm oil began with processed foods in the 1960s scientists began to warn that butter s high saturated fat content may increase the risk of heart disease food manufacturers including the british dutch conglomerate unilever began to replace it with margarine made with vegetable oils low in saturated fat by the early 1990s though it became clear that the process by which the oils in margarine were made known as partial hydrogenation actually created a different kind of fat trans fat that was even unhealthier than saturated fat the unilever board of directors saw a scientific consensus forming against trans fat and decided to get rid of it unilever was always very conscious of the health interests of consumers of its products said james w kinnear a unilever board member at the time the switchover happened suddenly in 1994 a unilever refineries manager named gerrit van duijn received a call from his bosses in rotterdam twenty unilever plants in 15 countries needed to remove partially hydrogenated oils from 600 fat blends and replace them with trans fat free components view image in fullscreen a fire at an oil palm plantation in pekanbaru sumatra due to intensive farming methods and the dry season photograph afp getty the project for reasons van duijn can t explain was called paddington first he needed to figure out what could replace trans fat while maintaining its favourable properties such as remaining solid at room temperature a necessity for inexpensive butter substitutes as well as manufactured goods such as cookies in the end there was only one choice oil from the oil palm tree either palm oil extracted from the fruit or palm kernel oil from the seed no other oil could be refined to the consistency needed for unilever s various margarine blends and baked goods without producing trans fat it was the only alternative to partially hydrogenated oils van duijn told me palm oil and palm kernel oil were also lower in saturated fat than butter the switch at each plant had to occur simultaneously the production lines couldn t handle a mixture of the old oils and the new on a certain day all these tanks had to be emptied of trans containing components and refilled with trans free components van duijn said logistically that was quite a nightmare purchasing additional tanks would have been too expensive as unilever had sometimes used palm oil previously a supply chain was already up and running but it took six weeks for the raw material to be shipped from malaysia to europe and van duijn had three months to make the switch he started to buy more and more palm and palm kernel oils arranging for the shipments to be trucked in to the various plants on schedule then one day in 1995 with trucks queued up outside unilever plants across europe it was done it was a moment that changed the processed food industry forever unilever was the trailblazer after van duijn organised the company s switch to palm oil virtually every other food manufacturer followed in 2001 the american heart association issued a statement declaring that the optimal diet for reducing risk of chronic diseases is one in which saturated fatty acids are reduced and trans fatty acids from manufactured fats are virtually eliminated today more than two thirds of palm oil goes into food consumption in the eu more than tripled between project paddington and 2015 that same year the us food and drug administration fda gave food manufacturers three years to get rid of all trans fats from every margarine cookie cake pie popcorn frozen pizza doughnut and biscuit sold in the us virtually all of it has now been replaced with palm oil for all the palm oil that now goes into food in europe and the us asia uses far more india china and indonesia account for nearly 40 of all palm oil consumed worldwide where they once cooked with soya oil palm oil has replaced it growth has been fastest in india where an accelerating economy has been another factor in palm oil s newfound popularity one of the commonalities of economic development across the globe and throughout history is that a population s consumption of fat grows in lockstep with its income and the subcontinent has been no exception between 1993 and 2013 indian per capita gdp expanded from 298 to 1 452 over the same period fat consumption in rural areas grew by 35 and in urban areas by 25 and palm oil has been a major ingredient in this escalation government subsidised fair price shops a food distribution network for the poor started selling imported palm oil in 1978 mainly for cooking two years later the 290 000 shops were unloading 273 500 tonnes by 1995 indian imports of palm oil had climbed to nearly 1m tonnes reaching more than 9m tonnes by 2015 in those years the poverty rate fell by half while the population climbed by 36 but palm oil is no longer just used for home cooking in india today it is a big part of the country s growing junk food industry india s fast food market grew 83 just between 2011 and 2016 between them domino s pizza subway pizza hut kfc mcdonald s and dunkin donuts all of which use palm oil now have 2 784 stores in the country according to reporting by the nation packaged food sales spiked 138 over roughly the same period for pennies you can buy dozens of packaged snacks containing palm oil palm oil s versatility is not limited to food unlike other oils it can be easily and inexpensively fractionated separated into oils of different consistencies which disposes it to multiple uses it has a tremendous advantage because of its versatility said carl bek nielsen chief executive director of united plantations berhad a malaysia based palm oil producer not long after the processed food business discovered the magical properties of palm oil industries as diverse as personal care products and transport fuel would also begin using it to replace other oils but just as trans fats were chosen for perceived benefits only to turn out to be worse than what they had replaced palm oil was initially adopted in large part for its perceived environmental friendliness as palm oil became more widely used in food the world over it was also replacing animal products in cleaning products and personal care items such as soap shampoo lotion and makeup today 70 of personal care items contain one or more palm oil derivatives historically soap often came from animal tallow and shampoo which originated on the indian subcontinent was first made with plant based surfactants a substance that acts as a detergent emulsifier or foaming agent later synthetic ingredients came into favour with animal tallow joining them in the 20th century in the 1980s the personal care industry started to notice a consumer preference for natural ingredients which a lot of consumers figured was synonymous with plant based rather than animal based said chris sayner vice president for corporate sustainability at croda a chemical company croda s customers started asking if it could come up with plant based surfactant formulations without tallow just as van duijn had discovered at unilever the composition of palm oil and palm kernel oil made them the perfect substitute manufacturers looking for alternatives found that palm and palm kernel oils contain the same set of fat types as tallow no other alternative could provide the same advantages across such a wide range of products alternate sources were looked at sayner recalled palm and palm kernel oil dropped in as the replacement view image in fullscreen a deforested palm oil concession in papua indonesia photograph ulet ifansasti greenpeace sayner believes that the bse outbreak of the early 1990s when a brain disease among cattle spread to some people who ate beef triggered a larger shift in consumption habits public opinion brand equity and marketing all came together to move away from animal based products in more fashion oriented industries like personal care companies across europe and the us that croda supplied started to make the switch the change from animal based fats to palm oil came with a certain irony in the past when tallow was used in products such as soaps a byproduct of the meat industry animal fat was put to good use now in response to consumers desire for ingredients perceived as more natural the makers of soaps detergents and cosmetics have replaced a local waste product with one that must be transported thousands of miles and that causes environmental destruction in the countries where it is produced although of course the meat industry comes with its own environmental harm what s better environmentally than using a byproduct that exists on your doorstep sayner asked a similar thing happened with biofuels the intent to reduce environmental harm had unintended consequences in 1997 a european commission report called for increasing the percentage of total energy consumption from renewable sources three years later it cited the environmental benefits of biofuels for transport and in 2009 adopted the renewable energy directive red which included a 10 target for the share of transport fuels coming from biofuels by 2020 unlike in food and home and personal care products where palm s chemical makeup makes it the perfect alternative when it comes to biofuel palm soybean rapeseed and sunflower oils all perform equally well but palm has one big advantage over these rival oils price the eu policies created an unprecedented market for the uptake of palm oil said kalyana sundram ceo of the malaysian palm oil council a trade group legislative attempts in the west to curb the environmental harm of fossil fuels the us adopted its own biofuel mandate in 2007 had severe environmental consequences in less developed countries contributing significantly to global warming eu palm oil imports shot up 15 the year after the red reaching an all time high and 19 the year after that as biofuel use tripled in the eu between 2011 and 2014 palm oil s share of biofuel raw material leapt fivefold in that period half of the eu s palm oil now goes to biofuel double the share prior to the red sustainability criteria were later added although oxfam and others have criticised their effectiveness and earlier this month european commissioners proposed new limits on biofuel crops tied to deforestation but the damage had already been done the oil palm is blessed with many attributes that have helped it on its path to dominance it is perennial and evergreen enabling year round production it is exceptionally efficient at photosynthesis for a perennial tree and requires less preparation of the soil than other sources of vegetable oils reducing costs it can succeed in soils that can t sustain other crops most importantly it gives the highest yield per acre of any oilseed crop almost five times as much oil per acre as rapeseed almost six times as much as sunflower and more than eight times as much as soybeans boycotts of palm oil will only lead to its replacement by other crops needing far more farmland and likely more deforestation the cost of production is far less than any compared vegetable or animal fat said sundram of the malaysian palm oil council industry is simply palming off the benefits to the consumer for decades palm s production advantage went unrealised until a scot named leslie davidson instigated perhaps the most significant innovation in the industry s history davidson had come to british malaya in 1951 at the age of 20 to work on a unilever plantation four years later the company transferred him to cameroon the oil palm originated in west africa and had been introduced from there to malaysia in 1875 in cameroon davidson noticed that insects resembling rice weevils surrounded palm fruits in malaya the plantations were employing hundreds of people to hand pollinate the flowers yet pollination occurred more efficiently in cameroon when unilever sent davidson back to malaya now malaysia in 1960 he told his bosses he thought the malaysian industry was going about pollination all wrong and that insects were the natural pollinators of oil palm they told him to mind your own business and don t get involved said carl bek nielsen who knew davidson in 1974 davidson became vice chair of unilever international plantations group he recruited three entomologists led by the pakistani scientist rahman syed who travelled to cameroon to investigate eventually syed determined that davidson s hunch was correct a particular species of weevil was pollinating the oil palm trees and davidson received permission from the malaysian government to import some on 21 february 1981 2 000 elaeidobius kamerunicus were released at unilever s mamor estate in johor results were seen immediately with no adverse effects and the pollinating weevils were distributed across malaysia the following year the country saw an increase in yield of 400 000 tonnes of palm oil and 300 000 tonnes of palm kernels the new pollination technique was a key factor in palm oil s growth as yields climbed and the cost of labour to manually pollinate the trees was more efficiently deployed for picking the fruit there was an explosion in the volume of land devoted to oil palm plantations davidson had radically changed the future of malaysia and indonesia view image in fullscreen a worker with palm oil fruits at a plantation in mamuju indonesia photograph antara foto agency reuters but the changes wouldn t have occurred without pushes from policymakers in both countries we ve seen a lot of effort from both governments into supporting the sector because it s an easy way to develop the economy said raquel moreno peñaranda research fellow at united nations university s institute of advanced studies in tokyo who studies agricultural systems and advises governments malaysia s minister of primary industries teresa kok told the european palm oil conference in madrid in october palm oil is synonymous with poverty eradication malaysia began its programme to boost palm exports as a means of poverty reduction in 1961 four years after independence from britain rubber had been a key crop but with prices falling the government initiated a programme to replace rubber plantations with oil palm in 1968 malaysia provided palm oil producers with a series of tax breaks industry subsequently invested heavily in milling technology to extract the oil from the fruit in the early 1970s fractionation was developed expanding the applications of palm oil for both food and other uses more recently plantation owners have found profitable uses for waste such as empty fruit bunches palm fronds palm fruit peels and palm kernel shells mill effluent that was once dumped into nearby streams now produces electricity these new revenue streams reduce planters risk by providing income even when palm oil prices are down such as right now and have helped them face headwinds such as the increasing costs of labour and fertiliser but the push for increased palm oil production has not only come from inside malaysia and indonesia world bank policies in the 1970s encouraged the indonesian government to expand palm among small farmers the 1998 economic crisis in asia shattered exports of manufactured goods from the region but commodity exports which were sold in dollars came in like a life vest in rough choppy seas bek nielsen recalled the imf s bailout package for indonesia required that it generate revenue by cultivating natural resources and erase export taxes the government had imposed to keep prices low at home the measures further incentivised expansion of palm plantations alongside the imf private finance has helped boost production dutch banks alone provided more than 12bn in loans to indonesian palm producers in the years 1995 99 the short term benefits to plantation owners and labourers producer nations governments and financiers have come with enormous long term costs to the global climate forests destroyed for oil palm plantations are among the most carbon rich in the world when they are burned that carbon is released palm oil now accounts for 13 7 of malaysia s gross national income and is indonesia s top export in october at the european palm oil association meeting in madrid government officials from the two countries trumpeted the successes in poverty reduction they had achieved thanks to palm oil though growers in indonesia at least have disputed these claims calling on government and industry to do more for farmers independent of the big plantations officials further insisted that deforestation was being halted and sustainability achieved even as another speaker told the attendees deforestation had actually increased in some areas over the previous decade in september indonesia s president signed a three year moratorium on new palm plantation development commodity producing countries need only answer to their buyers though while those buyers must respond to consumers in 2004 the environmental ngo friends of the earth uk released a report detailing deforestation rates from palm oil production as the outcry spread and concern rose among producers that the continued deforestation would become a risk to their reputations the world wildlife federation that year convinced a small number of palm growers manufacturers and retailers to establish the roundtable on sustainable palm oil a decade later most of the major users of palm oil had committed to production the rspo deemed sustainable and 19 of global product was certified as such by the organisation but the environmental investigation agency an offshoot of greenpeace three years ago found rspo to be woefully substandard and in some cases colluding to disguise violations rspo responded in a statement that it takes very seriously the claims contained in the eia report and welcomes it as an opportunity for intensifying this dialogue and further its certification system it is extraordinarily difficult to make sure that palm oil is being sustainably produced a single palm oil mill there are hundreds in malaysia alone can buy fruit from a multitude of suppliers and with all its formulations and derivatives palm oil has one of the most complicated supply chains of any ingredient even when the sustainability certification system is working as it is supposed to environmentalists have criticised such programmes for instance a product can earn a certified sustainable label even if 99 of the palm oil it includes came from freshly deforested land the rspo says having less strict certification criteria encourages participation the hope being that manufacturers of retail products will ramp up to higher levels once they see they can sell certified palm oil for a higher price before the european palm oil association meeting rspo s head of european operations inke van der sluijs admitted that very few companies do because of the complexity and length of the supply chain rspo is widely viewed by environmentalists as the most robust of several certification systems and encourages manufacturers to use rspo certified oil nevertheless half of certified sustainable palm oil isn t sold as sustainable until a sufficient number of consumers are willing to pay the higher price for certified palm oil little will change moreover the vast majority of palm oil is traced only as far as the mill where it s processed not to the field where it s produced eyes on the forest a coalition of indonesian ngos that includes the wwf the same organisation that spurred palm oil certification said in a 2016 report that mill traceability wastes time and money without offering a solution to the issues of illegal product entering the supply chains there is now a growing effort to deploy technology to trace each bunch of fruit to a field and farmer which would finally ensure new deforestation isn t occurring to produce palm oil the other hope for halting deforestation for palm is increasing yields the idea being that if more oil can come from existing plantations it will obviate the need to expand the planting area into biodiverse forest rajinder singh leader of the genomics group at the malaysian palm oil board a government agency has been identifying genetic signatures associated with certain traits so high yielding palms can be selected and land isn t wasted on trees that don t produce much the best plantations currently yield around six or seven tonnes of oil per hectare but singh said we ve seen individual palms that can give almost double the amount of oil compared to common strains as trees reach the end of their productive life of 25 30 years they could be replaced by more prolific strains but even doubling yields won t meet the near quadrupling of demand expected by 2050 there is no easy solution replacing palm with other oils will only accelerate deforestation since none of its competitors boast anywhere near its yield per unit of land palm accounts for 6 6 of cultivated land for oils and fats while delivering 38 7 of the output according to the european palm oil alliance an industry group colombia is aggressively pursuing palm oil development in areas formerly devoted to illegal crops such as coca but it has a lot of catching up to match asia s output palm oil has become ubiquitous because it is the perfect ingredient for a number of growing industries the perfect export for developing economies and the perfect commodity for the globalised economy that links them wealthy consumers are capitalising on the cheap labour and valuable rainforest that developing nations have in abundance and are willing to part with at a discount to accelerate their economic growth but that model isn t sustainable if things continue the forests and their creatures will be gone and the cost of labour will increase as some workers move up the economic ladder and realise there are better things they could be doing than picking fruit palm oil producers and consumers will be left with nothing products that are sustainable are those produced and consumed locally when buyers are able to witness the production process they will demand that it occur in line with their values when it s out of sight it s difficult to get enough of them to care changing that may require more than a little magic follow the long read on twitter at

gregory shupak examines the silences that organize the mainstream media s coverage of the crisis in the caribbean nation the us media chorus supporting a us overthrow of the venezuelan government has for years pointed to the country s economic crisis as a justification for regime change while whitewashing the ways in which the us has strangled the venezuelan economy fair org 3 22 18 a un rapporteur declares that sanctions kill independent 1 26 19 but few in western media are listening to his message sister eugenia russian president of fundalatin a venezuelan human rights ngo that was established in 1978 and has special consultative status at the un told the independent 1 26 19 in contact with the popular communities we consider that one of the fundamental causes of the economic crisis in the country is the effect the unilateral coercive sanctions that are applied in the economy especially by the government of the united states while internal errors also contributed to the nation s problems russian said it s likely that few countries in the world have ever suffered an economic siege like the one venezuelans are living under while the new york times and the washington post have lately professed profound and definitely 100 percent sincere concern for the welfare of venezuelans neither publication has ever referred to fundalatin alfred de zayas the first un special rapporteur to visit venezuela in 21 years told the independent 1 26 19 that us canadian and european union economic warfare has killed venezuelans noting that the sanctions fall most heavily on the poorest people and demonstrably cause death through food and medicine shortages lead to violations of human rights and are aimed at coercing economic change in a sister democracy de zayas un report noted that sanctions hind the imports necessary to produce generic medicines and seeds to increase agricultural production de zayas also cited venezuelan economist pasqualina curcio who reports that the most effective strategy to disrupt the venezuelan economy has been the manipulation of the exchange rate the rapporteur went on to suggest that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as possible crimes against humanity given that de zayas is the first un special rapporteur to report on venezuela in more than two decades one might expect the media to regard his findings as an important part of the venezuela narrative but his name does not appear in a single article ever published in the post the times has mentioned him once but not in relation to venezuela economist francisco rodríguez wola 9 20 18 points out that oil production in both venezuela and colombia dropped when oil prices fell in 2016 but venezuelan production plummeted when the us imposed financial sanctions in 2017 the economist francisco rodríguez points out that the sanctions the trump administration issued in august 2017 prohibited us banks from providing new financing to the venezuelan government a key part of the toxification of financial dealings with venezuela rodríguez notes that in august 2017 the us financial crimes enforcement network warned financial institutions that all venezuelan government agencies and bodies appear vulnerable to public corruption and money laundering and recommended that some transactions originating from venezuela be flagged as potentially criminal many financial institutions then closed venezuelan accounts concerned about the risk of being accused of participating in money laundering rodríguez says that this handcuffed venezuela s oil industry the sector most crucial to its economy with lost access to credit preventing the country from obtaining financial resources that could have been devoted to investment or maintenance and whereas previously the venezuelan government would raise production by signing joint venture agreements with foreign partners who would finance investment trump s sanctions effectively put an end to these loans mark weisbrot the nation 9 7 17 the trump administration has made an open and firm commitment to regime change through the destruction of an already debilitated venezuelan economy mark weisbrot the nation 9 7 17 also an economist raised a related issue if we step back and look at venezuela from a bird s eye view how does a country with 500 billion barrels of oil and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of minerals in the ground go broke the only way that can happen is if the country is cut off from the international financial system otherwise venezuela could sell or even collateralize some of its resources in order to get the necessary dollars the 7 7 billion in gold held in central bank reserves could be quickly collateralized for a loan in past years the us treasury department used its clout to make sure that banks who wanted to finance a swap such as jpmorgan chase and bank of america did not do so sanctions have kept the venezuelan government from accessing financing and dealing with its debt while hamstringing its most important industry given that us media are writing for a principally us audience the damage done by washington and its partners sanctions should be front and center in their coverage exactly the opposite is the case virginia lopez glass of the new york times 1 25 19 uses 920 words to describe the challenges facing venezuelans but sanctions isn t one of them even as she writes about matters to which as i ve shown above sanctions are directly relevant food and medicine shortages are widespread hundreds have died from malnutrition and illnesses that are easily curable with the appropriate treatment weaponizing hunger in venezuela in this manner is dishonest and misleading christina m schiavoni a doctoral researcher at the international institute of social studies in the hague and ana felicien and liccia romero both of whom are venezuelan scholars wrote in monthly review 6 1 18 on overt us aggression toward venezuela in the form of the intensifying economic sanctions imposed by the obama and trump administrations as well as an all out economic blockade that has made it extremely difficult for the government to make payments on food imports and manage its debt torture advocate bret stephens new york times 1 25 19 mocks the idea that sanctions and not socialism are responsible for venezuela s economic crisis bret stephens column in the times 1 28 19 only mentions the word sanctions to complain that the media supposedly isn t blaming socialism for the crisis in venezuela alleging that what you re likelier to read is that the crisis is the product of corruption cronyism populism authoritarianism resource dependency us sanctions and trickery even the residues of capitalism itself after dismissing the idea that the sanctions are a key part of the problems in venezuela stephens went on to advocate using them to bring about regime change in the country writing that the trump administration should enhance s political standing by providing access to funds that can help him establish an alternative government and entice wavering figures in the maduro camp to switch sides it can put venezuela on the list of state sponsors of terrorism these funds presumably refer the money that the us has seized from venezuela and adding the country to list of state sponsors of terrorism automatically entails hitting it with further sanctions the editorial board of the washington post 1 24 19 alleged that venezuela s government has subject the country s 32 million people to a humanitarian catastrophe without referring to what scholars whose research and writing focuses on latin america such as laura carlsen sujatha fernandes greg grandin francisco dominguez noam chomsky aviva chomsky gabriel hetland and venezuelan born historian miguel tinker salas describe common dreams 1 24 19 as sanctions cut off the means by which the venezuelan government could escape from its economic recession while causing a dramatic falloff in oil production and worsening the economic crisis and causing many people to die because they can t get access to life saving medicines later the editorial said that a us boycott of venezuelan oil could endanger ordinary venezuelans already coping with critical shortages of food power and medicine an absurd remark given that the sanctions they are occluding have had precisely these effects a washington post op ed 1 24 19 urges trump to ratchet up pressure on venezuela while insisting that the country has been driven into the ground by the repressive socialist policies pursued by nicolás maduro henry olsen in the post 1 24 19 wrote as if sanctions are a benign tool that can be used to usher in a brighter future for venezuelans rather than a key reason that so many of them find themselves in such a grim condition trump has many levers to pull short of military intervention to topple maduro he could use us pressure on the global financial system to cut off regime access to international banks freezing access to any secret accounts that the regime and probably its highest ranking leaders established offshore he can as sen marco rubio r fla has suggested work with american oil companies that purchase venezuelan oil to provide the profits from those purchases to accounts controlled by guaidó s national assembly he can also pressure china which has a far more valuable relationship with the united states than it does with venezuela to withdraw its support any or all of these measures would ratchet up pressure directly on the regime decreasing its ability to finance itself and buy support from security and military figures odds are that increasing financial pressure on the regime will finally bring about its collapse even if one momentarily sets aside that the sanctions are illegal under international law and violatethe charter of the organization of american states and that the us has no right whatsoever to decide who governs venezuela these measures don t just ratchet up pressure on the regime they also kill and immiserate ordinary venezuelans a the post s charles lane 1 28 19 wrote apologists for the regime blame us sanctions and destabilization for venezuela s problems the truth is that with the exception of the george w bush administration s brief halfhearted support for a coup attempt in 2002 washington learning the lessons of ill fated cold war interventions has shown restraint in dealing with the caracas regime he went on to write that until the trump administration announced limitations on imports of venezuelan oil that day the united states had traded with venezuela and focused economic pressure on regime leaders and key institutions which suggests that the sanctions exclusively harm the regime again even if that were true it would still be illegal and amounts to a lie given the evidence that the sanctions are crushing the venezuelan masses unlike lane and the rest of the media s regime change choir the us government has acknowledged what it s doing to venezuela schiavoni felicien and romero point to a telling remark that a senior state department official made last year the financial sanctions we have placed on the venezuelan government has forced it to begin becoming in default both on sovereign and pdvsa its oil company s debt and what we are seeing because of the bad choices of the maduro regime is a total economic collapse in venezuela so our policy is working our strategy is working and we re going to keep it on the venezuelans thus the us government acknowledges that it is knowingly consciously driving the venezuelan economy into the ground but us media make no such acknowledgment which sends the message that the problems in venezuela are entirely the fault of the government and that the us is a neutral arbiter that wants to help venezuelans call this elision what it is war propaganda the views expressed in this article are the author s own and do not necessarily reflect those of the venezuelanalysis editorial staff

minister mthuli ncube that the zimdollar will be back within 12 months and delays in monetary policy statement mps have helped narrow down expected outcomes contrary to the view that these factors have instead increased uncertainty by respect gwenzi unfolding events since the beginning of 2019 have helped give a clearer view in terms of expectations on the policy side of the economy the reactionary fuel price increase announcements by the finance minister mthuli ncube that the zimdollar will be back within 12 months and delays in monetary policy statement mps have helped narrow down expected outcomes contrary to the view that these factors have instead increased uncertainty this article will explore what we believe to be possible indications and expectations on the policy front going forward and further proffer guidance to business in terms of risk mitigation given the possibilities in pure sequence of events and ahead of davos 2019 economic pressure was mounting characterised by severe fuel shortages and although fuel supply has been erratic for three years the january 2019 levels were a notch higher ncube was the first to highlight at a pre davos townhall meeting that government had no capacity to contain the fuel crisis at that meeting he said the government had secured 20 million worth of fuel which we deduced to be in the region of 40 million litres and given the then fuel consumption rate amounted to only a four days supply now would a four day supply help to alleviate two weeks long dry spells and even cover future needs it was inevitable that something had to yield and although the price hike was unpopular it could buy time on government s side because as shown there were no funds to secure the supplies the government s response through a 150 fuel price hike was again misread by most of the populace and it is paramount to elaborate increasing the price of fuel in local money terms could rebalance the market to some extent in the short run but the mid to long term effect is significant inflation in his justification for the price increase the president said he sought to close the gap caused by illegal black market dealers essentially there were two things one being the black market exchange rate for dollars and the black market for fuel the black market price for fuel was around us 1 12 per litre which could be acquired for bond 3 80 on the same black market so the gap was a pump price bond 1 38 and a bond 3 80 black market price what the responsible authorities failed to read is that the black market forex rate was a moving variable which was not within their control and an upward movement which was likely anyway would result in yet another gap widening and give further room for rent seeking on the black market this means government was playing to the gallery and yet in doing so creating inflationary pressure if it is agreed that economic fundamentals are still weak then a black market rate increase is always a possibility on the other hand fuel is secured in united states dollars if a price increase is effected in local money it does not help increase its supply but only helps constrain its local demand the government would still have raided exporters for forex at 1 1 whose local costs would be moving up in line with the rest of the local market despite a rebate teaser so the forex shortage remains with us so those believing that this policy measure was correctly timed and that it had a positive impact of closing the fuel subsidy gap are wrong they are wrong in that they assume the parallel foreign exchange rate is a constant variable authorities however know this fallacy and only took the route so as to achieve a temporary rebalancing cognisant of the not so far effects of inflation the conclusion with regards this move is that it shows government is no longer looking at returning to the us dollar regime as a primary currency it also shows that the government has no immediate solution to solving the forex crisis lastly it demonstrates that the government is less worried about inflation than it is about a shortterm disguised stability this bird in hand approach depicting a defective telescopic view is replete in zimbabwe s economic history and has been one of the major sources of its economic crisis while gradually every economy should move towards an independent currency to allow for flexible monetary management a promised return of the zimdollar in the very short term 12 months is without basis it further solidifies the view that the government has no solid plan to the crisis and has become highly nostalgic and reactionary giving room to high downside costs in his argument ncube has said every country should have its own currency and that the us dollar is too strong for zimbabwe although he said certain fundamentals have to be met there was no clear guidance as to what fundamentals he meant a weak current account position huge budget deficit and high inflation are brickbats in effective zim redollarisation of the economy without forex reserves or gold reserves to support the currency as hedge given possible volatility the currency will be highly exposed shoring up such reserves in the short term is clearly not possible given the trade gap and a projected economic recession in 2019 moreover the weakening of the currency does not necessarily imply increased competitiveness of local produce to be competitive one needs to produce and given the challenges we face in terms of retooling and forex challenges to allow for importation of raw materials production is readily pointing southwards introducing a local currency at the present moment will not make local produce competitive but even more expensive given effects of inflation so why announce such a policy measure now the government simply wants to control money supply and one would argue but they readily have indirect control through open market operations tbs yes that is right but there is a cost attached to the issuance of sovereign instruments which is not incurred paper printing the cost known as interest can drive money supply up at a higher rate and cause serious inflation within a very short space of time through the compound effect a new currency could allow for government to inject money without incurring an interest cost within the trappings of power this option is very tempting especially in desperate times but within the context of this report this move highlights yet again the desperation the short termism and reactionary approach by government it can only further demonstrate that government is giving in sacrificing principles for expediency and that road we have travelled before it yields inflation if prudence is in lack and all that we have seen over the last five years is a clear sign of lack of prudence and more of expedience as seen by the growth in money supply to finance government s excesses delays in announcement of monetary policy have heightened speculation and given the gestures shown by government over the last five weeks the population could be forgiven for speculating an immediate return to the zimdollar the question still remains if there is no shift in currency policy why then delay the mps announcement the truth is overtures over currency regime debunking have been tabled and contemplated over the last few weeks and indeed as expected there are two sides to the matter one for the status quo or managed exchange rate where exchange rate is partially floated and partially managed and another which is ready to bite the bullet and go for the zimdollar while we will not dig into the merits of the various proffered policy positions these variances and resultant delays are a demonstration of lack of a coherent plan to tackle the cash and forex crisis on the part of government it feeds into the formative observations that government is reactionary and lacks a solid plan to tackle the present crisis in planning at business level against the observations made corporates should ensure there is sufficient downside hedge against further and more severe inflation sustained and wider forex gap and the resultant parallel exchange rate worsening it is tactical to delay credit settlements where necessary and shore up inventory levels less resources should be kept as cash and to counter for value erosion necessary placements of cash into investments should be expedited where import competition is concerned companies will have to re evaluate their models using the purchasing power parity and make informed decisions concerning own production if status quo is maintained which the reserve bank of zimbabwe has already hinted on there will gradual but effective value erosion if the local currency is restored immediately without controls both partial and managed exchange money supply will incur a shock that can destabilise financial market further and collapse the currency

gregory shupak examines the silences that organize the mainstream media s coverage of the crisis in the caribbean nation by gregory shupak fair february 19 2019 fair org the us media chorus supporting a us overthrow of the venezuelan government has for years pointed to the country s economic crisis as a justification for regime change while whitewashing the ways in which the us has strangled the venezuelan economy fair org 3 22 18 a un rapporteur declares that sanctions kill independent 1 26 19 but few in western media are listening to his message sister eugenia russian president of fundalatin a venezuelan human rights ngo that was established in 1978 and has special consultative status at the un told the independent 1 26 19 in contact with the popular communities we consider that one of the fundamental causes of the economic crisis in the country is the effect the unilateral coercive sanctions that are applied in the economy especially by the government of the united states while internal errors also contributed to the nation s problems russian said it s likely that few countries in the world have ever suffered an economic siege like the one venezuelans are living under while the new york times and the washington post have lately professed profound and definitely 100 percent sincere concern for the welfare of venezuelans neither publication has ever referred to fundalatin alfred de zayas the first un special rapporteur to visit venezuela in 21 years told the independent 1 26 19 that us canadian and european union economic warfare has killed venezuelans noting that the sanctions fall most heavily on the poorest people and demonstrably cause death through food and medicine shortages lead to violations of human rights and are aimed at coercing economic change in a sister democracy de zayas un report noted that sanctions hind the imports necessary to produce generic medicines and seeds to increase agricultural production de zayas also cited venezuelan economist pasqualina curcio who reports that the most effective strategy to disrupt the venezuelan economy has been the manipulation of the exchange rate the rapporteur went on to suggest that the international criminal court investigate economic sanctions against venezuela as possible crimes against humanity given that de zayas is the first un special rapporteur to report on venezuela in more than two decades one might expect the media to regard his findings as an important part of the venezuela narrative but his name does not appear in a single article ever published in the post the times has mentioned him once but not in relation to venezuela economist francisco rodríguez wola 9 20 18 points out that oil production in both venezuela and colombia dropped when oil prices fell in 2016 but venezuelan production plummeted when the us imposed financial sanctions in 2017 the economist francisco rodríguez points out that the sanctions the trump administration issued in august 2017 prohibited us banks from providing new financing to the venezuelan government a key part of the toxification of financial dealings with venezuela rodríguez notes that in august 2017 the us financial crimes enforcement network warned financial institutions that all venezuelan government agencies and bodies appear vulnerable to public corruption and money laundering and recommended that some transactions originating from venezuela be flagged as potentially criminal many financial institutions then closed venezuelan accounts concerned about the risk of being accused of participating in money laundering rodríguez says that this handcuffed venezuela s oil industry the sector most crucial to its economy with lost access to credit preventing the country from obtaining financial resources that could have been devoted to investment or maintenance and whereas previously the venezuelan government would raise production by signing joint venture agreements with foreign partners who would finance investment trump s sanctions effectively put an end to these loans mark weisbrot the nation 9 7 17 the trump administration has made an open and firm commitment to regime change through the destruction of an already debilitated venezuelan economy mark weisbrot the nation 9 7 17 also an economist raised a related issue if we step back and look at venezuela from a bird s eye view how does a country with 500 billion barrels of oil and hundreds of billions of dollars worth of minerals in the ground go broke the only way that can happen is if the country is cut off from the international financial system otherwise venezuela could sell or even collateralize some of its resources in order to get the necessary dollars the 7 7 billion in gold held in central bank reserves could be quickly collateralized for a loan in past years the us treasury department used its clout to make sure that banks who wanted to finance a swap such as jpmorgan chase and bank of america did not do so sanctions have kept the venezuelan government from accessing financing and dealing with its debt while hamstringing its most important industry given that us media are writing for a principally us audience the damage done by washington and its partners sanctions should be front and center in their coverage exactly the opposite is the case virginia lopez glass of the new york times 1 25 19 uses 920 words to describe the challenges facing venezuelans but sanctions isn t one of them even as she writes about matters to which as i ve shown above sanctions are directly relevant food and medicine shortages are widespread hundreds have died from malnutrition and illnesses that are easily curable with the appropriate treatment weaponizing hunger in venezuela in this manner is dishonest and misleading christina m schiavoni a doctoral researcher at the international institute of social studies in the hague and ana felicien and liccia romero both of whom are venezuelan scholars wrote in monthly review 6 1 18 on overt us aggression toward venezuela in the form of the intensifying economic sanctions imposed by the obama and trump administrations as well as an all out economic blockade that has made it extremely difficult for the government to make payments on food imports and manage its debt torture advocate bret stephens new york times 1 25 19 mocks the idea that sanctions and not socialism are responsible for venezuela s economic crisis bret stephens column in the times 1 28 19 only mentions the word sanctions to complain that the media supposedly isn t blaming socialism for the crisis in venezuela alleging that what you re likelier to read is that the crisis is the product of corruption cronyism populism authoritarianism resource dependency us sanctions and trickery even the residues of capitalism itself after dismissing the idea that the sanctions are a key part of the problems in venezuela stephens went on to advocate using them to bring about regime change in the country writing that the trump administration should enhance s political standing by providing access to funds that can help him establish an alternative government and entice wavering figures in the maduro camp to switch sides it can put venezuela on the list of state sponsors of terrorism these funds presumably refer the money that the us has seized from venezuela and adding the country to list of state sponsors of terrorism automatically entails hitting it with further sanctions the editorial board of the washington post 1 24 19 alleged that venezuela s government has subject the country s 32 million people to a humanitarian catastrophe without referring to what scholars whose research and writing focuses on latin america such as laura carlsen sujatha fernandes greg grandin francisco dominguez noam chomsky aviva chomsky gabriel hetland and venezuelan born historian miguel tinker salas describe common dreams 1 24 19 as sanctions cut off the means by which the venezuelan government could escape from its economic recession while causing a dramatic falloff in oil production and worsening the economic crisis and causing many people to die because they can t get access to life saving medicines later the editorial said that a us boycott of venezuelan oil could endanger ordinary venezuelans already coping with critical shortages of food power and medicine an absurd remark given that the sanctions they are occluding have had precisely these effects a washington post op ed 1 24 19 urges trump to ratchet up pressure on venezuela while insisting that the country has been driven into the ground by the repressive socialist policies pursued by nicolás maduro henry olsen in the post 1 24 19 wrote as if sanctions are a benign tool that can be used to usher in a brighter future for venezuelans rather than a key reason that so many of them find themselves in such a grim condition trump has many levers to pull short of military intervention to topple maduro he could use us pressure on the global financial system to cut off regime access to international banks freezing access to any secret accounts that the regime and probably its highest ranking leaders established offshore he can as sen marco rubio r fla has suggested work with american oil companies that purchase venezuelan oil to provide the profits from those purchases to accounts controlled by guaidó s national assembly he can also pressure china which has a far more valuable relationship with the united states than it does with venezuela to withdraw its support any or all of these measures would ratchet up pressure directly on the regime decreasing its ability to finance itself and buy support from security and military figures odds are that increasing financial pressure on the regime will finally bring about its collapse even if one momentarily sets aside that the sanctions are illegal under international law and violatethe charter of the organization of american states and that the us has no right whatsoever to decide who governs venezuela these measures don t just ratchet up pressure on the regime they also kill and immiserate ordinary venezuelans the post s charles lane 1 28 19 wrote apologists for the regime blame us sanctions and destabilization for venezuela s problems the truth is that with the exception of the george w bush administration s brief halfhearted support for a coup attempt in 2002 washington learning the lessons of ill fated cold war interventions has shown restraint in dealing with the caracas regime he went on to write that until the trump administration announced limitations on imports of venezuelan oil that day the united states had traded with venezuela and focused economic pressure on regime leaders and key institutions which suggests that the sanctions exclusively harm the regime again even if that were true it would still be illegal and amounts to a lie given the evidence that the sanctions are crushing the venezuelan masses unlike lane and the rest of the media s regime change choir the us government has acknowledged what it s doing to venezuela schiavoni felicien and romero point to a telling remark that a senior state department official made last year the financial sanctions we have placed on the venezuelan government has forced it to begin becoming in default both on sovereign and pdvsa its oil company s debt and what we are seeing because of the bad choices of the maduro regime is a total economic collapse in venezuela so our policy is working our strategy is working and we re going to keep it on the venezuelans thus the us government acknowledges that it is knowingly consciously driving the venezuelan economy into the ground but us media make no such acknowledgment which sends the message that the problems in venezuela are entirely the fault of the government and that the us is a neutral arbiter that wants to help venezuelans call this elision what it is war propaganda source us media ignore and applaud economic war on venezuela

the group also invested considerablely in its enterprise resource planning system in brazil as well as in regulatory and quality resources in europe to meet the medical device regulation mdr that will come into effect in may 2020 business performance the full year performance was driven by implants which posted double digit growth throughout and generated half of the group s growth all implant lines including the ceramic range contributed to this with the strongest growth coming from straumann s blt line the group s non premium implant business also developed well especially in north america and emerging markets uptake was slower than expected in some parts of europe the restorative business delivered good results with standard and variobase abutments outpacing implant growth further impetus came from the digital business driven by buoyant demand for intraoral scanners and 3d printers the clear aligner business grew dynamically in its established markets australia the uk

on 1 january 2018 led to an exceptional inventory revaluation expense of chf 9 million which is reported under costs of goods sold as well as a tax benefit of chf 2 million in july 2018 the group increased its ownership in createch medical a leading provider of high precision cadcam dental prosthetics from 30 to full ownership prior to this the business was included in share of results of associates the business combination led to a consolidation gain of chf 4 million below the ebit line see financial report note 4 in november 2018 the group increased its stake in t plus from 49 to 58 and consolidated the business this led to a consolidation gain of chf 7 million all of these effects are treated as exceptionals to facilitate the like for like comparison the term underlying refers to accounting figures excluding these effects double digit volume expansion lifts gross profit strong volume growth in implants lifted gross profit above the chf 1 billion threshold for the first time it increased 22 to chf 1028 million with the underlying margin at 75 in line with h1 despite the negative flip in the currency impact in h2 year on year the gross margin was 40 base points lower than in 2017 primarily due to the less favorable business mix in pursuit of its strategy to provide complete integrated solutions the group generated strong demand for its digital equipment and clear aligner solutions which have a lower gross margin than implants ebitda margin just less than 30 distribution expenses which comprise sales force salaries commissions and logistics costs rose chf 41 million to chf 291 million as the company incorporated the aforementioned acquisitions and invested further in its distribution network despite these important investments distribution costs decreased by 120 base points relative to sales this was the key improvement driver of operating profit margin r d marketing and general overhead costs which are grouped under administrative expenses in the income statement increased by chf 78 million to chf 389 million mainly due to the incorporation of clearcorrect and batigroup as well as additional expenses to comply with the mdr as a percentage of sales administrative expenses increased 60 base points r d investments increased in absolute terms but remained stable at 5 of sales taking all the aforementioned items into account earnings before interest tax depreciation amortization ebitda and exceptionals increased 24 to chf 404 million lifting the underlying margin 35 base points to just under 30 in recent years the group has built new manufacturing facilities and continues to increase the capacity of its existing sites significantly as a consequence depreciation expenses increased by chf 5 million amortization expenses rose chf 7 million mainly for customer and technology related intangible assets connected to recently acquired businesses after depreciation and amortization charges of chf 52 million underlying operating profit ebit amounted to chf 351 million reported chf 343 million compared with chf 285 million in 2017 the underlying ebit margin increased 20 base points to almost 26 net profit rises 19 underlying net financial expenses increased from chf 3 million reported chf 19 million in the prior year to chf 17 million reflecting higher hedging costs in 2018 due to increased volatility foreign exchange losses in some emerging markets and a lower interest result the strong performance of batigroup after its acquisition led to a revaluation of the present value of future earn out payments the exceptional gains related to the consolidation of t plus and createch amounted to chf 11 million the group s share of results from associates7 was a negative chf 10 million similar to the prior year this reflects an impairment charge of chf 8 million for rodo medical which was reported in h1 and was due to the delay in the development and commercialization of the company s prosthetic retention system underlying income tax expenses rose by chf 8 million due to the increase in profits tax expenditure amounted to chf 49 million or chf 51 million excluding the aforementioned exceptional tax benefit of chf 2 million the underlying income tax rate was stable at 15 which is consistent with the group s long term guidance as a result of all the above items underlying net profit increased 19 to chf 274 million with the corresponding margin reaching 20 basic earnings per share rose more than chf 2 to chf 16 99 free cash flow climbs to chf 169 million cash flow from operations increased 28 to chf 277 million due to the rise in operating income this corresponds to a solid cash conversion rate of 102 8 cash generation would have been even higher had it not been for the increase in net working capital as a result of the strong topline growth trade receivables and inventories increased in absolute terms while days of supply decreased by 9 days and days of sales outstanding remained unchanged the group invested chf 93 million in production and infrastructure which is 40 more than the prior year and covers new machinery new properties and building expansion in spite of this free cash flow amounted to chf 169 million and the respective margin reached 12 chf 73 million was used for acquisitions taking capex financial investments and other items into account cash used for investing activities in 2018 amounted to chf 199 million the cash position at year end remained solid at chf 279 million which exceeds the company s interest bearing liabilities by chf 17 million dividend

was 2 7 some of our otter tail power s 2018 accomplishments include the north dakota public service commission granularity of power and overall revenue increase of 4 6 million or 3 1 with a return on equity of 9 77 final rates went into effect february 1 2019 we implemented interim rates in south dakota interim rates which are subject to refund remain in place until the public utilities commission makes a decision on our request to increase non fuel rates by approximately 3 3 million or 10 1 the commission will also decide on the second step in our request which is an additional 1 7 to recover costs for the proposed merricourt wind generation facility when it goes into service we completed straining the big stone south ellendale 345 kv regional transmission project in 2018 and energized the line in early february of 2019 our share of the cost for this project was 115 million because this is a miso multi value project which allows cost recovery from all customers who benefit from the line our customers will pay less than 1 of the project costs in 2019 otter tail power will also enhance transmission infrastructure in our southeastern south dakota service territory providing an approximate 39 million investment that will improve reliability and provide increased capacity for customers in the southern end of our service territory in the fourth quarter and into 2019 we continue to work through the miso generator interconnection process for the merricourt wind generation projects which will be otter tail s largest capital investment at 270 million we estimate the project construction will began in july of 2019 with an expected commercial operation in the third quarter of 2020 south dakota public utilities commission approved the site permit for the 165 million astoria station natural gas generation project and the north dakota psc approve the project for rider recovery in our recent north dakota rate case we will begin construction in 2019 and expect to be operational by march 2021 these and other investments will produce an annual growth rate of 8 in our rate base between 2018 and 2023 in a constructive regulatory environment the minnesota public utilities commission approved a one year extension to june 1 2020 for the filing of our next resource plan two key environmental regulations that may impact our modeling are the regional haze rule and the proposed affordable clean energy rules delaying our filing one year will allow us to consider the outcomes of these environmental regulations and develop a more informed resource plan in august we published our esg sustainability report which gives investors and others insight into our environmental social and governance commitments on slide 15 through 17 you ll see highlights from our report and a glimpse into how our electric utilities plant and service and resource mix are evolving due to significant investments in low cost renewable energy and transmission that enables regional wind development last but certainly not least february 4 2019 marked the official go live date for our new customer information system this 37 month project is our biggest system upgrade in the generation i m proud of the project team for its result throughout the project and for executing a seamless cutover plan to help ensure continued customer satisfaction i d also like to give special recognition to coyote station in north dakota for achieving two milestones by year end the plant exceeded 3 million megawatt hours produced the second highest yearly generation amount in the plants 38 year history and crossed over the 3 million manhour without a loss time incident the plants last loss time incident occurred 18 years ago congratulations to coyote station employees for these significant accomplishments and thank you to all of our employees for continuing to put safety first our manufacturing companies also experienced notable accomplishments in 2018 btd our contract metal fabricator and largest manufacturing business increased sales by 19 in 2018 and the georgia location is profitable in the last half of the year the company achieved this while reporting its lowest osha rate and highest on time delivery in history t o plastics celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2018 and achieved 6 overall sales growth and a 29 increase in earnings driven mostly by lower income tax rates the company s horticulture segment continues to grow through key account relationships and new product launches northern pipe products and vinyltech had an exceptional year supported by strong market demand and prices and continued excellent operational performance they positively contributed to earnings while remaining highly competitive both companies continue to prove improve in the markets they serve by demonstrating flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs we re targeting additional organic volume growth in these companies in 2019 employees across our organization are aligned with our growth strategy which includes capital investment continued improvement in operations and talent development it s with much appreciation that i congratulate them on a job well done in 2018 in 2019 we will continue to execute on utility rate base growth and create additional organic growth in the manufacturing businesses now i ll turn it over to kevin for the financial perspective kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer well thank you chuck and good morning everyone i will cover the following items our 2018 financial results our liquidity position the strength balance sheet and corporate credit ratings the increase in our 2019 indicated annual dividend our five year capital expenditure plan and our 2019 business outlook we are pleased with our strong 2018 financial performance revenues grew approximately 8 and earnings grew approximately 14 with all our reporting segments showing year over year increases in revenues and earnings we earned 2 06 per share which compared with 1 82 per share last year our 2018 return on equity was 11 5 on an equity ratio of 54 5 our two platform strategy continues to deliver higher returns on equity on a higher equity layer when compared to holding company peers let me now provide an overview of 2018 earnings by segment as shown on slides 20 and 21 electric segment net earnings increased 5 million year over year key drivers include increased revenues due to more favorable weather year over year earnings improved by 0 11 a share due to the weather and compared to normal weather was favorable by 0 07 a share increased revenues due to interim rates associated with our north dakota general rate case net of estimated refunds which was implemented in january of 2018 interim rates associated with our south dakota rate case went into effect in october of 2018 increased renewable resource rider revenues in minnesota and north dakota and increased minnesota sip revenues these items were partially offset by a 9 6 million reduction in revenues related to a provision for refunds to recognize that current retail rates in our service area and ferc approved transmission tariffs our recovering federal income taxes in excess of lower rates under tax reform lower north dakota environmental cost recovery rider revenue due to the impact from lower tax rates a reduction in the return on equity component of the rider in the lower investment balance subject to recovery from depreciation for our north dakota and south dakota transmission costs recovery riders due to the impact of lower tax rate and reduced transmission costs other items impacting the segment s earnings were higher operating and maintenance property tax and depreciation expenses we did have a scheduled maintenance outage in 2018 at our big stone plant that cost 2 9 million we don t have any planned maintenance outages in 2019 in income tax expense was lower in 2018 mainly due to the reduction in federal corporate tax rates from 35 to 21 and the reversal of excess deferred taxes net earnings for the manufacturing segment increased 1 8 million year over year key elements of this improvement are as follows btd s revenues increased 36 8 million of which 33 8 million came from increased product sales to all its major end markets 12 7 million of this increase relates to higher material costs that were passed through to customers with the balance due to increased sales and improved pricing btd s scrap metal revenues also increased due to higher volumes and higher scrap sales prices these increases were offset in part by higher cost of goods sold and operating expenses and higher income taxes due to the elimination of the section 199 deduction which was eliminated in 2018 and the writedown of deferred tax liabilities in 2017 which lowered last year s income tax expense these items resulted in a 1 2 million increase in btd s year over year earnings t o plastics revenues improved 1 9 million mainly due to increased sales of horticultural containers the increased revenues were partially offset by higher cost of goods sold labor freight and operating expenses earnings before taxes increased slightly year over year however due to a lower tax rate earnings improved 600 000 at t o plastics the plastics segment s earnings increased 2 1 million year over year as a result of a 9 4 increase in pvc pipe prices a 2 3 decrease in pounds of pipe sold the increase in sales prices more than offset higher cost of goods per pound sold and lower sales volumes the net impact of these items resulted in an 11 3 improvement in gross margins sales volumes were lower in the last four months of 2018 compared with the same time period in 2017 primarily due to the increased sales from hurricane related impacts in the gulf coast region those dynamics favorably impacted earnings by an estimated 0 09 a share in 2017 and the favorable variance due to tax reform was offset by a loss of the section 199 deduction in 2018 technical difficulty lower tax expense in 2017 from a 3 3 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities due to tax reform our corporate expenses before taxes increased 4 million year over year primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions due to the establishment of the otter tail corporation charitable foundation in 2018 the increase in employee benefit costs and in other corporate costs we realized the 5 million net increase in tax savings in the corporate costs center in 2018 primarily due to the writedown of deferred tax assets in 2017 from tax reform this was offset by an increase in tax expense mostly related to uncertain tax positions and the establishment of a valuation allowance on the recoverability of certain state net operating losses and we experienced a reduction in tax savings as a result of the federal tax rate change the net result of our lease items was 1 million year over year reduction in corporate expense moving to slide 22 let s review our financial condition and liquidity last year we had no equity financing activity and don t expect any equity issuances in 2019 our two credit agreements are in place until october 31 of 2023 between expected cash flow generated from 2019 operating activities and these credit facilities we have the appropriate levels of liquidity to support both of our business platforms we currently expect to do a private placement of debt at otter tail power company in the range of 150 million to 170 million during the last half of 2019 in connection with our rate base growth and in 2018 all three rating agencies affirmed otter tail corporation and otter tail power s ratings and outlook and we remain committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and we ll manage our operations to reflect that commitment as shown on slide 24 the board of directors increased our indicated annualized dividend rate from 1 34 per share to 1 40 per share this 4 5 increase is a result of our solid 2018 performance and our 2019 outlook the company s strong balance sheet liquidity cash generation profile and our commitment to enhancing shareholder returns we expect future dividend increases to be in line with earnings growth while maintaining a targeted payout ratio in the range of 60 to 70 and we have paid dividends on our stock for 80 years for 321 consecutive quarters slide 25 highlights our capital expenditure plans for the 2019 through 2023 timeframe we expect capital expenditures for 2019 to be 203 million planned expenditures for this year includes 61 million for the merricourt wind project and 40 million for the astoria station natural gas fired plant these investments will continue to positively impact the corporation s earnings and returns on capital the five year capital plan calls for approximately 973 million in utility projects 45 of this capital spend will be recovered through riders the plan also includes 97 million for the manufacturing and plastics businesses in our updated compounded annual growth rate in rate base over the 2018 through 2023 timeframe is projected to be 8 using 2018 as the base year slide 26 reflects our 2019 consolidated earnings per share guidance of 2 10 to 2 25 this guidance includes our strategies for improving future results the cyclical nature of the manufacturing businesses as well as current regulatory factors facing our electric segment our electric segment s 2019 net income is expected to be higher than 2018 based on constructive outcome in the south dakota rate case increased afudc for planned capital projects including merricourt wind project in the astoria natural gas plant along with increased revenues from the north dakota generation cost recovery rider on the astoria station increased revenues from the completion of the big stone south ellendale project and additional transmission investments related to our south dakota transmission reliability project decreased operating and maintenance expenses due to a decrease in pension medical workers compensation and retiree medical benefits our discount rate is increasing in 2019 to 4 5 from 3 9 driven by the increasing interest rate environment these items are offset by normal weather weather favorably impacted our 2018 earnings per share by 0 07 compared to normal higher property tax and depreciation expense due to larger transmission projects being put into service we expect increased earnings from our manufacturing segment in 2019 due to increased sales at btd and the recreational vehicle lawn and garden and agricultural end markets also increased scrap revenues due to stronger sales volumes the increased earnings at t o plastics primarily driven by increased sales in horticultural life science and industrial end markets the backlog for this segment is approximately 211 million for 2019 compared with 166 million a year ago we expect plastics 2019 net income to be lower than 2018 we are expecting lower operating margins due to increasing resin prices and slightly higher sales volumes compared to last year in corporate costs net of tax are expected to be lower in 2019 our current earnings guidance for 2019 reflect 68 of our earnings from our electric segment and 32 of our earnings from our manufacturing and plastics segments this compares with 66 and 34 respectively in 2018 the increase in the electric earnings mix is being driven by the rate base growth related to merricourt astoria and south dakota reliability projects we expect the long term earnings mix to continue to move back in line with 75 of earnings from our electric segment and 25 of our manufacturing and plastics segments net of unallocated corporate costs this will be driven by the capital plan which calls for approximately 91 of our capital spend over the 2019 through 2023 timeframe to be in the electric segment we believe our 2019 guidance further positions us to achieve a 5 to 7 compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share using 2018 s 2 06 a share our 2019 guidance is dependent on the business and the economic challenges our two platforms will face this year for the utility key drivers include constructive outcome in the south dakota rate case and successful execution of our rate base growth projects for btd key drivers include continued operational improvements across all locations to further improve our return on sales margins and while earnings are expected to decline in 2019 for plastics this segment continues to be a strong complement to our portfolio by providing strong earnings cash flows to support our dividend and returns on invested capital we are now ready to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from paul ridzon with keybanc paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst good morning how are you charles macfarlane president chief executive officer good morning paul paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst could you give just some background on this charitable contribution and what we should look for going forward charles macfarlane president chief executive officer sure paul i appreciate the question we have for a number of year been considering establishing the foundation for well both otter tail corporation and then we also have established one for the otter tail power company as well and we wanted to in 2018 certainly help get the foundations off on the right foot with the good commitment to fund those organizations going forward and so you see a probably a much healthier contribution made for the otter tail power i m sorry the otter tail corporation foundation in that 2 million amount the power company is a 0 5 million and as we kind of look forward i would tell you that future contributions are ultimately subject to the success the financial success that we re having at both of the entities but in the utility we re looking for the future kind of range i would say in that 2 million to 500 000 range on a go forward basis and at the parent company depending on results you could see i suppose in a range of 300 000 to 600 000 a year paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst so 18 was just kind of getting this the critical mass charles macfarlane president chief executive officer yes paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst and then relative to your eei data it looks like some capex moved from 19 to 20 can you give a little more detail there charles macfarlane president chief executive officer sure the movement paul relates to the astoria merricourt the movement is the merricourt project when you in terms of what you we saw at eei and then what we see now we ve seen a bit of a push back in the timing of the merricourt project and so basically the project isn t going away it s just a movement of dollars from 19 into 20 paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst got it ok so everything fundamentally still the same just the timing shift charles macfarlane president chief executive officer yup paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst and then i know i ask this every call but pressures you re seeing maybe from the benefit of tax reform being competitively reduced in the manufacturing segments charles macfarlane president chief executive officer paul we just haven t seen that with couple of our as we talk about in the press release and in my comments we were actually we saw price uplift from some of our customers in 2019 both in kind of across the board at btd and t o plastics we were able to get price increases in place with customers where we thought it was appropriate and needed we haven t had any push back from customers looking for kind of a reduction in pricing because of the tax savings were picking up in the manufacturing businesses it doesn t mean that it couldn t happen but we certainly are seeing any of that and of course we actually have we could be looking for the same things on our supply side as well when we negotiate our prices with our supply base and given the pvc commodity nature of that business prices were up in 2018 in the pvc pipe business and that was really a reflective of market conditions we re seeing some softening of prices we saw that in the fourth quarter and as we head into 19 but it s really more market driven that it is having anything to do with tax reform paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst what s driving that softening in the market charles macfarlane president chief executive officer i think that there we as we went through 18 we saw much stronger prices than we expected now as we head into the we completed the fourth quarter we saw some uplift in our resin costs we think saw some pullback in market pricing as it relates to just demand and competition and as we move into 19 we re seeing similar there s some announced resin price increases here in the first quarter we ll see if they stick fully but we expected some of it s going to stick and we ve seen some softening in sales prices that started in the fourth quarter and it s really kind of market related and it s what s driving it paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst okay thank you very much charles macfarlane president chief executive officer thanks paul operator our next question comes from chris ellinghaus with williams capital christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst hey guys good morning charles macfarlane president chief executive officer hi chris good morning chris christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst can talk about the georgia you d mentioned that it was profitable in the second half of the year are you expecting that trend to continue charles macfarlane president chief executive officer thanks for the question chris yes we are we more like a 30 increase in volume year over year in georgia so we ve got some leverage there and we continue to see a good backlog at that site we ve continued to improve operationally then improve dramatically around our on time delivery and work with a number of customers on pricing so we anticipate that similar or better results as we had in the last six months of 18 going forward into 19 christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst does that mean btd had some pretty strong revenue growth are you expecting particularly with the way the backlog look you re expecting another really good revenue year there charles macfarlane president chief executive officer we are definitely expecting an increase i would say in the backlog 35 of the part price or 35 to 40 is metal and a lot of these prices that are in the backlog assume metal prices that were probably based on 2018 final quarter and we ve seen that drop a little so the metal impact in the 19 backlog is likely overstated a little bit but we do anticipate good growth in all the segments where there are some of those segments that you re not going to see that kind of growth we have been awarded programs in the ag sector that are new to us meaning it s just not higher volume of the same part we were making we are going to be making parts of it that we weren t in previous year so it s a market share growth there christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst okay kevin is the foundation donations that you were talking about would you anticipate that those would likely stay sort of fourth quarter kind of events kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer yes christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst okay and lastly you talked about the competition increasing in plastics a little bit is there was there a lot of slack in capacity that some of your competitors may have been trying to utilize or get your utilization higher or what where is that competition coming from charles macfarlane president chief executive officer yeah i mean i think that there is a lot of the some of the larger competition certainly has capacity out there in the in their plants some of that competition is also vertically integrated and that there are resin manufacturers and there s always some potential or were there want to have their profits occur and whether it s at their resin plants or their pvc businesses and so we did see some of that happened and there s been it s at least looks to be continuing into the first quarter here i mean we re only a month and a half into the year so far but we have seen sales prices kind of continue with those little bit reduced levels from that were in the fourth quarter christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst okay thanks for the details guys i appreciate it charles macfarlane president chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question is a follow up question from paul ridzon with keybanc paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst just back to the last question the at btd the decrease in metal prices will impact revenues but shouldn t impact net income kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer correct the metal prices are passed through to the customer but they do show up in the backlog as far as total part prices paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst kevin when you talked about and talks about the 19 electric utility outlook you said something about o m and pension like i kind of missed that could you quickly review what you said kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer sure i mean we re we expect in large part lower o m at the utility in part because we re our discount rate went up on the pension plan and our other benefit programs and we had a discount rate

are reported in accordance with ias 39 financial instruments recognition and measurement ias 39 3 in measuring our performance the financial measures that we use include those which have been derived from our reported results however these are not presented within the financial statements and are not defined under ifrs these are considered non ifrs financial measures and are unlikely to be

issued by hsbc bank canada financial commentary overview of results for the quarter and year ended 31 december 20181 2 hsbc bank canada reported strong results for the quarter and year with total operating income of 565m for the quarter and 2 264m for the year an increase of 25m or 4 6 and 194m or 9 4 respectively we are continuing to execute our strategy and focus on growth and value creation building on our solid momentum while continuing to lay a strong foundation for future performance our results were driven by higher net interest income from growth in both lending and deposit balances and improved margins from higher interest rates in addition higher gains on the disposal of financial investments and increased revenue from information technology services provided to affiliated hsbc group companies also contributed to our results in commercial banking the biggest contributor to our bottom line growth was seen across most products and business segments which lead to total operating income of 247m for the quarter and 954m for the year an increase of 10m or 4 2 and 69m or 7 8 respectively we continued to invest in growth initiatives and digital capabilities and are seeing the results of our efforts with lending balances growing at 16 the highest level since 2010 in global banking and markets total operating income was 74m for the quarter a decrease of 1m or 1 3 as higher net interest income from increased interest rates and credit and lending activities was offset by unfavourable credit debit and funding fair valuation adjustments for the year total operating income was 331m an increase of 29m or 9 6 as a result of strong revenue driven by increased infrastructure debt capital markets transactions increased interest rates and higher sales and trading in foreign exchange products in retail banking and wealth management focusing on customer needs led to strong growth in total relationship balances3 particularly for deposits and mortgages leading to growth in market share for these products despite increasing pricing competitiveness strong volume growth in retail products and higher margins led to total operating income of 185m for the quarter and 737m for the year an increase of 8m or 4 5 and 62m or 9 2 respectively active risk management together with favourable credit conditions led to a net release of 27m in the change in expected credit losses2 for the year a reduction from the elevated recovery levels experienced in 2017 for the quarter the change in expected credit losses resulted in a charge of 19m as a result of a number of small charges in the non performing wholesale portfolio as well as an increase in expected credit losses for performing loans driven by forward looking economic factors in both the wholesale and retail portfolios we continue to invest in people and technology to grow our business and make it more convenient for our customers to bank with us as a result operating expenses increased in the global businesses this was partially offset by a decrease in the corporate centre as certain restructuring and streamlining initiatives undertaken from 2015 to 2017 are now complete the overall result was a decrease in operating expenses of 9m or 2 7 for the quarter and an increase of 11m or 0 9 for the year profit before income tax expense increased by 16m or 7 8 for the quarter and 96m or 10 7 for the year as strong revenue growth active risk management favourable credit conditions and closely managed costs more than covered the cost of business investment 1 for the quarter and year ended 31 december 2018 compared with the same periods in the prior year unless otherwise stated 2 effective 1 january 2018 the bank adopted ifrs 9 on a retrospective basis without restatement of prior periods results from prior periods are reported in accordance with ias 39 under ifrs 9 the term change in expected credit losses is used the equivalent term prior to 1 january 2018 under ias 39 was loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions 3 total relationship balances is comprised of lending deposits and wealth balances commenting on the results sandra stuart president and ceo hsbc bank canada said we have consistently been a top contributor to hsbc group profits for many years as a result in each of my 3 years as president we have benefited from group investments in the country and worked hard to build our business in ways that make it better faster and safer for our customers informed by our knowledge of other markets and supported by hsbc s extensive global network this year s 11 increase in profit before tax 9 increase in revenue and our first year reporting over 100 billion in assets were the result of solid sustainable growth across our three business lines the investments we continue to make were more than offset by strong revenue growth in the coming year we will continue to execute on our strategy and focus on growth and value creation while actively managing our risks and costs and we ll be here for our customers as they navigate the world whatever the future brings analysis of consolidated financial results for the quarter and year ended 31 december 20181 2 net interest income was 335m for the quarter and 1 292m for the year an increase of 17m or 5 3 and 115m or 9 8 respectively contributing to the increase for both the quarter and the year were volume growth in both lending and deposits within retail banking and wealth management and higher loans and advances in commercial banking and global banking and markets in addition we benefited from improved margins as a result of higher interest rates this was partially offset by lower interest from impaired loans and a reduction in deposit balances in commercial banking and global banking and markets as some of our customers responded to u s tax reforms by repatriating balances to their u s parent companies net fee income was 164m for the quarter and 673m for the year an increase of 5m or 3 1 and 20m or 3 1 respectively credit facility fees increased as a result of higher volumes of bankers acceptances in both periods this was partially offset in the quarter by reductions in funds under management and underwriting fees and for the year by lower net credit card revenues related to enhanced credit card rewards and incentives net income from financial instruments held for trading was 26m for the quarter a decrease of 5m or 16 1 the decrease was primarily due to unfavourable credit and debit valuation and funding fair value adjustments together with accounting volatility from balance sheet management activities this was partially offset by increased volumes of foreign exchange transactions higher net interest from trading activities from higher yields and product mix and favourable hedge ineffectiveness net income from financial instruments held for trading for the year was 136m an increase of 11m or 8 8 primarily due to increased volumes of foreign exchange transactions higher net interest from trading activities from higher yields and product mix and favourable hedge ineffectiveness this was partially offset by a loss relating to accounting volatility from balance sheet management activities other items of income were 40m for the quarter and 163m for the year an increase of 8m or 25 and 48m or 41 7 respectively the increase for both the quarter and the year was primarily due to higher income from hsbc group entities from providing information technology services to group companies in addition we benefited from higher gains on the disposal of financial investments arising from the re balancing of the bank s liquid asset portfolio change in expected credit losses2 the change in expected credit losses for the quarter was a charge of 19m compared with loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions of 1m for the same period in the prior year the result in the current quarter is primarily due to a number of small charges in the non performing commercial banking portfolio as well as an increase in expected credit losses for performing loans driven by forward looking economic factors across all of the global businesses the change in expected credit losses for the year was a release of 27m compared with loan impairment recoveries and other credit risk provisions of 108m for the prior year the release in the current year was primarily driven by provision releases in the commercial banking non performing portfolio from improving credit conditions mainly relating to specific energy services customers the elevated recoveries in 2017 were driven by significant reversals of specific provisions in the energy industry as well as releases in collective provisions reflecting overall improvements in credit quality total operating expenses for the quarter were 324m a decrease of 9m or 2 7 we continue to invest in our people and technology to grow all of our global businesses however this investment was more than offset by a reduction of operating expenses in the corporate centre as certain transformation and streamlining initiatives undertaken from 2015 to 2017 are now complete in addition we benefited from lower marketing and depreciation expenses in the quarter total operating expenses for the year were 1 300m an increase of 11m or 0 9 as we continue to invest in growing our business and making it more convenient for our customers to bank with us this was partially offset by lower operating expenses in the corporate centre as referenced earlier plus lower costs associated with a reduction in our office space and leveraging the scale of centralizing specific business activities in the group share of profit in associates for the quarter and year were nil compared with nil for the quarter and a gain of 6m for the year 2017 the share of profits represents changes in the value of the bank s investments in private equity funds income tax expense the effective tax rate for the quarter was 29 4 compared with 26 1 for the same period in the prior year the effective tax rate for the year was 27 6 compared with 25 4 for 2017 the difference for both the quarter and the year was due to additional tax liabilities recorded 1 for the quarter and year ended 31 december 2018 compared with the same periods in the prior year unless otherwise stated 2 effective 1 january 2018 the bank adopted ifrs 9 on a retrospective basis without restatement of prior periods results from prior periods are reported in accordance with ias 39 under ifrs 9 the term change in expected credit losses is used the equivalent term prior to 1 january 2018 under ias 39 was loan impairment charges and other credit risk provisions movement in financial position assets total assets at 31 december 2018 were 103 4bn an increase of 7 0bn or 7 3 from 31 december 2017 this was primarily driven by strong growth in loans and advances of 6 8bn across all of our global businesses commercial banking saw excellent growth across all regions in line with our strategic plan leading to the highest lending balance growth since 2010 strong branding innovation and strategic investments coupled with competitive mortgage rates led to residential mortgage growth within our retail banking and wealth management business increased trade finance activity led to growth in our global banking and markets business other assets increased by 1 3bn primarily due to higher cash collateral posted as a result of movements in the fair value of the derivative portfolio and higher unsettled balances at the period end balance sheet management activities led to an increase in financial investments of 1 1bn these increases in assets were partially offset by a reduction in trading assets of 1 5bn as part of normal trading activity and a reduction in customers liability under acceptances of 0 9bn as a result of lower volumes liabilities total liabilities at 31 december 2018 were 97 8bn an increase of 7 1bn or 7 9 from 31 december 2017 higher repurchase volumes and balance sheet management activities led to an increase in non trading repurchase agreements of 3 6bn debt securities in issue increased by 3bn primarily due to increased wholesale funding customer accounts increased by 2 8bn primarily as a result of successful campaigns run across all global businesses this growth was partially offset as some of our customers responded to u s tax reforms by repatriating balances to their u s parent companies these increases were partially offset by a reduction in trading liabilities of 1 5bn due to lower net short positions held at period end as a result of normal trading activities equity total equity at 31 december 2018 was 5 6bn a decrease of 0 1bn or 2 2 from 31 december 2017 primarily as a result of profits generated in the period of 0 7bn net of dividends paid in the period of 0 8bn including a special dividend of 0 4m on hsbc bank canada common shares paid during the year dividends dividends declared in 2018 during the year the bank declared and paid 810m in dividends including a special dividend of 400m on hsbc bank canada common shares an

floor for institutions using advanced approaches for credit risk and operational risk effective for the second quarter of 2018 the capital floor is based on the standardized approach under basel ii framework with the floor factor transitioned in over three quarters the result was an immediate reduction of rwa which allowed hsbc bank canada to declare and pay a special dividend of 400m dividends

respectively the execution of our strategic plan coupled with the benefit of higher interest rates are the main drivers of the growth which was seen across most products and business segments and in both net interest income and fee income our strategic plan is focused on growing market share through expansion in the eastern region increasing productivity by deepening product penetration streamlining processes leveraging our differentiated product suite in global trade and receivable finance and global liquidity and cash management and building on our position as the leading international bank with enhanced positioning in key trade corridors in 2018 these strategic actions led to a 16 growth in lending balances the highest since 2010 and double digit revenue growth in multiple regions and segments we continued to invest in online technology and process enhancements and this has enabled us to drastically increase the speed of completing customer due diligence to the benefit of new and existing clients this is reflected in our customer survey which has shown marked improvement the percentage of customers rating our onboarding experience as excellent has doubled since december 2017 profit before income tax for the quarter was 141m an increase of 2m or 1 4 as higher operating income and lower operating expenses were partially offset by a change in expected

greater emphasis on connectivity between hsbc s global businesses across regions leveraging the hsbc group s extensive distribution network for the quarter profit before income tax was 40m an increase of 10m or 33 3 as the slight decline in total operating income discussed above was more than offset by a positive change in expected credit loss in the current quarter as a result of active risk management and favourable credit conditions together with a decrease in operating expenses primarily as a result of the timing of certain expenses profit before income tax for the year was 180m an increase of 10m or 5 9 as strong revenue growth more than covered the cost of business investment and a higher change in expected credit losses charge for the year compared to recoveries in the prior

february 19 2019 the investment landscape is a virtual minefield to the untrained it presents a myriad of opportunities to be embraced and threats to be avoided business savvy individuals with a keen eye for detail typically fare better than greenhorns dipping their feet in an ocean of investment opportunities for starters what do you invest in who do you invest with where does your investment stand the best chance of growth why should you trust one broker over another the world s premier stock markets including the new york stock exchange dow jones industrial average nasdaq and s p 500 have enjoyed an unparalleled run of success in recent years this is due in no small part to the performance of the us economy the business confidence index relatively low inflation and a repatriation of business back to the homeland monetary policy and fiscal policy measures have aligned to create a growth oriented paradigm in us stock markets in europe asia latin america and beyond varying degrees of success have been experienced in the financial markets brexit concerns rising debt and uncertainty trade wars et al are bugbears that many european markets like the cac 40 dax 30 ftse 100 nikkei 225 hang seng shanghai shenzhen stock exchanges are dealing with some countries face crippling employment shortages like japan while others are dealing with red hot economies of scale like china the managed chaos of the global economy is difficult to predict even for the most experienced traders analysts and investors that is of course until now fortunately there are powerful tools resources and platforms geared towards making sense of global markets in economics an assumption known as ceteris paribus is invoked when individual economic considerations are assessed ceteris paribus all things being equal holds other variables constant while specific economic conditions are being tested as an investor it s impossible to know how employment housing starts inflation the us dollar index fed activity global demand currency wars sanctions and a smorgasbord of other variables will impact your decision to invest in this stock or that stock the best we can hope for is a logical correlation between variables and the attendant impact on stocks commodities indices currencies and beyond what types of investment options are currently available savvy investors tend to diversify their portfolios for maximum growth and yield the range of investment options comprises a combination of high risk and low risk alternatives a growth oriented investment portfolio typically includes a mix of 40 us stocks 23 foreign stocks 7 emerging market stocks 13 us small cap 7 us mid cap 6 municipal bonds and 4 us aggregate bonds on the opposite end of the spectrum a low risk portfolio would be heavily weighted in favor of bonds for example you may invest 37 in municipal bonds 22 in us aggregate bonds 7 in high yield bonds and 4 in inflation protected bonds stocks tend to take a backseat in a risk averse financial portfolio having said that how does one go about picking the ripest stocks or those about to blossom in the financial markets this is an unenviable task and certainly not one tailored to novice investors brand name stocks like alphabet inc goog facebook news alert fb amazon amzn tesla incorporated tsla and others may appear to be attractive propositions but are they how much gas is left in the tank what of stock market downturns these are all issues that plague investors traders and analysts on a daily basis besides stocks and bonds currencies and indices there are also hybrid options like etfs exchange traded funds cryptocurrencies futures markets and beyond for the most part it is impossible to eliminate risk from any financial investment this is an intractable component of the process however the degree of risk you re willing to assume plays a big part in the potential rewards you stand to gain as a rule high risk investments should be eschewed pharmaceutical companies biotech companies new tech start ups since these companies often shutter operations after seed capital and investor funding runs out of course this is not always the case and many notable exceptions abound among the many high profile brokerages trading platforms and investment arenas one particular company stands out we scoured the literature in search of an all encompassing trading platform and found one financial consultants agree wealthsimple meets the needs of its investors according to the reviews this trading brokerage offers three tiers of investment opportunities basic up to 100 000 black over 100 000 and generation over 500 000 depending on your individual circumstances it is possible to pay minimal investment fees and enjoy all the advantages of vip style service such as dividend reinvesting automatic deposits automatic portfolio rebalancing and expert financial advice of course it s always best to play around with the sliders to see precisely how easy it is to save on investment fees over time some of the biggest hurdles for investors are trading fees investment fees monthly maintenance fees account management fees and other costs associated with trying to establish a viable financial portfolio we found the aforementioned investment service particularly well suited to investors wanting to minimize costs and maximise benefits chasing the ideal investment portfolio balance is the best way to success in the investment world by diversifying your portfolio you can effectively have your eggs in many different baskets as a novice investor your best bet is to go with a tried and trusted brokerage which understands where you re coming from the objective in all cases is to minimize risk and maximize reward a fund is much safer than a stock since the fund tracks multiple stocks in a sector or category for example you may be particularly partial to social media stocks like facebook twitter news alert snapchat and so forth but twitter and snapchat are performing particularly poorly in the financial markets rather than putting all your eggs into one basket you may be inclined to choose a fund that tracks the top tech stocks like google amazon facebook microsoft apple news alert and so forth failsafe tips to help you succeed do your homework don t blindly accept the fees that brokerages impose upon you markets typically experience cyclical behaviour this means there are peaks and troughs at regular intervals the only way you can ride out this volatility and variance is by investing regularly automatic deposits are a great way to begin take a look at the stock market from year to year tech stocks may have been the darlings of yesteryear but they may be the bears of the present automatic rebalancing of your financial portfolio is sacrosanct your portfolio cannot possibly grow if it is improperly skewed towards the wrong investments diversify your portfolio to include different types of investments for example gold is the perfect counterbalance to poorly performing stock markets a good mix of gold shares gold etfs gold funds and physical gold bullion is always a good idea automatically invest dividends earned through stocks in your financial portfolio this is how growth takes place use a brokerage or investment service which is geared towards quick easy financial management seasoned professionals and trading experts readily attest to the merit of passive investments which track market activity over a long period of time markets have a pulse of their own and it takes tremendous effort to understand the inner mechanics of this complex global system

contains forward looking statements based on the environment as we currently see it and as such does include risks and uncertainties please refer to our press release for more information on the specific risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially advertisement advertisement finally during the call we will discuss gaap and non gaap financial measures a reconciliation between the two is included in the press release that we issued this morning and is also available in the presentation slides the press release and presentation as well as a supplementary financial information file are provided on the investor relations section of our website at ir leidos com with that i ll turn the call over to roger krone roger a krone chairman chief executive officer thank you kelly and thank you all for joining us this morning for our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2018 earnings conference call 2018 was a continuation of our great execution and was a year of transition as we pivoted the organization to focus on growth we saw many successes and i am proud of our employees for driving these achievements advertisement advertisement the government shutdown had a negligible effect on our fourth quarter results and is expected to have an immaterial effect to our first quarter 2019 results as well now i d like to start this morning by discussing four key highlights from our results bookings growth profitability and cash generation before focusing on what we see going forward in 2019 and beyond first 2018 was a record year for us in bookings and backlog we booked 13 7 billion in net awards into backlog resulting in a 1 3 book to bill for the year and a record backlog of 20 8 billion these bookings along with other single award idiq positions we won will drive our growth this year and beyond the strong momentum in our business development results has continued into 2019 with nasa s recent award of the nasa end user services technology program to leidos this is new work for us a competitive takeaway furthering our market share gains although it is still subject to a protest nest is a single award firm fixed price idiq contract with a potential value of 2 9 billion over 10 years advertisement advertisement second in terms of growth the improving win rates and ramp of revenues from our new awards allowed us to close out the year on a strong note with year over year revenue growth in q4 at the highest pace we ve had in two years for the third quarter in a row revenues grew year over year as new awards increasingly contribute to the expansion of our base business third profitability was also a highlight for the year as we again exceeded our target of 10 or higher for long term adjusted ebitda margin and delivered margins of 10 4 for the year we continue to balance margin and growth as we drive to our long term targets in both areas with revenue growth of 3 or more while maintaining adjusted ebitda margins at 10 or higher finally we continue to maximize the cash generated from the organization through the fourth quarter for 2018 we generated more than three quarters of a billion dollars of operating cash flow a 46 increase from the prior year s level despite the revenue growth in the fourth quarter driving cash collections from the business is truly a cross functional effort these results show that our teams across the organization did a great job in driving cash conversion throughout the year and continuing into the fourth quarter we benefited from many initiatives to monetize our balance sheet we will continue to explore additional such opportunities in 2019 cash generation is important and smart deployment of that cash is essential to driving shareholder value advertisement advertisement in 2018 our performance allowed us to return over 600 million to our shareholders or nearly 90 of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases we returned 200 million to our shareholders through regular quarterly dividends and nearly 420 million in share repurchases which allowed us to retire 6 5 million shares during the year we also repaid 59 million of debt these actions are consistent with our stated capital deployment philosophy now we look forward to 2019 as we are focused on accelerating growth while continuing to execute our book of business to drive this growth we will leverage the strong defense budget and outlays ramp ups from our new program wins and a strong pipeline of submitted bids waiting decisions we ve entered the year with roughly 28 billion of bids outstanding this pipeline includes several multi billion dollar bids such as our department of energy hanford mission support contract recompete our disa global solutions management operations program recompete as well as the nasa nest bid which i mentioned earlier advertisement advertisement we re also submitting proposals on several other large new business and takeaway bids during 2019 and expect decisions by many of these large programs during the year we ve analyzed what s driven our improving win rates and our success in capturing new work while it s clear that no single factor has led to this success the three most prevalent areas are the strength of our technical solution the competitiveness of our cost structure and our past performance credentials all made possible by our talented and dedicated employees further it s clear that customers have confidence in our ability to solve their large complex problems because of our size scale and depth we continue to strengthen across all of these areas including investing in our internal r d so we can offer increasingly advanced technical solutions one particular area where we have seen strong customer enthusiasm is in the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning these technologies drive efficiencies in our customers mission through automation and also provide deep analytical insight at speed we also invest in aiml security to make all of our data rich information technology offerings the most reliable and secure in the industry our aiml capabilities have already been instrumental to several recent program wins with our defense and intelligence customers advertisement advertisement with our anticipated growth we ll need more people to join the company i m pleased to say we have seen improvement in our hiring statistics as our recruiting and hr teams had implemented innovative methods to improve our success and efficiency in hiring new employees as well as improved retention rates of our existing employees we are also optimistic on the potential for a more efficient security clearance process with a renewed focus on this effort by the department of defense which recently assumed the function from the office of personnel management when in place this increased efficiency will mean that our employees spend less time waiting to start work on classified programs refining the process is a complex undertaking that will take time to implement but we are encouraged by the initial progress now we all continue to watch what is going on in the federal government we are pleased with the last week s budget agreement that averts another shutdown even a partial shutdown impacts a broad array of vital government services that touch millions of americans and impacts the important mission of our customers while there is still uncertainty on the debt ceiling limits and the sequester caps we remain optimistic about the actual budgets that will be agreed upon and the spending priorities in government fiscal 2020 and beyond as we analyze the budgetary activity beyond the headlines we re encouraged that the government spending priorities align well with our strategy and our areas of technical strength keeping us well positioned to drive growth advertisement advertisement finally i m pleased to announce that we have set may 14 as the date of our investor day which will be held in new york city as well as being webcast the leadership team and i look forward to sharing our vision for the company and more details about our strategy at the event i hope you will find time to join us with that i ll turn the call over to jim reagan our chief financial officer for more details on our 2018 results and our 2019 outlook james reagan chief financial officer thank you roger and thanks everyone for joining us today we re pleased with our full year 2018 results and i ll start by highlighting a few of our accomplishments for the fourth quarter and the full year advertisement advertisement fourth quarter revenues increased 5 2 from the prior year and 2 8 sequentially our third consecutive quarter of growth and another proof point in our growth trajectory in 2018 our adjusted ebitda margins of 10 4 again exceeded our long term target of 10 or higher fourth quarter margins were 9 7 in line with our expectations and reflects typical seasonality in the margin profile due to a higher proportion of materials revenues compared with other quarters this strong operational performance coupled with lower than expected tax rate drove a non gaap diluted eps of 1 10 in the quarter non gaap diluted eps for the year was 4 38 at the upper end of our guidance range operating cash flows for the full year of 768 million increased 46 from the prior year and resulted in a 104 free cash flow conversion of non gaap net income in line with our long term goal the slight miss versus our guidance target was driven by unexpected timing slips in the fourth quarter due to year end payment system transitions at a couple of our key customers during the fourth quarter we continued to monetize our balance sheet by selling our old headquarters building in san diego for net proceeds of 79 million the cash proceeds from this were received and recognized in two tranches 14 million in financing inflows in q4 of 18 and 65 million in investing in flows that will be in q1 of 2019 in addition just after the close of the year we also closed on the sale of the old is gs headquarters in gaithersburg for 31 million proceeds will be recognized as a cash flow from investing item during the first quarter of 2019 and these two transactions are an extension of our focus on monetizing non core assets and increasing our return on invested capital now let me share some comments on our segment results revenues in the defense solutions segment increased 3 6 in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year period driving the third consecutive quarter of growth in the business this growth largely reflects new program activity that expands our revenue base non gaap operating margins in our defense solutions segment decreased 160 basis points from the prior year quarter to 7 7 reflecting a lower level of net profit write ups now as a reminder there s typically a fair amount of variability in the quarterly timing of profit write ups for the full year the segment s margins were 8 4 flat with the prior year reflecting a similar level of profit write ups awards activity was a highlight in the defense solutions segment net bookings were over 7 billion in 2018 a 56 increase from 2017 book to bill for the year was 1 4 a substantial increase over the prior year level of 0 9 in our civil segment the new program wins and on contract growth contributed notably to fourth quarter results driving revenue growth of 3 6 over the prior year period the start up of new programs was the primary cause of the roughly 100 basis point decline in non gaap operating margins to 9 7 overall we are pleased in the growth in this business and are confident in our ability to drive margins higher over time in this segment bookings in our civil business increased in the fourth quarter with roughly 1 billion in net bookings which resulted in a 1 1 book to bill for the quarter and 1 0 for the year turning now to our health segment fourth quarter results were again very strong across all metrics revenue growth margins and bookings revenue grew nearly 13 over the prior year and roughly 12 sequentially this growth largely reflects the slippage of some revenues from the third quarter into the fourth quarter as we discussed in our third quarter call margins in our health business expanded in tandem with the revenue growth non gaap operating income margins of 16 1 in the fourth quarter increased more than 400 basis points from the prior year and 190 basis points sequentially for the full year non gaap operating margins of 15 2 increased 30 basis points from the prior year the margin expansion reflects a greater mix of on contract growth in certain quick turn fixed unit price contracts the health segment also had a very strong year in awards activity with full year net bookings of 3 2 billion roughly 75 higher than the prior year level resulting in a 1 7x book to bill for the year during the fourth quarter we booked 1 1 billion into backlog in the health segment resulting in a book to bill of 2 2 overall all of our businesses demonstrated solid progress in the fourth quarter toward our growth targets and we expect all segments to grow in 2019 but before i talk about 2019 guidance i want to comment on the government shutdown and its impacts to our business for fiscal year 2018 the shutdown was in effect for four working days at the very end of the year where we typically see heavy vacation usage so there was minimal impact to our business the shutdown did however force the closure of the committee on foreign investments in the united states or cfius which was the last approval needed to allow for the closure of our commercial cyber sale we continue to work the process and we expect that deal to close within the first quarter of 2019 for 2019 the shutdown impacts to our business are also relatively immaterial but given the volume of questions we ve received on this i ll provide some context first we estimate our aggregate revenue impact resulting from the shutdown to be approximately 11 million this effect is largely isolated to our civil segment where some of our work for the faa and the department of homeland security were deemed nonessential causing us to furlough some employees we realize the effect that this had on those employees and it was not a step taken lightly we may be able to recover some of this revenue loss throughout the year but it is too early to estimate any recovery now the shutdown also caused some delays in the billing and collections cycle as well as with award decisions but these effects are more timing related and we don t expect any permanent impacts to our business from those delays now on to our guidance for 2019 we expect revenue in the range of 10 5 billion to 10 9 billion reflecting growth of 3 to 7 from 2018 we expect 2019 to be a year in which we will exceed our 3 long term revenue target growth due to the strength of our backlog entering the year and our focus on driving on contract growth and winning new business throughout the year although we do not guide on a quarterly basis i would like to provide some context on the quarterly phasing of revenues for the year and particularly for the first quarter similar to 2018 we expect revenues to build sequentially throughout the year starting from a low point in the first quarter historically q1 revenues decline sequentially due to the lower level of material volumes compared to q4 this year however we expect a greater sequential decline in the high single digit range due to the combined effects of low materials buying in the first quarter program transitions in our health segment and the shutdown from the first quarter low however we expect revenues to grow sequentially throughout the year and to drive to our full year revenue guidance we expect adjusted ebitda margins of 9 9 to 10 1 for the year a slight decrease compared to 2018 and as we ve said in the past there is a trade off between margin and revenue growth and the ramp up of our new awards will drive slightly lower margin levels in the near term we expect non gaap eps between 4 25 and 4 60 we expect operating cash flow of at least 725 million a slight increase from 2018 levels after adjusting for the interest rate swap monetization and the unusually low cash tax rate we experienced in 2018 following the fourth quarter sale of our san diego building we will move into the more material phase of our real estate consolidation activities in 2019 we will continue to streamline our footprint and reduce owned facilities allowing us to work more efficiently and increase the level of collaboration across our functions as a result of these actions we expect a lot of moving parts to the different components of our cash flow statement this year so we ve added a slide slide 10 in our earnings deck which is available on our website to help you with some of the details some of the real estate actions increased capex and therefore reduced the free cash flow metric while others resulted in inflows in cash in investing and financing activities at the end of the day the net of all of our balance sheet monetization activities and our real estate investments will yield a positive cash inflow for the company and we will continue to deploy our excess cash from those transactions consistent with our stated capital deployment plan all that said we expect 2019 capital expenditures of between 135 million and 140 million roughly 60 million of that is related to real estate investments and leasehold improvements which will drive better asset utilization as we ve said earlier between the san diego and gaithersburg real estate sales we have already closed on transactions that will drive 95 million in inflows to cash from investing in the first quarter these inflows will more than offset the one time 60 million capex item that i referred to earlier beyond leaning out our real estate portfolio we will continue to look for opportunities to monetize the balance sheet which increases our flexibility and drives value for our shareholders now a couple of other comments to help you with modeling 2019 we expect net interest expense between 135 million to 140 million and a non gaap tax rate between 23 and 24 to wrap up we closed the year on strong footing we generated over three quarters of 1 billion of cash from operations our margins were again over target for the second year in a row and we exited the year with a revenue growth rate of 5 2 and record backlog we remain focused on continuing this momentum into 2019 by driving profitable growth and generating cash to drive long term value with that i ll turn the call over to kevin so we can take some questions questions and answers operator thank you we ll now be conducting a question and answer session operator instructions our first question today is coming from cai von rumohr from cowen and company your line is now live cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst yes thank you very much good quarter maybe you can help us understand like what is in your guide for 2019 does it include anything for nest does it include the commercial cyber business that you hope to close and then maybe some color on the adjusted ebitda margin which looks like it s at the bottom of your expectations james reagan chief financial officer good morning cai thanks for joining us yeah first the guide does include our expectations for the ramp up of nasa nest the guide does not include the commercial cyber business and in terms of our ebitda margin expectations for the year it reflects the fact that in 2019 we ve got a number of programs the army corps of engineers program nasa nest just to name a couple of them where the ramp up of those programs typically has lower margins than for the life of the program and we ve been historically pretty conservative in setting those profit take up levels early in the program as we plan on some contingencies as programs reach the end of their lives and we start to wind them down that s typically when you get more liquidation of risk and we pick up some write ups as you ve seen us historically have in the past cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst terrific and then for a last one maybe update us on where you are with genesis roger a krone chairman chief executive officer great cai i ll be happy to take that one we re really pleased with the program our relationship with the customer solid support in dha for moving forward a lot of enthusiasm over what s happened to the ioc sites and how we ve learned from our initial deployments we have agreement on a full schedule for deployments we re currently working on what we call wave 1 we ve identified the different groups of hospitals we re going to deploy to we expect wave 1 to go live in the fall the next wave not to confuse you is actually going to be wave 4 and we ll expect to start that later in the year and then we should be running a new wave about every six months and at any one time we will be in deployment of two waves concurrently a lot of great discussions with our customers we ve got agreement on the go forward plan we should be fully deployed by 2025 and cai as you know the program is expected to extend to about excuse me 2023 fully deployed and the program runs through 2025 i know you ve often asked in the past about sort of a ramp up in revenues and we expect to see that this year that maybe will give us sort of a point at the top line something like that and again very enthusiastic about the program a great relationship with our customer at dha there a strong commitment to put this technology in place to increase the healthcare for our active military cai von rumohr cowen and company analyst thank you very much operator our next question is coming from krishna sinha from vertical research partners your line is now live krishna sinha vertical research partners analyst hi thank you on your operating cash flow guidance for the year obviously i see the slide about the real estate but i m just talking about the operating cash flow can you just give us some puts and takes there about what you re expecting what s not being included or not recurring from 2018 to 2019 and just kind of what we can expect from the forward trajectory maybe beyond 2019 in terms of cash flow for the business on an underlying basis james reagan chief financial officer sure krishna thanks for the question the two big things that occurred in 2018 which are not recurring in 2019 and that s reflected in the go forward guide first as part of monetizing the balance sheet we took 60 million of cash for interest rate swaps that we could monetize in conjunction with extending the term of our term loan facility the second thing is we had some opportunities to monetize some deferred tax assets now these were tax assets that were fully reserved anyway but that was 65 million of cash that we pulled in that s also reflected in the gaap effective tax rate of about 4 5 so those things aren t recurring although we re always looking for opportunities to improve on our tax rate so those are the big things and then there are also a couple of items and they are primarily program related one of the large contracts that we just won will require us to buy some assets and that s a roughly 40 million cash flow headwind that we will end up recouping over the life of the program krishna sinha vertical research partners analyst that s great thank you james reagan chief financial officer sure operator thank you our next question is coming from robert spingarn from credit suisse your line is now live robert spingarn credit suisse analyst good morning roger a krone chairman chief executive officer good morning robert spingarn credit suisse analyst i wanted to ask a high level question about the guidance from a segment perspective in other words how are you thinking about the growth across the segments and then the same for the margins and this has to do with just some of the movement that we see in 2018 especially sequentially with regard to margin so jim if you could give us some understanding some color there by segment james reagan chief financial officer sure well rob i ll remind you we don t guide by segment but what i can give you is some color on is first of all because we re expecting all of the segments to be growing with some fairly large program wins as i mentioned when i was answering cai s question some of these larger programs tend to have margin profiles that ramp up as we increase the operating efficiency of these contracts we re probably expecting a little bit more growth in the health segment and in the defense segment as compared to the other segments of the business because of the large program wins that we ve had and the pace of the ramp up in both defense and in health as roger mentioned we re getting a full point of growth just off of the dhmsm program so i think that that helps you with kind of setting up what the growth profile is like of the segments robert spingarn credit suisse analyst and what are the biggest swings in your revenue guide that 400 million program wise or how do we think about what you re assuming at the low and high end james reagan chief financial officer well i think what i am understanding you re wondering well what could give rise to the low end what could give rise to the high end well robert spingarn credit suisse analyst yeah the 10 5 billion versus the 10 9 billion james reagan chief financial officer yeah we ve got a lot of bids that are 28 billion of bids outstanding at the end of the year one of them we ve already pulled in from bids outstanding and into backlog and that s the nasa nest program which was a takeaway meaning it s obviously additive to our growth profile that s reflected in our guide and i think the high end would be achieved if we kind of ran the table on the big ones and set us up for a 2020 that is growing at or potentially above what we re guiding to now on the low end it would be a significant drop in our win rates for the last year we ve been experiencing win rates that reflect first the very competitive cost position that is now showing up in the velocity of new awards the second it is we have a well defined set of technical differentiators that is probably more prominent in our win rates than the cost competitiveness and third the efficiency of our business development process is not only yielding great technical scores but it is reducing the cost that we need to put into winning x dollars of new backlog so those three things are really bearing out what i think gives us the confidence of at least the midpoint of our revenue guide if not a little bit more roger a krone chairman chief executive officer hey rob it s roger just a quick follow up on the nasa program we re still in that kind of unique period between announcement and debrief and the protest period so we have a couple more days to go to see whether one of the competitors is going to file a protest so we haven t exactly booked that into backlog yet and when we do it s a single award idiq and we ll probably book the first task order just so that people don t go out and put 2 9 billion in backlog it s probably likely in the quarter of in the hundreds of millions not in the billions but just as a technical point i wanted to make sure that i was clear in my comments that it s still subject to protest thanks robert spingarn credit suisse analyst and roger just on the back of that are there any specific awards that you would call out as being within the revenue synergies that at the time of the deal you weren t yet ready to talk about but now a few years in here what are you seeing revenue synergy wise roger a krone chairman chief executive officer well rob that s a great question it s one we haven t had for a while nasa nest is clearly won that is a program that really has come out of capabilities that came across in the merger with is gs and the combination of some of the things that we have done on the technology side and the cyber and the relationship that is gs had with the end user at nasa as part of that i would say i think our probability of win on hanford is enhanced by bringing the company together clearly that was a heritage is gs contract but i think we added more innovation in our offering you can look at navy next gen i think with the same view a program we might or might not have bid as stand alone leidos but clearly felt we had a compelling offering to bring forward to the program and just to kind of round out the sens3 program and the department of homeland security one that we won last year i think i would put in synergy we won an abis contract which is an army biometrics win which is a collection of sort of it and technology to be able to recognize individuals based upon biometrics and there s a whole host of classified wins i talked to aiml in my comments and that has been of particular interest in the intelligence community and it s led to some wins there as well so really a lot of again we don t talk a lot about synergy but a lot of cross linkages of the two business and a lot of strength in things that we can go after that we couldn t have gone before and then overall increasing our inaudible robert spingarn credit suisse analyst thank you both roger a krone chairman chief executive officer thank you rob operator thank you operator instructions our next question is coming from jon raviv from citi your line is now live jon raviv citigroup analyst hey good morning roger a krone chairman chief executive officer good morning jon raviv citigroup analyst jim can you just walk us through just some of a little bit more on the risks and opportunities in this year s sales guidance and i m thinking about it specifically in relation to a year ago where obviously fell a bit short in 2018 i just want to make sure that the bias is really more to the upside in this year s guidance versus last year s guidance thank you james reagan chief financial officer sure well we always like to hit the guidance down the middle of the fairway the nasa nest win certainly gives us a little bit more confidence as it s yet another takeaway win which builds the revenue volume and adds to our growth so just to put a little bit more color on my comments of just a minute ago i will repeat continuing to run at high win rates on takeaway and new business work new contract awards that are kind of new to our peer group that s one and we continue to see really great results in win rates that reflect the execution in our business development teams going back to kind of what are the things that could be a dampener of our growth rate and that would be if the clearance process slows down or if the handoff from opm to dod doesn t go as i think dod or we would expect i think that that could be one risk factor to revenue growth and then the second one would be kind of a change in the success that we ve been experiencing in business development that and our hiring processes so far we re pleased with what we re seeing out of our recruiting teams but if the labor market has a sudden tightening from where we see it today that could slowdown down our ability to hire people needed to execute on contract backlog jon raviv citigroup analyst okay and then in terms of some of the bigger recompetes this year can you just potentially give a little more color perhaps even quantify some of that exposure in terms of sales but also in terms of profits the docs make it look like hanford big on sales but doesn t add much income could you just level set us on those please james reagan chief financial officer yeah you just mentioned hanford and probably the other large recompete that we have is gsm o which we don t disclose the dollar values of both the revenue run rate or the margin details at the contract level but clearly gsm o would be one that we re planning on rewinning and if we get surprised on that one that could be a dampener not so much for 2019 though but more for 2020 that contract regardless of the outcome is going to continue to run well into 2019 for us jon raviv citigroup analyst thanks i ll stick to the two james reagan chief financial officer okay thanks jon operator thank you our next question is coming from noah poponak from goldman sachs your line is now live gavin parsons goldman sachs analyst hey good morning everyone it s gavin on for noah roger a krone chairman chief executive officer hey gavin james reagan chief financial officer hey gavin gavin parsons goldman sachs analyst hey guys nice to see bookings strength translating to revenue growth but i think the margin pressure is kind of right in line with that 10 plus you re talking about which maybe seems like a lot of pressure just on the rate of growth you re experiencing so i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your strategy to grow ebitda dollars and roger i appreciate the color that earlier on the contracts have lower margins and later on you can book them at a higher margin but whether or not these will be accretive on average over the life of the contracts and how you think about bidding when the margin initially is this low roger a krone chairman chief executive officer okay complex question let me see if i can unpack it a little bit and then i ll look to jim let s see we have a pipeline and we kind of filter against the pipeline and we look at the structure of a contract and our ability to generate at or our target over the life of the program we are in a fortunate position where we can decide what to bid and what not to bid we ve talked in the past about staying away from what we used to call lowest price technically acceptable because it traditionally has lower margin and frankly it s probably not the work that we are best equipped to do we become more interested in a program where we can create a point of difference through our discriminators our technology our cost structure and our size and as such we hope over the life of the program right to be accretive to our long term ebitda margin i think it was jon who talked about hanford there are some programs just by their nature are going to be lower hanford is one of them has always been that particular customer just views the programs differently hanford is a very important program to us we use it for a lot of past performance quals it s a hugely important program for the nation and cleaning up the 600 square mile site in southeast washington is really really important work but generally we are looking at the portfolio and the pipeline with an eye to 10 or better on ebitda i think you reemphasized is that often when we get started we are more thoughtful about our booking rate and how we ramp up and if programs are going to have transition issues it s usually in the first year or so so it behooves us and i think everyone in the industry does that to be more thoughtful about our earnings rate in the early contract but because of our technological differentiators we have the luxury to go after higher value added work which typically carries more margin with it gavin parsons goldman sachs analyst got it and then roger you talked about the dod budget aligning well with your portfolio can you give us a little bit more color on kind of how you d expect those priorities to go between hardware and kind of your addressable market roger a krone chairman chief executive officer well secretary shanahan is in i think in the first year or two they were looking at operational capability rate and getting the fleet and other hardware back up to a higher operational tempo we certainly benefited from that they are now focused toward buying end items ships and tanks and airplanes but not necessarily at the expense of their operational tempo but what really excites me is the digital transformation that s going on not only in the department of defense but across federal space writ large they have gotten to operate more efficiency to open up more sort of obligation authority to buy hardware and to pay troops and to defend the country and that s right in our sweet spot we re really really good at digital transformation move to the cloud software defined networks and that gets us excited but we re also seeing a bit of a shift in how i think the department views the threat and a lot of discussion if you read the national security strategy is what we call the physical and the kinetic threat is still important but the virtual threat is becoming even more important what s going on in cyberspace some of the newer technologies and that fits really well with where we are we re not necessarily a company that builds tanks and big aircraft carriers and things like that we are much more in the soft technologies software cyber areas like that electronic warfare and we see increased spending in those areas gavin parsons goldman sachs analyst thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from greg konrad from jefferies your line is now live greg konrad jefferies analyst a really strong booking year and quarter can you maybe talk about some of the initiatives outside of dhmsm in place that s supporting both the improvement in bookings and the revenue outlook for next year roger a krone chairman chief executive officer yeah i think so so this is roger and if you ve been following our story for a while you know that about two years ago we had lost some programs that we thought were franchise and it really caused us to go back and look at our whole business development process from cradle to grave and we looked at what we call our win plan how we write proposals the staff that we had how we view the competitive discriminators and as we ve said frankly often on this call over the past several quarters we kind of started over and we took a clean sheet and gerry fasano and now roy stevens in business development and we looked at why we were winning and why we were losing and how we presented our competitive discriminators even down to what bids that we were bidding on and whether we really felt we had a compelling point of difference on those bids and i would say i think we ve gotten better across the board better in identifying the opportunity putting it in the pipeline working early in the bid process with the customer to understand what their compelling needs actually were and then just the way we go about actually structuring and writing a proposal how we deal with the proposal center how well we represent our capabilities in between the front cover and the back cover of the proposal another point that we made that s really all the way through this journey from the acquisition is there was i think a thought that is gs the lockheed business had become less cost competitive in some of the bids that they had made kind of being tucked inside a large oem and we had huge emphasis on bringing their overhead and sg a therefore their wrap rates down to where we had been historically and we look at our wins and our losses we do a lot of forensics and i wouldn t say we have not lost any bids based upon price but the number of bids that we have lost based upon our cost structure is down to just a very and so we are pleased with how we have used our cost structure to solve that problem and that has allowed us to focus on superior technical offerings that create a point of difference for the customer greg konrad jefferies analyst thank you and just a follow up on your commentary around employees and employment is there any way to think about headcount growth for the year and are you seeing any signs of any type of wage inflation james reagan chief financial officer yeah greg we don t provide headcount targets i can tell you that compared to what our internal targets are we re doing well in growing our direct employees compared to our plan and then the other thing on wage inflation we do put a plan in place for growth in in market salaries that is consistent with the benchmarks that we see published externally and so far we re not seeing any pressure on those assumptions that we have in our plan the market is obviously pretty competitive for the kinds of people we are hiring but given our scale and given the breadth of different things that people can work on here and a competitive salary and benefit structure so far we re able to achieve our hiring numbers operator thank you our next question today is coming from rick eskelsen from wells fargo securities your line is now live richard eskelsen wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning thank you for taking my question just to clarify on the guidance commentary for the dhmsm contract it s 1 point to growth throughout the guidance or is it a 1 point addition at the high end and then also can you talk about any grow over amount for the commercial cyber which i believe you said was not in the forward guidance thank you james reagan chief financial officer thank you yeah so the way first of all we think about dhmsm is that 1 point of growth is inclusive of the our guidance implies 5 growth that number includes roughly a point for our dhmsm the second point to commercial cyber the commercial cyber number that midpoint of growth would be higher if you back the commercial cyber number out of our 2018 results but at this point we have to keep those numbers confidential for terms of our agreement with the buyer richard eskelsen wells fargo securities analyst thank you operator your next question is coming from tobey summer from suntrust your line is now live tobey summer suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks with respect to your comment on the budget and having a constructive outlook does your commentary for the defense and intelligence budget hold true for the whole budget including civil and could you comment if currencies take a little bit of the edge off of your revenue growth guidance for 19 roger a krone chairman chief executive officer i ll do the first one i think that was a foreign exchange question on the second one let s see here s a comment that i want to make sure everybody understands is that so i think we re all comfortable with what s going on in the department of defense clearly there s been a lot of attention in what s going on in the department of homeland security we are optimistic in the parts of border security in which we operate our vacis system what we do relative to vehicle inspections we believe that has a significant role to play in the vision of this government in securing the borders and so not only are we pleased with what we re seeing out of the department of defense in those areas in our civil business where we have visibility into the budget we are also quite pleased we think there was a large amount of fentanyl that was used at the border a couple of weeks ago and it is those technologies which we think we will be able to provide to the government and they will fuel our top line growth by the way we kind of feel the same way about what s going on in doe and faa and a lot of the other civil organizations james reagan chief financial officer yeah and then relative to the currency question we don t see currency as being a material headwind or tailwind for 2019 there was a little bit of a headwind in 2018 but i wouldn t call it material with respect to the overall number just a reminder that international or foreign denominated contracts are roughly 10 of our overall business operator thank you our next question is coming from joseph denardi from stifel your line is now live joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst yeah good morning jim i think you ve talked in the past a little bit about your m a focus and not having much of a desire just to acquire pure play services businesses and maybe want to increase your exposure to products and hardware i m wondering if that means looking at services business that may have a product or hardware component to them or whether you d be willing to acquire kind of or look at pure play hardware and products businesses james reagan chief financial officer joe great question and the short answer to both parts of your question is yes for us we have less interest in a pure play services business especially one that looks in terms of its customer footprint a lot like us we don t need more of what we ve got we can compete and expand the business that we have just fine on our own the things that we re looking for to build the company inorganically would be the kind of company with both the services and a product differentiator that bolts in well with the kind of work that both the target company and we do a pure product company could also be of interest to us although i would say that the ones that we ve been interested in to this point tends to have some kind of service element to them but i wouldn t say that we re not interested in i wouldn t say we d shy away from a pure product business if it was strategically if it fit our strategic criteria operator thank you our next question is a follow up from jon raviv from citi your line is now live jon raviv citigroup analyst hi thanks for taking the follow up roger in your prepared remarks you had mentioned 2019 and beyond could you talk a little bit more about that beyond by any chance maybe a small preview for the event in may especially now that the combination is done roger a krone chairman chief executive officer a little bit is we kind of came out of the merger and we talked about 3 growth and 10 and of course now we re printing a little bit better than that as you know we are a long cycle business and with 28 billion if you take the 2 9 billion out for nasa nest 25 billion in unawarded most of that is going to impact beyond 2019 the way things work if they make an award to us this year we ramp up you really don t see those revenues until 2020 and beyond and as excited as we are about 2019 if you just run your model as we do and you ll run similar models you can see that that the submits unawarded is going to have a larger impact on 2020 than it will on 2019 and it s the government s need for the types of solutions that we provide that gives us enthusiasm about the future and our strong balance sheet and cash conversion gives us the currency if you will to invest in the future and to grow the business and so as excited as i was five years ago when i came excited and as excited as i was about the merger with is gs i look at the budget prospects and the needs of the government and 2019 is going to be year for us but i think 2020 will be even better james reagan chief financial officer yeah and to pile on there jon about two thirds of our pipeline is either new work or what i call opb other people s business and so with two thirds of that representing things that are other than just keeping and recompeting our existing work to roger s point i think the profile of the pipeline certainly speaks well for some growth opportunity operator thank you our next question is a follow up from krishna sinha from vertical research partners your line is now live krishna sinha vertical research partners analyst i just wanted to get an update on capital deployment obviously you ve made some comments that you re just going to try and maintain the dividend at a kind of steady rate but just focusing more on the buybacks and the m a opportunity and how you re thinking about those in 2019 are you close to any sort of bolt on deals or have any in the pipe that you think could close within the next 12 months that we should be aware of or since you d be generating cash here should we think about the buyback sort of staying at this pretty high cadence that you ve been generating in the last two quarters james reagan chief financial officer yeah krishna i think that if you compare where we sit today and looking at the m a pipeline i wouldn t say anything different about it compared to what i said last quarter or the quarter before that we ve got an m a team internally that is looking at ideas that are consistent with our strategy but we re very focused on doing good deals not just deals for the sake of prosecuting a pipeline so a couple of other factors that i would point out to answer your question we re very comfortable with our leverage today and we have plenty of dry powder and ability to take on more leverage particularly today s rates to buy the right kinds of assets but with that said we re also not going to sit around waiting for something to come under contract before we make a decision on whether to deploy so you could see a year we could be looking back on 2019 as being a year when we made a couple of acquisitions or an acquisition but we also were able to deploy capital with some buyback and the normal level of debt buyback operator thank you our next question is coming from joseph denardi from stifel your line is now live joseph denardi stifel nicolaus analyst yeah my follow up was going to be if roger you can just talk about the sensitivity to a cr in 2020 and maybe just the mechanics of how that would look i think kind of the impact to spending would be more pronounced because the budget would get set at the sequestration level whereas fy 19 just got set at fy 18 s level so maybe i m wrong can you just kind of walk us through what your expectations there would be if there is a cr to start fy 20 i know it s a long way away but just want to get your thoughts thank you roger a krone chairman chief executive officer joe you have it just about right if we end up with a cr we could snap back and if we don t do this right we could be back to the sequester caps and i touched on that in my remarks i m not the best person to predict what s going to happen in the government i will tell you i have been encouraged by what the department of defense has done and their ability to cross the river and talk to the hill and to explain to our elected officials how important it is to get a budget i ve been optimistic before about the ability of the department to actually get a budget passed i m also optimistic moving into what is going to be a presidential election season that people are not going to be distracted by a continuing resolution which snaps us back to the sequester caps and requires the department to curtail programs and so if i was up funded ph i would tell you i think it s more likely that we re going to get some kind of a negotiation and we will get a budget rather than a cr but the mechanics of what happens in a cr you have about right and if we win all the way back to the sequester caps i think the department would have to take some significant measures to be able to get their budgets back underneath that as you know once they start spending on aircraft carriers and f 35s and things there is a future bill to be paid and when they commit to like a bulk buy of two aircraft carriers that s with the assumption that they re going to get most of what they ask for in their budget request in the future if you snap the budget back to sequester caps they re already committed to build those aircraft carriers and it creates a real planning dilemma for the department and because of that because i think our elected officials understand the importance of defending the country and they don t want this to become a topic in the presidential debate i think we ll probably end up with a budget operator thank you we ve reached end of our question and answer session i d like to turn the floor back over to kelly for any further closing comments kelly hernandez senior vice president of investor relations thank you kevin and thank you all for joining us this morning as well as for your

core operating income is used by management to evaluate the financial performance of the company s long term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as assist

the financial performance of the company s long term investment strategy and core business activities over periods of time as well as its earnings capacity a limitation of utilizing this non gaap financial measure is that the effect of accounting for non core events or transactions in accordance with gaap does in fact reflect the financial results of our business and these effects should not be ignored when evaluating and analyzing our financial results for example the economic cost or benefit of hedging instruments other than interest rate swap agreements such as u s treasury note futures or options on u s treasury note futures do not affect the computation of non gaap core operating income in addition the company s calculation of non gaap core operating income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies therefore the company believes that net income and comprehensive income determined in accordance with gaap should be considered in

wall street returns after its long weekend with setting up the asx to open in positive territroy this morning 1 us markets back wall street up us markets returned to trade last night and heading into wall street s close a positive day looks to be on the cards for american stocks if realised it ll be one that comes on the back of markedly lower volume following the presidents day holiday at that as far as the s p goes the market is not yet seriously threatening that highly anticipated resistance level at about 2815 wall street advanced albeit on a day of light trading volume credit ap given market circumstances this v shaped rally in us and global equities could lose juice before that point that approximate level though is being treated as the line in the sand it s where rallies have gone to die in the recent past and will be watched closely as it looms larger on the horizon 2 dollar lower yields falls activity in other asset classes is proving supportive for us stocks presently the market landscape didn t shift last night just like it didn t at the back end of last week regardless the themes contributing to the evolution in price action thus far this year still possess momentum rates and bonds markets are progressively shifting towards levels that reflect an economic slow down in the us albeit at a manageable tick for now
tickers gtch gbr gtbdf source michael ballanger for streetwise reports 2 19 19 sector expert michael ballanger describes his investment strategies in light of recent stock market moves a few weeks ago i published one of my more noteworthy missives entitled the time to be short again has arrived in which i advanced the notion that the level of the 200 day moving average for the s p 500 2 742 was about as good a level to exit the market if long or an opportunity to reestablish shorts if flat after a particularly profitable december i went into the new year 2019 cashed up and ready for another shorting opportunity in the s p and goldman sachs i decided to take a stab at a few spy puts on feb 6 with the market at 2 738 and warned that a 2 day close above 2 750 was my stop loss point it was a moderately good call in that the s p immediately tanked to 2 685 but has since reversed and in the absence of any tweets or e mails or missives suggesting anything resembling cover all shorts i was officially stopped out of the s p short on friday morning on the opening at 2 761 prior to monday s action the s p only had one closing above 2 750 feb 13 at 2 753 spent most of valentine s day between 2 732 and 2 753 but then exploded due to positive trade news meaning rumors to the positive we sold the s p at 2 738 we covered at 2 761 and now at 2 775 i am looking to reestablish the short on the s p once the relative strength index rsi now 69 01 moves into the 70s which it should next week while the histograms appear somewhat subdued the macd indicator is now as wildly overbought as i have seen it in quite some time while i was stopped out for a modest hit on friday like a pitbull on a bone i am looking to take another stab at the short side i still consider this to be a textbook bear market rally with a retest of the december lows in store before new highs are achieved in the second half of 2019 however as i have been writing since the lows on christmas eve the most powerful of all financial narcotics is fear of missing out which along with its older brother greed is incubated in the most powerful meth lab in existence the bear market rally only time will tell whether the algobots programming will agree with my assessment but once thing is certain this rally is one mother of an opium den of illusory hope and it is sucking a great many investors into that familiar fed s got our backs complacency the big story for me this week was not the manipulations and machinations of the price managers on wall street in rescuing the great bull market but rather the abrupt about face in the precious metals markets in the face of the capitulation of jerome powell and the global central bankers everyone is now rapidly abandoning the entire concept of normalization from the u s federal reserve to the european central bank to the people s bank of china as renewed stimuli are being discussed and introduced everywhere the chart below illustrates how gold responded to those gargantuan watershed shifts in monetary policy from 2009 to 2011 as the stock markets became the third mandate joining maximum full employment and price stability on the docket gold was most certainly headed for a test of the 1 300 level last week when in the face of a strong dollar it did a one eighty and headed back up closing at 1 325 basis april for most of this frigid weekend i have been pondering over the longer term implications of the powell policy shift in late december the more i think about it the more convinced i am of the likelihood of a sustained advance in gold and silver mirroring their behaviors in the 2009 2011 period which was the last time the bankers bailed out stocks they bailed out the stock market again this past december because i believe jerome powell gazed into the crystal ball and saw the incredible degree of financialization of the global economies wreaking terminal havoc on the western economies and panicked what appeared in that ominous orb was not only massive layoffs in the financial industries but wave after wave of rising populism with the gutted middle class pointing accusatory fingers at the davos gang while declining stock markets and depleted portfolio values frighten the elite politico banker classes in every country around the world nothing and i mean nothing terrifies them more than the specter of the madding crowd s ignoble strife complete with torches pitchforks and confiscatory tax policies designed to liberate the wealthy from their wealth and the governors from government to the elitists the working and shrinking middle classes are magnificent mirrors by which they can view and compare their enviable lots in life to that of the deplorables referred to by hillary clinton during the last american election however it is these very deplorables that are manning the guillotines of revolutionary change in the streets of france in a millennial march toward a new world order and not the kind envisioned by the globalists and politico banker class this anarchist sentiment bubbling to the surface of generational thinking comes as the cost of maintaining the current world order and its suppressive employment policies rise to levels unbearable within the current economic system to have 30 youth unemployment in countries such as italy is unthinkable but were it not for the wealth concentrated in the stock portfolios of the american politico banker class the same would be the case in america which brings us right back to the late december powell revelation of just how significant stock markets are to the public mood and to the maintenance of the status quo so worshipped by the 1 that own 99 of everything around the world balance sheet normalization pales in importance to a marauding middle class seeking out revenge for the plight in which they find themselves adding a crashing stock market to crashing job opportunities and you arrive at bone dry political tinder in advance of a flash fire of social disorder that in my view was the horror that prompted the policy shift in summary since the fed mandate now has three instead of two critical components the recently added third one being rising stock markets i look to history and the 2009 fiscal policy initiative that created approximately 14 trillion in stimulus credit as the benchmark for the next two to five years and the one singular event rhyming with the 2009 2011 period that will drive the gold price to all time highs with that as a backdrop what are the optimum actions to take over the short intermediate and long term time horizons to adequately protect wealth from the erosion of purchasing power and depletion of living standards in the short term we must look to the intentions of the bullion bank traders who have a distinct advantage over the rest of us by way of unlimited capital and regulatory sanctuary the best window into their playbook remains the commitment of traders cot report as for the cot we are still weeks behind in the data the cot week ended jan 22 marked the terminus of the pullback to 1 281 50 and included a 16 036 contract reduction in the commercial trader short position the next move was straight north to the january peak at 1 331 10 at which point rsi got into the mid 70s and reversed i sent everyone a chart of silver showing how many tops had occurred with rsi stretched into the 70s and proceeded to exit all of my leveraged positions on thursday jan 31 which was followed the very next day by a two week decline that ended exactly on valentine s day what has caught my eye is that even with the lag in the cot data it is obvious the narrowing of the position extremes between the commercials and the large specs continues just as it did last spring but the price action is decisively different last year s rinse and repeat cycle saw a 140 drop in gold as the commercials went from 160 000 net shorts in may to over 40 000 net longs in august in the six weeks we have seen a sharp reversal in the large spec holdings as prices remain rangebound as opposed to collapsing which spells higher prices ahead the reversal day we got on thursday set up the sharp and unusual for a friday advance in gold late last week so leveraged long positions such as the gld slv and jnug calls should be bought but only on weakness early this week if i get a pop into the 1 335 1 345 range for gold with rsi in the 70 80 range i will use very tight stop losses on these positions the long physical gold and silver positions and the junior exploration and development issues recommended in the 2019 forecast issue portfolio remain intact as intermediate and long term holdings in anticipation of new highs in 2019 twitter is a useful tool in communicating actions to be taken and going on record with a call accordingly i sent out a tweet last thursday at 11 17 a m with gold at 1 313 60 having roared back from a 1 305 low looks like we are getting a positive outside reversal for gold at least in the pit session so i am buying back all of my leveraged positions gld april 125 calls slv april 13 calls plus jnug the ggma 2019 model portfolio has been updated as of friday and has advanced 14 56 year to date ytd largely on the strength of the 10 000 share holding in great bear resources ltd gbr tsx v gtbdf otc purchased on jan 2 at 2 30 i purchased my first position in gbr in august at around 1 70 immediately after learning of its exciting gold discovery in red lake ontario the dixie project is especially close to my heart because the first championship in my hockey career was while playing center ice for the mississauga based dixie beehives in 1969 1970 we won the ontario junior b championship defeating the likes of the markham waxers stratford indians and hamilton mountain bs the dixie organization holds a special place for me and now gbr s dixie project is doing the same with the s p 500 enjoying the biggest percentage advance in years having gained 10 72 ytd the ggma portfolio is outperforming it by a hefty 35 8 in the same time period and it is the 65 gain in gbr that is carrying the load this portion of my service is for paid subscribers only should you wish to subscribe to the ggm advisory ggma email me and i ll send you the details finally and in closing i wanted to thank all participants in the getchell gold corp gtch cse financings during the 2017 2018 stretch for their patience and perseverance now that the final verdict has been handed down by the canadian securities exchange and canada depository services i must wait for getchell to announce the results of the tribunal before making any detailed comments but suffice it to say that i basically wasted eight weeks of my life trying to secure justice for my friends and colleagues now that it is a fait accompli i intimately know how the gold anti trust action committee s gata s bill murphy and chris powell must be feeling after twenty odd years of herculean efforts in trying to secure justice for believers in the roles played by gold and silver in the quest for true price discovery and transparency in world markets getting shuttled back and forth between regulators and exchange officials and brokerage firm compliance departments as bill and chris have been doing since the late 90s enduring untold personal expense with not so much as a token retainer has been a nosferatu nightmare for them both i am in the middle stages of writing my memoirs over the getchell affair and when i am finally able to compare notes with bill and chris and the late jim blanchard i will reveal what i have learned about the people we think we trust in their execution of their duties it is explosive material it is enraging material it is maddening material to the point of violence and it evokes the finality of the knowledge and recognition of right versus wrong some of the people in our world have been allowed to function within a platform bereft of the knowledge or appreciation if what exactly constitutes actions that transgress the moral compass they choose to withdraw to the sanctuary of legal technicality and absolution a tactic that my late father would never tolerate let alone condone the gata saga and the getchell saga carry one thing in common there is today no avenue of access available to anyone that seeks to recolonize the very core of the free market once you have all grasped

project construction will began in july of 2019 with an expected commercial operation in the third quarter of 2020 south dakota public utilities commission approved the site permit for the 165 million astoria station natural gas generation project and the north dakota psc approve the project for rider recovery in our recent north dakota rate case we will begin construction in 2019 and expect to be operational by march 2021 these and other investments will produce an annual growth rate of 8 in our rate base between 2018 and 2023 in a constructive regulatory environment the minnesota public utilities commission approved a one year extension to june 1 2020 for the filing of our next resource plan two key environmental regulations that may impact our modeling are the regional haze rule and the proposed affordable clean energy rules delaying our filing one year will allow us to consider the outcomes of these environmental regulations and develop a more informed resource plan in august we published our esg sustainability report which gives investors and others insight into our environmental social and governance commitments on slide 15 through 17 you ll see highlights from our report and a glimpse into how our electric utilities plant and service and resource mix are evolving due to significant investments in low cost renewable energy and transmission that enables regional wind development last but certainly not least february 4 2019 marked the official go live date for our new customer information system this 37 month project is our biggest system upgrade in the generation i m proud of the project team for its result throughout the project and for executing a seamless cutover plan to help ensure continued customer satisfaction i d also like to give special recognition to coyote station in north dakota for achieving two milestones by year end the plant exceeded 3 million megawatt hours produced the second highest yearly generation amount in the plants 38 year history and crossed over the 3 million manhour without a loss time incident the plants last loss time incident occurred 18 years ago congratulations to coyote station employees for these significant accomplishments and thank you to all of our employees for continuing to put safety first our manufacturing companies also experienced notable accomplishments in 2018 btd our contract metal fabricator and largest manufacturing business increased sales by 19 in 2018 and the georgia location is profitable in the last half of the year the company achieved this while reporting its lowest osha rate and highest on time delivery in history t o plastics celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2018 and achieved 6 overall sales growth and a 29 increase in earnings driven mostly by lower income tax rates the company s horticulture segment continues to grow through key account relationships and new product launches northern pipe products and vinyltech had an exceptional year supported by strong market demand and prices and continued excellent operational performance they positively contributed to earnings while remaining highly competitive both companies continue to prove improve in the markets they serve by demonstrating flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs we re targeting additional organic volume growth in these companies in 2019 employees across our organization are aligned with our growth strategy which includes capital investment continued improvement in operations and talent development it s with much appreciation that i congratulate them on a job well done in 2018 in 2019 we will continue to execute on utility rate base growth and create additional organic growth in the manufacturing businesses now i ll turn it over to kevin for the financial perspective kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer well thank you chuck and good morning everyone i will cover the following items our 2018 financial results our liquidity position the strength balance sheet and corporate credit ratings the increase in our 2019 indicated annual dividend our five year capital expenditure plan and our 2019 business outlook we are pleased with our strong 2018 financial performance revenues grew approximately 8 and earnings grew approximately 14 with all our reporting segments showing year over year increases in revenues and earnings we earned 2 06 per share which compared with 1 82 per share last year our 2018 return on equity was 11 5 on an equity ratio of 54 5 our two platform strategy continues to deliver higher returns on equity on a higher equity layer when compared to holding company peers let me now provide an overview of 2018 earnings by segment as shown on slides 20 and 21 electric segment net earnings increased 5 million year over year key drivers include increased revenues due to more favorable weather year over year earnings improved by 0 11 a share due to the weather and compared to normal weather was favorable by 0 07 a share increased revenues due to interim rates associated with our north dakota general rate case net of estimated refunds which was implemented in january of 2018 interim rates associated with our south dakota rate case went into effect in october of 2018 increased renewable resource rider revenues in minnesota and north dakota and increased minnesota sip revenues these items were partially offset by a 9 6 million reduction in revenues related to a provision for refunds to recognize that current retail rates in our service area and ferc approved transmission tariffs our recovering federal income taxes in excess of lower rates under tax reform lower north dakota environmental cost recovery rider revenue due to the impact from lower tax rates a reduction in the return on equity component of the rider in the lower investment balance subject to recovery from depreciation for our north dakota and south dakota transmission costs recovery riders due to the impact of lower tax rate and reduced transmission costs other items impacting the segment s earnings were higher operating and maintenance property tax and depreciation expenses we did have a scheduled maintenance outage in 2018 at our big stone plant that cost 2 9 million we don t have any planned maintenance outages in 2019 in income tax expense was lower in 2018 mainly due to the reduction in federal corporate tax rates from 35 to 21 and the reversal of excess deferred taxes net earnings for the manufacturing segment increased 1 8 million year over year key elements of this improvement are as follows btd s revenues increased 36 8 million of which 33 8 million came from increased product sales to all its major end markets 12 7 million of this increase relates to higher material costs that were passed through to customers with the balance due to increased sales and improved pricing btd s scrap metal revenues also increased due to higher volumes and higher scrap sales prices these increases were offset in part by higher cost of goods sold and operating expenses and higher income taxes due to the elimination of the section 199 deduction which was eliminated in 2018 and the writedown of deferred tax liabilities in 2017 which lowered last year s income tax expense these items resulted in a 1 2 million increase in btd s year over year earnings t o plastics revenues improved 1 9 million mainly due to increased sales of horticultural containers the increased revenues were partially offset by higher cost of goods sold labor freight and operating expenses earnings before taxes increased slightly year over year however due to a lower tax rate earnings improved 600 000 at t o plastics the plastics segment s earnings increased 2 1 million year over year as a result of a 9 4 increase in pvc pipe prices a 2 3 decrease in pounds of pipe sold the increase in sales prices more than offset higher cost of goods per pound sold and lower sales volumes the net impact of these items resulted in an 11 3 improvement in gross margins sales volumes were lower in the last four months of 2018 compared with the same time period in 2017 primarily due to the increased sales from hurricane related impacts in the gulf coast region those dynamics favorably impacted earnings by an estimated 0 09 a share in 2017 and the favorable variance due to tax reform was offset by a loss of the section 199 deduction in 2018 technical difficulty lower tax expense in 2017 from a 3 3 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities due to tax reform our corporate expenses before taxes increased 4 million year over year primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions due to the establishment of the otter tail corporation charitable foundation in 2018 the increase in employee benefit costs and in other corporate costs we realized the 5 million net increase in tax savings in the corporate costs center in 2018 primarily due to the writedown of deferred tax assets in 2017 from tax reform this was offset by an increase in tax expense mostly related to uncertain tax positions and the establishment of a valuation allowance on the recoverability of certain state net operating losses and we experienced a reduction in tax savings as a result of the federal tax rate change the net result of our lease items was 1 million year over year reduction in corporate expense moving to slide 22 let s review our financial condition and liquidity last year we had no equity financing activity and don t expect any equity issuances in 2019 our two credit agreements are in place until october 31 of 2023 between expected cash flow generated from 2019 operating activities and these credit facilities we have the appropriate levels of liquidity to support both of our business platforms we currently expect to do a private placement of debt at otter tail power company in the range of 150 million to 170 million during the last half of 2019 in connection with our rate base growth and in 2018 all three rating agencies affirmed otter tail corporation and otter tail power s ratings and outlook and we remain committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and we ll manage our operations to reflect that commitment as shown on slide 24 the board of directors increased our indicated annualized dividend rate from 1 34 per share to 1 40 per share this 4 5 increase is a result of our solid 2018 performance and our 2019 outlook the company s strong balance sheet liquidity cash generation profile and our commitment to enhancing shareholder returns we expect future dividend increases to be in line with earnings growth while maintaining a targeted payout ratio in the range of 60 to 70 and we have paid dividends on our stock for 80 years for 321 consecutive quarters slide 25 highlights our capital expenditure plans for the 2019 through 2023 timeframe we expect capital expenditures for 2019 to be 203 million planned expenditures for this year includes 61 million for the merricourt wind project and 40 million for the astoria station natural gas fired plant these investments will continue to positively impact the corporation s earnings and returns on capital the five year capital plan calls for approximately 973 million in utility projects 45 of this capital spend will be recovered through riders the plan also includes 97 million for the manufacturing and plastics businesses in our updated compounded annual growth rate in rate base over the 2018 through 2023 timeframe is projected to be 8 using 2018 as the base year slide 26 reflects our 2019 consolidated earnings per share guidance of 2 10 to 2 25 this guidance includes our strategies for improving future results the cyclical nature of the manufacturing businesses as well as current regulatory factors facing our electric segment our electric segment s 2019 net income is expected to be higher than 2018 based on constructive outcome in the south dakota rate case increased afudc for planned capital projects including merricourt wind project in the astoria natural gas plant along with increased revenues from the north dakota generation cost recovery rider on the astoria station increased revenues from the completion of the big stone south ellendale project and additional transmission investments related to our south dakota transmission reliability project decreased operating and maintenance expenses due to a decrease in pension medical workers compensation and retiree medical benefits our discount rate is increasing in 2019 to 4 5 from 3 9 driven by the increasing interest rate environment these items are offset by normal weather weather favorably impacted our 2018 earnings per share by 0 07 compared to normal higher property tax and depreciation expense due to larger transmission projects being put into service we expect increased earnings from our manufacturing segment in 2019 due to increased sales at btd and the recreational vehicle lawn and garden and agricultural end markets also increased scrap revenues due to stronger sales volumes the increased earnings at t o plastics primarily driven by increased sales in horticultural life science and industrial end markets the backlog for this segment is approximately 211 million for 2019 compared with 166 million a year ago we expect plastics 2019 net income to be lower than 2018 we are expecting lower operating margins due to increasing resin prices and slightly higher sales volumes compared to last year in corporate costs net of tax are expected to be lower in 2019 our current earnings guidance for 2019 reflect 68 of our earnings from our electric segment and 32 of our earnings from our manufacturing and plastics segments this compares with 66 and 34 respectively in 2018 the increase in the electric earnings mix is being driven by the rate base growth related to merricourt astoria and south dakota reliability projects we expect the long term earnings mix to continue to move back in line with 75 of earnings from our electric segment and 25 of our manufacturing and plastics segments net of unallocated corporate costs this will be driven by the capital plan which calls for approximately 91 of our capital spend over the 2019 through 2023 timeframe to be in the electric segment we believe our 2019 guidance further positions us to achieve a 5 to 7 compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share using 2018 s 2 06 a share our 2019 guidance is dependent on the business and the economic challenges our two platforms will face this year for the utility key drivers include constructive outcome in the south dakota rate case and successful execution of our rate base growth projects for btd key drivers include continued operational improvements across all locations to further improve our return on sales margins and while earnings are expected to decline in 2019 for plastics this segment continues to be a strong complement to our portfolio by providing strong earnings cash flows to support our dividend and returns on invested capital we are now ready to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from paul ridzon with keybanc paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst good morning how are you charles macfarlane president chief executive officer good morning paul paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst could you give just some background on this charitable contribution and what we should look for going forward charles macfarlane president chief executive officer sure paul i appreciate the question we have for a number of year been considering establishing the foundation for well both otter tail corporation and then we also have established one for the otter tail power company as well and we wanted to in 2018 certainly help get the foundations off on the right foot with the good commitment to fund those organizations going forward and so you see a probably a much healthier contribution made for the otter tail power i m sorry the otter tail corporation foundation in that 2 million amount the power company is a 0 5 million and as we kind of look forward i would tell you that future contributions are ultimately subject to the success the financial success that we re having at both of the entities but in the utility we re looking for the future kind of range i would say in that 2 million to 500 000 range on a go forward basis and at the parent company depending on results you could see i suppose in a range of 300 000 to 600 000 a year paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst so 18 was just kind of getting this the critical mass charles macfarlane president chief executive officer yes paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst and then relative to your eei data it looks like some capex moved from 19 to 20 can you give a little more detail there charles macfarlane president chief executive officer sure the movement paul relates to the astoria merricourt the movement is the merricourt project when you in terms of what you we saw at eei and then what we see now we ve seen a bit of a push back in the timing of the merricourt project and so basically the project isn t going away it s just a movement of dollars from 19 into 20 paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst got it ok so everything fundamentally still the same just the timing shift charles macfarlane president chief executive officer yup paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst and then i know i ask this every call but pressures you re seeing maybe from the benefit of tax reform being competitively reduced in the manufacturing segments charles macfarlane president chief executive officer paul we just haven t seen that with couple of our as we talk about in the press release and in my comments we were actually we saw price uplift from some of our customers in 2019 both in kind of across the board at btd and t o plastics we were able to get price increases in place with customers where we thought it was appropriate and needed we haven t had any push back from customers looking for kind of a reduction in pricing because of the tax savings were picking up in the manufacturing businesses it doesn t mean that it couldn t happen but we certainly are seeing any of that and of course we actually have we could be looking for the same things on our supply side as well when we negotiate our prices with our supply base and given the pvc commodity nature of that business prices were up in 2018 in the pvc pipe business and that was really a reflective of market conditions we re seeing some softening of prices we saw that in the fourth quarter and as we head into 19 but it s really more market driven that it is having anything to do with tax reform paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst what s driving that softening in the market charles macfarlane president chief executive officer i think that there we as we went through 18 we saw much stronger prices than we expected now as we head into the we completed the fourth quarter we saw some uplift in our resin costs we think saw some pullback in market pricing as it relates to just demand and competition and as we move into 19 we re seeing similar there s some announced resin price increases here in the first quarter we ll see if they stick fully but we expected some of it s going to stick and we ve seen some softening in sales prices that started in the fourth quarter and it s really kind of market related and it s what s driving it paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst okay thank you very much charles macfarlane president chief executive officer thanks paul operator our next question comes from chris ellinghaus with williams capital christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst hey guys good morning charles macfarlane president chief executive officer hi chris good morning chris christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst can talk about the georgia you d mentioned that it was profitable in the second half of the year are you expecting that trend to continue charles macfarlane president chief executive officer thanks for the question chris yes we are we more like a 30 increase in volume year over year in georgia so we ve got some leverage there and we continue to see a good backlog at that site we ve continued to improve operationally then improve dramatically around our on time delivery and work with a number of customers on pricing so we anticipate that similar or better results as we had in the last six months of 18 going forward into 19 christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst does that mean btd had some pretty strong revenue growth are you expecting particularly with the way the backlog look you re expecting another really good revenue year there charles macfarlane president chief executive officer we are definitely expecting an increase i would say in the backlog 35 of the part price or 35 to 40 is metal and a lot of these prices that are in the backlog assume metal prices that were probably based on 2018 final quarter and we ve seen that drop a little so the metal impact in the 19 backlog is likely overstated a little bit but we do anticipate good growth in all the segments where there are some of those segments that you re not going to see that kind of growth we have been awarded programs in the ag sector that are new to us meaning it s just not higher volume of the same part we were making we are going to be making parts of it that we weren t in previous year so it s a market share growth there christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst okay kevin is the foundation donations that you were talking about would you anticipate that those would likely stay sort of fourth quarter kind of events kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer yes christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst okay and lastly you talked about the competition increasing in plastics a little bit is there was there a lot of slack in capacity that some of your competitors may have been trying to utilize or get your utilization higher or what where is that competition coming from charles macfarlane president chief executive officer yeah i mean i think that there is a lot of the some of the larger competition certainly has capacity out there in the in their plants some of that competition is also vertically integrated and that there are resin manufacturers and there s always some potential or were there want to have their profits occur and whether it s at their resin plants or their pvc businesses and so we did see some of that happened and there s been it s at least looks to be continuing into the first quarter here i mean we re only a month and a half into the year so far but we have seen sales prices kind of continue with those little bit reduced levels from that were in the fourth quarter christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst okay thanks for the details guys i appreciate it charles macfarlane president chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question is a follow up question from paul ridzon with keybanc paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst just back to the last question the at btd the decrease in metal prices will impact revenues but shouldn t impact net income kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer correct the metal prices are passed through to the customer but they do show up in the backlog as far as total part prices paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst kevin when you talked about and talks about the 19 electric utility outlook you said something about o m and pension like i kind of missed that could you quickly review what you said kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer sure i mean we re we expect in large part lower o m at the utility in part because we re our discount rate went up on the pension plan and our other benefit programs and we had a discount rate of 3 9 paul in 2000 that we use for 2018 and then now in 2019 given where interest rates move kind of that last half of the year our discount rate went up to 4 5 paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst and should we also look for decrease in o m because of the plant outage loss kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer yes yup paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst so the o m line in total should be down correct is that fair to say kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer yes paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst okay thank you very much for the clarification operator and i m not showing any further questions on the phone lines charles macfarlane president chief executive officer well thank you for your questions and support otter tail corporation with continued execution on the utility growth projects and strong operational performance in our manufacturing segment we remain confident in our ability to deliver shareholder value in 2019 we will focus on continuing to improve btd profitability and we will further refine the long term growth strategy for northern pipe and vinyltech and t o plastics and we will continue to execute on otter tail power s major generation and technology projects we believe this will allow us to the deliver on our 2019 guidance of 2 10 to 2 25 a share thank you for joining our call we appreciate your interest in otter tail corporation and we look forward to a successful 2019 operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today s presentation you may now disconnect and have a wonderful day

modern monetary madness more than 10 years ago some australian readers begin regaling me with the ideas of economist bill mitchell of the university of newcastle in new south wales he was teaching about something he called and he coined the term modern monetary theory i looked into it and fairly quickly dismissed it as silly actually printing money as an economic policy get serious mmt is a revival of an early 1900s idea called chartalism now it is influencing the thinking of new socialist like movements in the us and other places and cited by politicians mmt is increasingly appearing in mainstream media like this sobering financial times article since it is increasingly discussed in more public venues you should know more about it and that will be today s topic join me in dallas now on with our letter modern monetary madness essentially mmt espouses that the public through the government owns the process of money creation and that in addition to borrowing and taxing should simply issue currency as payment for its obligations this is not the sleight of hand that quantitative easing was this is direct monetization in lieu of borrowing if that sounds like printing money that s because it is upfront and in your face as a serious economic proposal most of the time when i am talking with my fellow writers and economists when somebody mentions mmt everybody smiles maybe chuckles and shakes their heads the problem is what seems like a joke is actually getting traction let s get the official definition of mmt from wikipedia my comments inserted are in brackets in mmt vertical money money created by the government and spent in the private sector enters circulation through government spending taxation and its legal tender enable power to discharge debt and establish the fiat money as currency giving it value by creating demand for it in the form of a private tax obligation that must be met in addition fines fees and licenses create demand for the currency an ongoing tax obligation in concert with private confidence and acceptance of the currency maintains its value because the government can issue its own currency at will mmt maintains that the level of taxation relative to government spending the government s deficit spending or budget surplus is in reality a policy tool that regulates inflation and unemployment and not a means of funding the government s activities by itself proponents argue that unemployment is caused by lack of demand and lack of demand is caused by insufficient money entering the private sector a problem the government can solve by creating money and spending it in the private sector voilà demand is created and unemployment goes down inflation that can be controlled by higher taxes hey it s their theory don t ask me to explain it economists advising major presidential and congressional candidates on the progressive and even moderate left are more and more openly talking about mmt and its practical applications pet economists i have said before that economists are the modern day equivalent of shamans and priests rather than looking at sheep entrails economists look at data and tell the politician king emperor or chief what they want to hear i have been in more than one meeting where a politician is clearly shopping for a rationale for something that they would like to propose and do any serious politician is going to have more than a few economic advisors attached in one form or another to their campaign let me quickly state that i am not disparaging the role of economists when they act as political advisors i have done that myself it is actually one of the rationales for the discipline indeed it would be strange if that were not the case 90 of readers may wonder why we are even talking about this in a serious letter the rest of you may tell me how i m wrong and it really will work let me hasten to say that 10 years ago it was much less than 1 and it is beginning to come from readers that i recognize to be fairly serious there are multiple and growing motivations and rationales for adopting mmt into your own philosophical base why should this be on your radar let me give you just a few scenarios politicians are increasingly talking about free stuff free college guaranteed basic income more total healthcare paid for by the public basic housing and more it is almost like there will be an auction to see who can promise the most free benefits paid for by taxes on the rich they will cite economic advisors who say it is completely doable and even necessary for the general welfare the richest country in the history of rich countries can easily afford to spend more on its citizens ensuring basic income and wealth equality more or less a direct quote from several interviews forget mere income taxes the new political ante will be a wealth tax that means these ideas will be increasingly promoted in the public space more politicians will argue for increased spending and or at least different spending priorities guns and butter over the next few years this will enter the national mindset an increasingly large group of voters especially younger voters will feel a natural affinity with the idealism why shouldn t a rich nation help those who are less advantaged then somewhere while we are having this conversation there will be a recession unemployment will rise and deficits increase until we are on our way to a 30 trillion debt in just a few years this will crowd out private investment slowing whatever recovery there might be and making us vulnerable to a quick second recession not unlike the recessions of 1980 and 1982 but it will also produce the potential for a true change election the frustration noted among trump voters will still be there but it will also be shared by many on the left who will see the promises as a way to change things it is hard to argue in the middle of financial crisis and recession that we don t need change there won t be a president warren harding who essentially decided to do nothing in one of the deepest recessions depressions in american history in the early 1920s in that case severe austerity allowed markets to clear but the recovery gave us the roaring 1920s cause and effect numerous scholarly books have been written to suggest that but that will not be the case 100 years later as we face the 2020s there will be an increasing drumbeat for doing something change will be the mantra it is not far fetched to imagine a white house and congress beginning to work around the principles of mmt if not adopt it outright with sharply higher taxes and spending now here s where it gets a little bit murkier the federal reserve even if a new president could pack the board with members philosophically attuned to a new president s desire to increase public spending through monetary creation does not have the legal authority to directly create money that is a right reserved strictly for the federal government and specifically the us treasury the treasury can issue all the debt into the private sector it wants the federal reserve can then go into the private market and buy all the debt it wants adding that debt to its balance sheet this is called quantitative easing it is technically not the same thing congress has tried to create agencies which would use the federal reserve to directly create money these agencies and methods have all been ruled overwhelmingly unconstitutional by the supreme court for the federal reserve to create money as mmt advocates want you would have to amend the federal reserve act certainly a possibility but not easy proponents of mmt point to how successful japan has been in implementing what essentially looks to be the same policy they have moved 140 of their gdp under the balance sheet of the bank of japan essentially buying every bond available in the private markets their balance sheet is growing because they are buying stocks and carrying japan s entire annual deficit which is large why can t we do the same japan and the us are both modern countries and economies europe though not to the extent of japan also engaged in a large amount of quantitative easing if it didn t cause problems the last time why not try it again on a larger scale especially if there is a crisis the explanation for japan not having inflation or hyperinflation doesn t fit into a sound bite and mmt proponents can answer it with dismissive sound bites that will be readily consumed and believed by a public wanting change coupled with automation increasingly taking jobs and depressing wages it will be a firestorm of political backlash and calls for change do deficits matter the only way to really tackle the increasing deficits is to 1 reduce medicare and medicaid benefits means test social security and at the same time raise the age of eligibility but few politicians will run on a platform of cutting medicare and social security because no matter how they propose it that will be what it means 2 feel rich is beside the point that will still not balance the budget but there s a high probability that it will send us into yet another recession bringing calls for more direct spending and some form of money creation as the answer that s what mmt says we should do raise medicare and social security taxes or simply increase taxes on everyone or at least the rich a lot the definition of the rich would have to be lower than you might think most of my readers will be seen as the rich whether yourich is beside the point that will still not balance the budget but there s a high probability that it will send us into yet another recession bringing calls for more direct spending and some form of money creation as the answer that s what mmt says we should do any politician who proposes to limit entitlement spending to balance the budget will be accused of forcing austerity on those least able to afford it that is not a winning platform there will be no clinton gingrich compromise austerity has no fun and simple sound bites it requires a certain amount of pain which is generally not politically popular oh a segment of the population will embrace such but we must remember that elections are won on the margin president trump won by razor thin margins in a few midwest states a change election in the middle of a recession or its aftermath could not only see those margins evaporate but bring a wave of progressive and socialist politicians to join aoc and her friends think 1932 the country was in true turmoil and there was a huge shift to the left fdr didn t get every policy he wanted but he got a lot of them it was truly transformational and has impacted the us for the last 100 years what would this look like how do we get there we are going to have several sessions at the strategic investment conference to specifically address these issues is all this going to happen next year no but something along the above line is my base case for the 1920s that means you need to begin structuring your life and your portfolios to avoid being in a tunnel with an oncoming train these are not simple changes like simple buy and sell instructions but will require much deeper structural change in not just your portfolios but perhaps your lives it is something you want to think very seriously about while you have the luxury of time and not wait to the last minute waiting too long may mean you won t be as prepared as you will wish think about how you would deal with taxes 20 or 30 higher or more than today s and potentially more how would that change your lifestyle what can you do today to deal with whatever may come it may mean adjusting your lifestyle saving more and getting out of debt which takes time for most families these are not quick decisions but i think they will become necessary ones especially if the first wave of a change election happens in 2020 bluntly shane and i have already begun our own changes if somehow there is eventually a change back to austerity or a crisis forces it that will mean even more change you need to be prepared for and unfortunately it s not clear what will happen we will have to get much closer to the actual events and elections to get a feel for the way actual events may develop dallas houston cleveland a lot new york back to puerto rico austin and dallas shane and i will be traveling to dallas at the end of this week to begin to get ready to move the rest of our furnishings to puerto rico or to a new smaller apartment that will be our dallas base right now it appears my dallas high rise home will sell within a few weeks after an ashford inc board meeting in athens texas i make a quick dash to houston to meet with my smh friends and then a meeting with

interview with le monde interview with luis de guindos vice president of the ecb conducted by marie charrel on 13 february 2019 is the ecb sufficiently well equipped to deal with the slowing european economy yes but remember that monetary policy cannot do everything its primary objective is to maintain price stability which contributes to a strong economy however fiscal policy and structural reforms also have a significant role to play in supporting economic activity the ecb still has a large range of tools at its disposal including advance communication about its strategy forward guidance reinvesting the debt securities it holds as they mature and targeted lending to banks the tltros we are currently analysing the causes of the economic slowdown in europe some of which are temporary we will not take a decision until we have conducted a thorough analysis what are the causes of this slowdown it is as much the result of international factors which have weighed on exports the slowdown of the global and chinese economies the risks of protectionism market volatility difficulties in some emerging markets as it is the result of internal factors like the uncertainty surrounding brexit and the tensions over the italian budget at the end of last year of course the ecb s ability to influence external factors is limited when dealing with the crisis we didn t hesitate to implement unconventional measures such as net purchases of public and private debt quantitative easing or qe in the light of the recovery we stopped qe but our rates are still low and our monetary policy stance will remain accommodative for a long while yet as we are going through a period of uncertainty how are you preparing for brexit the united kingdom leaving the eu is bad news for everyone and for the uk economy in particular we are participating in a working group with the bank of england to analyse the various markets that could be affected like the derivatives market and the market for insurance contracts if there is an orderly brexit the effect on financial stability will be limited as we think the private sector is sufficiently prepared a disorderly brexit on the other hand would represent a significant macroeconomic shock at a time when the european economy is already weakened the uk s gdp could shrink by up to 8 according to the bank of england this would naturally affect the euro area economy i hope we will avoid such a scenario do the tensions over the populist italian government s budget risk sparking a new crisis in the euro area following the agreement in december between the italian government and the european commission on the italian budget the country s borrowing costs fell this confirms that when a country follows the common rules its efforts go down well with the markets italy s main challenge at the moment is its weak growth this has been the case for several years now rome must urgently implement structural reforms in order to increase its growth potential by resolving its productivity issues regaining competitiveness and targeting internal weaknesses how much have the political uncertainties already cost the euro area in terms of growth it is very hard to measure this precisely as it is very difficult to incorporate certain variables like confidence and business sentiment into macroeconomic models nonetheless for the past six to nine months protectionism has been the main risk at the international level and one of the major sources of market volatility it is essential that the united states and china as well as the eu find common ground so that these tensions don t devolve into a trade war that would be harmful to everyone why is inflation still struggling to recover in the euro area the situation in the job market has improved considerably in the euro area nine million jobs have been created since the crisis and the unemployment rate has fallen below 8 compensation per employee is also recovering what matters is knowing when this increase will translate into a pickup in underlying inflation which excludes the most volatile product prices like energy prices we are confident that it will pick up within a few months or quarters even if energy prices were to fall a little in the coming months we are confident that inflation will over the medium term converge towards our aim of below but close to 2 for several months now political leaders criticisms of central bank independence have been growing in europe and above all in the united states does that worry you in recent decades the independence of central banks has proven extremely effective in maintaining price stability political and economic agendas are very different when monetary institutions act under the influence of political leaders they run the risk of making serious mistakes that harm economic activity very often the threats made against their independence are part of populist rhetoric which regularly proposes simple magical solutions to complex problems while these solutions may seem appealing they are rarely correct why has the ecb not used debt purchases to support more directly the ecological transition or the fight against inequality the ecb and the euro area national central banks have purchased many green bonds both public and private within the framework of their asset purchase programme while ensuring that their purchases are conducted in a market neutral manner furthermore these asset purchases and the other measures taken by the ecb in recent years have been the main source of support for the economic recovery and the fall in unemployment in the euro area all the studies we have carried out show that job creation is the main lever for reducing inequality many people feel that the eu is not doing enough to protect them from globalisation are they right despite national concerns on the subject the recovery in the euro area is bearing fruit it is creating jobs and people are taking note of that by way of evidence recent surveys show that almost 80 of people in the euro area have confidence in the euro few political parties can boast such support and this confirms that the member states are stronger together than they are alone when it comes to dealing with globalisation were you surprised by the gilets jaunes movement in france to a degree yes because france is one of the most egalitarian countries in europe in terms of income distribution but other factors have played a role wouldn t it be more sensible for us to adjust to permanently weak growth rather than constantly seeking to raise gdp it s true that demographic trends in europe are not very favourable for growth but that shouldn t stop us from implementing reforms that aim to boost growth in the long term at the euro area level we need to complete the banking union and the fiscal instrument that is essential to be able to stabilise the economy when there is a downturn we also need to achieve greater integration for example by encouraging the creation of cross border banks and that requires us to further harmonise legislation and to pursue greater consolidation in the sector even though banks are now much better capitalised and much more resilient than they were ten years ago isn t money laundering a more urgent issue that needs tackling several european credit institutions such as danske bank denmark s largest bank have recently been hit by scandal yes it s a major issue that has been brought to the fore by several very serious cases the ecb doesn t have a mandate in this area but the european commission has taken action to strengthen the cooperation between the various national anti money laundering authorities under the auspices of the european banking authority this is the first step and more needs to be done to achieve greater centralisation in this area
gold has an enduring primeval appeal which means it is never too far from an investor s mind particularly in turbulent times the yellow metal had a bit of the shine taken off it by the historic equities bull run seen since the financial crisis of 2008 but with stock markets getting decidedly choppy recently gold has had a bit of a polish geopolitical tensions are bubbling up from america s trade dispute with china to continued turmoil in the middle east via populist trouble brewing in the eurozone these things all reduce confidence in fiat currencies stock markets and the global economy in general which raises the relative attractiveness of one of humanity s oldest loves with stock markets hitting choppy water recently gold has received a bit of a polish the other side of the capital markets coin to shares fixed income has also offered up reasons to be positive on gold in the near term the federal reserve s relatively punchy rate rising cycle has been replaced by a new found dovishness as concern builds the us economy is due for a slowdown with no meaningful rate rise cycle in sight for the united kingdom the european union or japan decent interest on cash savings or yield on investment grade bonds still looks a long way off an increasing number of people are going for gold of late with the price of an ounce climbing from just over 1200 three months ago to 1352 as of today 18 february another specific driver of this rise is the people s bank of china s decision to boost its gold reserves on 12 february china s central bank added to its hoard for the second month in a row the price of an ounce of gold has climbed to 1352 1047 over the past three months adrian ash head of research at bullionvault explained like any investor central banks buy gold when they start to mistrust other assets and the wider financial system that s because gold offers unique diversification liquidity and security of ownership with regards to diversification gold prices tend to do well when other assets do badly rising 98 per cent of the time when the us stock market has fallen from 5 years before in relation to liquidity gold trades in a deep global market 24 hours a day finding end user demand from chinese newly weds to hindu temple goers microchip factories to new york hedge funds most importantly with respect to security gold is no one s liability and no one s to default on ash also pointed out that countries like russia and venezuela facing us and eu sanctions and who want independence from western dominated financial systems may also be adding to their holdings the primary reason gold has rallied in early 2019 is the retrenchment on seven years of interest rate hike promises by the us federal reserve added ned naylor leyland manager of the merian gold silver fund the central bank s assurances of policy normalisation have held back the gold price which is chiefly driven by moves in real interest rates interest rates adjusted to remove the impact of inflation federal reserve boss jerome powell has made dovish noises on the prospects for further interest rates rises in america now with the path of rate hikes seemingly reverting the market is concerned about the future purchasing power of currencies such as the us dollar and sterling naylor leyland continued these concerns are what drive interest in gold and silver secondly the apparent reversal in long standing trends in several asset classes for example equities and rising political tension have created an uncertain market environment as gold tends to perform well when monetary policy turns looser the current conditions and the resultant investor caution is making gold look interesting again he added how to invest in gold so if you want to put a bit of bullion in your investment pot what s the best way to go about it getting hold of a bar or two and hiding them in your house somewhere is certainly one option another is buying a big thick gold chain and wearing it out on the town like a rapper these may not be the most sensible ways though adrian lowcock head of personal investing at willis owen outlines some of the best options one way to track the gold price is via an etf backed by physical gold another is the ishares gold producers etf which will simply track all listed gold miners however most etfs use derivatives which makes them complex products individual mining companies incur operational risk so a fund with a portfolio of companies may be a better option many mining shares are trading near historic lows versus spot gold prices blackrock gold and general fund is one of the best known and is well diversified across the world it can invest in other precious metals and has about 10 per cent in silver this fund gets its exposure to gold and precious metals via related quoted equities evy hambro and co manager tom holl execute a disciplined investment approach that incorporates detailed commodity and company analysis with the aim of outperforming the ftse gold mines index in a risk and liquidity aware manner merian gold silver fund differs in that it has a blend of real assets a gold bullion trust and gold and silver mining shares lowcock continued it tilts towards bullion when cautious and shares when bullish silver is more volatile than gold so the fund manager increases exposure to silver when prices are rising if you want an investment trust rather than an open ended fund one good option is blackrock world mining trust the trust aims to benefit from global demand for metals and the mining companies that produce them said william heathcoat amory head of investment trust research at kepler trust intelligence a gold mine on the mongolian border in north east china the managers have huge flexibility as to how they invest through equities debt preference shares and private royalty contracts in total the trust has 15 per cent exposure to gold miners as at 31st december one of their key themes currently is that following the very difficult years of a few years back mining companies have cut back on exploration and unnecessary capital expenditure he continued the managers believe that despite this companies that have good quality assets which have longevity and ease of extraction should do well in the current environment they believe this is particularly prevalent amongst the gold companies given their shorter mine lives and greater need for reinvestment

by justin fox bloomberg opinion there are nations on this earth that tax their citizens far more heavily than the u s does the top spots on the organization for economic cooperation and development s rankings of tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product in 2017 were held by france 46 2 percent denmark 46 percent belgium 44 6 percent sweden 44 percent and finland 43 3 percent the u s tax burden was 27 1 percent of gdp ranking it 31st among the 36 members of the oecd the club of the world s affluent democracies that 27 1 percent includes state and local taxes it doesn t factor in the big tax cuts signed into law by president donald trump in december 2017 i have trotted out these oecd tax statistics several times over the past few years mainly just because i like trotting out statistics but also to temper trump s repeated claims that u s taxes are inordinately high lately though a lot of the talk about taxes has been coming from democratic politicians hoping to raise them to fund programs that they favor with the increases in most cases targeted at the very wealthy which makes this an opportune time i think to review how the countries that raise lots more money from taxes than the u s go about raising it to start here is how the u s stacks up against 15 other oecd nations the biggest economies plus our neighbors plus some countries the nordic ones mainly with a reputation for combining high taxes with healthy growth in personal income tax revenue as a share of gdp the u s gets much more revenue from personal income taxes than is the oecd norm but yeah finland sweden and especially denmark bring in even more as a share of gdp how do they do it with higher top income tax rates than the u s definitely but also by assessing those top rates on a much wider swath of taxpayers than is the case in the u s smaller numbers in the right hand column imply income tax systems that are less progressive progressive in this case meaning that rates rise as incomes go higher in denmark the top income tax bracket of 55 8 percent kicks in at an income of just 77 730 this year in the u s the threshold for the top federal rate of 37 percent is 510 300 interestingly the countries with even more progressive income tax systems than the u s france japan and mexico raise substantially less from personal income taxes than the u s does payroll taxes for retirement savings health care unemployment insurance and other purposes are usually less progressive than income taxes some high tax countries rely quite heavily on them too the u s less so the clearest differentiator between the u s and the high tax countries though may be taxes on goods and services all the oecd countries but the u s have a value added levy that taxes goods and services at every stage of production the relatively modest consumption tax revenues in the u s come from state and local sales taxes and federal excise taxes on fuel plane tickets tobacco alcohol and such lots of economists like consumption taxes because they don t discourage work and investment the taxes do however tend toward regressivity poor people spend a larger share of their income on goods and services than wealthy people do how about taxing wealth directly there are so few outright wealth taxes in the world france had one but ditched it as of last year that the oecd instead tracks taxes on property which includes taxes on net wealth but also taxes on real estate gifts and inheritances and financial and capital transactions u s property taxes are mostly taxes on real estate at 4 percent of gdp they aren t huge but in some high tax localities they really add up these are wealth taxes that as my bloomberg opinion colleague noah smith pointed out last month weigh more heavily on the middle class than the rich because rich people hold most of their wealth in stocks instead of houses still they are wealth taxes and they re higher in the u s than in all but two oecd countries and much higher than in the high tax nordic countries overall the countries that raise lots more tax revenue than the u s tend to have higher top income tax rates but less progressive income tax systems and it seems less progressive taxation overall their systems rely more on spending than on tax policy to help the poor and counteract income inequality on the whole this has worked out pretty well there is no clear net gdp cost of high tax based social spending on gdp economist peter h lindert concluded after surveying the long run evidence from oecd countries in 2003 one of the main reasons for this he continued was that the tax strategies of high budget welfare states are more pro growth and less progressive than has been realized the u s does have some tax leeway that smaller european countries don t it s more of a hassle for rich people to leave the u s to escape taxation than to leave say finland and the u s is such a huge market that businesses and investors will want to be here whatever the tax structure also there may be good reasons for levying new taxes on the very rich other than raising lots of money but if raising lots of money is the goal the tax approach that seems to have worked the best elsewhere involves making most everybody pay justin fox is a bloomberg opinion columnist covering business he was the editorial director of harvard business review and wrote

in north dakota for achieving two milestones by year end the plant exceeded 3 million megawatt hours produced the second highest yearly generation amount in the plants 38 year history and crossed over the 3 million manhour without a loss time incident the plants last loss time incident occurred 18 years ago congratulations to coyote station employees for these significant accomplishments and thank you to all of our employees for continuing to put safety first our manufacturing companies also experienced notable accomplishments in 2018 btd our contract metal fabricator and largest manufacturing business increased sales by 19 in 2018 and the georgia location is profitable in the last half of the year the company achieved this while reporting its lowest osha rate and highest on time delivery in history t o plastics celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2018 and achieved 6 overall sales growth and a 29 increase in earnings driven mostly by lower income tax rates the company s horticulture segment continues to grow through key account relationships and new product launches northern pipe products and vinyltech had an exceptional year supported by strong market demand and prices and continued excellent operational performance they positively contributed to earnings while remaining highly competitive both companies continue to prove improve in the markets they serve by demonstrating flexibility and responsiveness to customer needs we re targeting additional organic volume growth in these companies in 2019 employees across our organization are aligned with our growth strategy which includes capital investment continued improvement in operations and talent development it s with much appreciation that i congratulate them on a job well done in 2018 in 2019 we will continue to execute on utility rate base growth and create additional organic growth in the manufacturing businesses now i ll turn it over to kevin for the financial perspective kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer well thank you chuck and good morning everyone i will cover the following items our 2018 financial results our liquidity position the strength balance sheet and corporate credit ratings the increase in our 2019 indicated annual dividend our five year capital expenditure plan and our 2019 business outlook we are pleased with our strong 2018 financial performance revenues grew approximately 8 and earnings grew approximately 14 with all our reporting segments showing year over year increases in revenues and earnings we earned 2 06 per share which compared with 1 82 per share last year our 2018 return on equity was 11 5 on an equity ratio of 54 5 our two platform strategy continues to deliver higher returns on equity on a higher equity layer when compared to holding company peers let me now provide an overview of 2018 earnings by segment as shown on slides 20 and 21 electric segment net earnings increased 5 million year over year key drivers include increased revenues due to more favorable weather year over year earnings improved by 0 11 a share due to the weather and compared to normal weather was favorable by 0 07 a share increased revenues due to interim rates associated with our north dakota general rate case net of estimated refunds which was implemented in january of 2018 interim rates associated with our south dakota rate case went into effect in october of 2018 increased renewable resource rider revenues in minnesota and north dakota and increased minnesota sip revenues these items were partially offset by a 9 6 million reduction in revenues related to a provision for refunds to recognize that current retail rates in our service area and ferc approved transmission tariffs our recovering federal income taxes in excess of lower rates under tax reform lower north dakota environmental cost recovery rider revenue due to the impact from lower tax rates a reduction in the return on equity component of the rider in the lower investment balance subject to recovery from depreciation for our north dakota and south dakota transmission costs recovery riders due to the impact of lower tax rate and reduced transmission costs other items impacting the segment s earnings were higher operating and maintenance property tax and depreciation expenses we did have a scheduled maintenance outage in 2018 at our big stone plant that cost 2 9 million we don t have any planned maintenance outages in 2019 in income tax expense was lower in 2018 mainly due to the reduction in federal corporate tax rates from 35 to 21 and the reversal of excess deferred taxes net earnings for the manufacturing segment increased 1 8 million year over year key elements of this improvement are as follows btd s revenues increased 36 8 million of which 33 8 million came from increased product sales to all its major end markets 12 7 million of this increase relates to higher material costs that were passed through to customers with the balance due to increased sales and improved pricing btd s scrap metal revenues also increased due to higher volumes and higher scrap sales prices these increases were offset in part by higher cost of goods sold and operating expenses and higher income taxes due to the elimination of the section 199 deduction which was eliminated in 2018 and the writedown of deferred tax liabilities in 2017 which lowered last year s income tax expense these items resulted in a 1 2 million increase in btd s year over year earnings t o plastics revenues improved 1 9 million mainly due to increased sales of horticultural containers the increased revenues were partially offset by higher cost of goods sold labor freight and operating expenses earnings before taxes increased slightly year over year however due to a lower tax rate earnings improved 600 000 at t o plastics the plastics segment s earnings increased 2 1 million year over year as a result of a 9 4 increase in pvc pipe prices a 2 3 decrease in pounds of pipe sold the increase in sales prices more than offset higher cost of goods per pound sold and lower sales volumes the net impact of these items resulted in an 11 3 improvement in gross margins sales volumes were lower in the last four months of 2018 compared with the same time period in 2017 primarily due to the increased sales from hurricane related impacts in the gulf coast region those dynamics favorably impacted earnings by an estimated 0 09 a share in 2017 and the favorable variance due to tax reform was offset by a loss of the section 199 deduction in 2018 technical difficulty lower tax expense in 2017 from a 3 3 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities due to tax reform our corporate expenses before taxes increased 4 million year over year primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions due to the establishment of the otter tail corporation charitable foundation in 2018 the increase in employee benefit costs and in other corporate costs we realized the 5 million net increase in tax savings in the corporate costs center in 2018 primarily due to the writedown of deferred tax assets in 2017 from tax reform this was offset by an increase in tax expense mostly related to uncertain tax positions and the establishment of a valuation allowance on the recoverability of certain state net operating losses and we experienced a reduction in tax savings as a result of the federal tax rate change the net result of our lease items was 1 million year over year reduction in corporate expense moving to slide 22 let s review our financial condition and liquidity last year we had no equity financing activity and don t expect any equity issuances in 2019 our two credit agreements are in place until october 31 of 2023 between expected cash flow generated from 2019 operating activities and these credit facilities we have the appropriate levels of liquidity to support both of our business platforms we currently expect to do a private placement of debt at otter tail power company in the range of 150 million to 170 million during the last half of 2019 in connection with our rate base growth and in 2018 all three rating agencies affirmed otter tail corporation and otter tail power s ratings and outlook and we remain committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and we ll manage our operations to reflect that commitment as shown on slide 24 the board of directors increased our indicated annualized dividend rate from 1 34 per share to 1 40 per share this 4 5 increase is a result of our solid 2018 performance and our 2019 outlook the company s strong balance sheet liquidity cash generation profile and our commitment to enhancing shareholder returns we expect future dividend increases to be in line with earnings growth while maintaining a targeted payout ratio in the range of 60 to 70 and we have paid dividends on our stock for 80 years for 321 consecutive quarters slide 25 highlights our capital expenditure plans for the 2019 through 2023 timeframe we expect capital expenditures for 2019 to be 203 million planned expenditures for this year includes 61 million for the merricourt wind project and 40 million for the astoria station natural gas fired plant these investments will continue to positively impact the corporation s earnings and returns on capital the five year capital plan calls for approximately 973 million in utility projects 45 of this capital spend will be recovered through riders the plan also includes 97 million for the manufacturing and plastics businesses in our updated compounded annual growth rate in rate base over the 2018 through 2023 timeframe is projected to be 8 using 2018 as the base year slide 26 reflects our 2019 consolidated earnings per share guidance of 2 10 to 2 25 this guidance includes our strategies for improving future results the cyclical nature of the manufacturing businesses as well as current regulatory factors facing our electric segment our electric segment s 2019 net income is expected to be higher than 2018 based on constructive outcome in the south dakota rate case increased afudc for planned capital projects including merricourt wind project in the astoria natural gas plant along with increased revenues from the north dakota generation cost recovery rider on the astoria station increased revenues from the completion of the big stone south ellendale project and additional transmission investments related to our south dakota transmission reliability project decreased operating and maintenance expenses due to a decrease in pension medical workers compensation and retiree medical benefits our discount rate is increasing in 2019 to 4 5 from 3 9 driven by the increasing interest rate environment these items are offset by normal weather weather favorably impacted our 2018 earnings per share by 0 07 compared to normal higher property tax and depreciation expense due to larger transmission projects being put into service we expect increased earnings from our manufacturing segment in 2019 due to increased sales at btd and the recreational vehicle lawn and garden and agricultural end markets also increased scrap revenues due to stronger sales volumes the increased earnings at t o plastics primarily driven by increased sales in horticultural life science and industrial end markets the backlog for this segment is approximately 211 million for 2019 compared with 166 million a year ago we expect plastics 2019 net income to be lower than 2018 we are expecting lower operating margins due to increasing resin prices and slightly higher sales volumes compared to last year in corporate costs net of tax are expected to be lower in 2019 our current earnings guidance for 2019 reflect 68 of our earnings from our electric segment and 32 of our earnings from our manufacturing and plastics segments this compares with 66 and 34 respectively in 2018 the increase in the electric earnings mix is being driven by the rate base growth related to merricourt astoria and south dakota reliability projects we expect the long term earnings mix to continue to move back in line with 75 of earnings from our electric segment and 25 of our manufacturing and plastics segments net of unallocated corporate costs this will be driven by the capital plan which calls for approximately 91 of our capital spend over the 2019 through 2023 timeframe to be in the electric segment we believe our 2019 guidance further positions us to achieve a 5 to 7 compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share using 2018 s 2 06 a share our 2019 guidance is dependent on the business and the economic challenges our two platforms will face this year for the utility key drivers include constructive outcome in the south dakota rate case and successful execution of our rate base growth projects for btd key drivers include continued operational improvements across all locations to further improve our return on sales margins and while earnings are expected to decline in 2019 for plastics this segment continues to be a strong complement to our portfolio by providing strong earnings cash flows to support our dividend and returns on invested capital we are now ready to take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from paul ridzon with keybanc paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst good morning how are you charles macfarlane president chief executive officer good morning paul paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst could you give just some background on this charitable contribution and what we should look for going forward charles macfarlane president chief executive officer sure paul i appreciate the question we have for a number of year been considering establishing the foundation for well both otter tail corporation and then we also have established one for the otter tail power company as well and we wanted to in 2018 certainly help get the foundations off on the right foot with the good commitment to fund those organizations going forward and so you see a probably a much healthier contribution made for the otter tail power i m sorry the otter tail corporation foundation in that 2 million amount the power company is a 0 5 million and as we kind of look forward i would tell you that future contributions are ultimately subject to the success the financial success that we re having at both of the entities but in the utility we re looking for the future kind of range i would say in that 2 million to 500 000 range on a go forward basis and at the parent company depending on results you could see i suppose in a range of 300 000 to 600 000 a year paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst so 18 was just kind of getting this the critical mass charles macfarlane president chief executive officer yes paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst and then relative to your eei data it looks like some capex moved from 19 to 20 can you give a little more detail there charles macfarlane president chief executive officer sure the movement paul relates to the astoria merricourt the movement is the merricourt project when you in terms of what you we saw at eei and then what we see now we ve seen a bit of a push back in the timing of the merricourt project and so basically the project isn t going away it s just a movement of dollars from 19 into 20 paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst got it ok so everything fundamentally still the same just the timing shift charles macfarlane president chief executive officer yup paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst and then i know i ask this every call but pressures you re seeing maybe from the benefit of tax reform being competitively reduced in the manufacturing segments charles macfarlane president chief executive officer paul we just haven t seen that with couple of our as we talk about in the press release and in my comments we were actually we saw price uplift from some of our customers in 2019 both in kind of across the board at btd and t o plastics we were able to get price increases in place with customers where we thought it was appropriate and needed we haven t had any push back from customers looking for kind of a reduction in pricing because of the tax savings were picking up in the manufacturing businesses it doesn t mean that it couldn t happen but we certainly are seeing any of that and of course we actually have we could be looking for the same things on our supply side as well when we negotiate our prices with our supply base and given the pvc commodity nature of that business prices were up in 2018 in the pvc pipe business and that was really a reflective of market conditions we re seeing some softening of prices we saw that in the fourth quarter and as we head into 19 but it s really more market driven that it is having anything to do with tax reform paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst what s driving that softening in the market charles macfarlane president chief executive officer i think that there we as we went through 18 we saw much stronger prices than we expected now as we head into the we completed the fourth quarter we saw some uplift in our resin costs we think saw some pullback in market pricing as it relates to just demand and competition and as we move into 19 we re seeing similar there s some announced resin price increases here in the first quarter we ll see if they stick fully but we expected some of it s going to stick and we ve seen some softening in sales prices that started in the fourth quarter and it s really kind of market related and it s what s driving it paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst okay thank you very much charles macfarlane president chief executive officer thanks paul operator our next question comes from chris ellinghaus with williams capital christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst hey guys good morning charles macfarlane president chief executive officer hi chris good morning chris christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst can talk about the georgia you d mentioned that it was profitable in the second half of the year are you expecting that trend to continue charles macfarlane president chief executive officer thanks for the question chris yes we are we more like a 30 increase in volume year over year in georgia so we ve got some leverage there and we continue to see a good backlog at that site we ve continued to improve operationally then improve dramatically around our on time delivery and work with a number of customers on pricing so we anticipate that similar or better results as we had in the last six months of 18 going forward into 19 christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst does that mean btd had some pretty strong revenue growth are you expecting particularly with the way the backlog look you re expecting another really good revenue year there charles macfarlane president chief executive officer we are definitely expecting an increase i would say in the backlog 35 of the part price or 35 to 40 is metal and a lot of these prices that are in the backlog assume metal prices that were probably based on 2018 final quarter and we ve seen that drop a little so the metal impact in the 19 backlog is likely overstated a little bit but we do anticipate good growth in all the segments where there are some of those segments that you re not going to see that kind of growth we have been awarded programs in the ag sector that are new to us meaning it s just not higher volume of the same part we were making we are going to be making parts of it that we weren t in previous year so it s a market share growth there christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst okay kevin is the foundation donations that you were talking about would you anticipate that those would likely stay sort of fourth quarter kind of events kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer yes christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst okay and lastly you talked about the competition increasing in plastics a little bit is there was there a lot of slack in capacity that some of your competitors may have been trying to utilize or get your utilization higher or what where is that competition coming from charles macfarlane president chief executive officer yeah i mean i think that there is a lot of the some of the larger competition certainly has capacity out there in the in their plants some of that competition is also vertically integrated and that there are resin manufacturers and there s always some potential or were there want to have their profits occur and whether it s at their resin plants or their pvc businesses and so we did see some of that happened and there s been it s at least looks to be continuing into the first quarter here i mean we re only a month and a half into the year so far but we have seen sales prices kind of continue with those little bit reduced levels from that were in the fourth quarter christopher ellinghaus the williams capital group analyst okay thanks for the details guys i appreciate it charles macfarlane president chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question is a follow up question from paul ridzon with keybanc paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst just back to the last question the at btd the decrease in metal prices will impact revenues but shouldn t impact net income kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer correct the metal prices are passed through to the customer but they do show up in the backlog as far as total part prices paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst kevin when you talked about and talks about the 19 electric utility outlook you said something about o m and pension like i kind of missed that could you quickly review what you said kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer sure i mean we re we expect in large part lower o m at the utility in part because we re our discount rate went up on the pension plan and our other benefit programs and we had a discount rate of 3 9 paul in 2000 that we use for 2018 and then now in 2019 given where interest rates move kind of that last half of the year our discount rate went up to 4 5 paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst and should we also look for decrease in o m because of the plant outage loss kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer yes yup paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst so the o m line in total should be down correct is that fair to say kevin moug senior vice president chief financial officer yes paul ridzon key banc capital markets analyst okay thank you very much for the clarification operator and i m not showing any further questions on the phone lines charles macfarlane president chief executive officer well thank you for your questions and support otter tail corporation with continued execution on the utility growth projects and strong operational performance in our manufacturing segment we remain confident in our ability to deliver shareholder value in 2019 we will focus on continuing to improve btd profitability and we will further refine the long term growth strategy for northern pipe and vinyltech and t o plastics and we will continue to execute on otter tail power s major generation and technology projects we believe this will allow us to the deliver on our 2019 guidance of 2 10 to 2 25 a share thank you for joining our call we appreciate

electric utilities total shareholder return has grown at a compound annual rate of 15 3 over the past five years the dividend yield at year end was 2 7 some of our otter tail power s 2018 accomplishments include the north dakota public service commission granularity of power and overall revenue increase of 4 6 million or 3 1 with a return on equity of 9 77 final rates went into effect february 1 2019 we implemented interim rates in south dakota interim rates which are subject to refund remain in place until the public utilities commission makes a decision on our request to increase non fuel rates by approximately 3 3 million or 10 1 the commission will also decide on the second step in our request which is an additional 1 7 to recover costs for the proposed merricourt wind generation facility when it goes into service we completed straining the big stone south ellendale 345 kv regional transmission project in 2018 and energized the line in early february of 2019 our share of the cost for this project was 115 million because this is a miso multi value project which allows cost recovery from all customers who benefit from the line our customers will pay less than 1 of the project costs in 2019 otter tail power will also enhance transmission infrastructure in our southeastern south dakota service territory providing an approximate 39 million investment that will improve reliability and provide increased capacity for customers in the southern end of our service territory in the fourth quarter and into 2019 we continue to work through the miso generator interconnection process for the merricourt wind generation projects which will be otter tail s largest capital investment at 270 million we estimate the project construction will began in july of 2019 with an expected commercial operation in the third quarter of 2020 south dakota public utilities commission approved the site permit for the 165 million astoria station natural gas generation project and the north dakota psc approve the project for rider recovery in our recent north dakota rate case we will begin construction in 2019 and expect to be operational by march 2021 these and other investments will produce an annual growth rate of 8 in our rate base between 2018 and 2023 in a constructive regulatory environment the minnesota public utilities commission approved a one year extension to june 1 2020 for the filing of our next resource plan two key environmental regulations that may impact our modeling are the regional haze rule and the proposed affordable clean energy rules delaying our filing one year will allow us to consider the outcomes of these environmental regulations and develop a more informed resource plan in august we published our esg sustainability report which gives investors and others insight into our environmental social and governance commitments on slide 15 through 17 you ll see highlights from our report and a glimpse into how our

equity was 11 5 on an equity ratio of 54 5 our two platform strategy continues to deliver higher returns on equity on a higher equity layer when compared to holding company peers let me now provide an overview of 2018 earnings by segment as shown on slides 20 and 21 electric segment net earnings increased 5 million year over year key drivers include increased revenues due to more favorable weather year over year earnings improved by 0 11 a share due to the weather and compared to normal weather was favorable by 0 07 a share increased revenues due to interim rates associated with our north dakota general rate case net of estimated refunds which was implemented in january of 2018 interim rates associated with our south dakota rate case went into effect in october of 2018 increased renewable resource rider revenues in minnesota and north dakota and increased minnesota sip revenues these items were partially offset by a 9 6 million reduction in revenues related to a provision for refunds to recognize that current retail rates in our service area and ferc approved transmission tariffs our recovering federal income taxes in excess of lower rates under tax reform lower north dakota environmental cost recovery rider revenue due to the impact from lower tax rates a reduction in the return on equity component of the rider in the lower investment balance subject to recovery from depreciation for our north dakota and south dakota transmission costs recovery riders due to the impact of lower tax rate and reduced transmission costs other items impacting the segment s earnings were higher operating and maintenance property tax and depreciation expenses we did have a scheduled maintenance outage in 2018 at our big stone plant that cost 2 9 million we don t have any planned maintenance outages in 2019 in income tax expense was lower in 2018 mainly due to the reduction in federal corporate tax rates from 35 to 21 and the reversal of excess deferred taxes net earnings for the manufacturing segment increased 1 8 million year over year key elements of this improvement are as follows btd s revenues increased 36 8 million of which 33 8 million came from increased product sales to all its major end markets 12 7 million of this increase relates to higher material costs that were passed through to customers with the balance due to increased sales and improved pricing btd s scrap metal revenues also increased due to higher volumes and higher scrap sales prices these increases were offset in part by higher cost of goods sold and operating expenses and higher income taxes due to the elimination of the section 199 deduction which was eliminated in 2018 and the write down of deferred tax liabilities in 2017 which lowered last year s income tax

increased revenues were partially offset by higher cost of goods sold labor freight and operating expenses earnings before taxes increased slightly year over year however due to a lower tax rate earnings improved 600 000 at t o plastics the plastics segment s earnings increased 2 1 million year over year as a result of a 9 4 increase in pvc pipe prices a 2 3 decrease in pounds of pipe sold the increase in sales prices more than offset higher cost of goods per pound sold and lower sales volumes the net impact of these items resulted in an 11 3 improvement in gross margins sales volumes were lower in the last four months of 2018 compared with the same time period in 2017 primarily due to the increased sales from hurricane related impacts in the gulf coast region those dynamics favorably impacted earnings by an estimated 0 09 a share in 2017 and the favorable variance due to tax reform was offset by a loss of the section 199 deduction in 2018 from lower tax expense in 2017 from a 3 3 million reduction in deferred tax liabilities due to tax reform our corporate expenses before taxes increased 4 million year over year primarily due to an increase in charitable contributions due to the establishment of the otter tail corporation charitable foundation in 2018 the increase in employee benefit costs and in other corporate costs we realized the 5 million net increase in tax savings in the corporate costs center in 2018 primarily due to the write down of deferred tax assets in 2017 from tax reform this was offset by an increase in tax expense mostly related to uncertain tax positions and the establishment of a valuation allowance on the recoverability of certain state net operating losses and we experienced a reduction in tax savings as a result of the federal tax rate change the net result of our lease items was 1 million year over year reduction in corporate expense moving to slide 22 let s review our financial condition and liquidity last year we had no equity financing activity and don t expect any equity issuances in 2019 our two credit agreements are in place until october 31 of 2023 between expected cash flow generated from 2019 operating activities and these credit facilities we have the appropriate levels of liquidity to support both of our business platforms we currently expect to do a private placement of debt at otter tail power company in the range of 150 million to 170 million during the last half of 2019 in connection with our rate base growth and in 2018 all three rating agencies affirmed otter tail corporation and otter tail power s ratings and outlook and we remain committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings and we ll manage our operations to reflect that commitment as shown on slide 24 the board of directors increased our indicated annualized dividend rate from 1 34 per share to 1 40 per share this 4 5 increase is a result of our solid 2018 performance and our 2019 outlook the company s strong balance sheet liquidity cash generation profile and our commitment to enhancing shareholder returns we expect future dividend increases to be in line with earnings growth while maintaining a targeted payout ratio in the range of 60 to 70 and we have paid dividends on our stock for 80 years for 321 consecutive quarters slide 25 highlights our capital expenditure plans for the 2019 through 2023 timeframe we expect capital expenditures for 2019 to be 203 million planned expenditures for this year includes 61 million for the merricourt wind project and 40 million for the astoria station natural gas fired plant these investments will continue to positively impact the corporation s earnings and returns on capital the five year capital plan calls for approximately 973 million in utility projects 45 of this capital spend will be recovered through riders the plan also includes 97 million for the manufacturing and plastics businesses in our updated compounded annual growth rate in rate base over the 2018 through 2023 timeframe is projected to be 8 using 2018 as the base year slide 26 reflects our 2019 consolidated earnings per share guidance of 2 10 to 2 25 this guidance includes our strategies for improving future results the cyclical nature of the manufacturing businesses as well as current regulatory factors facing our electric segment our electric segment s 2019 net income is expected to be higher than 2018 based on constructive outcome in the south dakota rate case increased afudc for planned capital projects including merricourt wind project in the astoria natural gas plant along with increased revenues from the north dakota generation cost recovery rider on the astoria station increased revenues from the completion of the big stone south ellendale project and additional transmission investments related to our south dakota transmission reliability project decreased operating and maintenance expenses due to a decrease in pension medical workers compensation and retiree medical benefits our discount rate is increasing in 2019 to 4 5 from 3 9 driven by the increasing interest rate environment these items are offset by normal weather weather favorably impacted our 2018 earnings per share by 0 07 compared to normal higher property tax and depreciation expense due to larger transmission projects being put into service we expect increased earnings from our manufacturing segment in 2019 due to increased sales at btd and the recreational vehicle lawn and garden and agricultural end markets also increased scrap revenues due to stronger sales volumes the increased earnings at t o plastics primarily driven by increased sales in horticultural life science and industrial end markets the backlog for this segment is approximately 211 million for 2019 compared with 166 million a year ago we expect plastics 2019 net income to be lower than 2018 we are expecting lower operating margins due to increasing resin prices and slightly higher sales volumes compared to last year in corporate costs net of tax are expected to be lower in 2019 our current earnings guidance for 2019 reflect 68 of our earnings from our electric segment and 32 of our earnings from our manufacturing and plastics segments this compares with 66 and 34 respectively in 2018 the increase in the electric earnings mix is being driven by the rate base growth related to merricourt astoria and south dakota reliability projects we expect the long term earnings mix to continue to move back in line with 75 of earnings from our electric segment and 25 of our manufacturing and plastics segments net of unallocated corporate costs this will be driven by the capital plan which calls for approximately 91 of our capital spend over the 2019 through 2023 timeframe to be in the electric segment we believe our 2019 guidance further positions us to achieve a 5 to 7 compounded annual growth rate in earnings per share using 2018 s 2 06 a share our 2019 guidance is dependent on the business and the economic challenges our two platforms will face this year for the utility key drivers include constructive outcome in the south dakota rate case and successful execution of our rate base growth projects for btd key drivers include continued operational improvements across all locations to further improve our return on sales margins and while earnings are expected to decline in 2019 for plastics this segment continues to be a strong complement to our portfolio by providing strong earnings cash flows to support our dividend and returns on invested capital we are now ready to take your questions question and answer session operator our first question comes from paul ridzon with keybanc paul ridzon could you give just some background on this charitable contribution and what we should look for going forward charles macfarlane sure paul i appreciate the question we have for a number of year been considering establishing the foundation for well both otter tail corporation and then we also have established one for the otter tail power company as well and we wanted to in 2018 certainly help get the foundations off on the right foot with the good commitment to fund those organizations going forward and so you see a probably a much healthier contribution made for the otter tail power i m sorry the otter tail corporation foundation in that 2 million amount the power company is a 0 5 million and as we kind of look forward i would tell you that future contributions are ultimately subject to the success the financial success that we re having at both of the entities but in the utility we re looking for the future kind of range i would say in that 2 million to 500 000 range on a go forward basis and at the parent company depending on results you could see i suppose in a range of 300 000 to 600 000 a year paul ridzon so 18 was just kind of getting this the critical mass charles macfarlane yes paul ridzon and then relative to your eei data it looks like some capex moved from 19 to 20 can you give a little more detail there charles macfarlane the movement paul relates to the astoria merricourt the movement is the merricourt project when you in terms of what you we saw at eei and then what we see now we ve seen a bit of a push back in the timing of the merricourt project and so basically the project isn t going away it s just a movement of dollars from 19 into 20 paul ridzon so everything fundamentally still the same just the timing shift charles macfarlane yes paul ridzon and then i know i ask this every call but pressures you re seeing maybe from the benefit of tax reform being competitively reduced in the manufacturing segments charles macfarlane paul we just haven t seen that with couple of our as we talk about in the press release and in my comments we were actually we saw price uplift from some of our customers in 2019 both in kind of across the board at btd and t o plastics we were able to get price increases in place with customers where we thought it was appropriate and needed we haven t had any push back from customers looking for kind of a reduction in pricing because of the tax savings were picking up in the manufacturing businesses it doesn t mean that it couldn t happen but we certainly are seeing any of that and of course we actually have we could be looking for the same things on our supply side as well when we negotiate our prices with our supply base and given the pvc commodity nature of that business prices were up in 2018 in the pvc pipe business and that was really a reflective of market conditions we re seeing some softening of prices we saw that in the fourth quarter and as we head into 19 but it s really more market driven that it is having anything to do with tax reform paul ridzon what s driving that softening in the market charles macfarlane i think that there we as we went through 18 we saw much stronger prices than we expected now as we head into the we completed the fourth quarter we saw some uplift in our resin costs we think saw some pullback in market pricing as it relates to just demand and competition and as we move into 19 we re seeing similar there s some announced resin price increases here in the first quarter we ll see if they stick fully but we expected some of it s going to stick and we ve seen some softening in sales prices that started in the fourth quarter and it s really kind of market related and it s what s driving it operator our next question comes from chris ellinghaus with williams capital chris ellinghaus can talk about the georgia you d mentioned that it was profitable in the second half of the year are you expecting that trend to continue charles macfarlane yes we are we more like a 30 increase in volume year over year in georgia so we ve got some leverage there and we continue to see a good backlog at that site we ve continued to improve operationally then improve dramatically around our on time delivery and work with a number of customers on pricing so we anticipate that similar or better results as we had in the last six months of 18 going forward into 19 chris ellinghaus does that mean btd had some pretty strong revenue growth are you expecting particularly with the way the backlog look you re expecting another really good revenue year there charles macfarlane we are definitely expecting an increase i would say in the backlog 35 of the part price or 35 to 40 is metal and a lot of these prices that are in the backlog assume metal prices that were probably based on 2018 final quarter and we ve seen that drop a little so the metal impact in the 19 backlog is likely overstated a little bit but we do anticipate good growth in all the segments where there are some of those segments that you re not going to see that kind of growth we have been awarded programs in the ag sector that are new to us meaning it s just not higher volume of the same part we were making we are going to be making parts of it that we weren t in previous year so it s a market share growth there chris ellinghaus kevin is the foundation donations that you were talking about would you anticipate that those would likely stay sort of fourth quarter kind of events kevin moug yes chris ellinghaus and lastly you talked about the competition increasing in plastics a little bit is there was there a lot of slack in capacity that some of your competitors may have been trying to utilize or get your utilization higher or what where is that competition coming from charles macfarlane yes i mean i think that there is a lot of the some of the larger competition certainly has capacity out there in the in their plants some of that competition is also vertically integrated and that there are resin manufacturers and there s always some potential or were there want to have their profits occur and whether it s at their resin plants or their pvc businesses and so we did see some of that happened and there s been it s at least looks to be continuing into the first quarter here i mean we re only a month and a half into the year so far but we have seen sales prices kind of continue with those little bit reduced levels from that were in the fourth quarter operator our next question is a follow up question from paul ridzon with keybanc paul ridzon just back to the last question the at btd the decrease in metal prices will impact revenues but shouldn t impact net income kevin moug correct the metal prices are passed through to the customer but they do show up in the backlog as far as total part prices paul ridzon kevin when you talked about and talks about the 19 electric utility outlook you said something about o m and pension like i kind of missed that could you quickly review what you said kevin moug sure i mean we re we expect in large part lower o m at the utility in part because we re our discount rate went up on the pension plan and our other benefit programs and we had a discount rate of 3 9 paul in 2000 that we use for 2018 and then now in 2019 given where interest rates move kind of that last half of the year our discount rate went up to 4 5 paul ridzon and should we also look for decrease in o m because of the plant outage loss kevin moug yes paul ridzon so the o m line in total should be down correct is that fair to say kevin moug yes operator and i m not showing any further questions on the phone lines charles macfarlane well thank you for your questions and support otter tail corporation with continued execution on the utility growth projects and strong operational performance in our manufacturing segment we remain confident in our ability to deliver shareholder value in 2019 we will focus on continuing to improve btd profitability and we will further refine the long term growth strategy for northern pipe and vinyltech and t o plastics and we will continue to execute on otter tail power s major generation and technology projects we believe this will allow us to the deliver on our 2019 guidance of 2 10 to 2 25 a share thank you for joining our call we appreciate your interest in otter tail corporation and we look forward to a successful 2019 operator ladies and gentlemen this does conclude today s presentation you may now disconnect and have a wonderful day

gold has an enduring primeval appeal which means it is never too far from an investor s mind particularly in turbulent times the yellow metal had a bit of the shine taken off it by the historic equities bull run seen since the financial crisis of 2008 but with stock markets getting decidedly choppy recently gold has had a bit of a polish geopolitical tensions are bubbling up from america s trade dispute with china to continued turmoil in the middle east via populist trouble brewing in the eurozone these things all reduce confidence in fiat currencies stock markets and the global economy in general which raises the relative attractiveness of one of humanity s oldest loves with stock markets hitting choppy water recently gold has received a bit of a polish the other side of the capital markets coin to shares fixed income has also offered up reasons to be positive on gold in the near term the federal reserve s relatively punchy rate rising cycle has been replaced by a new found dovishness as concern builds the us economy is due for a slowdown with no meaningful rate rise cycle in sight for the united kingdom the european union or japan decent interest on cash savings or yield on investment grade bonds still looks a long way off an increasing number of people are going for gold of late with the price of an ounce climbing from just over 1200 three months ago to 1352 as of today 18 february another specific driver of this rise is the people s bank of china s decision to boost its gold reserves on 12 february china s central bank added to its hoard for the second month in a row the price of an ounce of gold has climbed to 1352 1047 over the past three months adrian ash head of research at bullionvault explained like any investor central banks buy gold when they start to mistrust other assets and the wider financial system that s because gold offers unique diversification liquidity and security of ownership with regards to diversification gold prices tend to do well when other assets do badly rising 98 per cent of the time when the us stock market has fallen from 5 years before in relation to liquidity gold trades in a deep global market 24 hours a day finding end user demand from chinese newly weds to hindu temple goers microchip factories to new york hedge funds most importantly with respect to security gold is no one s liability and no one s to default on ash also pointed out that countries like russia and venezuela facing us and eu sanctions and who want independence from western dominated financial systems may also be adding to their holdings the primary reason gold has rallied in early 2019 is the retrenchment on seven years of interest rate hike promises by the us federal reserve added ned naylor leyland manager of the merian gold silver fund the central bank s assurances of policy normalisation have held back the gold price which is chiefly driven by moves in real interest rates interest rates adjusted to remove the impact of inflation federal reserve boss jerome powell has made dovish noises on the prospects for further interest rates rises in america now with the path of rate hikes seemingly reverting the market is concerned about the future purchasing power of currencies such as the us dollar and sterling naylor leyland continued these concerns are what drive interest in gold and silver secondly the apparent reversal in long standing trends in several asset classes for example equities and rising political tension have created an uncertain market environment as gold tends to perform well when monetary policy turns looser the current conditions and the resultant investor caution is making gold look interesting again he added how to invest in gold so if you want to put a bit of bullion in your investment pot what s the best way to go about it getting hold of a bar or two and hiding them in your house somewhere is certainly one option another is buying a big thick gold chain and wearing it out on the town like a rapper these may not be the most sensible ways though adrian lowcock head of personal investing at willis owen outlines some of the best options one way to track the gold price is via an etf backed by physical gold another is the ishares gold producers etf which will simply track all listed gold miners however most etfs use derivatives which makes them complex products individual mining companies incur operational risk so a fund with a portfolio of companies may be a better option many mining shares are trading near historic lows versus spot gold prices blackrock gold and general fund is one of the best known and is well diversified across the world it can invest in other precious metals and has about 10 per cent in silver this fund gets its exposure to gold and precious metals via related quoted equities evy hambro and co manager tom holl execute a disciplined investment approach that incorporates detailed commodity and company analysis with the aim of outperforming the ftse gold mines index in a risk and liquidity aware manner merian gold silver fund differs in that it has a blend of real assets a gold bullion trust and gold and silver mining shares lowcock continued it tilts towards bullion when cautious and shares when bullish silver is more volatile than gold so the fund manager increases exposure to silver when prices are rising if you want an investment trust rather than an open ended fund one good option is blackrock world mining trust the trust aims to benefit from global demand for metals and the mining companies that produce them said william heathcoat amory head of investment trust research at kepler trust intelligence a gold mine on the mongolian border in north east china the managers have huge flexibility as to how they invest through equities debt preference shares and private royalty contracts in total the trust has 15 per cent exposure to gold miners as at 31st december one of their key themes currently is that following the very difficult years of a few years back mining companies have cut back on exploration and unnecessary capital expenditure he continued the managers believe that despite this companies that have good quality assets which have longevity and ease of extraction should do well in the current environment they believe this is particularly prevalent amongst the gold companies given their shorter mine lives and greater need for reinvestment
