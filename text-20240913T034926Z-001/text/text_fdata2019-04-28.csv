before the neoliberal turn the rise of energy finance and the limits to us foreign economic policy simone selva palgrave 2018 find this book if we abandon saudi it would be a terrible mistake said us president donald trump making a reference to the kingdom s influence over oil prices while explaining the us government s position regarding the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi i am about to make america great again not going to destroy the economy of our country what trump communicated in this statement is neither new nor unexpected oil has defined the twentieth century including its democracies our lifestyle work and quest for unlimited growth require large amounts of energy and money all derived from oil with this insight selva identifies the often overlooked but equally detrimental role that the extraction distribution and profits of oil played before the neoliberal turn of the late 1970s while reading his work it is obvious that selva does not want his research to simply be part of the rising number of books produced on the influential doctrine of the twentieth century neoliberalism this is why he has not chosen to analyse the influence of the mont pelerin society the pro market governance of the 1970s and 1980s the chicago boys or the financial crisis of 2007 2008 instead he analyses the events that have given rise to neoliberalism especially in the us where foreign economic policy has been restructured since the 1960s despite the public outcry this is discussed in the preface of the book where selva shares his personal history as an academic working as a guest co editor for journal 900 and how he started seeing the influence of oil and petrodollars at work in today s world chapter after chapter selva uses archival material to analyse how in the post war era the us balance of payments plummeted for the first time and drained its gold reserves he asks how us monetary policy not only negatively affected its industrial productivity but also caused capital outflow from the us to the eurodollar market he also explores how the weak dollar in the international monetary market not only caused the bretton woods system to collapse but also gave meteoric ascendency to oil producing countries in global politics before the neoliberal turn is divided into two sections the first deals with the recurrent dilemma of the plummeting balance of payments in the us since the 1950s the second concerns how us foreign economic policies gave rise to energy finance in the 1960s and 1970s selva examines how us presidents from john f kennedy to jimmy carter with the backing of the political and financial elite each tried to tackle the dwindling importance of the us dollar in their own way for example in the 1960s the us authorities raised interest rates on long term financial assets to unsuccessfully curb capital flight to the eurodollar markets other policies included asking for early repayments of outstanding debts from capital surplus european countries and an increase in foreign military sales while stressing cost sharing nato expenditures with european allies unfortunately things did not go as planned instead of restoring the balance of payments what the us instead witnessed was decline in the manufacturing industry and continued depreciation of the us dollar as various countries started trading in a number of currencies to minimise the fluctuation risk moreover selva highlights the crushing effects of the devaluation of the british pound and the impact of the collapse of the gold pool on overseas us military and development assistance commitments after explaining the us economic situation selva moves on to examining how access to oil and petrodollars has become a privilege for both the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec and the us it is in this section that selva s knowledge of the functioning of international finance and the neoliberal ideal market utopia shines as he elucidates the us recycling mechanism for petrodollars namely the selling of us assets to saudi arabia and kuwait and the use of us banks to boost domestic growth for example the gerald ford administration facilitated saudi investment worth 100 million in the tech giant at t ignoring the concerns of the economist arthur burns and congress relating to the opec countries taking over key national industries subsequently kuwait joined hands with the bank of america and chase manhattan and made investments in the us stock and real estate markets at first glance these and other opec direct investments looked profitable giving a boost to the us economy with less detrimental effects on the us dollar especially at a time when saudi arabia and iran began giving long term loans to least developed countries ldcs instead of investing in eurodollars unfortunately the entry of petrodollars in the us economy has only accelerated the neoliberal process including washington s adoption of relaxed lending policies the privatisation of the national industries and an increase in national and international debt leading to the global financial crisis before the neoliberal turn is an ambitious book which makes it a challenging read especially for readers beyond the academy nonetheless the book is relevant across a range of topics for example the discussion in chapters four and five of the us government s simultaneous use of development rhetoric and the institutions of the international monetary fund imf and the world bank to maintain its hegemonic power under the guise of knowledge and technology transfer was of particular interest to me as my research is focused on innovation and regional economic development i found selva s in depth analysis of us finance policies a welcome addition to the scholarship in aiding understanding of the actors who have co created the market for alternative fuels through subsidies mandates and the much hyped knowledge based economy trump has declared it s a very simple equation i m about make america great again our relationship is with the kingdom of saudi arabia selva has underscored the history of this relationship at a time when balancing the budget through the market is a priority by providing a review of us economic policies of the 1960s and 1970s overall before the neoliberal turn is a valuable book for social

i m mike gleason and welcome to this week s market wrap podcast a few weeks ago we heard the first half of an interview money metals president stefan gleason did during a recent 360 gold summit today we ll hear part two of that interview stefan gives some important warnings to precious metals investors discusses why he favors one of the precious metals over the others and also talks about some really important things to consider when selecting a precious metals dealer don t miss the eye opening conclusion of stefan s interview coming up after this week s market update well the big headline in markets this week the s p 500 pushed to a new all time high in nominal terms but is it a new high in real terms most in the financial media don t want to ask that question they would rather join their wall street sponsors in celebrating a new official record president donald trump certainly didn t miss the opportunity to boast about the stock market s strength under his watch donald trump the stock market and our country from an economic standpoint is doing the best probably it s ever done we re hitting new highs again we ve hit new highs i guess close to or over 100 times since i m president from the time of the election cnbc reporter you heard the president starting off there with the stock market obviously he sees that as a piece of good news and an overall barometer for the economy under his leadership i asked the president how high he thinks the stock market can go he didn t respond to that one the trump tax cuts for corporations and his administration s relative business friendly approach to regulation have certainly given equity markets a boost but stocks have also benefited from a general rising sea of liquidity thanks to the federal reserve investors shouldn t be fooled by records that get set because of artificial stimulus from central bankers there has never been a clearer case of the federal reserve goosing the stock market than the current rally that began off last year s pre christmas lows under pressure from wall street and the white house plunge protection team to back off on rate hikes fed chairman jerome powell announced a pause earlier this spring he confirmed the pause would continue for the remainder of the year for wall street it has been perhaps the greatest pause of all time judging by the nominal gains registered over the past four months despite the celebratory mood surrounding stocks there is a striking number of what market technicians call non confirmations the transportation index hasn t hit a new high the small cap russell 2000 index is nowhere near a new high and the s p 500 itself is far short of a new high when measured against raw materials including crude oil and gold yes despite the gold market s frustratingly sluggish performance over the past few years the monetary metal has still outperformed the stock market over a longer term frame it may be hard to believe given all the current hoopla around stocks but since 2000 gold bullion has still doubled the gains of the s p 500 stocks are up big in terms of dollars in terms of hard money though it s been a lost generation for equities investors won t necessarily hear that inconvenient truth told to them by the talking heads on cnbc turning to this week s market action in precious metals gold is managing a 0 9 gain to trade at 1 289 an ounce with most of that gain coming here thanks to a bit of a friday rally silver which dropped below 15 in trading earlier this week is now a tick above it and is essentially unchanged on the week now to bring spot prices to 15 10 the platinum market shows a weekly decline of 0 8 to trade at an even 900 and finally palladium looks higher by 1 4 this week as prices check in at 1 462 per ounce and like gold with all of that gain coming here on friday metals markets faced headwinds this week from both a rising stock market and rising u s dollar index the dollar rose toward a 2 year high against its major foreign currency counterparts even as the federal reserve has turned dovish central banks around the developed world from japan to sweden to canada have turned even more dovish they are aggressively committing to ultra low interest rates in some cases even negative interest rates in the face of weak economies if this dynamic continues to push the dollar higher against foreign currencies the fed will come under increasing pressure to cut rates futures markets are currently pricing in a quarter point rate cut by the end of the year fed policymakers haven t yet signaled they will make such a move but there are signs the economy is slowing significantly enough to give them justification despite the record high stock market and historically low official unemployment rate gdp is slumping and housing is hitting the skids perhaps investor optimism toward stocks will finally begin to wane the big question is whether the next round of fed stimulus benefits primarily the stock market again or whether monetary inflation gets reflected more in other asset classes such as commodities and precious metals that question could start getting answered later this year well now without further delay let s get to this week s featured interview of money metals president stefan gleason as we listen to the conclusion of his remarks during the 360 gold summit a discussion about all things precious metals and we start off where stefan answers the important question about how to select a precious metals dealer stefan gleason you want be careful about who you are doing business with you want to do a little research probably start small with that dealer and see how it goes see how the service is see how the delivery is another place to acquire precious metals would be from a local dealer money metals exchange is a national dealer there is other several other good national dealers local dealers are a little bit more sort of unknown some are very good some are not one of the problems though buying locally is that you are often faced with sales taxes many states i think it is about 20 states actually force dealers who sell inside of their states to collect sales taxes which are significant especially when you consider that an ounce of gold might cost 5 6 7 over spot well if you add a 7 sale sales tax to that that s a huge huge markup in the context of the numbers you normally see in precious metals so that is a disadvantage that many local dealers have when compared to a national dealer but the advantage perhaps especially if you are very nervous about dealing with somebody from a long distance is that presumably you can walk out that day with your metals after having paid instead of having to wait a couple days in the mail for it to arrive on the other hand they may not be as well equipped locally to detect fakes which are not a big problem but they are out there and there may less of an education component involved but look at your options obviously our customers are buying from us many of them bought locally and then changed to us pete fetig that is a really interesting observation with the sales tax when you think about it you are actually exchanging one form of currency for real money you are not buying anything you are not selling you are exchanging stefan gleason right that is an extremely concerning subject as you pointed out you are changing one form of money paper u s dollars or coins for another form of money that is recognized by our constitution as money article 1 section 10 of the constitution sets up gold and silver as the only money that is supposed to be accepted in the states we have also obviously got away from that the idea that you would have to pay sales taxes as though it some sort of good as opposed to money could imagine if you went to the bank and had to pay sales tax to break a 10 bill into a roll of quarters i mean that is basically the equivalent gold and silver is disfavored by the sales tax laws in many states and then at the federal level you have to pay capital gains taxes when your gold and silver goes up in dollar terms but it may not have really gone up in the context of purchasing power what happened was the dollar went down so it s kind of an example of the inflation tax you are being taxed essentially through the capital gains tax on the inflation that the government is creating and so these are the public policies that we are working to spotlight and hopefully change over time that is to repeal the sales tax laws that are discriminatory against people for exchanging one form of money for a better more trusted form of money and then of course the discriminatory capital gains tax and unfortunately it is even at a higher rate than say a stock a long term capital gain on gold bullion is taxed at 28 and not 15 like you would with a gain in a stock so there are definitely some problems we can get into this in a minute that is one of the advantages of holding precious metals in your ira is that you can buy and sell without having to pay those gains every time pete fetig is there anything more important than choosing the right product and getting it for a low price stefan gleason the most important thing is getting delivery and that means getting your metal i would say that in some cases the lowest price can be a red flag if somebody is selling gold and silver for below its actual value there is probably something wrong we recently ran across somebody who had bought some gold from a bitcoin exchange and he bought it at a discount a discount to its market price well that is kind of a red flag gold and silver is not at a discount to the spot price particularly on the buy side so the lowest price is not necessarily the best safest place to go obviously there is some very good low cost dealers including money metals exchange but there s also been horror stories of low cost dealers i will mention one that went out of business tulving company they were super low no service almost kind of mean to their customers if you dealt with them eventually at one point about 2 years ago 100s of people stopped getting delivery something like 20 million worth of gold and silver was never delivered so getting a low price is no good at all if you are not actually getting your metal the most important thing is working with somebody and getting what you paid for pete fetig very true how does the average person trust a dealer or an organization that supplies the coin or bullion stefan gleason well the first thing is doing a little research you should always do that with any purchase you should know who you re dealing with when it comes to precious metal dealers the first thing i think look them up on the bbb see if there are complaints see how they have handled those complaints everybody probably can have a complaint but how they dealt with those how many they have what kind of rating they have that is one way of doing the research there is another site called bullion directory which has reviewed 100s of companies across the globe we were honored to have been named precious metals dealer of the year in the united states last year by that ratings group international ratings group those are two things you can do research the bbb and bullion directory the other thing is size them up look at their website look at the content that they have if they have an email list get on your email list and start small if you are worried about it you re not 100 sure buy a small amount and see how it goes see how good the communication is see if they provide you with transparent pricing and fast delivery do they confirm that they got your payment was their invoice exactly what you expected was it packaged well was there pride put into the way they handled everything with their customer if you have a good experience that is a really good sign obviously it is not a guarantee but you really need to pay attention to the people you are doing business with and that s just as much if not more the case when it comes to precious metals pete fetig what sort of considerations are important to make before and after acquiring stefan gleason i would say that there are a couple things that i would emphasize one is what are you going to do with it when you get it where are you going to put it how are you going to store it most of our customers probably keep it somewhere in their house a few will put it in their bank safe deposit box some will stored in a depository or at a brink s facility some will put it in their home safe but some will hide it in other unpredictable places so if you have a lot of precious metals you probably want to have some of it stored remotely because that is a lot to have in your house i do think that everybody should have the ability to get their hands on their gold and silver at least some of it very quickly if they need to so storage is one consideration some people are reluctant and i can understand why to store it in their bank safe deposit box in fact the banks are part of this war on cash and even war on precious metals some banks are saying you cannot hold gold and silver or cash in your bank safe deposit box you may be banking with one of those banks but there are also concerns from back in the 1930s fdr issued an executive order banning private gold ownership in america some people felt like the gold that they had in the safe deposit box was being disclosed and potentially seized that never actually happened but most people turned it involuntarily or many people did but there s less privacy perhaps if you hold it in the bank i think people rightly are little reluctant to do that the other thing is in addition to figure how you are going to store it and where you are going to put it is really to think about the responsibility that you have as a precious metals owner or as a person to keep your financial business to yourself a trusted person or a spouse certainly should be aware if something happens to you but you should not be talking about how you bought all this gold and silver bringing out your collection and showing it to everybody that comes and visits there s been unfortunately some really horrific situations where people have not kept her mouth shut had been talking way too much about what they own and found themselves with a home invasion or a robbery so that s the other thing figure out how you are going to store it and also discipline yourself to keep your financial business as private as possible pete fetig very good points how can the average person best understand appreciation of his holdings or the upside value stefan gleason the first reason to own gold and silver is not necessarily for these spectacular gains although i think you are going to see those at least in dollar terms the first reason is to own it as insurance and as a hedge but particularly with silver probably also with gold there is a huge potential upside even real terms right now we are seeing negative interest rates emerge in europe we are seeing 0 interest rates here in the u s one of the big knocks on gold and silver is it does not pay any interest well neither does the dollar now and then on top of that you have the devaluation of the principal when you own dollars so gold and silver are becoming very attractive assets that is particularly been evidenced in the last few months gold and silver have done extremely well so there s definitely some real potential upside to gold and silver in terms of when to get out i think that you probably want to be owning gold and silver forever a certain amount but if you re more of a speculator and you have larger amounts than you probably do want to be looking for opportunities to sell over time but i would say right now is a buying opportunity down the road you could see silver at 100 an ounce or even higher gold could be several thousand dollars an ounce before this is all over particularly if the devaluation continues and maybe you ll want to lighten your holdings right now i think you are wise to be in the accumulation mode unless you need the money because you need to liquidate for other reasons pete fetig that makes sense i guess related would be when might an average person consider liquidating his holdings are there any solid event types that might precipitate liquidating all of what you have versus only some of what you have stefan gleason if you see the u s government live within its means and the debt goes from 18 trillion down to 0 that might be a good time to seriously lighten up on precious metals i personally don t see that happening i do not think most people do i think we are locked on a path here so i think there is always going to be a significant role for precious metals in your portfolio regardless but perhaps if you saw an outbreak of sanity in washington dc and around the world and peace emerging and all these geopolitical things simmering down and terrorism going away i think it might be time to seriously consider selling a fair amount of your gold and silver but we re not in that situation the way to approach this is to not try to pick a bottom or a top it would be accumulate over time in smaller amounts don t go all in and don t sell all at once i would look at this as a way of getting on a plan and slowly and steadily increasing the number of ounces you own and then if we get down the road and you do see things changing and 40 of the american people are talking about you re getting your shoes shined and the guy is talking about owning gold and silver maybe that is the time to start selling but we are nowhere near that situation and most people are dangerously exposed in not owning any so i would get on a monthly plan and accumulate now is the time to accumulate down the road would be a time to potentially disgorge some your holdings or if you have a need for it if you re in retirement or you have some big expenses obviously you do not want to lock up all of your available cash in precious metals just do what you can over time to accumulate and i think you will be rewarded for it pete fetig and somewhat related in terms of best place to get it what about best places to liquidate it is there a type of list that would be investors might consider comparing against or going to stefan gleason well usually and certainly it s the case with money metals exchange you can sell to the same people that you buy from we ll buy anybody s gold or silver coins bars and rounds we obviously check it and ensure that it is what it is we make sure we have it in our facility before we pay the customer once we verify it but we buy back and we would love to buy back unfortunately for us most of our customers are just buying from us and very few are selling to us so we actually have to buy from mints and wholesalers and the u s mint and so forth we d love to buy more of our inventory from our customers because obviously we are buying from a middleman we do make a market probably only about 5 to 10 of our inventory is sourced from our customers we are eager to buy and we offer probably the highest or among the highest buyback prices of any of our competitors we are as eager to buy from our customers as we are to sell to our customers and that s probably the case with most dealers we are not retailers we are dealers and that means that we both and sell you probably would go back to where you bought it but you do not have to we buy stuff from people that they bought elsewhere all the time and are happy to do so the items that we deal in are very standard recognizable liquid some people may want to sell to their local dealer and that s fine too they want to walk out with the cash they may not get as good a price but it depends on what your priorities are there is no problem selling your precious metals but that s a very good question because a lot of times people say how do i sell what do i do with it it is really about as easy to sell it as it is to buy it you contact a dealer or walk into a dealer shop they offer you a price you give them the metal and they pay you it s that simple it is about the same process in reverse as when you buy from us pete fetig i m going to switch gears just a little bit here how about other precious metals like platinum palladium etc are there times when an investor should be considering acquiring those precious metals or vice versa or liquidating if they are already held stefan gleason platinum and palladiums are the other two major precious metals there s rhodium for example which is even less considered an investment asset platinum and palladium are still a very small part of the precious metals market there s less of it i should mention but it is not as big of an investment asset it is more of an industrial asset platinum and palladium are used for catalytic converters diesel and gasoline catalytic converters with automotive demand for example platinum and palladium can go up and down based on what is happening in the automotive market it is also a financial asset there are etfs now of course there are physical bars and rounds and coins of all of these including platinum and palladium but i would definitely not get into those until you have already got a significant or at least a reasonable holding of gold and silver those are the two that you want to start with platinum and palladium is a little bit more for down the road in terms of the upside again a lot of it is driven by industrial demand but they are also undervalued versus gold as i discussed earlier silver is way undervalued versus gold historically both in recent history as well as the longer term history but platinum and palladium are undervalued platinum is way below the price of 1 ounce of gold and it s typically 1 5 to 2 times the price of gold over time platinum is way undervalued versus gold but again that is really not something to jump into until after you already have a meaningful holding of gold and silver pete fetig it also sounds like something that you probably would not do until you better understood the market and price swings and so forth of the precious metals in general what about owning precious metals in your ira how does that work should you own the only physical metal or shares of metal backed by etf stefan gleason etfs again if you want to trade and you want to do in your stock account it is convenient but there these precious metals backed etfs they re really a proxy you don t own direct title to the metal you own shares of a trust that supposedly owns the metal and then there is a whole series of custodians and sub custodians and sub sub custodians involved in that kind of instrument so if you re buying gold and silver as insurance then why introduce counterparty risk into something that is supposed to be your safe asset there are reasons people want to buy that certainly it is convenient but it s not necessarily cheaper than owning it and storing it and paying the storage fees yourself there s still fees involved in the etfs i don t think that s really something people should be doing they should be buying physical gold and silver that they have direct title to pete fetig what sort of things or education can the average person do for themselves to be better prepared to consider precious metals investing stefan gleason this is something our company money metals exchanges is really big on and that is education and content we want our customers to be well informed and we want to keep them updated there are lots of websites out there but a great place is to go to moneymetals com and get on our email list we send out 2 or 3 informative articles about the markets each week pay attention get a little gold and silver in your hand start thinking about it start thinking about what it means compare it to paper money it s interesting the first time i had gold and silver my hand 20 years ago it really got the wheels turning what is this fiat money what is this federal reserve note why does it have value why do people accept it and compare that to this beautiful timeless metal of gold and silver and it really gets the wheels turning and that opened up an education process for me and i think it does a lot of people and we think the best customers are the best informed and that s certainly what we strive for i want to get back to precious metals iras that s one thing that is an area where people might be best able to put money into precious metals because they have ira accounts there something called a self directed ira you can set up an account with a self directed ira company and then work with a dealer like us and with a depository you can directly hold title your ira can directly hold title to physical metal inside of your iras that s another way of getting into this market that we definitely encourage people to look at pete fetig a lot safer than to be speculating in the stock market that is for sure is there any method to the madness in how the average person might approach what he considers owner or holding when i say that for example is there any sort of 80 20 type of rule or rules of ratio for gold to silver holdings stefan gleason i would say that the more likely you are to need to access the gold and silver and turn it into cash or liquidate out of it the more likely that that s the case probably the higher percentage that you want to have in gold gold tends to be a little more consistent it s rising but it s less of a roller coaster silver can be quite volatile when priced in dollars and of course some of that is just the volatility of the dollar itself but i would say if you re looking at a 3 to 5 year horizon then definitely favor silver if you re only going to own gold and silver for a year or 2 and think you might need to liquidate out of it then perhaps you should favor gold and have a majority of your funds in gold but this isn t something that you should be buying and selling like stock this is something you should be accumulating and not necessarily looking to liquidate it any time soon it s there if you need it do not necessarily plan on buying gold and silver if you think you are going to need the money in 6 months there are some transaction costs involved not significant if you go to the right places but that is a something to keep in mind going back to you what i said earlier silver is definitely the more potentially explosive upside metal as long as you not looking very short term i would definitely have a majority of your funds in silver but make sure you get some gold pete fetig very good well we re running up against a time constraint here i wanted to thank you for joining us and offering all of your just excellent insights and observations and answers to all the questions that we have thrown at you today before we leave though i would like to offer you the opportunity to let people know how to reach you and to contact you at money metal exchange stefan gleason thank you so much for the opportunity and hopefully i ve shown education is a big part of what we do at money metals i think when compared to other dealers that s one of our very strongest differentiating factors go to moneymetals com look at the products most importantly get on our email list and let us continue to educate you about the market we also have a monthly savings plan which you can get into where you set up a certain amount each month where we debit your bank account or whatever your instructions are and send you on a steady schedule gold and silver and that s a great way to accumulate kind of put it on auto pilot so that s available at moneymetals com as well but i certainly really appreciated the opportunity to talk about this important subject and also about a company pete fetig well thank you for joining us today and folks thanks for listening in and we hope you guys have a great day
the pound to euro exchange rate is 0 06 higher 1 15909 today the pound to us dollar exchange rate is 0 02 higher 1 29958 today analyst marshall gittler chief strategist head of education at acls global brings you the weekly outlook for april 29 to may 3 weekly outlook fomc bank of england payrolls japan holiday to make for active week the week gone by central bank capitulation i thought that without brexit i d be bereft of things to write about no such luck several themes in the market this week the monetary policy convergence theme was in full display over the past week the two market effecting events were the further slowdown in australian inflation and the change in the bank of canada s rate bias both countries are now expected to cut rates this year well almost for canada this is a big change for canada which just six months ago was expected to hike rates not once but twice during 2020 above boc rates advertisement as the idea of a global slowdown in inflation took root bond yields around the world began to fall again this is a reversal from the trend we ve seen since the beginning of april when yields started to move higher again german 10 year yields are back below zero above change in 10yr yields with fears of higher interest rates receding and bond yields falling the major stock markets tended to do well china being the major exception in the last few weeks despite the government s reflationary efforts emerging market currencies fell sharply over the week the argentinian peso ars not shown here hit a record low as the market began to worry about yet another default after the upcoming presidential election the five year argentinian credit default swap is now pricing in more than a 60 chance of that happening during the swap s lifetime above usd vs em currencies it may be that the money flowing out of em currencies is what s pushing up the price of stocks and bonds in the developed countries we may also be seeing investors putting on g10 carry trades using usd as an asset currency and eur and chf as the funding currency bond issuance in eur and chf has been quite active recently about chf 6bn in foreign bonds issued ytd in switzerland the most since 2015 however the basis swap market shows no signs of excess usd demand in these currencies so i m hesitant to fall back on that as an explanation above one year basis swaps coming week fomc bank of england nfp china pmis japan holiday the coming week should provide further opportunities for investors to gauge the intentions of central banks as the federal open market committee fomc and the bank of england s monetary policy committee mpc meet neither meeting is likely to result in any change in rates instead attention will focus on the nuance of the accompanying statement and any change in the perceived bias the fomc meeting on wednesday is likely to make only modest tweaks to its assessment i don t think that much has changed since the last meeting on march 20th only a little more than a month ago if anything the economic outlook has improved meaning that any changes in the statement following the meeting or in fed chair powell s press conference following it are likely to positive for the dollar the market is currently pricing in one rate cut this year and one next year this is despite the fact that the fomc members themselves expect no change in rates this year and one rate hike next year at least that was what the dot plot back in march showed above fed funds the market s expectation for the time of this cut has been receding investors currently see a 50 chance of a cut by the time of the october meeting a month ago this would ve been august although there s no fomc meeting in august above market estimates fed rates that s probably because the recent data shows that the risks to the us economic outlook are far more balanced than they were a month ago the relatively strong us retail sales figure 1 6 mom in march shows that consumers are still alive and well while the continued decline in jobless claims shows that the labor market remains strong accordingly the recession fears that animated markets just a few months ago have been receding some fed officials have expressed concern that persistently below target inflation could start to erode inflation expectations indeed the core personal consumption expenditure pce deflator the fed s preferred inflation gauge which comes out on monday is expected to show some deceleration in inflation from january s rate no february figure available the headline figure however is expected to accelerate sharply probably because of higher oil prices above us personal consumption but while core inflation may have slowed a bit the better economic data and higher oil prices have caused inflation expectations to go back up again closer to the fed s 2 target so the concern that some fomc members have expressed on this topic isn t really valid right now and isn t likely to affect their assessment above us inflation vs oil price we could see the market move the likely date of the rate cut even further out if the committee presents a positive assessment of developments as seems likely to me that would probably be good for the dollar as for the bank of england mpc at their last meeting in march they voted unanimously to keep rates steady as they did at their february meeting as well the main change since the march meeting is that the brexit deadline has been put off to end october this takes some of the heat off of them in theory they could move interest rates during this interregnum and indeed growth has been somewhat better than expected which gives them leeway to do so the monthly gdp figures suggest that december s decline was just a statistical oddity and growth remains steady if not necessarily robust above uk gdp but why would they raise rates while they did say that assuming everything goes well with brexit an ongoing tightening of monetary policy over the forecast period at a gradual pace and to a limited extent would be appropriate to return inflation sustainably to the 2 target but the underlying brexit uncertainty is still there and will be until october or brexit occurs whichever comes first furthermore inflation has stayed at pretty much right around their 2 target meaning there shouldn t be any urgency to change stance above uk inflation views on the boe have changed dramatically since the march meeting immediately after the meeting the market saw the possibility of a cut in rates as much higher than that of a hike but now the market sees almost no chance of a cut and a moderate 34 or one in three chance of a rate hike by the beginning of next year i think it s unlikely that the mpc will be more optimistic than the market already is about the potential for a successful brexit and higher economic activity accordingly i expect the statement following the meeting to be more or less in line with current expectations and for the pound to have relatively little reaction afterwards above boe rates the other main event of the week will be the monthly nonfarm payroll nfp figure and the accompanying average hourly earnings these have the same importance as ever for the market although now they are looked at from the opposite direction from before now the question is will they be weak enough to hasten a cut in rates this time the market consensus is no on the contrary they re expected to be strong enough that it could diminish expectations of a rate cut this year that would be positive for the dollar the market forecast for the adp report which comes out a few hours before the fomc meeting ends on wednesday is for a rise of 180k going back to a more normal level after march s unusually low 129k for the nfp expectations are that it will be 185k little changed from the previous month s 196k and within the recent range of what s considered normal excluding the unusually large increases in december and january these figures would show job creating remaining solid and would give the fed no reason at all to start worrying about rates being high enough to choke off activity above nfp the average hourly earnings are forecast to rise a healthy 0 3 mom which would push the yoy rate of growth up to 3 3 from 3 2 that s the more significant figure imho as higher wages can be expected to eventually lead to higher prices furthermore as many people argue the labor market can t be said to be tight unless workers start to exert some leverage vis à vis employers higher wages are a sign that companies are having to compete for workers a strong hourly earnings figure is therefore good for the dollar above us average hourly earnings the ism indices in the us will also be closely watched manufacturing on wednesday non manufacturing on friday there are numerous other important indicators out during the week for the eurozone the first estimate of eu wide q1 gdp and german inflation on tuesday followed by eu wide inflation on friday will be the ones to watch but perhaps the most attention will focus on the china purchasing managers indices pmis the official ones come out tuesday morning china time the caixin manufacturing pmi on thursday they are all expected to show a further improvement in the chinese economy this too may help to dispel fears of a deeper downturn globally and help fed expectations to recover somewhat which could also be dollar positive above china pmis at the same time we saw during the past week how eur usd often tended to track usd cnh inverted given how highly leveraged the german economy is to china an improvement in chinese business outlook could boost expectations for europe much more than for the us and thereby push up eur usd above euro spot finally the week will also be unusual indeed unique in one respect japanese markets will be closed for the entire week and the following monday may 6th for a super golden week of 10 consecutive days of holiday as the current emperor abdicates and a new era begins this means lower liquidity in the fx market during asian time according to the 2016 bis survey of the fx market 6 1 of total fx market turnover takes place in japan this is a significant amount but even more it s 27 of the trading during the asian time zone and many of the other centers largely trade their own currency such as thailand and philippines in particular japanese corporate activity in usd jpy will be unusually thin the risk is not that a retail investor won t be able to get his or her order filled that s not going to be a problem but rather that the thin market in some currency pairs may be susceptible to sudden sharp movements due to low liquidity which could cause traders to get stopped out at a loss the problem is particularly acute during the time period after trading in new york has ended but trading in asia hasn t really started up yet a period that will now be longer every day as tokyo the first major center in asia to start trading will be absent from the market in the worst case we could see another flash crash like we ve seen before when currency trading computers for no apparent reason suddenly get it in their minds to buy or sell a currency in huge size incredible movements of 10 or so have happened before with no cause that any human being can discern at the time the problem will be particularly acute on wednesday may 1st when many other centers will be closed as well for labor day uk germany switzerland and china for example nonetheless market participants don t seem particularly concerned far from pulling back last week speculators in the us actually increased their short yen positions although we won t know what they did this week until the figures come out later friday and even that only covers up to tuesday my guess is that singapore and hong kong can take up much of the slack especially without the corporate flow emanating from tokyo and in tokyo retail investors have sent their jpy long positions to a record high as they are concerned about possible appreciation of the yen owing to the us japan trade talks also they probably remember that jpy surged almost 4 higher in minutes during the flash crash last january perhaps they re actually hoping for a replay of that event wellington nz is three hours ahead of tokyo and sydney is one hour ahead but those centers do only a small part of tokyo s business the bis figures show australia trading 182bn a day and wellington 12bn vs 374bn for tokyo hong kong and singapore which together do 658bn open an hour after tokyo above spectators net positions on yen above g10 vs usd performance chart

party winning four general elections and losing one in 1976 he gave up office for all time to the astonishment of the world what was wrong was he suffering from a grave secret illness was some great scandal about to break why should a man held in high esteem by his party and who had just celebrated his 60th birthday resign from the prime ministership at an age when churchill eden and home had yet to form a government the speculation was so lively that almost everyone missed the simple truth it was that wilson had had enough and did not intend to fight another election he had no new solutions for britain s old and recurrent problems and less energy than he had once had to sort out the party s internal feuds all but a few people missed too the historical significance of his resignation that it signalled the approaching decline of the kind of demand managed economy cum welfare state which had begun in 1945 had been maintained by three tory prime ministers and had been developed by wilson it was left to his successor james callaghan to tell the party bluntly it was untrue that a government could simply spend its way out of depression and unemployment the years of consensus between the parties and within them were coming to an end the labour party was soon to be defeated by margaret thatcher s radical conservatism and without wilson to hold it together was to lose some of its right wing to roy jenkins s breakaway movement the social democratic party and to see the broad left flexing its muscles dangerously though wilson became the best known man in britain he was an enigma to the public and even to his colleagues i ve had him on the air a dozen times said a bbc producer on the day wilson was appointed leader in 1963 yet i still feel i don t know him you are right said richard crossman wilson s friend isn t it wonderful what did wilson really think he had a remarkable gift for equivocation and manoeuvre which he used to hold the party together and to achieve and retain the leadership a nimble mind harold macmillan once said sometimes a revolutionary driving the tumbril sometimes affecting the part of moderate statesmanship it was an exaggeration which contained a lot of truth nobody thought of wilson as a left winger until he resigned from attlee s government with aneurin bevan then he took our breath away herbert morrison said wilson in 1970 a few months before he lost the premiership to edward heath getty but the mystery of wilson s personality was simply that it was all there on display there was nothing more to know he was a brilliant academic but no intellectual there were no philosophic depths to probe he was one of the few university socialists of his generation to escape the tamed and benevolent marxism of the left book club he kept away from the oxford labour club which was run by communists and joined the liberals but in huddersfield he joined the labour party before he was 20 the party that represented my highest moral and religious ideas he was a christian inspired by the social gospel finding his code of conduct in the precepts of the scout law and kipling s if shall we he asked later build a new britain of fair shares and equal opportunity or return to boom and bust days with their inequality and restrictive national production that was and remained his socialism in a nutshell in the controversy about the proposed removal of clause iv of the party s constitution which seemed to envisage the public ownership of almost everything wilson took a relaxed view let it stand he said it is an ideal not a detailed programme yet it was wrong to say that he had no ideology or for him to claim he was wholly pragmatic he shared the conventional outlook of the revisionist socialists of his generation a mixed economy a welfare state supported on an expanding industrial base part of it publicly owned and full employment made possible by keynesian expansion and trade union moderation when hugh gaitskell heard baseless sexual gossip about wilson he said if only it were true it would be one human attribute in the man yet his judgement of his rival was wrong wilson was not cold nobody wrote longer or more sympathetic letters to the widows of his colleagues nobody was more deeply concerned about the physically handicapped he filled no 10 with them every christmas it was he who insisted that jack ashley should not give up his seat when he lost his hearing and that susan masham in her wheelchair should accept a life peerage wilson argued that they could set an example and show other handicapped people what they could achieve but wilson was reticent he had been taught by his parents never to display his emotions or to weep on anyone s shoulder he was a member of the most loving but most undemonstrative of families to the end there remained left wingers who were suspicious of his politics and right wingers who were sceptical of his compromises and of his motives he was more loyal to his friends than some of them were to him but in time he did become our harold to the labour rank and file one of us as attlee never was and gaitskell could never have been no 10 wilson would cry as he entered a labour club harold s den the delighted would chorus of course many tories in the south detested his provincial bounce he was the archetype of the new meritocrats a stocky man of undistinguished appearance who had been left with a stoop by typhoid a common man from nowhere but with a mind of uncommon excellence and a prodigious capacity for work he had however a weakness for boasting and a naive delight in the limelight about his head and the red carpet beneath his feet though he spent six happy years at oxford wilson heard no whisper of those last enchantments in his style his tastes his speech he remained an unchanged man of the north his puritan earnestness graced by the affability of the nonconformist chapel and spiced with a lethal wit a macmillan minion complained you are acting as if you were prime minister well thank god somebody is wilson answered he married at 24 after six years courtship mary baldwin daughter of a congregational minister she gave him two sons and a home in which he could forget about politics wilson was a yorkshire equivalent of arnold bennett s card he preserved and cherished his roots they were good ones his mother was a schoolteacher and captain of a girl guides company his father was a works chemist skipper of a rover senior scout s crew at the baptist chapel where the family worshipped father and son stood on the terraces together cheering huddersfield town and the father s motor bike took harold on a sidecar ride to see the wembley exhibition and to pose for the prophetic picture in front of no 10 a lot of lads who make their way up herbert wilson observed don t want anything to do with their old folk but harold s not like that and harold had certainly made his way up king s scout 12 proficiency badges scholarship to secondary school captain of the school exhibition at jesus college oxford first class degree in politics philosophy and economics winner of the gladstone memorial prize and webb medley scholarship fellow of university college and assistant to beveridge civil servant in the war cabinet secretariat head of statistics and economics at the ministry of fuel and power and all this by the age of 29 wilson had political ambitions and became candidate for ormskirk which he won back for labour in 1945 before he had seen parliament in action he found himself parliamentary secretary of the ministry of works two years later attlee took him into the cabinet as president of the board of trade a complex department with a bureaucracy 14 000 strong in the house of commons he made a poor show head down in a departmental brief he would rush through his speeches dealing nervously with the barbed interruptions of brendan bracken and oliver lyttelton yet in the department he was most efficient he was at the heart of the labour government s effort to put britain on a sound post war footing no matter what it might cost in popularity it suited his puritan nature wilson enthusiastically rationed raw materials and clothes longer than was necessary and manipulated controls to restrict consumption and stimulate exports rationing by decree became the new socialist orthodoxy rationing by the purse was wicked capitalism the only popular gesture he allowed himself was a refusal to discourage dior s new look which used more cloth than the prevailing fashion we can t dictate what length women shall wear their skirts he said but he made himself a laughing stock by speaking of the bootless children of his youth what he really said was never established wilson s version was that he said the boys had to have clogs instead of boots some believed that he had claimed to be a barefoot boy himself for years press and politicians taunted him about barefoot children if he was barefoot harold macmillan said it was because he was too big for his boots wilson stood for the restrictive controlling bureaucratic side of the 1945 government but what was in his mind in the months before his resignation in 1951 labour had been returned the previous year with a small majority and could not last long attlee was unwell cripps was ill and had had to retire and ernie bevin was dying the top leadership was fading away who would take their place cripps successor as chancellor of the exchequer was hugh gaitskell and wilson would have been less than human if he had not been jealous of another economist coming into the cabinet over his head when gaitskell at the behest of the americans decided to finance a heavy programme of rearmament was it envy and ambition that motivated wilson to oppose it or was it simply that as a good chief of the board of trade he had to warn the cabinet that the programme was impossible and that his own department could not procure all the raw materials needed certainly he was not personally piqued as was aneurin bevan the leader of the revolt by gaitskell s insistence on diluting the national health service by levying charges for false teeth and spectacles one must remember that though wilson was by this time a mature cabinet minister he was still an inexperienced politician who had been sheltered from the politics of rivalry and ambition by his giant department did he think that soon when labour had fought and lost the election bevan would replace attlee as leader and he wilson would be number two it was long years in opposition that allowed wilson to make himself into a politician a potential leader and a brilliant house of commons orator and wit bevan gave him the clue cut out the boring detail wilson studied bevan s methods and elected to labour s front bench he made his attacks on tory budgets a joyful annual event noting the change in imagery when macmillan succeeded butler as chancellor he said that butler s had been equestrian and horticultural curbing the spirited horses and pruning the roses while macmillan had gone to the electrician to describe the blowing of fuses and the pulling out of plugs rarely commented the unfriendly daily telegraph has the clown been played to such effect when the tories subsidised industry wilson described the treasury as a public assistance board for mendicant capitalists and when they decided to tax compensation paid to company directors the tory benches looked to him like a collection of st bernards that had lost their brandy macmillan took a connoisseur s delight in wilson taunts but when macmillan became prime minister and claimed to draw on the heritage of both gladstone and disraeli he did not enjoy wilson s jibe he has inherited the streak of charlatanry in disraeli but without his vision and the streak of self righteousness in gladstone without his dedication to principle for many years after labour s defeat in 1951 there was bitter strife in the party between fundamental socialists with bevan at their head and the revisionists led by morrison and gaitskell who did not believe that the new social and political reality went with the traditional total commitment to socialism many people in the party and wilson was one of them stood between the two camps or had a foot in both of them in later years wilson claimed that he was never a bevanite simply a co belligerent with bevan sharing a place in the wilderness but there was more to it than that wilson appeared on tribune brains trusts and was popularly regarded as one of bevan s lieutenants that is why he was elected to the constituency section of the national executive his status depended not only on his intellect and on his reputation as a minister but on the support of the left when bevan resigned from the shadow cabinet because of disagreement with the policy on german rearmament wilson as runner up in the last election automatically inherited his place bevan demanded that he resign at once and when he refused warned him you ll lose your seat on the executive not so wilson said i ll come top so he did he had learnt to show conference as much sport in tory bashing as bevan himself could though he made the journey to the socialist promised land seem longer and more arduous wilson lost nothing of his standing in the party though he did in the country by hinting that oliver poole the tory deputy chairman was somehow connected with a leak in the city about an impending change in the bank rate a tribunal of inquiry showed there was nothing in it and wilson humiliated yet defiant narrowly avoided disaster in a 90 minute speech in the commons with his back to the wall he was at his best his capacity for equivocation or compromise reached new heights after the loss of the 1959 election a loss for which he shared responsibility with gaitskell by an unconvincing claim that labour s plans for a better britain could be financed out of increased production without putting up taxation gaitskell now wanted to amend clause iv of the party s constitution wilson was not a fundamentalist but he argued that the clause represented the central myth of the party and so should be kept as it was the conflict was defused but then moved to defence the executive had come to believe like some non socialists such as selwyn lloyd that a country of britain s size could not be an independent nuclear power that britain must leave the provision of the western strategic deterrent to the united states the argument was really about britain s continuance in nato with its nuclear strategy and it was against neutralism that gaitskell promised to fight fight and fight again when conference rejected a defence policy based on the threat of nuclear force wilson did not differ from gaitskell on policy but believed that the parliamentary party while elected on a policy of nuclear defence could yet not frontally oppose the conference decision gaitskell thought wilson ought to come up with a new policy reconciling the contradictory positions the party leader was being confrontational again and so as wilson put it in the interests of unity he decided to run against him for the leadership he knew he would lose but he said he could do no other this was not merely a moral position the left led by frank cousins told him that if he did not run they would drop him for ever wilson got fewer than half the votes and lost the sympathy of many of his non left admirers gaitskell s prestige was at its highest when he won conference back on defence and united the labour movement solidly behind him in his sceptical approach of bearing he had gravitas and was valiant for truth the hero in politics beside him wilson looked a devious anti hero who had no real friends or followers who was regarded with suspicion on the left and dubiety on the right yet when gaitskell died in january 1963 wilson headed the first leadership poll with 115 votes brown got 88 callaghan 41 in the second round with callaghan eliminated wilson got 144 brown 103 he never forgot that more than half the party had rejected him on the first round and that he would always have to watch his back wilson was 47 from the start he was not merely an able but also a surprisingly agreeable leader the media always hungry for personalia built him up and the public began to respond as they saw on their television screens this homely pipe smoking classless man who resembled a good family doctor everything went his way he flew to the united states and met the glamorous john f kennedy who was in the same fashionable age group he went to moscow had several meetings with khrushchev and discussed a test ban treaty the economy at home in which people had recently never had it so good was in trouble and super mac s image was tarnished first by the vassall and then by the profumo scandals wilson perhaps warned by his bank rate fiasco played the situation with impeccable caution he left the dirty work to others in the sixties the public was in an anti establishment mood and the desire for a more permissive society was part of it satire came to television through that was the week that was and private eye was founded macmillan was depicted as an elderly languid aristocrat left over from the edwardian era and sir alec douglas home who succeeded him had to confess that only with the aid of matches could he understand economics wilson was the beneficiary of the new mood wilson made no attempt to change gaitskell s policy indeed he himself had been the principal author of the economic section of signposts for the sixties which visualised harnessing socialism to science and science to socialism in his speech at the scarborough conference in 1963 wilson created a new political language much to the taste of younger educated people here at last was the politician who understood the new age of automation and the computer who would bring science and economic planning together in order to effect a structural change in british industry there was an unforgettable sentence the britain that is going to be forged in the white heat of this revolution will be no place for restrictive practices or outdated methods on either side of industry later he made a patriotic appeal for a new britain whose motivation is not private profit but national effort and national purpose a britain not backward looking though proud of its past and willing to discover the true traditions of our nation as a guide to our role in the future wilson went into the election with all the authority that gaitskell would have had if he had lived wilson s first term as prime minister might have been judged more generously had he not aroused such high expectations he was 48 when he entered no 10 the youngest prime minister since rosebery and at the height of his powers only two years before he had been an also ran and now he was leader of his party and leader of the nation too his zest for office overflowed labour had been in the wilderness for 13 years and now he had led them to the promised land he had however a majority of only five and would soon have to fight another election he resolved to carry out his programme until he was stopped or was ready to face the electors his cabinet lacked governmental experience but was rich in intellect nine members like him were graduates of oxford only eight of the 23 had not been to university and they included his two rivals for the leadership brown and callaghan the parliamentary party had changed half its members were graduates both brown and callaghan were men of the centre right with strong bases in the labour movement useful minds and a high temperament each was ready to fight his corner and wilson must have known that trouble was ahead as brown s department of economic affairs had been set up to prevent callaghan s treasury from stifling demand led growth brown was to evolve a national plan for an annual economic growth of 4 per cent and negotiate a voluntary prices and incomes policy to make it feasible and wilson created a ministry of technology to stimulate science based industries and the computer revolution he had foreshadowed at scarborough then wilson and his lieutenants were shown the treasury books which revealed there was an immediate crisis a record and rapidly increasing balance of payments deficit which carried an incipient threat to sterling wilson re enters downing street in march 1974 getty for the next four years wilson was struggling desperately to balance the books and protect the parity of the pound his aim was to win through to surplus and independence to steady growth based on full employment to the high wage economy and wilson said these objectives could not be reached without great risk until a strong balance of payments could be assured why did he not devalue the pound the moment he uncovered his bitter legacy the question was still being asked 20 years after the world expected a labour government to devalue rather than to deflate wilson s answer was that to devalue may have made economic sense but was full of political danger he knew from his days in attlee s government how long it takes a devaluation to restore the balance and what unpopular things must be done to counter its inflationary effects he feared too that instant devaluation would cause speculators to gamble dangerously on his doing it again when the going looked rough and wilson was anxious too to prove that labour was not financially irresponsible treasury bank and city were against devaluation and he did not want to risk upsetting the other world currency the dollar a few days before his populist friend president lyndon johnson had to face his electors the alternative to devaluation was to impose a 15 per cent surcharge and risk the wrath of efta he refused the advice of the earl of cromer governor of the bank of england to deflate heavily and said it was outrageous that a labour government should have to change policies for which it had won democratic consent at the behest of foreign speculators he threatened he would fight and win an election on that theme lord cromer pointed out that the pound would have gone long before polling day but agreed to set about raising a loan from the central banks anxious to avoid the monetary chaos which would follow a failing pound and wilson got away with it all economic policy was designed to achieve re election and to keep the party sweet these were his best years he looked omnicompetent by early 1966 the country had come to believe that wilson had proved himself a moderate and decisive prime minister and returned him to power with a majority of 97 seats the tories were so impressed that they discarded alec douglas home and chose as their new leader wilson s conservative clone edward heath from 1966 to 1970 wilson was to plunge from crisis to crisis after the election the balance of payments was still threatening earnings were increasing by almost 10 per cent and the seamen were on strike in the july 1966 crisis wilson again turned down devaluation and heavily deflated for the next two or three years he ran through the gamut of deflationary measures wage and price freezes special deposits hire purchase restrictions foreign currency rationing use of the regulator to increase sumptuary taxes plus of course cuts in public expenditure there were groans from old labour party stalwarts and from not so old labour mps he had to legislate to try to break the wage price spiral and in the end was driven to try to legislate against wildcat strikes on the way wilson first lost george brown from the dea brown saw that deflation increased unemployment and the use of incomes policy as a crisis measure had wrecked his national plan he stayed to put through a prices and incomes bill which provided a 12 month price freeze and a six month wage freeze to be followed by six months of restraint wilson persuaded brown to stay in government only by offering him the foreign office even then brown resigned before the end of the parliament because he did not like the way wilson ran the government wilson lost callaghan in 1967 when devaluation could no longer be avoided wilson persuaded callaghan to accept the home office and appointed roy jenkins as chancellor to carry out the deflation made necessary by devaluation in two years of hard slog the party groaned under the postponement of the higher school leaving age and the return of prescription charges a prices and incomes policy creating a 3 5 per cent ceiling was met with labour abstentions in the commons and rejected by the tuc and the labour party wilson said the government must govern the economy was still being damaged by wildcat strikes and under his tutelage barbara castle produced the white paper in place of strife which proposed allowing the minister to impose a 28 day stoppage to insist on a ballot before an official strike and to set up an official board that would impose penalties on defaulters the unions reacted with horror the parliamentary labour party was appalled one by one the cabinet dissociated themselves and wilson and castle stood alone for the policy the chief whip and the chairman of the parliamentary party warned wilson that he could not get the bill through and he dropped it in return for a solemn and binding pledge from the tuc to do what they could wilson might well have been ousted after this in favour of callaghan who had opposed the policy as a member of the party executive a number of members however hoped that jenkins would be the next leader and jenkins had originally welcomed the new policy the antagonism of the rival supporters preserved wilson but he was never the glad confident wilson again the economic battle and the crises overseas obscured even from the party the traditional good works wilson had carried through there was some transfer of wealth to the poor pensions and family allowances were increased and a scheme for redundancy payments introduced more resources were found for education and health dock labour was decasualised and 400 000 houses were built each year money was found for the arts and for sport and women were to benefit from the equal pay act wilson used to claim that his best achievement was the creation of the open university if it had been less controversial in the party he could have boasted of his historic role of restarting the process which was to make britain a member of the european economic community and of keeping britain in the community when it might have come out after labour s return to power in 1974 wilson s political skills were at their height in dealing with the european question there was a strong feeling in the party against the whole idea the left believed that the community wanted to keep west europe divided from east europe for the foreseeable future and even some fabians and revisionists saw the community as a rich man s club led by free enterprise conservatives who would prevent britain from following the path to socialist planning wilson s prestige after the election of 1966 enabled him to say in the queen s speech that he would try to negotiate entry the first two years of government taught him that he needed wider markets particularly for aircraft and computers and greater financial resources he began by taking george brown on a round of european visits he addressed the assembly of the council of europe he had remarkable talks in depth with de gaulle in a meeting at chequers he got the cabinet to agree to renew britain s application but de gaulle finally said no troubled by wilson s atlanticism and the role of sterling while government and party were agonising about the economic drama they were further disturbed and divided by overseas crises playing a world role appealed to wilson s histrionic side and some thought to his vanity indeed they believed that external events distracted his attention from the economic problems yet these events were big enough and dangerous enough to demand a prime minister s intervention from the beginning of his regime to the end wilson had to face the problems of rhodesia and vietnam then in 1968 britain became involved in the nigerian civil war and a year later events in northern ireland took a tragic turn the cornerstone of wilson s foreign policy was to sustain a close if not a special relationship with president johnson the old populist who headed the world s most powerful economy and was sympathetic to many of labour s social aims johnson wanted wilson to give at least token military support in vietnam but there was a strong desire in the labour movement for wilson to denounce the war wilson played it down the middle giving johnson diplomatic support though unable to accept the bombing of hanoi he and alexei kosygin were co chairmen of the geneva conference which had been put together years before to preserve the independence of vietnam thus he had a duty to conciliate the reaction of the party to the nigerian civil war was even more emotional the republic of biafra had broken away from the federation of nigeria in a complex regional and tribal struggle involving nigeria s oil wilson supported the government of the federation which britain had created and whose integrity was accepted by the commonwealth and he continued britain s custom of supplying that government with arms arguing that if we did not do so the soviet union s influence in the area would supplant britain s wilson only narrowly got his policies through cabinet and would not have done so without the stout support of the foreign secretary michael stewart who was ready to resign biafran students lit a bonfire in downing street called for wilson and tried to burst in through the door of no 10 wilson s predecessor sir alec douglas home had told ian smith rhodesia s prime minister that he could not win independence unless it was the wish of a vast majority of the population which consisted of 4 million blacks and about a quarter of a million whites when smith refused to come to london wilson warned him that a unilateral declaration of independence would be a rebellion against the crown the two did meet in london in salisbury and in the warships fearless and tiger off gibraltar wilson sent out high official and imaginative unofficial missions smith would raise their hopes but never gratify them even though wilson s final offer came dangerously close to giving smith all he could hope to get from any government the northern ireland troubles began ironically with an easing of tension as terence o neill the most liberal prime minister the province had ever had engaged in friendly talks with premier lemass of the republic wilson encouraged o neill in a programme of reforms concerning the allocation of public service jobs and houses which the civil rights movement was demanding for the underprivileged roman catholics it looked at one time as though there was going to be a miracle in ulster but o neill had difficulty with his colleagues and when his fight came to an end the demonstrations and riots reached such a pitch of violence that the police were exhausted and wilson and callaghan now home secretary had to bring in the army to keep the peace they hoped that firmness and fairness would still the quarrel and that the army would be able to return after a month or two though they had been welcomed as protectors by the catholics opinion changed some of wilson s supporters joined the catholics in their call for troops out in 1968 the chances of labour s surviving the next election looked slim indeed in the opinion polls the party sank as low as 21 per cent of the vote and remained in the twenties until september 1969 the by election results were disastrous the cabinet was quarrelsome and as the gap between ideology and necessity widened some contemplated resignation but thought better of it but wilson never lost hope in public at least successes were always just around the corner and some found his optimism hard to bear political correspondents who had found him the most approachable and frank of prime ministers were disenchanted by his failing predictions his appearances on television once so competent now seemed glib and specious wilson suspected with some justification that plots were being hatched against him in may 1968 cecil king chairman of the mirror group and wilson s only support in the popular press turned on him and wrote britain is threatened with the greatest financial crisis in history it is not to be removed by lies about our reserves but only by a fresh start under a fresh leader his attack did wilson no harm and a fortnight later the mirror directors unanimously agreed that king must go at once at long last the deflation and devaluation began to work and in autumn 1969 the party passed the 30 per cent mark in the opinion polls by may 1970 labour was ahead of the conservatives and wilson decided to go to the country his popularity was always higher than that of the party particularly in the provinces and he fought the election largely as a personal fight as if he were a presidential candidate the moment the first results appeared wilson knew he was doomed and ordered the removal vans for no 10 next morning he began to plot the memoirs which would earn the funds the party did not provide to run the leader s office wilson found himself prime minister again in march 1974 in circumstances as difficult as those which had faced him 10 years before true the pound had been floated and he no longer had the sterling area round his neck but now he headed a minority government that might be brought down within days and he had inherited an economic crisis aggravated by a four fold increase in the price of oil there was a state of emergency the miners threat to energy supplies had caused heath to put the nation on a three day week more than 2 million were out of work inflation was at its highest there was a vast deficit on the balance of payments it was a less buoyant wilson who now went back to no 10 after the shock of his unexpected defeat in 1970 he had buried his head for 12 months in his 400 000 word account of 1964 70 he regained party confidence only after a masterly attempt to deal with the northern irish problem which included secret meetings with the untouchable ira his leadership ceased to be questionable and he came to no 10 with 14 members of his previous cabinet available for office his 1974 style was so different that people wondered whether he was ill but he explained to labour mps that with the inexperienced cabinet of 1964 he had had to occupy every position on the field goalkeeper defence attack but now he could be a deep lying centre half concentrating on defence and initiating attacks what he did not say was that he would resign the captaincy and leave the field before half time wilson decided that audacity was the only practical policy first he got the tuc and the cbi to agree that they would co operate with the government to bring the coal dispute to an end the cabinet then sanctioned the terms for settlement he had advocated in the election and he was able to announce within 50 hours of going to buckingham palace to discuss the forming of a government that the solution had been found the next day he brought the state of emergency to an end the queen s speech made eight days after labour had taken office covered labour s commitments for a full parliament heath threatened to defeat the government but withdrew after wilson had warned him that he would do so at his electoral peril the past hung heavily on wilson many in the party felt that the previous labour government had been too pragmatic and had neglected its ties with the unions wilson had been more like a tory prime minister than a socialist one labour came to office in 1974 committed against the statutory control of incomes but hoping the unions would be moderate to get their goodwill and encourage them to accept some responsibility for the level of wage increases an understanding had been reached in opposition that there would be a social contract not only would a labour government repeal heath s industrial relations act and end legal wages restraint it would also take action against price increases and seriously attack social inequalities having been defeated 20 times on important amendments wilson decided to go to the country in october and he won the election though with an overall majority of only three yet he was in less danger than he seemed since the opposition parties could rarely co operate against him more worrying for him was the parliamentary labour party riven by differences on domestic policies and the common market the quadrupling of the price of oil had helped to create a new and little understood phenomenon an inflationary recession that could not be cured simply by increasing public expenditure as the party activists were demanding on the contrary there would have to be cuts and it was essential to check domestic inflation one man s pay rise was another man s job loss as wilson put it wilson was warned by all the authorities that the pound might go and it was essential to have a legally imposed incomes policy the tuc guidelines on pay were not being observed by all unions in the first 12 months of the new government the wage index rose by 33 and the rpi by 21 wilson used all his goodwill to warn the unions that unless a voluntary policy near the guidelines was followed there would be more unemployment and lower living standards the solution was surprisingly found by jack jones the left wing leader of the transport and general workers union who got a divided general council to accept a practical proposal of a flat rate increase of more than 6 which was compatible with an inflation target of 10 per cent would the miners accept it wilson went to their conference and made a patriotic appeal what the government has the right to ask the duty to ask he said is a year not for self but a year for britain would the unions really stick by the 6 wilson closed the credibility gap by saying that if anybody stepped out of line the government would take reserve powers to apply legal restraints not on workers but on employers wizardry said the times and the guardian wilson had come to office with the party opposed to the terms of britain s entry to the common market and a commitment to renegotiate them the people could decide by ballot whether they then wished britain to remain a member in all my 13 years as leader wilson afterwards said i had no more difficult task than keeping the party together on this issue twice he had to threaten resignation to keep the national executive in line the renegotiation achieved more than was then obvious not only was britain awarded a surprisingly generous share of the new regional fund but an agreement was reached to operate a corrective mechanism if britain s budgetary contributions got too far out of line with its relative gnp it provided a basis from which later mrs thatcher could make her uninhibited demands wilson was ready to claim success and recommend acceptance but some ministers were irreconcilable he therefore proposed the extraordinary solution that dissident ministers could campaign in the country though not at westminster for a no vote in march wilson got the cabinet to recommend a yes vote but next month a special meeting of the party conference rejected the terms by two to one in the campaign foot benn and barbara castle fought hard for rejection but in the referendum it was the yes side that got twice as many votes as the nos the left was humiliated in march 1976 wilson shocked almost everybody by his announcement that he was about to retire he was 60 and had had enough all the old problems of the nation and the party were still there and he had no new and feasible solution for them he would rather people asked why did he go rather than why did he stay the view commonly taken of wilson as prime minister may seem to historians to be too harsh after all complete economic success eluded every other post war government his classic error was thought to be his refusal to devalue the pound until he could hold out no longer but as samuel brittan wrote on wilson s retirement in 1976 early devaluation would not have avoided the conflict between traditional full employment objectives the strike threat system and maintaining a usable currency both in 1964 and 1974 wilson came to office at a time of economic crisis and as he was without a working majority had to improvise until he could fight another election and increase his strength part of the disappointment in his subsequent performance was that he aroused too high hopes of a golden future once labour had replaced the conservatives but his freedom to deal with the endemic problems of the balance of payments was restricted by the socialist myth which made conventional remedies appear to be attempts to make capitalism work by the recurring strife between the left and right wings of the party and by the party s dependence on a trade union movement which wanted to influence policy but could not play a sustained role in managing the economy the month after he resigned the queen appointed wilson to the order of the garter his own resignation honours list was deplored by his friends and ridiculed by his foes wilson maintained that the list was his and his alone and that baroness falkender as his political secretary mrs williams had become in 1974 denied the allegations that it was her list marcia williams served wilson for many years there was never a shred of evidence for the gossip about their relationship some members of wilson s kitchen cabinet found her difficult and she them but too much was made of it wilson remained an mp presiding over a committee that reviewed the city s financial institutions writing his memoirs and making an occasional lecture tour he survived after two operations for cancer in 1979 he became lord wilson of rievaulx he played little part in the work of the house of lords but voted dutifully after the age of 70 his memory began to fail and though his wit could sparkle on some days on others he was deeply withdrawn and he sadly failed to acknowledge old friends harold wilson baron wilson of rievaulx british prime minister born 11 march 1916 died 24 may 1995 lord beavan died in 1994

by lucia mutikani washington reuters u s economic growth accelerated in the first quarter but the burst in growth was driven by a smaller trade deficit and the largest accumulation of unsold merchandise since 2015 temporary boosters that are seen weighing on the economy later this year the surge in growth reported by the commerce department on friday put to rest fears of a recession that were stoked by a brief inversion of the u s treasury yield curve in march but it also exaggerates the health of the economy as consumer and business spending slowed sharply and investment in homebuilding contracted for a fifth straight quarter gross domestic product increased at a 3 2 percent annualized rate in the first quarter the government said in its advance gdp report growth was also driven by increased investment in roads by local and state governments the gain in first quarter gdp would seem to make a mockery of claims that the u s economy is slowing as the fiscal stimulus fades said paul ashworth chief u s economist at capital economics in toronto looking beyond the headline number however there are plenty of causes for concern the economy grew at a 2 2 percent pace in the october december period economists polled by reuters had forecast gdp increasing at a 2 0 percent rate in the first three months of the year the economy will mark 10 years of expansion in july the longest on record president donald trump cheered the economy s performance in the first quarter this is far above expectations or projections trump tweeted the white house has sought to boost growth through an array of policies including a 1 5 trillion tax cut package passed in december 2017 economists believe the fiscal stimulus which also included more government spending peaked in the third quarter they expect gdp to slow this year with annual growth forecast around 2 5 percent below the trump s administration s 3 percent target the economy missed the growth target in 2018 excluding trade inventories and government spending the economy grew at only a 1 3 percent rate in the first quarter the slowest since the second quarter of 2013 this measure of domestic demand increased at a 2 6 percent pace in the october december quarter a gauge of inflation tracked by the federal reserve increased at a 1 3 percent rate last quarter fed policymakers are likely to shrug off the last quarter s growth spurt and focus on the weak domestic demand and inflation when they meet next week the u s central bank recently suspended its three year monetary policy tightening campaign dropping forecasts for any interest rate increases this year the fed raised borrowing costs four times in 2018 the fed will focus on the composition of growth which points to a slowing trend amid softening inflation said joe brusuelas chief economist at rsm in new york this data reinforces the prudent pause the fed is engaged in the dollar dropped against a basket of currencies as investors fretted over the weak details of the gdp report u s treasury prices rose while stocks on wall street were mixed business spending stalls exports surged and imports declined in the first quarter leading to a small deficit that added 1 03 percentage points to gdp after being neutral in the fourth quarter trade tensions between the united states and china have caused wild swings in the trade deficit with exporters and importers trying to stay ahead of the tariff fight between the two economic giants the standoff has also had an impact on inventories which increased at a 128 4 billion rate in the first quarter the strongest pace since the second quarter of 2015 inventories increased at a 96 8 billion pace in the october december quarter part of the inventory build was because of weak demand especially in the automotive sector which is expected to weigh on future production at factories inventories contributed 0 65 percentage point to first quarter gdp after adding one tenth of a percentage point in the october december period growth in consumer spending which accounts for more than two thirds of u s economic activity slowed to a 1 2 percent rate from the fourth quarter s 2 5 percent rate the moderation in spending reflected a decline in motor vehicle purchases and other goods likely related to a 35 day shutdown of the federal government there was also a slowdown in spending on services the government said the shutdown had subtracted three tenths of a percentage point from gdp last quarter retail sales have since rebounded strongly pointing to some acceleration in consumption in the second quarter momentum in consumer spending picked up toward the end of the first quarter which augurs well for a better consumption outcome in the second quarter said michael feroli an economist at jpmorgan in new york even so we continue to expect gdp growth to step down to a 2 25 percent pace in second quarter business spending on equipment braked sharply rising at only at a 0 2 percent rate the slowest since the third quarter of 2016 spending was held down by weak outlays on agricultural machinery and office furniture investment in structures contracted for a third straight quarter residential construction fell at a 2 8 percent rate marking the fifth straight quarterly decline government investment rebounded at a 2 4 percent rate driven by spending at state and local governments federal government spending was flat reporting by lucia mutikani editing by paul simao
bengaluru major central banks are done tightening policy according to a majority of economists polled by reuters with the growth outlook wilting across developed and emerging economies along with scant prospects for a surge in inflation while that is largely reflected in bond markets with major sovereign bond yields falling this year global equities have rallied and the s p 500 index is near record highs after its best start this year in more than three decades one striking conclusion from the latest surveys of over 500 economists from around the world covering more than 40 economies was not just a toning down of the economic outlook but a clear shift away from long held optimistic views although economists who answered an additional question were split on whether a deeper global economic downturn was more likely than a synchronised rebound this year s growth outlook was downgraded or left unchanged for 38 of the countries polled the recent weakness of global growth will persist for much longer than is commonly assumed a dovish turn by central banks and stimulus in china will not be enough to boost world gdp growth from its current slow pace noted jennifer mckeown head of global economics at capital economics disappointing economic performance will leave inflation very low and cause monetary policy to be loosened almost across the board but we do not see this prompting any meaningful recovery until 2021 global growth was forecast to average 3 4 this year the lowest since polling began for 2019 almost two years ago the most optimistic prediction was also more modest than at the start of the year the 2020 forecast held at 3 4 the joint lowest since reuters began polling on it however the 2019 consensus was a touch higher than the international monetary fund s latest view of 3 3 the risk of an escalation of the us china trade war and prospects of britain exiting the european union without a deal two of the more prominent threats that initially drove the current slowdown have eased yet most major central banks have been hinting at a move away from hiking rates and nearly 60 of more than 200 economists who answered a separate question said they were confident the global tightening cycle was over on thursday the bank of japan dispelled any doubt about its commitment to ultra loose policies and sweden s central bank said a forecast interest rate hike would come slightly later than it had planned the us federal reserve is done raising rates until at least the end of next year with about a third of economists polled predicting at least one rate cut by then with euro zone economic growth and inflation prospects dimming the european central bank ecb may have missed its opportunity to raise rates before the next downturn the ecb blames the euro zone weakness on a slowdown in china and concerns about the trade war the fed meanwhile pointed the finger to europe and china as the main drags on us growth but with everyone looking across the border for a scapegoat someone must inevitably be watching the wrong space noted elwin de groot head of macro strategy at rabobank one could speculate that the central banks are pointing the finger just because they have little confidence that their actions are effective growth forecasts for developed economies including germany france italy spain britain japan australia the united states and canada for this year and next weakened it was not very different for emerging market economies despite efforts from policy makers to boost sluggish growth economic growth in major economies from asia to africa to latin america was predicted to lose more momentum although india is still expected to be the fastest growing major economy growth predictions were lowered compared with the previous poll looser fiscal and monetary policy should help to cushion the impact of weaker export demand on growth in emerging asia nevertheless regional growth this year is still likely to slow to its weakest rate in a decade added capital economics ms mckeown reuters
spurred on by the global justice movement of the late 1990s and the u s invasions and occupations of afghanistan and iraq marxists like david harvey and ellen meiksins wood have produced a flowering of theorization about capitalism and imperialism author william i robinson has been a key contributor to this new body of work in particular with his books a theory of global capitalism and global capitalism and the crisis of humanity his latest collection of essays into the tempest essays on the new global capitalism is a provocative and accessible summary of his argument that globalization which he calls the master process of our age has ushered in a new epoch of capitalism he contends that this epoch was born out of the global recession the system underwent in the 1970s up until then capitalism was a world economy divided up into hierarchically organized national economies dominated by great imperial powers like the u s to overcome the recession corporations broke out of that national framework in search of cheap labor resources and markets over the subsequent decades transnational corporations established a new global system of production finance and services in the process robinson argues a new fraction of capital emerged a transnational capitalist class that is not tied to any particular nation state their corporations run global assembly lines their boards are made up of executives from many different countries and they advocate common ideologies and policies of neoliberal globalization this fraction of capital according to robinson has created an emergent transnational capitalist state comprised of two components one international institutions like the international monetary fund the world bank the world trade organization and the united nations and two the majority of the world s nation states over which the transnational capitalist class has won hegemony he contends that the development of this new class and its new state has invalidated the classical marxist theory of imperialism developed by marxist theorists and russian revolutionaries including rudolf hilferding rosa luxemburg vladimir lenin and nikolai bukharin among others they predicted that the great powers were driven by competing interests toward rivalry and war or the division and re division of the world while robinson notes that the classical marxists ideas were accurate accounts of world capitalism in their time he argues that they can no longer explain contemporary global capitalism today the transnational capitalist class has brought an end to the tendency toward inter imperial rivalry between great powers the axis of conflict within the world system is between the 1 percent and its accomplices in the professional middle class and the 80 percent laboring majority moreover the capitalist classes of the global south have also bought into globalization and benefited from it therefore he makes the case that brazil russia india china and south africa offer neither an alternative path of development in the interests of the global south nor even a challenge to neoliberalism they are now in fact accomplices in generalizing the logic of free trade globalization a new axis of conflict thus the central axis of conflict within the world system is neither between dominant nation states nor between them and oppressed nations in the developing world but between the transnational capitalist class and the transnational working class put another way this is a conflict between the world s 20 percent the 1 percent and its accomplices in the professional middle class and the 80 percent laboring majority the conditions for this global working class are getting dramatically worse in the global north several decades of neoliberalism have driven wages down busted unions and dismantled welfare state programs introducing unprecedented precarity in the global south capitalism has plundered whole regions dispossessing peasants of their land and driving them to become migrants in search of jobs in the megacities of their home countries or to become criminalized laboring migrants deprived of the most basic human rights in advanced capitalist countries whole chunks of the population which robinson calls supernumeraries can t even find employment but sit on the margins of society in desperate poverty faced with this discontented mass of workers the transnational capitalist class uses the classic strategy of all rulers divide and conquer to pit the masses against one another they use their immigration laws to set citizens against noncitizens in what robinson calls a new rigid caste system they have also intensified and institutionalized racism islamophobia and other forms of bigotry to further split up workers and they have ramped up sexism through neoliberalism s privatized system of social reproduction which places ever more burdens on women in the home and restrictions and rollbacks on rights to everything from abortion to affirmative action but all of this has failed to stabilize the system as robinson demonstrates global capitalism has entered an epochal crisis triggered by the great recession our rulers got out of that downturn by imposing brutal austerity measures on workers throughout the world making their lives even more precarious so far the global right has gained the most ground offering authoritarian scapegoating of oppressed groups as false solutions to real grievances they launched these attacks in the hopes of triggering a new boom but they have failed the system remains mired in what professor and author david mcnally calls a global slump characterized by low rates of growth state and corporate debt and shrinking consumer demand even worse there are now signs of yet another crisis accumulating throughout the world on top of all this the system has disrupted the global climate threatening all of human society and our ecosphere it is creating superstorms exacerbating economic and social inequality and generating new waves of climate refugees fleeing natural disasters and rising sea levels all of these developments have thrown the system its states and the parties that rule them into a profound crisis of legitimacy in turn the masses of the world have radicalized staging many struggles from the arab spring to the occupy movement in the u s and in the process have turned to both the left and the right in search of alternatives to the wretched status quo so far the global right has gained the most ground offering authoritarian scapegoating of oppressed groups especially migrants as false and brutal solutions to real grievances most ominously it has opened the door to what robinson calls 21st century fascism robinson contrasts the right s success with the left which has so far failed to provide an alternative way forward social democracy as he notes long ago rejected the need for revolutionary change by backing their own imperialist states and embracing neoliberalism just think of new labour in the u k under tony blair he advanced capital s program of neoliberal restructuring of the british economy and he supported and indeed trumpeted george w bush s invasions and occupations of afghanistan and iraq robinson also points out that alternatives to social democracy also remain limited non governmental organizations remain tied to their capitalist donors which limits the reforms they can advocate to only the most superficial changes to the system and the revolutionary left is far too small and scarred either by its past association with authoritarian regimes or its sectarian habits defending the marxist theory of imperialism robinson s account of the world system today and the tasks of the new socialist movement are insightful and invaluable but his dismissal of the classical marxist theory of imperialism is overstated this theory offers key insights that help explain the existence and indeed intensification of geopolitical conflicts in our world today exemplified most clearly between the u s and china rivalry persists for three key reasons first as russian bolshevik bukharin argued in imperialism and world economy capitalism produces two tendencies one toward internationalization and another toward national concentration and in some cases fusion with a home state in the form of state capitalism which of these two dominate and their interrelationship or conflict have varied over different epochs trump s america first foreign policy is only the most recent and most extreme formulation of this ruling class consensus for example during the age of classical imperialism from the end of the 19th century through world war ii the dominant tendency was toward national concentration imperial powers competed with one another for the division and re division of the world system in the interests of their corporations since the 1970s the dominant tendency has been internationalization but not to the exclusion of national concentration indeed most multinational corporations however much they incorporate executives from various nations on their boards of directors remain based in a home nation state with dense networks of association with other nationally based corporations and continue to use their home government to prosecute their interests in the world system just think of the close relationship between u s based multinational high tech firms like apple and google which however internationally oriented lean on washington to secure their interests in international negotiations over trade investment and intellectual property rights especially when faced with competition from china s state owned and state backed corporations second even in the epoch of globalization capitalism does not grow in even fashion and has not produced a homogeneous transnational capitalist class with shared interests instead the system is subject to what russian revolutionary leon trotsky called the law of uneven and combined development some sections of the world system develop earlier than others and those can later stagnate as new developers leap ahead combining the most advanced features of the system with archaic ones inherited from pre capitalist modes of production as a result capitalism does not generate a single and increasingly undifferentiated field as robinson argues but real and in some cases profound differences between capitalist nation states economies and ruling classes third because each section of the international capitalist class even those with multinational orientations remains tied to particular nation states they must win hegemony over the middle and oppressed classes in their societies this deepens the tendency for separate and particular configurations of capitalist classes their states and national politics as a result the system even in the epoch of globalization continues to produce geopolitical conflict and inter imperial rivalry still it would be absurd to argue that all of this plays out in the same manner that it did in lenin and luxemburg s time a nuanced look at imperialism s global evolution there are specific economic and geopolitical patterns to our period that grow out of the system s logic and its history classical imperialism gave way to global superpower imperialism during the cold war and after the collapse of the soviet union it in turn was replaced first by a moment of unipolar dominance by the u s and then after the rise of new centers of capital accumulation like china and others by a new asymmetric multipolar world order the u s remains the dominant capitalist power but it is no longer unrivaled it faces as the state managers of u s imperialism recognize a major potential superpower in the form of china as well as lesser regional antagonists like russia iran and so on at the same time given the economic integration wrought by globalization and the fact that all the world s main powers possess nuclear weapons and can therefore threaten mutually assured destruction in the event of armed conflict inter imperial rivalry today tends to be expressed as geopolitics and geo economics with great powers angling for advantage while trying to avoid military conflagration as robinson notes most armed conflict tends to be that of the u s policing the crisis torn sections of the world but it does not do so in pursuit of the common aims of a transnational capitalist class as he claims but in the interest of u s s hegemony over allies and against any potential rivals to prevent them from establishing positions of political and economic strength outside the orbit of washington the politicians and state managers that run u s imperialism have made this abundantly clear in countless national security documents which from the clinton administration on aim to lock in u s dominance especially over strategic resources like middle eastern oil and prevent the rise of a peer competitor especially china trump s america first foreign policy is only the most recent and most extreme formulation of this ruling class consensus thus the classical marxist theory of imperialism helps us understand why the u s and china are in conflict over everything from trade intellectual property rights islands and the strategic waterways in asia 5g technology and beijing s massive belt and road initiative it s also important as a guide to action for the new socialist movement to oppose not just global capitalism but also u s imperialism and its lesser rivals like china and russia these powers have found themselves on opposite sides in conflicts over popular revolts from below for example against regimes like bashar al assad s in syria russia iran and other states backed the assad regime against the masses while the u s tried to cynically manipulate the revolt for its own aims mainly to wipe out isis also known as daesh this reality puts the left in a position of having to take a stand on the policies of these rival imperial and sub imperial powers and on popular revolts in states outside the u s sphere of influence tragically many on the left sided with the assad regime russia and iran as a supposedly anti imperialist camp standing up to the u s and slandered the revolution as a color revolution orchestrated by washington no doubt robinson as an internationalist would oppose such campism and stand with popular revolts from below but because his theoretical framework downplays inter imperial rivalry it cannot help the left think through concrete questions like the different states positions on syria why they are in conflict and what stance the left should adopt toward them and the popular revolution for that we must return to correct develop and apply the insights of the classical marxist theory of imperialism my disagreements with robinson however should not obscure the strengths of his book it offers insightful analyses of the development of globalization the authoritarian turn of states throughout the world the brutal assault on migrants and the system s epochal economic and ecological crises lastly it holds forth the hope of building a new left across borders that can help lead a new international movement for reforms on the road to ecosocialism this book should be read discussed and debated as part of developing new and creative marxists determined to join that global struggle and help lead it to victory

president trump is heading into the thick of the 2020 reelection cycle with the strong breeze of a surging economy at his back the economy grew at an impressive 3 2 in the first quarter the first time in six years that growth in the january through march period topped 3 the burst was bolstered by rising exports falling imports and higher inventory spending america s future has never been brighter mr trump said at a campaign rally saturday night in green bay wisconsin yet the democrats those very friendly people in washington have never been angrier than they are today the combination of low inflation rising wages and near historic lows in unemployment could blunt the appeal for now of presidential challengers such as former vice president joseph r biden the democrat will hold his first big campaign event monday in pittsburgh to lay out his vision for rebuilding america s middle class his campaign said biden spokeswoman kate bedingfield said mr biden s ability to raise 6 3 million in the first 24 hours of his campaign last week shows that americans are ready in part for someone who can rebuild the middle class so everyone gets a fair shot but the republican national committee said the first quarter report is proof that the economy which grew 2 9 in 2018 isn t slowing down see also donald trump cheers economy criticizes democrats at wis rally when voters ask themselves in 2020 if they re better off now than they were four years ago the answer will be a resounding yes thanks to president trump and republican leadership said rnc spokesman michael joyce the economic performance following a disappointing growth rate of 2 2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year came out strong despite a partial government shutdown that slowed some business activity for the first 25 days of 2019 the commerce department estimated that without the shutdown first quarter growth would have been 3 5 economists who had predicted growth of 2 5 said the better than expected result is a positive sign for the rest of the year at the very least national association of manufacturers chief economist chad moutray said the economy s performance showed resilience in the face of slowing global growth the partial government shutdown trade policy uncertainties a strong u s dollar this was the strongest first quarter of growth since 2015 he said the u s economy should now expand by around 2 7 in 2019 an improvement from what i might have forecasted prior to this release economist joel naroff of holland pennsylvania said the first quarter growth does show that the economy is still in good shape and should remain that way for the rest of the year senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley iowa republican said the report shows that the u s economy under trump is still running on all cylinders the dow jones industrial average closed friday at 26 543 33 near its all time high there were fears that economic output could fall below 1 this year because of the combined impact of the trade war with china which white house officials say is nearing a resolution the precipitous decline in the stock market in december a global economic slowdown and the partial government shutdown that ended jan 25 but the u s economy bounced back aided by an announcement from the federal reserve that it is suspending plans for more interest rate hikes which were harshly criticized by mr trump and prompted his effort to appoint two non academics to the central bank s governing board while mr biden is arguing that the trump economy is leaving behind certain groups the president pointed out again saturday night that the unemployment rate has reached historic lows for women blacks hispanics and asian americans the president who champions tax cuts and fewer regulations said the first quarter report on gross domestic product smashed expectations our economy is now the hottest anywhere on the planet earth mr trump said however some economists see warning signs for 2020 mr naroff said there is a labor market bubble that will likely lead to rising wages rising prices and falling earnings unfortunately the wage gains will not be enough to overcome the increasing inflation and the increasing inflation will not be enough to offset slower demand domestically and globally he said there are more risks to the downside than the upside and that means a slowdown in 2020 if as i forecast the unemployment rate starts rising next spring and continues to do so through the fall the economy could become a major political issue megan greene global chief economist at manulife john hancock asset management said the first quarter report looks good until you look under the hood and kick the tires inventory buildup will have to be unwound which will drag on growth imports were weak everyone front ran the tariffs last year and spending was strong but rest of govt spending weak she tweeted former obama white house economic adviser jason furman said in a twitter post that the underlying data is much weaker and is consistent with a slowing economy consumer spending which makes up more than two thirds of economic output moderated to 1 2 growth in the first quarter spending on durable goods fell 5 3 the biggest drop in a decade led by a sharp decline in light truck sales some economists said the robust growth will renew pressure on the federal reserve to raise interest rates mr trump has criticized the fed for raising rates four times in 2018 saying it hurt growth in the fourth quarter and contributed to the stock market plummet in december the white house council of economic advisers said the gdp report likely underestimates the current pace of economic growth for the year because the first quarter is typically the slowest of the year it also said the full impact of the shutdown cannot be quantified and that factoring in those uncertainties implies an annual growth rate of 4 4 dave boyer can be reached at dboyer washingtontimes com
back in july 2005 the g8 summit at the gleneagles hotel in scotland announced a package of aid and debt relief for the world s poorest countries the event marked the high point of international development cooperation and was supposed to put the finances of low income nations on a permanent sustainable footing for a while optimism seemed well founded public debt for those countries that qualified for help dropped from an average of 100 of their annual income in the early 2000s to just over 30 by 2013 freeing up resources to spend on health education and infrastructure projects now warning signs are flashing that another debt crisis is approaching with concerns being raised not only by development campaign groups but by the international monetary fund and the world bank the imf says 40 of low income countries are either in debt distress or at high risk of being so the bank says debt in poor countries is a rising vulnerability explaining how the world came to be on the brink of debt crisis 2 0 is relatively simple it all began in the depths of the financial crisis just over a decade ago when the response to the threat of a second great depression led to interest rates being slashed to central banks boosting the supply of money through quantitative easing qe and to countries supporting growth through packages of tax cuts and public spending the biggest such fiscal package by far was announced by beijing and it was instrumental not only in turning round the chinese economy but also in hastening recovery elsewhere china s exceptionally high growth rates meant it needed oil industrial metals and raw materials and this was a boon to those developing countries rich in commodities commodity prices rose just as all the money created by qe was looking for a home investors had a choice they could plump for developed economies where growth and interest rates were low or they could be more daring and invest in emerging and developing countries where the risks and rewards were higher many opted for the latter course and as a result lending to low income countries increased sharply much of the lending was from the private sector rather than the multilateral organisations such as the world bank and so tended to be made at higher interest rates the commodity boom was actually a bubble and like all bubbles it burst poor countries assuming that the commodity boom would go on forever borrowed in foreign currencies sometimes the money was spent on projects designed to improve the growth capacity of their economies too often according to the world bank it was spent on current consumption however the commodity boom was actually a bubble and like all bubbles it burst poor countries found themselves hit by a quadruple whammy falling demand for their exports lower commodity prices higher global interest rates and depreciating exchange rates which made their foreign currency denominated debt more expensive to repay not all low income countries are in trouble but the imf has warned that emerging market debt has returned to levels last seen in the early 1980s when overborrowing brought a crisis to latin america nor are high levels of indebtedness confined to the poorer parts of the world because public debt as a share of national output in advanced countries is at its highest since the second world war it took time for the debt crisis of the 1980s to migrate from the periphery of the global economy to its core today there are already worries about debt sustainability in italy little wonder then that the imf is concerned about the possibility that the current slowdown in the global economy turns into something more serious if another debt crisis does erupt the international community is not well placed to deal with it there is much less of a willingness to cooperate than there was in the early 2000s and a complete absence of leadership in 2005 rich countries had solid growth and felt able to devote time to sorting out problems beyond their shores now they are more concerned about domestic issues the other big problem is the lack of a structure to deal with another debt crisis if and when it arrives ideally there would be a bankruptcy procedure for countries to match those that operate for companies and individuals and such a scheme a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism was floated in the early 2000s by the imf s then deputy managing director anne krueger in the wake of argentina s default intense opposition by the us killed off krueger s blueprint and despite its current concerns the imf has no plans to revive it sign up to the daily business today email or follow guardian business on twitter at businessdesk there are though things that could be done to prevent and mitigate a future debt crisis the imf has proposed a three step process in which countries would take greater care to ensure any borrowing could be repaid that there be comprehensive and transparent recording of public debts and that there should be greater collaboration between creditors to take into account the fact that much of the recent lending has been by china the jubilee debt campaign has gone further it is calling for the g20 which represents the leading developed and emerging economies to set up a public registry of loan and debt data all governments and multilateral institutions would commit to disclosing their loans to the registry the uk and the us and other relevant jurisdictions would insist that for a loan to a government to be enforceable in the courts it would have to be publicly disclosed on the register within 30 days of the contract being signed this is a sensible suggestion it would not deal with the stock of debts already accumulated but it would help prevent a bad situation from getting worse

lebanon has world s 3rd highest ratio of public debt it s an image many invoke when discussing the lebanese joie de vivre that heady mix of rueful stoicism and show must go on partying often advertised as the nation s antidote to successive calamities but to a growing chorus of experts aid officials and donors it s evidence of a debt fueled bender spelling economic doom and this time they say joie de vivre may not be enough this tiny nation slightly smaller than connecticut currently has the world s third highest ratio of public debt to its gross domestic product the debt now stands at more than 84 billion or roughly 152 per cent of gdp last year s budget deficit alone reached 11 per cent of gdp much of it for servicing the debt government employee salaries and subsidies for electricity power prices have gone unchanged since 1996 meanwhile eight years of unrest in neighbouring syria and the region at large have battered economic growth this month the world bank revised its estimate for lebanon to 0 2 per cent growth for this year down from 1 per cent last year one lifeline is the 11 6 billion pledged last year at a donor conference in paris which brought together 50 countries and organisations including the us france the world bank and the european bank for reconstruction and development to aid lebanon s decrepit infrastructure demand for serious reforms but the package which comprises 10 2 billion in loans and 860 million in grants came with tough talk from foreign officials they insisted on political and economic reforms including trimming wages for government workers and reducing the deficit by one percent a year 152 percentage of gdp lebanon s debt accounts for above all they made clear the fractious lebanese government could no longer ignore its obligations the government does not have the luxury of time we must advance on several plans said france s ambassador to lebanon pierre duquesne at a news conference last month anything that can be done by the government over the coming weeks and months to confirm this will to move forward will be useful and even necessary so dire is the situation that even leaders of the nation s dysfunctional political class culled from 18 religious sects acknowledge the need for change last week lebanese prime minister sa ad hariri warned parliament that his government must prepare a budget that would be the most austere in the history of lebanon according to media reports if spending continued as it has the country could face economic disaster he added the statement followed similar warnings by lebanon s foreign minister gebran bassil that without a temporary reduction in wages for public servants there would be no salary left for anyone the announcements which spurred street protests followed parliament s approval of a far reaching plan to update a power grid that often leaves people in darkness meanwhile the 2019 draft budget due to be released in the coming days would target highly compensated state workers thousands of whom receive salaries higher than that of lebanon s president finance minister ali hasan khalil said in a recent interview with lebanese broadcaster mtv citizens blame crooked politicians yet the common feeling among the lebanese is that any proposed sacrifices should be made by politicians who use their positions to take part in lucrative government contracts provide patronage jobs to supporters or receive kickbacks on projects step out of beirut s rafik hariri airport and you re likely to be greeted by heaps of trash the result of a years long garbage crisis that saw the opening of a landfill just beyond the runway attracting birds that could cause air disasters take a taxi and you ll join lebanese drivers who spend

likely nothing will happen only haiti nigeria and yemen have worse electricity quality even the government s massive debt is prone to crony capitalism lebanese banks own more than a third of the debt

third of the country s 1 2 million people of working age to seek their fortunes elsewhere said marwan iskander a lebanese economic expert all of our situation is mismanagement and taking advantage of one s authority iskandar said in an interview in beirut the politicians are uninterested in the welfare of the people and there are only a few who truly understand the economy meanwhile politicians have already begun positioning themselves as protectors of the poor and middle class talk shows that air on lebanese tv channels affiliated with the various parties now host acrimonious debates in

jeffrey frankel one of us president donald trump s two intended nominees to fill vacancies on the us federal reserve board of governors herman cain has now withdrawn trump s other potential pick stephen moore is also under an ethical cloud and often gets his economic facts wrong by contrast trump s earlier appointments to the fed have been sound choices in particular jerome powell the current chair although moore lacks a doctorate in economics that is not a reason to oppose him fed appointees have long included people with business experience powell for example does not have one either the big worry however is that moore would be a trump crony who does whatever the president wants rather than what is best for the economy moreover moore s views on the fed s interest rate policy and his support for returning america to a gold or commodity standard are disturbing moore has favored pro cyclical monetary policy opposing stimulus when the economy needed it and favoring stimulus when it was not required when the fed sought to boost the us economy in response to the 2007 2009 recession moore initially raised the specter of hyperinflation and continued to warn of rising inflation in 2010 even when unemployment exceeded 9 percent needless to say the bogeyman never showed up employment then rose steadily over the following eight years presumably increasing the risks of the us economy overheating yet moore switched coats and attacked the fed for excessively high interest rates in december he even suggested that trump should fire powell for tightening monetary policy one is tempted to ask moore if he turns on the air conditioning at home in winter and the heat in summer the most plausible explanation for his change of course is that he started favoring stimulus when trump took office had the fed followed moore s advice it would have tightened monetary policy in 2010 prolonging the recession and loosened policy in 2018 when unemployment was already below 4 percent this would have destabilized the economy moore s shift is part of a more general republican swing in favor of monetary easing trump himself made the same switch in the direction of his attacks on the fed from 2011 to 2018 some media have portrayed this as a departure from decades of anti inflation hawkishness in fact republican administrations have been pressuring the fed to ease monetary policy for half a century in the early 1970s president richard nixon successfully pushed fed chair arthur burns to loosen monetary policy excessively leading to high inflation that the administration then tried to suppress with wage and price controls nixon also broke the dollar s link with gold in 1971 and devalued the currency ending the bretton woods era of monetary stability in a similar vein republican presidents ronald reagan and george h w bush leaned aggressively on fed chairs paul volcker and alan greenspan to ease monetary policy especially in election years as bob woodward documented in his book maestro by contrast all three democratic presidents during the past 50 years refrained from pushing the fed toward a more dovish stance president jimmy carter appointed volcker as fed chair in 1979 with a mandate to conquer inflation even at the cost of a recession that reduced carter s chances of re election the following year and presidents bill clinton and barack obama scrupulously avoided commenting on us monetary policy thereby reinforcing the norm of fed independence in addition to his pronouncements on interest rate policy moore has repeatedly said in the past that he supports a currency regime under which the dollar would be convertible into a fixed amount of gold in true trumpian fashion moore recently denied having advocated this despite clear video evidence to the contrary he now says he favors a monetary policy that focuses on a basket of commodities and not only gold although this suggestion has drawn criticism a price index based on a variety of commodities would at least make the economy less vulnerable to the volatile gold market after president franklin d roosevelt took america off the gold standard in the 1930s for example two leading economists benjamin graham and john maynard keynes discussed the merits of a hypothetical commodity basket standard in the late 1970s those who hitched themselves to reagan s 1980 presidential campaign and famously called for large tax cuts which they said would pay for themselves also tended to believe that america should consider returning to the gold standard rep jack kemp and others continued to campaign for a return to gold in the 1980s arguing that the fed would then be able to ease its tight monetary policy which they thought was the only thing that had prevented their supply side revolution from succeeding as some pointed out the rise of a small government populist arguing in favor of the gold standard turned the history of american populism on its head during the deflationary 1890s democrat william jennings bryan had campaigned for the presidency by memorably declaring that farmers and workers would refuse to be crucified on a cross of gold for him an easier monetary policy required abandoning the gold standard on this issue bryan was ahead of his time it would make no more sense to go back to the gold standard than to heating all our homes with coal in recent times the fed has shown that it can fight to achieve monetary stability more effectively on its own so long as it has competent appointees and institutional independence the us senate should keep that in mind if and when it considers moore s nomination jeffrey frankel is a professor of capital formation and growth at harvard university ed
some of america s buzziest billion dollar startups are quietly setting off warnings about the risks that brexit could pose to their businesses and to the broader technology industry after years of staying private and growing to ever inflated valuations thanks to rivers of venture capital funding startups like transportation firm uber and work messaging app slack are finally gearing up to go public in the process they are required to release detailed financial information and documentation about their businesses and nestled among dozens of pages of legalese are warnings about the risks being created by britain leaving the european union exposure to political developments in the united kingdom including the outcome of the u k referendum on membership in the european union could harm us slack warns potential investors in its s 1 documents filed on friday the companies call out a laundry list of potential hazards that brexit could pose from uncertainty around employment law and issues around financial regulation to the risk of decreased investment in the uk that could have knock on effects for the entire british technology industry advertisement see also british techies in silicon valley are watching brexit unfold with barely concealed horror the red flags raised by these startups illustrate the trepidation with which many international companies are viewing the united kingdom due to ongoing brexit uncertainty and the breadth of the hurdles it is creating for them after voting to leave the european union in a referendum in 2016 the uk was originally scheduled to formally exit on march 29 but after being bogged down in protracted negotiations with the european union about the terms of its exit while also facing fierce domestic disagreement about the best path forward britain has now delayed brexit until the end of october 2019 the final form brexit will take or even if it will ultimately take place remains unclear clouding the british business and political landscape with paralyzing uncertainty advertisement the concerns are myriad the different companies raise different concerns about potential implications of brexit a key concern raised by slack is how britain s final potential deal with the eu will affect its laws on handling user data a subject of obvious concern to a platform for enterprise messaging depending on the terms reached regarding any exit from the european union or if no such terms are reached it is possible that there may be adverse practical or operational implications on our business it warns for example the uk data protection act that substantially implements the gdpr became effective in may 2018 it remains unclear however how united kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the united kingdom will be regulated file storage service drobpox which went public in 2018 also brought up concerns around data protection regulation in

business insider here s slack exposure to political developments in the united kingdom including the outcome of the u k referendum on membership in the european union could harm us on june 23 2016 a referendum was held on the united kingdom s membership in the european union the outcome of which was a vote in favor of leaving the european union the united kingdom s vote to leave the european union has created an uncertain political and economic environment in the united kingdom and across other european union member states the result of the referendum means that the long term nature of the united kingdom s relationship with the european union is unclear and that there is considerable uncertainty as to whether and when any such relationship will be agreed and implemented the political and economic instability created by the united kingdom s vote to leave the european union has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and the value of the british pound or other currencies including the euro depending on the terms reached regarding any exit from the european union or if no such terms are reached it is possible that there may be adverse practical or operational implications on our business for example the uk data protection act that substantially implements the gdpr became effective in may 2018 it remains unclear however how united kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfers to and from the united kingdom will be regulated and how those regulations may differ from those in the european union further the united kingdom s exit from the european union may create increased compliance costs and an uncertain regulatory landscape for offering equity based incentives to our employees in the united kingdom if we are unable to maintain equity based incentive programs for our employees in the united kingdom due to the departure of the united kingdom from the european union our business in the united kingdom may suffer and we may face legal claims from employees in the united kingdom to whom we previously offered equity based incentive programs advertisement here s uber additionally the united kingdom held a referendum on june 23 2016 to determine whether the united kingdom should leave the european union eu or remain as a member state the outcome of which was in favor of leaving the eu which is commonly referred to as brexit lack of clarity about future u k laws and regulations as the united kingdom determines which eu rules and regulations to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal including financial laws and regulations including relating to payment processing tax and free trade agreements intellectual property rights supply chain logistics environmental health and safety laws and regulations immigration laws and employment laws could decrease foreign direct investment in the united kingdom increase costs depress economic activity and restrict access to capital here s dropbox we also expect that there will continue to be new laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions for example european legislators have adopted a general data protection regulation or gdpr that will when effective in may 2018 supersede current european union or eu data protection legislation impose more stringent eu data protection requirements and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance further following a referendum in june 2016 in which voters in the united kingdom approved an exit from the eu the united kingdom government has initiated a process to leave the eu or brexit brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the united kingdom in particular it is unclear whether the united kingdom will enact data protection laws or regulations designed to be consistent with the pending eu general data protection regulation and how data transfers to and from the united kingdom will be regulated additionally although we have self certified under the u s eu

of data transfers from the eu and switzerland to the united states and we are closely monitoring regulatory developments in this area advertisement here s zoom we also expect that there will continue to be new laws regulations and industry standards concerning privacy data protection and information security proposed and enacted in various jurisdictions for example in may 2018 the general data protection regulation gdpr went into effect in the european union eu the gdpr imposed more stringent data protection requirements and provides greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data protection laws including potential penalties of up to 20 million or 4 of annual global revenues further following a referendum in june 2016 in which voters in the united kingdom approved an exit from the eu the united kingdom government has initiated a process to leave the eu known as brexit brexit has created uncertainty with regard to the regulation of data protection in the united kingdom in

can government deficits be financed directly by central banks as modern monetary theory suggests the question should not be if but how much all things are poison and nothing is without poison the dosage alone makes it so a thing is not a poison paracelsus modern monetary theory mmt has in recent weeks been strongly criticised by leading keynesian macroeconomists paul krugman here too kenneth rogoff and larry summers this reaction is surprising as the theoretical core of mmt can be easily reconciled with standard macroeconomic principles if one focuses on the macroeconomics of mmt leaving aside the associated proposal of a universal job guarantee its core idea is that government deficits can be financed directly by the central bank conventionally governments have financed their deficits by issuing bonds sold on the capital market the confusion can be explained by the fact that so far the mechanisms of mmt have not been presented in a simple macroeconomic model a framework which allows the basic mechanics of mmt to be described is provided by the textbook is lm model the model consists of two markets an aggregate goods market the investment saving or is curve and an aggregate financial market the liquidity preference money supply or lm curve it defines an equilibrium point between them at a certain aggregate output horizontal axis and a certain interest rate vertical axis become a social europe member support independent publishing and progressive ideas by becoming a social europe member for less than 5 euro per month your support makes all the difference click here to become a member if one assumes that a deficit is caused by additional government spending the higher demand for goods shifts the is curve to the right figures 1 and 2 this effect is independent of the financing of the deficit if the deficit is financed traditionally by issuing bonds the money supply remains constant and the lm curve is unchanged together with the upward shift of the is curve the interest rate then goes up figure 1 and the higher public expenditures crowd out private investments in the case of mmt where the additional government spending is directly financed by the central bank the lm curve shifts too suppose the government pays an invoice to a construction company to do so it makes a transfer from its central bank account to the account of the construction company with a commercial bank this transaction increases the reserves of the bank as well as the deposits of the construction company thus the monetary base reserves of commercial banks with the central bank and the money stock m1 deposits of private households or companies with commercial banks increase in the is lm model the resulting increase in money supply causes a downward shift in the lm curve overall direct central bank financing magnifies the expansionary effects of additional government spending figure 2 it avoids at least in part the rise in interest rates that is caused by capital market financing unchanged lm curve in this model the financial crowding out of private investors that krugman fears can be at least partly avoided lm1 depending on the extent of the shifts in the is and lm curves crowding out can be fully avoided lm2 and the result may even be an interest rate decline lm3 which would lead to more private investment abba lerner the 1943 inventor of functional finance explicitly addressed this possibility of a crowding in interpreted in this way the effects of mmt financing do not fundamentally differ from the monetary policy pursued in japan for many years there the government financed huge deficits traditionally issuing sovereign bonds on the capital market by purchasing these bonds from non banks insurance companies for instance in its large quantitative easing programmes the central bank generated an increase in the money supply higher bank deposits on the part of non banks and the monetary base higher reserves of commercial banks with the central bank as a corollary of its increased liabilities with non banks this combination of traditional capital market financing of deficits with qe purchases by the central bank leads to the same result as the direct financing of deficits by the central bank which mmt supporters advocate the lm curve shifts downwards of course mmt financing can be also considered in the context of a horizontal lm curve which implies that the central bank targets the interest rate in this case the central bank has to sterilise the impact of the increase of mmt financing on the monetary base and the money stock this requires that the central bank sells bonds to non banks which can be regarded as reverse quantitative easing with such a policy a financial crowding out of private investment can be prevented as with any therapy so with mmt the dose makes the poison the example of japan makes it clear that such a policy can be carried out even in a fairly high dosage without leading to inflation in fact japan is still in a deflationary environment in addition there was never an indication that the record high government debt had a detrimental effect on the trust of international investors in the japanese currency on the contrary the exchange rate was too strong for most of the time rather than too weak in essence mmt differs from the macroeconomic policy operated in japan for years only in that it provides for a coupling of expansive monetary and fiscal policies in japan by contrast the two policies are effected separately albeit in a quite co ordinated manner surprisingly aggressive given such a sober look at mmt financing it is surprising that leading economists have responded so aggressively to this concept rogoff speaks of all the nonsense about mmt he quotes the chair of the federal reserve jerome powell the idea that deficits don t matter for countries that can borrow in their own currency i think is just wrong and adds that the deficit idea is just nuts but it s always a question of the right dose especially in the years 2009 12 japan the united kingdom and the united states were running very high deficits which obviously did not matter to them and with massive bond purchases from non banks the central banks of these countries provided the parallel expansion of the money stock which kept interest rates at very low levels with the simple model presented here one can also respond to the question posed by krugman how expansionary fiscal policy will lead to lower and not higher interest rates it is the shift of the lm curve that matters the model shows furthermore that there is not necessarily a trade off between monetary and fiscal policy as both curves can be shifted independently summers regards mmt as a recipe for disaster he points to the dismal experiences of emerging market economies as the experience of any number of emerging markets demonstrates past a certain point this approach leads to hyperinflation and that of france in the european monetary system in the early 1980s but of course the deficit spending concept of mmt is only applicable to very large economies with a flexible exchange rate regime he also mentions the problems of italy and the uk in the 1970s they increased their deficits at a time when their inflation rates were already very high 11 per cent in italy and 9 per cent in the uk in 1973 mmt should only be applied in a low inflation environment today in addition to japan the best example of very effective mmt deficit spending is china if one does not look at the official fiscal deficit but at the deficit which includes the borrowing of local governments the country has maintained a deficit of over 10 per cent for years so far there are no signs that china has to worry about this in the whole controversy about mmt the critics and proponents should agree on two points first a consensus should be possible around the basic idea of functional finance as presented by lerner the central idea is that government fiscal policy its spending and taxing its borrowing and repayment of loans its issue of new money and its withdrawal of money shall be undertaken with an eye only to the results of these actions on the economy and not to any established doctrine of what is sound and unsound the principle of judging only by the effects has been applied in many other fields of human activity where it is known as the method of science as opposed to scholasticism and both sides should also be able to agree that the combination of expansive fiscal policy and expansive monetary policy is a very powerful tool which should be used if needed and at the same time handled with great care once again it is the dose that makes the poison this article is a joint publication by social europe and ips journal

u s president donald trump loves tariffs he sees them as a powerful weapon to force factories to relocate to the u s bully countries into making trade concessions and eliminate the trade deficit and he insists all that tariff revenue will pay down the massive u s government debt that s mostly nonsense of course tariffs are just another form of taxation and a particularly noxious one at that mr trump may think he s punishing canada or china but tariffs are a tax on imports and they are paid primarily by consumers and businesses in the countries that impose them worse tariffs can have all sorts of unintended consequences including discouraging the kind of trade that makes economies more productive steering investment into inefficient industries and driving up the cost of everything when targeted countries retaliate any marginal benefits may disappear but we know all that the economics and history of protectionism are unambiguous what may be less obvious is the havoc tariffs cause in markets for specific goods new research by three economists at the university of the chicago and the u s federal reserve explored what happened when mr trump slapped tariffs last year of 20 per cent then 50 per cent on imported washing machines and it s not good federal reserve keeps interest rates steady as u s economy motors along at first blush the tariffs look like a winner whirlpool the main u s maker of washing machines added 200 jobs at a plant in ohio south korea s samsung and lg opened new factories in south carolina and tennessee respectively creating another 1 600 jobs here s where it gets interesting appliance makers permanently raised prices on all washers by an average of 12 per cent including ones made in the u s and not subject to the tariff according to the study the price of clothes dryers also went up by 12 per cent or nearly us 100 apiece the researchers concluded that manufacturers exploited the new inflationary environment simply because they could knowing consumers generally buy washers and dryers in pairs appliance makers raised prices on both items consumers are losing big time americans are collectively paying us 1 5 billion more per year for washers and dryers that are no better than the cheaper ones they were buying before the tariffs mr trump can claim a partial victory due to the creation of 1 800 jobs but at an average cost of us 820 000 per job it s a steep price to pay compared with other job creation programs the study concluded meanwhile the tariffs generate a meagre us 82 million per year for the u s treasury that s a blip relative to the u s government debt of us 22 2 trillion and the u s trade deficit has continued to rise by another us 81 billion in 2018 alone tariffs have the perverse effect of suppressing both imports and exports because the u s dollar tends to gain strength versus other currencies when the country closes its borders a higher dollar makes u s exports more expensive and therefore less desirable in the rest of the world the big winners of the washing machine tariffs are appliance makers both the foreign ones and whirlpool the companies are passing on the cost of the tariffs on imported products to consumers and then some generating a nice profit the researchers found they re even taking advantage of the tariff effect to raise prices on u s made washers and dryers this story is not just about washing machines thanks to mr trump s tariff spree last year 15 per cent of all u s imports are now covered by some kind of tariff or quota washing machines represent just 0 1 per cent of that protective umbrella according to the washington based peterson institute for international economics mr trump s tariff war has been more damaging and far reaching than people realize as the bank of canada warned last week the global economy is now in the midst of a synchronous slowdown due in part to rising trade fights over such items as cars steel motorcycles and yes washing machines the pace of global growth slowed in 2018 to 3 6 per cent and will decelerate further to 3 3 per cent this year according to the latest forecast from the international monetary fund countries representing 70 per cent of the global economy are gearing down including canada and the u s the spin cycle is already on slow by next year it could stop rotating altogether

with music and people dancing around maypoles getting drunk and so on my wife and i went to may day parties in a cleared spot in the woods of rural southern rhode island many years ago mostly to hear some musician friends of ours silly pagan fun the haymarket riot began as a peaceful rally in support of workers striking for an eight hour work day the day after police killed eight workers an unidentified person threw dynamite at the police as they tried to disperse the rally and the blast and ensuing gunfire killed seven police officers and at least four civilians and led to the executions of four anarchists south coast rail promise the best news for our region in a while comes from massachusetts gov charlie baker who fulfilling a campaign promise is dedicating more than 1 billion in state bond revenue to the long delayed extension of mbta service to fall river new bedford and taunton the plan is to have the project called south coast rail completed by late 2023 taunton fall river and new bedford are the only massachusetts cities within 50 miles of boston that don t have commuter rail access to boston the extension will make it easier for southeastern massachusetts and eastern rhode island to share in the wealth and economic development of greater boston while making southeastern massachusetts s housing whose costs are generally much lower than boston s and its suburbs more accessible to commuters and rhode islanders in tiverton little compton on aquidneck island and bristol may find it easier to take the train to boston from fall river than from providence in the long run south coast rail will help make southeastern new england more prosperous help restrain traffic congestion and reduce car traffic s strain on the environment in any case much needs to be done to get more people off the roads consider that a massinc polling group recent survey of 1 200 bay state registered voters found that 67 percent say that they ve left work earlier or later to avoid greater boston s traffic crush sixty three percent describe themselves as angry frustrated about the delays on the roads and the mbta the pollsters found among those with commutes longer than 45 minutes about half 51 have thought about changing jobs 30 have considered leaving their area altogether the booming metro boston economy fueled by technology health care finance and higher education has kept the jobless rate low latest 3 percent but eventually traffic congestion might cause many to leave the area the best answer is more and better commuter rail service please hit this link to

big structural changes it s a disaster for rhode island s largest city the center of new england s second biggest metro area and capital to have such low education outcomes there are a few exceptions most notably classical high school a healthy economy and civic culture require a well educated populace of course government can t do everything the socio economic problems of many providence families all too many of them with only one parent in a kind of an electronic device dependent distracted post literate society makes fixing education in a city such as providence very difficult we need a more economically secure disciplined and orderly citizenry too better that state government take over the schools than to leave reform efforts mostly up to the city which has shown itself incapable of turning things around disclosure my children attended providence public schools golocal news editor kate nagle and whitcomb view larger let s hope that rhode island s news media repeatedly publish the names of the state legislators who are raising future property taxes by voting for one measure that would indefinitely extend otherwise expired municipal and teacher contracts and another that would set a mandatory 42 hour overtime threshold for firefighters in a state that already has the highest firefighting costs in america the special interest votes are examples of the inherent conflict of interest around public employee unions which use politicians desirous of their campaign money and other organizational support to try to get what they want quite rational sometimes things get very intimate indeed consider that sen valerie lawson d east providence is a member of the senate labor committee and vice president of the rhode island affiliate of the national education association the teachers union but then the committee s chairman frank ciccone d providence north providence is a paid consultant for the laborers international union of north america which represents some state and municipal employees in rhode island private sector unions are quite another thing they must bargain without special help from politicians usually we need more and stronger private sector unions their decline has hurt the middle class while the political power of public employee unions at least in some places has raised citizens cynicism about and lack of trust in their governments which can end up being bad for hard working public employees too in the long run view larger lifespan has denounced boston based partners healthcare s bid to take over care new england i wonder if lifespan would change its tune if partners in the fullness of time made a nice offer for lifespan with big golden parachutes for lifespan executives meanwhile to those who warn that partners would over time shift a lot of rhode island area patients to its high priced hospitals in boston yep partners would almost inevitably do just that warren s bridge too far massachusetts senator and presidential candidate elizabeth warren s proposal to cancel college student debt for everyone with under a 100 000 income and some debt relief even for those earning up to 250 000 and going forward provide free public higher education financed by a new tax on households making more than 50 million a year is not the way to go for one thing it would tend to subsidize people from middle and upper income families who could afford to pay for college with family money private sector loans and pell grants etc and reap the lifelong earnings gains that could flow from that education which they d pursue with or without the warren program and especially for past and present students it would encourage the idea that you don t have to pay back money you borrowed better to concentrate help on the truly needy there s also the question of how valuable college is for some students compared with say high quality vocational education for some of us liberal arts can be vocational e g a history major who plans to go into journalism aka history on the run but perhaps not for the majority of students in any event i m sure that many people in the surplus of private colleges and universities would be terrified if it seemed that senator warren s plan could be enacted leading many more students to opt for free public colleges new england has a famously dense concentration of private colleges some of them in deep financial trouble because of worsening demographics paradise pier the rhode island department of environmental management hopes that work on the new 280 foot long t shaped pier at rocky point in warwick scheduled to start within a few weeks will be finished by year s end too bad it won t be ready for this summer but the fact that it will be there soon is heartening long piers are potent magnets for people and fish and this one with its shade structure benches railings and solar powered lights will be a more powerful one than most that the new pier will provide easy access to

welcomed russia s help and encouraged it publicly and privately robert mueller noted his frustration during the probe that some in the trump crowd deleted or encrypted key communications that would have been useful in an investigation already hamstrung by sabotage by trump and his family and servants and of course justice department policy is not to indict a sitting president mr mueller basically tossed the hot potato over to congress mr mueller wrote the office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct we investigated including some associated with the trump campaign deleted relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide for long term retention of data or communications records still the report is devastating enough to read it please hit this link given the trump administration s lack of interest in combatting russian efforts to interfere in the 2020 elections and trump s continuing disinclination to call out putin we can infer that his toxic special relationship with the kremlin continues meanwhile as trump increases his frenetic daily twittering

than five times the food and drug administration s budget he noted and roughly equal to the entire budget of the national institutes of health the most rapid growth has been in direct to consumer

china s investment strategy of throwing money at developing countries appears to have hit a snag in the republic of congo as the central african nation is seeking an imf bailout while the funding it provided to congo wasn t part of the belt and road initiative bri which china was promoting this week it serves as a cautionary tale of the trouble beijing could face with its plan for massive investments in maritime road and rail projects across 65 countries from asia to europe and africa when the plunge of global oil prices in 2014 blew a hole in the congolese government s finances it was china that stepped in to help but despite the recovery of oil prices the country also known as congo brazzaville has had trouble getting back on top of its finances and has asked the international monetary fund for help the imf places conditions on its loans to force governments to take measures to boost their finances in addition as the imf can only lend if it judges that a country s debt load is sustainable a bailout may be accompanied by a restructuring of government debt it s certainly the first time china has found itself confronted with this kind of situation said a specialist in relations between china and africa who asked her name not be used as the discussions with imf were still underway the republic of congo is seeking imf protection in order to avoid a possible default on its payments she added china which holds more than a third of its foreign debt is not really comfortable with that china lending full tilt julien marcilly chief economist at coface a firm that provides payment insurance for french companies said that china went full tilt on lending in recent years often to countries which produce and export raw materials in particular oil it is only now that beijing is beginning to realise that problems can build up in particular after venezuela defaulted the situation is all the more worrying as the republic of congo in 2005 was one of the countries that benefited from an international debt relief initiative for the world s poorest countries its foreign debt was bought down from 119 percent of annual economic output to just 33 percent but like other oil producing nations congo brazzaville took a beating from the 2014 plunge in oil prices it was an expected and very brutal drop in prices which was ironically linked to a slowdown in china noted marcilly the drop in oil prices meant the nation s economic output dropped by 50 percent as a consequence its debt as a percentage of gdp soared to 110 percent in 2017 about one third of the country s debt is in chinese hands or about 2 billion said the specialist in relations between china and africa the congolese government reached an agreement with imf negotiators a year ago but the terms need to be approved by the imf s governing board one year later the deal has yet to be approved a french source confirmed that the imf programme is contingent on congo brazzaville s debt becoming sustainable which means that a deal has to be reached with china on cutting the amount owed or pushing back payments however it would be unusual for beijing to do this when sri lanka was unable to repay its loans it was forced to turn over a deep sea port to china for 99 years the imf and china both declined to comment when contacted by afp imf hemmed in it will be tricky for the imf to find a compromise last year a group of us lawmakers urged treasury secretary steven mnuchin to use his influence at the imf where the united states holds the most voting rights of any nation to block bailouts of countries that were too heavily indebted to china for the united states it out of the question that the imf rescues a country that is in debt to china the specialist said with the imf sticking to its long held position that debt must be sustainable at the end of a rescue programme so it gets repaid the situation was blocked until a mid april meeting of imf leaders the question of congo s debt to china was only being discussed between the two nations a congolese source told afp on the margins of the meeting that china made efforts we re making progress she added it was hoped the rescue programme could be approved at an imf board meeting in june we understand that things are moving along a good path but it hasn t been signed yet a french source said france has prioritised increased transparency on lending to developing countries during its g7 presidency particularly those in africa where france still backs the cfa franc
the global fashion industry has a problem as it has criss crossed the world in search of ever cheaper places to manufacture its clothing the stories of worker abuses that have followed remain depressingly similar violence brutally long hours dangerous conditions and pay that amounts to poverty wages continue to surface advertisement last year at one indian factory supplying a number of well known brands workers said they were viciously beaten for daring to join a union earlier this year researchers for an aid group found that garment workers in bangladesh and vietnam making clothes for big international labels were paid so little they couldn t adequately feed themselves a new report found that female garment workers in vietnam face systemic sexual harassment and violence at work these are just some of the recent examples in 2013 the industry became a global symbol of worker exploitation when the rana plaza factory complex collapsed on the outskirts of dhaka in bangladesh killing around 1 134 people and ranking as one of the worst industrial disasters in history just over two decades ago a small collection of workers rights groups trade unions british retailers and others joined together to take action on the poor pay and labor conditions that countless workers in global supply chains endure the organization they ultimately formed the ethical trading initiative eti has since founded programs in countries around the world partnered with other advocacy groups and elicited commitments from brands large and small including some of the world s biggest fashion labels to try to improve workers lives advertisement but while it has done a lot of good it hasn t been able to eradicate the problems that led to its creation last year was our 20th anniversary and in many ways we haven t seen the kind of progress that we d like to see says martin buttle eti s strategic lead on general merchandise and business models we ve seen the same stories and same kind of problems reoccur in various different sourcing countries since when we started working in this field in fashion particularly the low cost high volume sort this has certainly been the case and after two decades working to solve these problems the group felt the need to reassess its approach as it prepares to set its strategy for the next few years the group has always focused on brands business practices but it has recognized the need to take a step back and look at the whole premise the industry operates on i think we ve been increasingly conscious that the business model is part of the issue buttle says the eti commissioned a team of authors including professors at the business schools of king s college london and the university of warwick to examine the connection between business models in fashion and food and labor standards in the supply chains of those industries the new report business model and labour standards making the connection argues that the model of producing giant volumes of clothing at the highest speed and lowest cost through a flexible and opaque global supply chain has been a key contributor to the hazardous conditions labor abuses and low wages that workers face in the industry all the factory inspections that brands carry out on their suppliers all their corporate social responsibility csr programs and the millions they spend on them may help to improve conditions but only in limited ways they re effectively treating symptoms rather than the disease advertisement to really make sure workers aren t routinely exploited in countries around the world individual fixes won t solve the problem the whole business model needs to change fashion s common ground there isn t really just one business model in fashion even within the low cost clothing sector zara works differently from walmart the former emphasizes constant smaller deliveries of new styles to keep up with trends the latter relies on selling higher volumes of more basic items even so there s a lot these brands share in terms of how they get their clothing made the eti report centers on these common ways of operating since those are at the nexus of the relationship between the brands factory owners and workers and that s where the roots of the industry s problems lie first off very few brands own the factories that make their clothes they outsource the work to independent producers usually in countries where labor is cheap their supply chains also tend to be highly flexible in that they can change the factories they source from without too much disruption lastly they re continually trying to make clothes faster as they work to keep pace with customers who are moving at the pace of social media trends can come and go in a matter of weeks now if it takes a brand a few months to design manufacture and ship clothing it can miss its chance to cash in shoppers reward the fastest brands offering them the best value advertisement to make all the inexpensive fashion they pack into stores and websites brands have come to rely on a complex network of contractors and subcontractors that can be nearly impossible to monitor and regulate they are constantly assessing how to produce their clothes in the most cost efficient way possible they get quotes from factories in different countries sometimes using middlemen who know where to find the best deals and go with the ones that offer that best mix of price speed and quality or they set draconian terms that factories in need of the work may be reluctant to reject as the eti report frames it clothing brands have become adept at dissecting the supply chain and looking for pockets of value that can be ring fenced and negotiated downwards but the longer and more dispersed the supply chain becomes the harder it is to keep an eye on everything happening within it the intense pressure to keep prices low and churn out clothes quickly pushes the suppliers themselves to outsource work and the brand at one end of the supply chain can lose control over what s happening at the other end incentive to cut corners these factors lead to serious problems beyond wages in countries where industry isn t well regulated factory owners may cut corners on safety failing to install proper fire doors or skipping important upgrades advertisement brands can also fail to give their suppliers enough lead time to produce their orders or may suddenly demand larger quantities or add other changes this leads to factory owners forcing staff to work overtime without extra pay or finding other ways to get the work done the eti s report cites the combination of these factors and the lack of visibility across the supply chain saying it influences the adoption of unethical practices by suppliers human rights watch hrw an advocacy group dedicated to uncovering abuses around the world just released its own report on the garment industry like eti it concludes that brands purchasing practices meaning how they place orders with manufacturers are driving labor violations low purchase prices and shorter times for manufacturing products coupled with poor forecasting unfair penalties and poor payment terms exacerbate risks for labor abuses in factories it states even the most robust corporate social responsibility efforts are undermined in this cycle often bad purchasing practices directly undermine efforts brands are making to try to ensure rights respecting conditions in the factories that produce their wares hrw points out many brands demand their suppliers maintain rights respecting workplaces but then incentivize them to do the opposite workers in myanmar and cambodia for example saw their production targets increased significantly when the country raised the minimum wage the workers got paid more hrw reports but the factories then demanded more workers could be denied basic rights such as bathroom breaks advertisement perhaps the worst instances of underpayment worker abuses and dangerous conditions occur in the unauthorized subcontracting sector the factory a brand contracted with might subcontract out work to another factory when it has accepted an order and then finds itself unable to fill it as fast as promised or it may even take the order knowing it can t complete it in time just because it doesn t want to say no and risk the brand going elsewhere with its business these subcontracting factories are less likely to be registered with the governments of their countries and may operate outside of any regulation or oversight the facilities that collapsed at rana plaza for example housed subcontractors producing for large international brands such as benetton brands may ban vendors from subcontracting but the demands they make and conditions they impose still set the stage for it hrw spoke to one sourcing expert with more than 30 years in the garment industry who explained if a brand says they are going to order 150 000 pieces and then at the time of actually placing the order turn around and ask for 250 000 pieces then you are going to have ot or subcontracting advertisement the authors of the eti report note that based on their research in bangladesh brand sourcing managers and middlemen are often aware of the production limits of factories and if they place orders that exceed them anyway they invite sub contracting with eyes wide shut how we got here the global supply chain of the fashion industry is relatively new up through the 19th century ready made clothing that a person could buy off a rack was mostly an alien concept as grace rogers cooper wrote in her history of the sewing machine for the most part those with the means got their clothes made to order from tailors or seamstresses and those who didn t made their own or wore hand me downs in the us until about the 1830s ready made garments were almost exclusively for sailors about to ship out to sea but in cities in such as new york as incomes rose and a steady rush of immigrants and others flooded in a market emerged for convenient ready made clothes as more people jumped into the business prices fell the invention of a practical sewing machine only spurred the process in 1860 the new york times compared it to the domestic equivalent of the telegraph or reaper slowly clothing manufacture was industrializing and affordable fashion for the masses becoming a reality as the industry grew so did pressure to make things more cheaply there was always outsourcing in the industry says doug miller an emeritus professor of workers rights and fashion at the university of northumbria in the us for example manufacturing started to migrate away from the urban centers into pennsylvania and beyond in the southern states he notes advertisement miller calls clothing manufacturers footloose because it s fairly cheap to move production around to sew clothing doesn t require a prohibitive amount of specialized knowledge or equipment once you had improvements in transport and communication he says it just was a matter of time before it went international that process took off in the late 1960s and 1970s as businesses that once manufactured clothing started outsourcing the work to cheaper destinations such as hong kong korea malaysia and taiwan as well as central america and the caribbean when wages rose in those locales they turned to southeast asian countries such as vietnam bangladesh and turkey and of course to mainland china in 1979 it started a process of economic reforms that would transform it in the decades that followed from a poor backwater that subsisted on farming to an export oriented economy pdf that would grow into the largest producer of clothing in the world there were still companies such as levi s that owned the factories where they made their clothes but they were losing ground even levi s eventually outsourced its production in wealthier countries textile mills and garment factories fought the outsourcing and governments in an effort to protect local industry put restraints on how much clothing and what types they would allow in from developing countries it wasn t enough even with the barriers production flowed to countries that offered labor costs no industrialized economy could compete with advertisement as author elizabeth cline detailed in her book overdressed the shockingly high cost of cheap fashion giant garment factories employing thousands of people in low wage nations sprang up to fulfill the massive orders of western labels companies such as gap and nike were among the pioneers coming up with products and marketing campaigns to whip up demand which they satisfied with an avalanche of products made through outsourced production keeping costs low and margins high this model is still in use today only it has gotten much faster and it has had economic consequences in wealthier countries too in the advanced capitalist economies of the 1950s and 1960s there was a virtuous circle of production and consumption according to the authors of eti report as real wages rose for workers producing goods their purchasing power increased lifting the demand for goods prices rose too but wages kept up while the desire for more products fueled a cycle of more employment and higher wages to make them it sometimes required workers getting those increases through collective bargaining but the model generally worked when these jobs moved overseas that virtuous cycle ceased to exist according to the eti advertisement global supply chains have broken this model they have separated spatially those who produce the goods and those who consume the goods to deliver lower priced goods separation of consumers from producers is necessary buyers threaten to relocate or actually relocate should wage costs rise as such the model is the opposite of the virtuous circle as it seeks out workers who do not have a reasonable prospect of being able to consume the type of goods which they produce in theory free trade should make the situation advantageous to all freeing up workers in the advanced economies to do better jobs and giving the workers in the developing nations jobs that will lead eventually to higher wages and living standards but free trade doesn t always work in practice the way it does in theory particularly for countries such as vietnam cambodia bangladesh myanmar and others cheap labor has been perhaps the top competitive advantage when it comes to attracting the fashion and footwear industries for these countries to remain attractive to international brands their wages may have to remain low in the us meanwhile shoppers are spending a diminishing share of their disposable income on clothing even as they stuff their closets with more of it clothing prices have been deflating compared to retail overall and brands keep looking for ever cheaper ways to fill the demand advertisement constant downward price pressure the ideal sourcing destinations globally not by coincidence are the ones that offer the best mix of price speed and quality though brands prioritize each of those factors differently a label that wants to fill its stores in europe with say a newly hot style of shirt may opt to make it in turkey or morocco even at a higher cost than in southeast asia since it can get it from idea to store shelf weeks sooner zara does much of its production near europe for this reason and as the need for brands to produce faster grows more may start looking to countries nearer the markets they sell in china meanwhile remains by far the world s largest clothing exporter even though prices have been rising there for years because it has built up an unmatched infrastructure that for now at least still allows the quality and efficiency of its manufacturing to offset the added expense even so price arguably carries a disproportionate amount of weight when brands balance out these factors as a business high volume low cost fashion has narrow margins so even a small additional expense to make something like a t shirt can have a big impact on a brand s profits when it s making tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of them shockingly low wages and abundant labor are part of the reason bangladesh has grown into the world s second largest clothing exporter with the eu as its main export destination for brands buttle says cost is definitely a very significant driver there s a reason they re all sourcing from countries with the lowest labor costs and where labor regulations are weakly enforced advertisement brands though aren t the ones setting the wages directly david sävman head of production at h m which is an eti member says it s a common misconception that brands decide what garment workers get paid again they don t own the factories it s the local industry and government that determine wages and a worker s pay doesn t change according to which brand she s sewing for that s not to say however that there s no correlation between wages and what a consumer ultimately pays on a single order there would be no connection between worker wage and final garment price sävman says but on a total of how a market develops yes while the brands are all competing to get their clothes in front of shoppers as fast as they can at the lowest possible price the factories are in competition too they need to get orders from the brands to make money themselves so the factory owners offer the best prices they can manage at the fastest turnaround times to make a profit they have to keep their own costs low so they pay the lowest wages they can advertisement and then there are the workers to sew clothing quickly and correctly all day long requires a tremendous amount of skill but it s not the same sort required for writing computer code or designing high end electronics it s often developed through repetition not formal education so factories may treat garment workers as interchangeable they can also be some of the most disadvantaged people in a community making them even more vulnerable to exploitation and abuse the majority of garment workers are women in vietnam cambodia and bangladesh for example at least 80 of garment workers are estimated to be female like everyone else in the supply chain they re in competition too for jobs that can be vital to their families survival out of necessity they may suffer inadequate pay sexual harassment and other abuses simply because low wages are better than no wages combined these dynamics allow brands to pay less and less for their clothes one analysis last year by mark anner director of penn state university s center for global workers rights found that brands are generally paying less pdf to make a pair of cotton trousers in bangladesh for export to the us than they were before the rana plaza disaster and if brands are paying less it s harder to pay workers more advertisement the collective action dilemma despite their pledges to better regulate their supply chains and despite the customer outcry they face every time they get bad press well known multinational labels continue to have their garments turn up at factories accused of abusing workers h m in particular has been outspoken about its ethical and sustainability initiatives and the need for change sävman says he generally concurs with the eti s assessment but also believes ethical purchasing practices can be good for business the company he explains is in the midst of adapting its sourcing trying to minimize the cons while maintaining the model overall in 2013 for instance it launched a five year pilot program that saw it partner with some of its major suppliers in bangladesh and cambodia among its goals including some related to environmental sustainability was getting worker pay up to a living wage meaning one that covers their needs and those of their families with some money left over for spending or saving but the company admits that while wages have increased it still has work to do the clean clothes campaign an alliance of trade unions and non governmental organizations that advocates for workers in the garment industry has lately harangued h m for failing to live up to its promise h m s reply has been that there s no silver bullet to achieve a fair living wage for workers and that it will take a dedicated industry wide effort to make it happen advertisement dorothée baumann pauly research director at nyu s stern center for business and human rights which has done its own investigations into the problems of the garment industry believes the brands have a sincere interest in establishing decent working conditions there are a lot of admirable csr activities including auditing and capacity building and training even training for improved industrial relations she says even so it s business as usual she points out plus specific activities that then try to compensate for what business models are causing so why hasn t there been more change one possibility is that brands keep trying to fix systemic problems through unilateral projects when what appears to be needed is collective industry wide reform that s easier said than done when any move that raises prices or reduces the speed of an individual brand puts it at a competitive disadvantage the authors of the eti report describe it as a collective action dilemma it s a situation in which everyone would be better off cooperating but their conflicting interests prevent it in such situations individual action will continually fail to address underlying problems as each actor in the chain has an incentive to focus on lower costs and drive down labour standards and wages the report says kalpona akter an activist for workers rights and chief executive of the bangladesh centre for workers solidarity takes a more skeptical of brands motivations saying they were forced to make visible efforts in the wake of disasters such as rana plaza to save their images they didn t do that voluntarily she told me in an interview this past november when she was speaking at business of fashion s voices conference they had been pressured and our people had to be killed to let them do whatever they ve done in terms of improving safety advertisement akter said that foreign fashion brands continue to wield a great deal of power in bangladesh if they really wanted to she argues they could use their tremendous financial leverage to pressure both factory owners and the government to bring about change why governments allow it to happen in theory the governments in countries that are big garment exporters could step in to ensure that their citizens are paid and treated fairly whatever demands foreign companies may make except that they re in competition too in a sense because their economies may rely on the export industries giving them an incentive to keep wages low in their own countries bangladesh is an extreme case clothing has come to account for more than 83 of its exports over the past three decades and many government officials themselves have investments in the garment industry the government of bangladesh and many of the countries that host the global garment industry considers low wages to be a comparable advantage and cheap labor to be something that is their right to kind of exploit explained sarah fox the former special representative for international labor affairs at the us department of state at a summit last april on the industry s progress since rana plaza advertisement fox also pointed out that bangladesh s government had made it harder for workers to unionize creating bureaucratic obstacles such as demanding that 30 of workers in a factory join a union for it to be recognized bodies such as the international labour organization and human rights watch have deemed that percentage unreasonably high a few months ago when tens of thousands of bangladeshi garment workers took to the streets to protest the government s failure to raise the minimum wage to the levels they demanded police squelched the demonstrations with rubber bullets tear gas and water cannons the worker rights consortium an independent monitor of labor rights called it the most extensive repression pdf it had documented in two decades of work in bangladesh and pointed to the government and apparel factory owners as responsible while in the past workers movements have been galvanized and gained popular support after industrial disasters bangladeshi garment workers after rana plaza found themselves with little leverage to exert if governments view workers as commodities and brands can quite easily move to other factories or even other countries to make their clothes they lack the power to force changes in their working conditions advertisement it s not as simple as people in power exploiting those without it though governments in low wage countries also see a national benefit in attracting foreign brands with low prices bangladesh s garment industry exploitative as it may be has been instrumental in reducing poverty and fueling the country s startling economic growth researchers and unions often note that garment workers want more work not less they d just like to be paid better for it both the benefits and struggles workers endure in these sprawling pressurized supply chains are direct consequences of foreign brands looking across the globe for inexpensive sources of labor it s free trade at work in all its complexity as the authors of the eti report note on the one hand the mechanisms driving competitiveness have brought jobs unprecedented economic growth and opportunities to places like bangladesh china myanmar and south africa they write on the other hand the same mechanisms also make work exploitative and precarious the authors quote a senior corporate social responsibility manager on the conundrum let s be honest it s called capitalism advertisement the path to development there s an argument that the low wages and exploitative conditions workers in developing nations face in industries such as the garment business are just temporary and are actually a sort of stepping stone to a future of rising incomes and standards of living the shining example of this process is china the country attracted foreign customers with its abundant labor and low costs kept down in part through lax regulation of labor and environmental standards it used those foreign investments and its large domestic savings pdf to increase its economic productivity and foster the growth of more advanced jobs making more complex products wages rose giving rise to a consumer class that has mushroomed in 2019 the country that makes most of the world s clothes is now poised to overtake the us as the biggest market for them while clothing and footwear companies are looking for cheaper alternatives to make their products the garment industry offers an entry point to building the manufacturing base to spur this process since clothes are a relatively simple product to start making so are the conditions in countries such as bangladesh and vietnam just part of this road to economic development advertisement that s the million dollar question isn t it eti s buttle says in some ways you can look at china and say well actually they have managed to develop bangladesh for all the problems that still exist in its garment industry is better off today than it was a few decades ago but buttle notes china s economy wasn t nearly so dependent on garments as bangladesh is and even if it is getting richer as a whole that doesn t mean garment workers are receiving their fair share of the benefits there s an elite group who maybe are benefitting more than the mass of the workers he says nyu s baumann pauly separately points out that the garment industries around southeast asia haven t really followed china in graduating to making more complex items such as electronics that justify higher wages they re doing the same basic garments that they did 10 years ago most of them at least she says of factories in bangladesh then it s difficult to pay higher classes and higher wages and so they re pretty much stuck besides even if low wage industries can lead to development workers need not be mistreated along the way there s really no good justification for the dreadful conditions that persist advertisement to ensure workers are properly protected paid and able to attain some sort of advancement through the garment industry will probably require brands and others to come up with alternative models that disrupt in part or whole the cheap flexible and fast regime that characterizes much of fashion s supply chains the same is likely true incidentally if the fashion industry intends to reduce the tremendous strain it is placing on the environment there isn t one clear path forward but big stakeholders have been experimenting with different ways of doing things a collective action solution the eti points to collective action agreements as one option they let brands pool resources allowing them to accomplish together what no one brand could do on its own they also let them use their collected leverage over suppliers to make sure they pay their workers well and maintain a safe working environment lastly they spread the economic costs making them easier to bear cost is always a stumbling block who s going to pay is the perennial question asked in any effort to improve conditions and raise wages h m s sävman and jenny fagerlin the company s sustainability manager for global production believe this kind of industry wide agreement offers maybe the best path to reform one notable example is act which stands for action collaboration transformation and has brought together brands and trade unions in an effort to raise garment wages in factories in cambodia turkey and myanmar by having a number of powerful companies in agreement it reduces the price competition between them that drives down wages theoretically making it more feasible for factories to pay wages high enough for workers to support themselves and their families act also promotes workers organizing a condition experts believe to be necessary for real change and fagerlin says it helps move away from a transactional relationship between brands and their suppliers advertisement the most prominent case of this type of agreement is the accord the joint effort by brands and trade unions that formed after the rana plaza tragedy to share the work of inspecting and fixing factories in bangladesh s garment industry while arguably flawed it has accomplished much of the work it set out to do in the factories it targeted though factory owners and bangladesh s government are currently trying to push it out another promising approach is to have brands treat the factories that make their clothes as long term partners rather than temporary contractors in its most advanced form such a partnership creates supply chain interdependency the eti report says supply chain interdependency overcomes the problem of being non committal to suppliers shifting of commercial risk to supplier a hit run approach and flexibility of changing suppliers like your shirt baumann pauly is currently studying a company that is sourcing from ethiopia which is rising rapidly as a low cost destination paywall for making clothes it made a five year commitment to work with its suppliers and help them improve their productivity at this stage she can t name the company but she explains they know that in the first couple of years they will not make money from those suppliers but they want to get them there and so it s an entirely different business model saying we re in a partnership we accept losses at the beginning of this partnership but we think we can do this together raise productivity and then get us to a point where we both make money other options for changing the system include looking to governments to intervene or relying on the demands from ethical consumers who resolve to withhold their dollars from brands that don t reform but buttle points out that neither is a realistic path to change if you re provided with a cheap garment most people are just going to buy it without thinking about it he says there are i think more consumers who are asking these questions and more conscious of these kinds of issues but at the same time we shouldn t put too much of the emphasis on the consumer to do the work for the brands advertisement the global garment trade may yet see a major upheaval in the decades ahead not coming from labor movements but because of automation fashion has been slow developing robots that can handle stitching stretchy pliable fabrics in part because it has had an endless pool of cheap labor to draw on but it may only be a matter of time the international labour organization has warned that workers in the apparel and footwear industries particularly in southeast asia are at risk of being displaced in the millions and that governments should begin investing in preparing workers for higher value manufacturing the good news both buttle and baumann pauly say is that brands are really beginning to question how they do business at a fundamental level the hope is a new approach will emerge and take hold that really does improve the lives of the millions of garment workers cutting and sewing the clothes shoes and other items that people in rich countries such as the us buy wear and discard so casually the big aspiration for the new and growing garment industry in ethiopia for instance is that it can avoid the problems that have plagued the industry in countries such as bangladesh the hawassa industrial park inaugurated in 2016 as the largest industrial park in africa has new buildings and a modern sewage system the government there sees it as a key component in its plan to transform ethiopia into a manufacturing economy and even though pay was low when it opened workers were optimistic about the opportunities it might offer pvh corp owner of the tommy hilfiger and calvin klein brands is one of the companies that is producing its clothes there and has been honored by the us state department for its responsible conduct in ethiopia advertisement but already the story is starting to sound familiar complaints have surfaced that the pay in ethiopia s nascent garment industry isn t enough to live on a recent survey suggests the great majority of workers don t earn a living wage in march workers went on strike to protest the inadequate pay and poor conditions as new reports of labor abuses have cropped up pvh corp has vowed to investigate

it raises rates it lowers rates whatever it does the federal reserve always catches headlines for its decisions on monetary policy in an effort to reform the nation s banking system six men met at the jekyll island club in 1910 and drafted the framework for a central bank of the united states three years later president woodrow wilson signed it into law creating the federal reserve system that we hear so much about today in its modern form the fed does more than just make decisions on monetary policy it also ensures financial stability and supervises and regulates financial institutions as the central bank for the world s largest economy fed decisions are not only critical for the u s they have ripple effects across the world although the fed s decisions sound extremely technical changes to monetary policy have an impact on everyday life too fed decisions on interest rates for example have an impact on mortgage rates and the yield you earn on deposits but what is the federal reserve and how does it conduct monetary policy to steer the economy one board 12 districts the federal reserve system is a network of reserve banks scattered across the country all reporting to a board of governors based out of washington d c the federal reserve system is headed by a board of governors in washington d c and is comprised of 12 districts that cover the u s and its territories credit david foster yahoo finance there are 12 reserve banks each of which has a president who is tasked with monitoring the economic conditions in their assigned geographical boundaries they report to washington d c where the fed chair and six other governors head the system and form aggregated views of the u s economy every year four of the reserve bank presidents rotate into the federal open market committee a panel of fed officials tasked with setting monetary policy by design this system ensures that the committee decisions include a diversity of economic views from different corners of the country the fomc makes decisions eight times a year in two day meetings that usually conclude on a wednesday at the conclusion of those meetings the fomc announces updates on its stance of monetary policy usually to much media attention the fed chair used to host press conferences in every other fomc meeting but current chairman jerome powell has made himself available for press questions after every fomc meeting interest rates the fed has said that interest rates are its main tool for steering monetary policy but when the fed announces changes to its interest rates what is the central bank actually doing federal reserve chair jerome powell listens to a reporter s question during a news conference in washington wednesday march 20 2019 ap photo susan walsh in its fomc meetings the fed sets a target range for the federal funds rate the benchmark interest rate that ripples through the economy and affects the cost of borrowing for businesses and individuals when the fed adjusts rates it is effectively changing the price of money think of a bank loan the cost is not the principal of the loan itself it s the interest payments that you pay on the loan higher interest makes for more expensive borrowing costs and lower interest makes for cheaper borrowing costs the fed serves as the bankers bank and pays interest on reserves that banks park at the central bank overnight so when the fomc decides to for example raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points they will set a target like 2 25 to 2 50 to nudge interest rates up into that range the fed notches up its interest rate on bank reserves to set a new benchmark reference rate for the nation s largest lenders the fed also sets a floor for the effective federal funds rate through its reverse repurchase program a more in the weeds system that involves temporarily swapping securities for cash at a specified interest rate james bullard president and chief executive officer of federal reserve bank of st louis smiles during a bloomberg television interview at the jackson hole economic symposium sponsored by the federal reserve bank of kansas city in moran wyoming u s on friday aug 24 2018 photographer david paul morris bloomberg via getty images generally higher interest rates encourage banks to leave more money at the federal reserve therefore reducing the amount of money that the bank is willing to lend for the loans that they do issue such as mortgages and other consumer credit banks will also raise rates and thus increase borrowing costs across the economy the reverse happens when the fed lowers interest rates banks would have less incentive to leave money at the fed and would instead use its money to lend to businesses and consumers at lower borrowing cost levels for this reason increasing interest rates are often referred to as tight or contractionary policy since it is aimed at reducing borrowing activity in an economy that might be running hot lowering interest rates is referred to as loose or expansionary policy because lower rates are generally aimed at stimulating a tepid economy the fed makes judgment calls on rate changes depending on how it assesses the u s economy but congress gave the fed mandated goals that lawmakers could refer to when checking the fed s work on steering the economy those two goals are maximum employment and stable prices currently the fed gauges maximum employment as a low unemployment rate and looks at stable prices from the lens of a 2 inflation target the balance sheet but interest rates aren t the only lever that the fed uses to steer the economy after the financial crisis the fed took on trillions of dollars in assets to absorb the negative shock of the mortgage collapse as part of an effort to stop the contagion of the housing market the fed booked a large amount of agency mortgage backed securities and agency debt in a strategy of unconventional monetary policy called quantitative easing the move was designed to absorb the deteriorating assets and in turn inject liquidity into the economy the fed also added long term treasurys to its balance sheet as part of its operation twist program which flattened the yield curve and signaled its commitment to accommodative monetary policy as it attempted to crawl out of recession with the fed now in an effort to normalize rates the fed hopes to undo its holdings of these unconventional assets as well through the process of quantitative tightening the fed wants to clean its balance sheet so that it is primarily comprised of shorter term treasurys but why did the fed undertake this new monetary policy tool to begin with the fed lowered interest rates in order to stimulate an economy that was spiraling out of control and ended up hitting the zero bound meaning that policymakers under then fed chairman ben bernanke were forced to turn to a strategy of balance sheet management that had never been done before by undoing quantitative easing the fed is again entering uncharted territory sparking some uneasiness in markets over the impact of the process on market liquidity over just the last 15 years the fed has not only been the focus of financial market participants around the world it s been the focus of speculators who wonder how these new monetary policy tools will change central banking in the future brian

first a review of last week s events eur usd as said in the previous forecast the euro has returned to the boundaries of the four month downward channel and 70 of the experts supported by graphical analysis considered that in such a situation the european currency would continue to lose ground dropping into the zone of the 2019 lows 1 1175 1 1185 expectations of strong economic statistics from the us were pushing the euro down for the whole week confirming the validity of such a forecast the pair even exceeded the plan dropping to the level of 1 1110 by the middle of friday april 26 the released macroeconomic data did turn out to be quite positive orders for capital products rose from 0 1 to 1 3 while the gdp increased by one percent compared to the previous quarter 3 2 compared to 2 2 however the market considered that the goals set had already been achieved positions were closed before the weekend and after a slight correction the pair set a final point at the level of 1 1147 gbp usd the forecast for this pair was also quite accurate recall that the overwhelming majority of experts 75 had voted that the pair would be able to overcome the medium term level of support in the area of 1 2975 after which it would rush to the zone of 1 2770 1 2830 that is exactly what happened on tuesday april 23 the pair broke through this support and abruptly went down the week low was fixed at 1 2865 and the pair completed the five day period at the level of 1 2915 usd jpy analysts opinions on the behavior of this pair last week were almost equally divided a third voted for its growth a third were for a fall and a third for a continuation of the lateral movement as sometimes happens it was such a blurred forecast that turned out to be the most correct at first the pair moved in a very narrow side channel only 15 points wide then the volatility gradually started to grow and the pair rose to the level of 112 40 and then probably due to the fall in the pair with the yuan usd cny the dollar slipped to the japanese yen as well touching a local bottom at 111 35 after that the pair returned to the horizon 111 60 having lost about 30 points in a week cryptocurrencies as has been said many times the cryptocurrency movement is largely motivated by the news background at the same time 65 of experts believed that even with positive news the btc usd would fail to break through the resistance of 5 500 in the near future in case the news background gets worse the bears would try to press the pair to support 4 600 in general this forecast can be considered correct it was in the middle of the week that several attempts were made to consolidate above the upper boundary of this echelon and the pair stayed around 5 650 for some time however after it became known on thursday april 25 that the state of new york attorney s office accused the bitfinex cryptocurrency exchange of hiding the disappearance of 850 million of corporate and client funds the bitcoin quotes flew down on some exchanges the btc price dropped to 4 600 and at bitfinex itself the collapse was stopped at 5 065 the exchange management completely denies any losses stating that these funds have not been lost but confiscated and the exchange makes every effort to return them and intends to defend its good name in court the final of this criminal story has yet to be learned in the meantime the pair quotes have returned to the level of the beginning of the week to the 5 370 zone as for the major altcoins after the collapse unlike bitcoin they were not able to fully restore the lost positions ethereum eth usd lost about 9 5 during the week litecoin ltc usd fell by 11 0 and ripple xrp usd lost about the same amount 10 4 as for the forecast for the coming week summarizing the opinions of a number of analysts as well as forecasts made on the basis of a variety of methods of technical and graphical analysis we can say the following eur usd the relatively good performance of the us economy and growing concerns about the eurozone economy and in particular germany are forcing investors to look at the dollar as a protection against global economic and political risks thus on april 28 extraordinary parliamentary elections will be held in spain and in a month elections to the european parliament will take place fueled by the brexit problem the ambiguity of the outcome of these events pressures the euro as for the united states here the market will look at the rhetoric of the fed the next meeting of which will take place on may 1 the focus there will be the issue of a possible interest rate reduction among other events of the coming week it is necessary to note the publication of the report on inflation in the united states on monday april 29 the data on the eurozone gdp and the consumer price index hicp of germany on tuesday and the data on the eurozone consumer market and on the us labor market including nfp on friday may 3 last week the eur usd pair dropped to the level of 1 1110 which is not only the 2019 low but also the lowest value since mid 2017 and 75 of analysts supported by 90 of indicators on d1 believe that the fall will not stop here and the pair may first reach the lower boundary of the downward channel in the 1 1080 area and then go even lower to the zone 1 0970 1 1030 the remaining 25 of analysts are inclined to believe that the pair may linger in the range of 1 1110 1 1250 with pivot point in the area of 1 1175 for some time graphical analysis on h4 and 10 of oscillators on d1 which signal that the pair is oversold adhere to the same point of view it should be noted that in the transition to the medium term forecast the number of euro bulls who believe that the pair will return to the zone 1 1400 1 1600 is almost 55 gbp usd the pair has broken through the medium term support level at 1 2975 and the overwhelming majority of experts 90 supported by 100 of the oscillators and trend indicators on d1 believe that it will definitely retest the low of april 25 at 1 2865 and if successful sink to 1 2770 1 2830 the opposite point of view is expressed by 10 of analysts and graphical analysis on d1 indicating the zone 1 2985 1 3015 as the closest target the next resistance is 1 3065 as before 60 of experts still hope in the medium term for the bank of england to raise interest rates and as a result strengthen the british currency the next meeting of the regulator will be held on thursday 02 may however the likelihood of a rate hike is close to zero already this week usd jpy there is still no clarity about the movement of this pair and the opinions of the experts are almost equally divided a small advantage 55 is with the bulls expecting it to return to the level of 112 00 and possibly to the april 24 high at the height of 112 40 45 of analysts and graphical analysis on h4 strongly disagree with such a forecast they believe that the dollar will continue to fall first to the level of 111 35 and then to the level of 110 85 cryptocurrencies in a situation of uncertainty experts are divided into three equal camps the bears their target for bitcoin is 4 800 the bulls target 5 700 and the side trend supporters pivot point 5 300 at the same time 70 of respondents believe that the btc usd will rise above the level of 6 000 within may
by barani krishnan investing com it was a big week in oil with crude hitting 65 per barrel and 75 before falling back sharply from those six month highs donald trump was the reason for both the rise and fall proving once again his ability to surprise the market with the unexpected the u s president also tested the intelligence of energy traders by feeding them one of the most ludicrous tales in oil and getting at least some to buy the story trump opened the week by announcing that he was ending all sanction waivers for importers of iranian oil that was the surprise then came the ludicrous bit he claimed on friday that he had called opec to lower domestic gasoline prices which are up 27 on the year it s unclear how many traders genuinely believed trump and how many just needed an excuse to cash out of a seven week rally u s pump prices are determined as much by fuel demand stockpiles and refining margins as the crude provided by both opec and local drillers in any case trump s story brought the runaway rally in oil to a screeching halt handing bulls an unexpected 4 loss on the day and 2 setback on the week for the record opec s secretary general mohammed barkindo later denied having spoken with the president also the weekly reading on u s oil rigs published on friday showed a startling drop of 20 rigs that took the count to a 13 month low if anything it was testimony of trump s inability to convince even domestic drillers to rally production to offset opec s huge output cuts this year and the market may not have woken up fully to the severity of a contamination issue in russian oil that has now shut down 1 5 million barrels per day in delivery to refineries throughout europe even so friday s selloff was a signal that the upward momentum in oil could falter anytime even with the limited restriction on iranian oil now we explain why below separate u s sanctions on venezuela and a civil war in libya one negative for oil prices has been climbing and for those who still believe in goldman sachs forecasts despite the wall street bank being more wrong than right these days on commodities brent prices have already topped out for this quarter at 75 that means the

expected to stick to its dovish script in the coming week s monthly policy meeting of the u s central bank those long on the yellow metal are looking at recapturing 1 300 pricing despite being socked for most of last week by a strong dollar to gold bugs friday s rebound particularly held promise it came after a vigorous quarterly reading for the u s gdp that should rightly sparked a wall street rally energy review to reiterate it was a big week for oil with the trump cabinet ramping up effort to bring iranian crude exports to zero and the rouhani administration to its knees neither would happen say analysts who point to beijing s plans to continue buying oil from tehran and iran s proven legacy of being immune to the dictates of various u s presidents to many analysts it s still unimaginable that trump who needs low oil prices would seek a virtual ban on iranian supply amid the continued squeeze on global production by a very determined saudi arabia and ongoing outages in venezuela and libya a year ago the president seemed alright in accommodating some of the evil the rouhani regime was capable of with u s midterm elections being just months away but with the next presidential elections not until november 2020 and with a gleeful saudi arabia cheering from the sidelines at the prospect of its arch rival being choked off the market dealing iran the ultimate punishment seemed right in trump s eyes aside from trump s disputable call to opec the week was made more interesting by the saudi energy minister s thoughtful reminder to the president that the u s shouldn t count on the kingdom to raise output immediately to make up for lost iranian barrels khalid al falih maintained that he would provide customers of saudi oil with as much as supply as they needed but none would of it would be made preemptively on the notion that the market was short on oil because it simply wasn t he added it was shrewd saudi speak for show us the money and we ll show you the oil at near 65 for wti and 75 for brent falih can afford to drag out production and to an extent he was right about the market being adequately supplied with orbital insight a californian company using satellite trackers reporting that global crude inventories were up more than 140 million barrels year on year the other dark horse for production is the organic chloride contamination

obiageli ezekwesili is a star a huge one in terms of quality of political leadership by accident or design or both nigeria has had a raw deal she is an inspiration to anyone who knows her but physically meeting obiagaeli ezekwesili a former government minister and past vice president of the world bank for africa is an experience in itself i am not a politician excellent people skills and a mastery of the oratory form are invaluable tools for politicians seeking electoral advancement and now that obiageli ezekwesili has joined the political fray they are certainly useful but for many years she resented the political tag and famously in a tense testy head to head exchange with al jazeera s mehdi hasan in 2015 declared to the world i am not a politician ezekwesili 56 has come a long way from her state of mind when she made that emphatic statement and a lot of things have certainly changed but ezekwesili herself has remained the same after trying to build a consensus among the fringe presidential candidates who didn t belong to the big two all progressives congress apc and the peoples democratic party pdp ezekwesili announced her own presidential bid in october 2018 a relatively late entry that nonetheless caused ripples because of ezekwesili s outsize personality in her statement of declaration ezekwesili made it clear she was on a rescue mission albeit without the messiah complex it was all about the issues for her she wrote the pain of seeing us become a country where the worth of life is trending down to zero sadness that we are now known as the world poverty capital with 87 million extremely poor nigerians and anguish at the increase in the number of out of school children constitute a driving force for seeking the office of the president as is usually the case with these things ezekwesili was maligned and ridiculed but her drive was focused and unyielding describing the two major presidential candidates as merely two sides of the same coin that must be rejected ezekwesili professed a genuine alternative that was ready to rise up to the occasion of providing genuine leadership no frills or excuses a tantalizing possibility for those who dared to believe ezekwesili s campaign run by an incredibly motivated and accomplished team of young persons struggled to get the message out especially in a race corrupted by big money and stomach infrastructure recognizing this the ezekwesili campaign messaging zeroed in on the famously unbothered middle class as well as the undecideds first time voters and disillusioned persons who hadn t been bothered by any of the mainstream options were also target ezekwesili had the legitimacy of her name the recognizable face plus loads and loads of integrity earned from a life time of public service but she needed more it seemed born in 1963 in lagos as the first child of her parents ezekwesili attended the university of nigeria nsukka after earning a masters in international law and diplomacy from the university of lagos ezekwesili left nigeria for the united states this was on account of the heat she was getting from the abacha junta as one of the co founders and pioneer directors of transparency international an anti corruption coalition watchdog group that took its mandate seriously ezekwesili was accepted into the kennedy school of government at harvard university for a masters degree inpublic administration and upon completion of the program in 2000 was hired by world renowned american economist and professor jeffrey sachs at the harvard centre for international development madam due process her work with the centre brought her back to nigeria where she was involved in economic reform assistance projects president olusegun obasanjo a colleague from their transparency international days appointed ezekwesili as the pioneer head of the budget monitoring and price intelligence unit aka due process unit it was in this position that ezekwesili would prove her mettle earning for herself the sobriquet madam due process on account of her work leading a team of professionals to sanitize the public procurement and contracting processes at federal level her achievements in this space includes the bureau for public procurement legislation which helped make public procurement more transparent she was also one of the members of obasanjo s much heralded twelve man economic management team that achieved debt relief from the paris club and instituted the excess crude account on the strength of the impact of her work obasanjo appointed ezekwesili as minister for solid minerals development in this capacity ezekwesili worked tirelessly instituting reforms that would bring the mining sector up to global standards she was chair of the nigeria extractive industries transparency initiative neiti oversaw the first ever audit of the nation s oil and gas sector and left a legacy of increased transparency in the ministry perhaps her toughest nut to crack in the civil service came when obasanjo moved her to the education ministry in the one year that she spent at the ministry ezekwesili refocused the ministry to provide greater value for the nigerian people via the attainment of education for all targets and millennium development goals her now aborted adopt a public school initiative launched by the nigerian stock exchange in 2007 sought to improve the quality of public schools considerably around the country through it all ezekwesili cultivated and maintained a reputation that was supremely above board leading by example she ensured her work was loud enough to speak for her and brought on a dedication and passionate competence to work that was and still is quite rare in public service in his memoir the accidental public servant published in 2013 kaduna state governor nasir ahmad el rufai described ezekwesili s moral uprightness and consistency with an illustration of her inability to pay back about 30 000 in student loans acquired during her stay at harvard even with her earnings as a government minister in el rufai s telling the loans were a continuous source of bother to ezekwesili but it would never have occurred to her to consider using her influence or helping herself to the considerable public assets that were in her custody it wasn t until she joined the world bank as vice president that ezekwesili was able to pay off these loans in el rufai s telling many people would say that only someone like oby could be the final hurdle in approving billions of dollars in procurement in nigeria for four years and then have difficulty paying off a loan of 30 000 oby was simply incorruptible she worked for six years in the government in positions that if she wanted she could have had 50 000 delivered to her any time she wanted but she did not at the world bank ezekwesili promoted africa s economic interests and was not shy about dishing out tough love to presidents of countries like ghana and dr congo who were about to fall into the trap of the resource curse during her tenure as vice president overall lending in africa rose to over 40 billion and agricultural development and rural growth expanded paul kagame president of rwanda described her tenure thus our sisters from africa oby and ngozi okojo iweala have been competent leaders in this institution under the able leadership of bob zoellick who has also been a good friend of africa citizen in chief after her spell at the world bank it would have been perfectly kosher for ezekwesili to retire into a comfortable life in the consultancy and public lecture circuits she did that earning seats at several international boards but she did more too a mother of three boys ezekwesili returned to nigeria and was soon in the public eye again after the goodluck jonathan administration thoroughly mishandled the 2014 kidnap of over 276 girls from their secondary school in chibok borno state by the terror boko haram group ezekwesili quickly and noisily rallied on behalf of the powerless girls and their families as the co convener of the bringbackourgirls movement kickstarting a campaign that overcame modest origins in nigeria and soon assumed a global dimension as presidents celebrities and influential citizens donated time voice and resources naturally this did not endear ezekwesili to the government of the day good thing then that her motivations have always been based solely on the strength of her convictions the advocacy of bringbackourgirls indirectly led to the return of 164 girls five years later and the movement marked its fifth anniversary this april with a call for the government to intensify efforts to bring back the remaining girls perhaps no other nigerian has shown the kind of dedication transparency and willingness to lead by example as ezekwesili has shown in the last decade she has constantly put herself in harm s way surviving not just verbal but physical attacks on her person by naysayers rented thugs and even men of the police force who have inexplicably been used to oppose ezekwesili s purposeful activism her influence transcends her stellar career in both public and private sectors as the nation s model citizen she stands as a constant reminder that the right of every nigerian to a decent life is non negotiable and that society must do its part to maintain justice and equity in order to wall off a breeding ground for chaos she is the rare activist who doesn t just talk and prescribe and pontificate when the moment calls for it ezekwesili is ever willing to jump into the line of fire to show how to get the job done whether as a political aspirant or a staff of a bretton woods institution she was the first presidential candidate in nigeria to publish a detailed report of campaign expenses she credits her late father with instilling in his offspring the importance of character building and of being consistent with one s values hear her my dad always said that if you have the conviction you must have the courage to stand for it ezekwesili s relationship with nigeria has been a chequered one but she has no plans of giving up on the country now recognized as the world s capital of extreme poverty in her interviews and public speaking engagements she makes it quite clear that there is clearly a path away from mediocrity and underachievement and she continues to hold out hope but her hope is not an empty futile one it is one that is characterized by doing the hard work needed to move from one point to the other as a development expert she knows all too well how nations are built and she is prepared to put in the work writing a profile in time for the magazine s 100 most influential people in the world in 2015 sister rosemary nyirumbe an ugandan nun and aid worker captured the soul of ezekwesili s activism thus it has been a year and the chibok girls haven t been rescued but she has made a difference by speaking about it not just speaking but shouting i know some people will say she is too loudmouthed the loud mouth is needed people hear it we hear it alright the question is what are we willing to do with it

russian state owned miner alrosa pjsc the world s biggest producer of rough diamonds in carat terms has initiated a rupee rouble payment mechanism with its indian clients and has kicked off transactions with four five companies here a senior company executive said alrosa is increasing its marketing spend in india as it attempts to catch up with rival de beers in a market that is predicted to see a rebound in 2019 advertisement alrosa recorded rough diamond sales of over 533 million in just the first quarter of 2019 evgeny agureev director of the united selling organisation of alrosa the company s sales division said india accounted for sales of over 2 billion in 2018 and 700 million in 2017 of rough diamond sales for the russian firm alrosa and de beers the diamond exploration and marketing unit of multinational mining firm anglo american produce nearly half the world s rough diamonds india is the biggest cutter and polisher of diamonds globally advertisement having successfully tested the rouble payment mechanism with select indian and chinese clients late last year agureev said that while sanctions by the us on russia did not directly affect alrosa since the company had floated a mechanism for rouble denominated rough diamond sales well before the sanctions were imposed this was a hedge against the overwhelming dominance of the us dollar in the international rough diamond market settlements now we are actively developing practice of non dollar deals currently there are four five companies that consistently buy in other currencies and they buy not only in rupees or roubles but also in euros feedback from the companies is positive the mechanism has been adjusted and now we do not face technical difficulties which we dealt with at the initial stage the total sum of completed transactions already amounts to tens of millions of dollars agureev told the indian express advertisement last year alrosa had signed long term agreements with 18 indian companies overall 173 companies from india buy alrosa s diamonds at auctions and through one time contracts agureev said globally the poor demand for stones valued at less than 100 a carat has been affecting diamond companies primarily due to a supply glut combined with the weakness of the indian rupee and the difficulty faced by gem cutters in accessing financing here after the nirav modi controversy analysts expect the oversupply of smaller sized diamonds globally resulting from large production in russia and australia to ease in the coming months as demand improves advertisement while the rupee had fallen nearly 6 per cent against the dollar over the last year the slide has been arrested this year with the rupee gaining nearly 2 cent against the greenback over the last three months the rebound in the rupee is being seen as a positive for the market plus demand has been steady in the us since the beginning of this year while the indian market has see a strengthening since the fourth quarter of last year after a weak first half of 2018 in 2018 alrosa s total diamond sales grew six per cent year on year to 4 5 billion with rough diamond sales pegged at 4 4 billion and polished diamond sales at 95 3 million de beers sales increased four per cent to 6 1 billion in 2018 with rough diamond sales increasing by four per cent to 5 4 billion preliminary data for 2019 according to de beers indicated an improvement in global consumer demand for diamond jewellery in us dollar terms in india the problem of reduced local demand primarily attributed to the significant depreciation of the rupee in us dollar terms is getting eased advertisement according to mark cutifani ceo anglo american although current economic forecasts remain positive the outlook for 2019 global diamond jewellery consumer demand faces a number of headwinds including the risk of a potential intensification of us china trade tensions the chinese government s ability to rebalance economic growth towards consumption and further exchange rate volatility production in 2019 is expected to be in the range of 31 33 million carats subject to trading conditions cutifani had said at the anglo american preliminary results announcement for 2018 on february 21 on investments by indian companies in the russian diamond value chain agureev said that russia is focusing on developing its own cutting and polishing industry and that kgk group a hong kong based company promoted by indian origin businessman navrattan kothari had invested around 50 million in setting up a diamond cutting and polishing factory in vladivostok in russia s far east region kgk group has been developing cooperation with russia for a long time now the cutting factory in vladivostok is a result of cooperation of alrosa and the leading global producer of precious stones and jewelry the kgk group kgk became one of the first foreign companies that took advantage of the preferential regime of the free port of vladivostok having obtained the resident status for its subsidiary agureev said adding that he expects indian firms to tap into the russian diamond value chain
it raises rates it lowers rates whatever it does the federal reserve always catches headlines for its decisions on monetary policy in an effort to reform the nation s banking system six men met at the jekyll island club in 1910 and drafted the framework for a central bank of the united states three years later president woodrow wilson signed it into law creating the federal reserve system that we hear so much about today in its modern form the fed does more than just make decisions on monetary policy it also ensures financial stability and supervises and regulates financial institutions as the central bank for the world s largest economy fed decisions are not only critical for the u s they have ripple effects across the world although the fed s decisions sound extremely technical changes to monetary policy have an impact on everyday life too fed decisions on interest rates for example have an impact on mortgage rates and the yield you earn on deposits but what is the federal reserve and how does it conduct monetary policy to steer the economy one board 12 districts the federal reserve system is a network of reserve banks scattered across the country all reporting to a board of governors based out of washington d c the federal reserve system is headed by a board of governors in washington d c and is comprised of 12 districts that cover the u s and its territories credit david foster yahoo finance there are 12 reserve banks each of which has a president who is tasked with monitoring the economic conditions in their assigned geographical boundaries they report to washington d c where the fed chair and six other governors head the system and form aggregated views of the u s economy every year four of the reserve bank presidents rotate into the federal open market committee a panel of fed officials tasked with setting monetary policy by design this system ensures that the committee decisions include a diversity of economic views from different corners of the country the fomc makes decisions eight times a year in two day meetings that usually conclude on a wednesday at the conclusion of those meetings the fomc announces updates on its stance of monetary policy usually to much media attention the fed chair used to host press conferences in every other fomc meeting but current chairman jerome powell has made himself available for press questions after every fomc meeting story continues interest rates the fed has said that interest rates are its main tool for steering monetary policy but when the fed announces changes to its interest rates what is the central bank actually doing federal reserve chair jerome powell listens to a reporter s question during a news conference in washington wednesday march 20 2019 ap photo susan walsh in its fomc meetings the fed sets a target range for the federal funds rate the benchmark interest rate that ripples through the economy and affects the cost of borrowing for businesses and individuals when the fed adjusts rates it is effectively changing the price of money think of a bank loan the cost is not the principal of the loan itself it s the interest payments that you pay on the loan higher interest makes for more expensive borrowing costs and lower interest makes for cheaper borrowing costs the fed serves as the bankers bank and pays interest on reserves that banks park at the central bank overnight so when the fomc decides to for example raise the federal funds rate by 25 basis points they will set a target like 2 25 to 2 50 to nudge interest rates up into that range the fed notches up its interest rate on bank reserves to set a new benchmark reference rate for the nation s largest lenders the fed also sets a floor for the effective federal funds rate through its reverse repurchase program a more in the weeds system that involves temporarily swapping securities for cash at a specified interest rate james bullard president and chief executive officer of federal reserve bank of st louis smiles during a bloomberg television interview at the jackson hole economic symposium sponsored by the federal reserve bank of kansas city in moran wyoming u s on friday aug 24 2018 photographer david paul morris bloomberg via getty images generally higher interest rates encourage banks to leave more money at the federal reserve therefore reducing the amount of money that the bank is willing to lend for the loans that they do issue such as mortgages and other consumer credit banks will also raise rates and thus increase borrowing costs across the economy the reverse happens when the fed lowers interest rates banks would have less incentive to leave money at the fed and would instead use its money to lend to businesses and consumers at lower borrowing cost levels for this reason increasing interest rates are often referred to as tight or contractionary policy since it is aimed at reducing borrowing activity in an economy that might be running hot lowering interest rates is referred to as loose or expansionary policy because lower rates are generally aimed at stimulating a tepid economy the fed makes judgment calls on rate changes depending on how it assesses the u s economy but congress gave the fed mandated goals that lawmakers could refer to when checking the fed s work on steering the economy those two goals are maximum employment and stable prices currently the fed gauges maximum employment as a low unemployment rate and looks at stable prices from the lens of a 2 inflation target the balance sheet but interest rates aren t the only lever that the fed uses to steer the economy after the financial crisis the fed took on trillions of dollars in assets to absorb the negative shock of the mortgage collapse as part of an effort to stop the contagion of the housing market the fed booked a large amount of agency mortgage backed securities and agency debt in a strategy of unconventional monetary policy called quantitative easing the move was designed to absorb the deteriorating assets and in turn inject liquidity into the economy the fed also added long term treasurys to its balance sheet as part of its operation twist program which flattened the yield curve and signaled its commitment to accommodative monetary policy as it attempted to crawl out of recession with the fed now in an effort to normalize rates the fed hopes to undo its holdings of these unconventional assets as well through the process of quantitative tightening the fed wants to clean its balance sheet so that it is primarily comprised of shorter term treasurys but why did the fed undertake this new monetary policy tool to begin with the fed lowered interest rates in order to stimulate an economy that was spiraling out of control and ended up hitting the zero bound meaning that policymakers under then fed chairman ben bernanke were forced to turn to a strategy of balance sheet management that had never been done before by undoing quantitative easing the fed is again entering uncharted territory sparking some uneasiness in markets over the impact of the process on market liquidity over just the last 15 years the fed has not only been the focus of financial market participants around the world it s been the focus of speculators who wonder how these new monetary policy tools will change central

by barrington m salmon nnpa newswire contributor disney heiress abigail disney is the latest critic of the vast disparity between workers and business executives to level intense and passionate criticism at a system that allows ceos to rake in unbelievable amounts of cash stock options and benefits while ordinary workers languish in stagnation in tweets and a recent op ed in the washington post disney excoriated disney ceo bob iger who made 65 million in 2018 which is 1 424 times greater than the median income of the average disney worker it is time to call out the men and women who lead us and to draw a line in the sand about how low we are prepared to let hardworking people sink while top management takes home ever more outrageous sums of money disney wrote in the opinion piece it is unreasonable to expect corporate boards to act as a check on this trend they are almost universally made up of ceos former ceos and people who long to be ceos to put that gap in context in 1978 the average ceo made about 30 times a typical worker s salary since 1978 ceo pay has grown by 937 percent while the pay of an average worker grew just 11 2 percent this growth in inequality has affected every corner of american life disney granddaughter of roy disney co founder of the legendary company with his brother walt is a philanthropist activist founder of peace is loud and co founder of level forward a start up that backs media projects of women and people of color to develop films podcasts stage shows and related projects at the pay levels we are talking about an executive giving up half his bonus has zero effect on his quality of life she said for the people at the bottom it could mean a ticket out of poverty or debt it could offer access to decent health care or an education for a child disney appealed to the moral conscience of the walt disney co leadership lead if any of this rings any moral bells for you know that you are uniquely situated to model a different way of doing business she wrote you do not exist merely for the benefit of shareholders and managers reward all the people who make you successful help rebuild the american middle class and respect the dignity of the men and women who work just as hard as you do to make disney the amazing company it is nobel prize winning economist joseph e stiglitz agreed with disney telling democracy now s amy goodman and juan gonzalez in an april 24 interview that capitalism hasn t been working for most americans for the last 40 years she s absolutely right you mentioned that in the late 70s it was 30 to one on average today it s over 300 to one said stiglitz a columbia university professor professor and chief economist at the roosevelt institute and former chairman of the council of economic advisers under president bill clinton and it s not as if our ceos have gotten 10 times as productive in those intervening years it s not as if you know american ceos get paid so much more than their workers relative to those in europe and even more relative to those in japan and it s not because our ceos are that much more productive it s because we have a real problem in our corporate governance laws in our norms that allow them to take away that much money stiglitz author of a new book people power and profits progressive capitalism for an age of discontent said using ceo bonus money to share the wealth among disney employees as disney suggests would make a significant difference to workers that money could also have gone into investment he said you know one of the striking things about the united states today is that while the rates of return are very very high relative to what they ve been in the past the levels of investment have been low so you would have thought those two would have gone together but with ceo pay and share buybacks being so large trillion dollars of share buybacks last year the money isn t going either to workers or to investment the widening wage gap and widespread disparities have been news lately with rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny vermont sen bernie sanders billionaire investor warren buffett entrepreneur and venture capitalist nick hanaeur activists from the left progressives and others leading the charge against and warning about the consequences of the excesses of the uber rich ocasio cortez a freshman legislator has proposed a 70 percent tax on incomes over 10 million while sen elizabeth warren posited a wealth tax of 2 percent for those whose net worth exceeds 50 million and sanders has suggested increasing the estate tax for estates above 1 billion so that children of billionaires do not unfairly reap the windfalls regular americans don t get all of which has caused consternation in wealthy circles they have been increasing critical of a republican tax cut in 2017 that transferred about 1 2 trillion of wealth from the middle class to the super rich and politicians and a business elite who have done little to address and alleviate the financial challenges that face their workers in 2018 the united way released data collected over 10 years that offers a disturbing snapshot of where the united states stands since the 2008 recession ended the alice asset limit income constrained employed project shows that almost 51 million americans make less than what s needed to survive in the modern economy stephanie hoopes the project s senior researcher said that number includes 16 1 million households living in poverty as well as the 34 7 million families that fall under the alice classification that translates to what she said is a staggering 43 percent of american households that can t afford basics such as food child care health care transportation and a cell phone there are many different alice stories some people are in different situations because of health problems natural disasters and a number of other issues hoopes said usually people who are in this field totally understand the magnitude of this problem the cause is a mismatch between basic elements of the average household budget and what people are making housing childcare food transportation and healthcare are increasing faster than inflation overall and faster than wages increasing wages would help offset fluctuating wages unpredictable hours and workhours incompatible with childcare america s working class is caught in an economic vice fueled by decades of stagnant wages the weakening of organized labor by republican lawmakers gaming of the system by politicians and corporations minimum wages for fast food and service jobs employees unemployment the spiraling cost of food medicine and rent gentrification foreclosures and the severe shortage of affordable housing dr elise gould a senior researcher at the washington d c based economic policy institute epi said research conducted by epi experts scholars and researchers corroborates the united way findings there are a lot of people working who are still in poverty said dr gould whose areas of expertise include wages poverty jobs healthcare and economic mobility we put data out titled 50 years after the poor people s campaign poverty persists because of a stingy safety net and a dysfunctional labor market which shows that a number of americans living in poverty who may be in school or retired but two thirds are otherwise employable of those 63 percent are working and 45 5 percent of them work fulltime stiglitz said the promise of decent well paying jobs a sturdy social safety net and retirement security has faded and the social contract between politicians corporations and the public is increasingly being ignored people need more jobs jobs that have more hours and the pay needs to be higher what people are earning is simply insufficient we also need a better safety net for caregivers and students stiglitz said in an article titled the american economy is rigged and what we can do about it it seems like people are working really hard and low income workers are more educated than ever before but the data make it clear that millions of people who are active participants in the labor market are unable to make ends meet either due to insufficient hours or low wages the basic perquisites of a middle class life including a secure old age are no longer attainable for most americans stiglitz continued we need to guarantee access to health care we need to strengthen and reform retirement programs which have put an increasing burden of risk management on workers who are expected to manage their portfolios to guard simultaneously against the risks of inflation and market collapse and which opened them up to exploitation by our financial sector which sells them products designed to maximize bank fees rather than retirement security beverly hunt knows what it s like to live in such uncertain circumstances hunt a washington d c area resident for more than 20 years said significant health care challenges have jeopardized her wellbeing the communications and public relations veteran said she has been living an increasingly precarious existence since discovering that she has breast cancer four years ago i was very blessed when i was diagnosed with cancer because i had a good job and good insurance with an 80 20 split meaning 20 percent of the costs are borne by me said hunt a howard university graduate who has been in her career field for 30 years i was paying 200 a month for four whole years to one doctor this has affected everything with me it s scary even though i have a great insurance i still had to pay cash acupuncture is no longer covered and i haven t even begun to figure how to pay for radiation i m thinking i may wait for the full seven years when my credit is clear and start from there it s certainly taken a toll on my standard of living i know so many friends with no insurance and the consequences for them have been so much worse what they re dealing with has knocked people out of the middle class one serious illness being unemployed for several months a year or us baby boomers not being hired all this affects one s ability to stay in the middle class what i see among my peers is that they are jammed up deciding whether they are going to eat or pay bills

contributed to a heavy sell off across the market last year analysts pinned much of the blame on a statement issued late on friday following a politburo meeting chaired by president xi jinping in beijing they were particularly alarmed by a term that surfaced in state media reports of the meeting of top communist party leaders deleveraging that word set off alarm bells among investors still hurting from beijing s campaign against leverage in the country s financial system last year those reforms focused largely on so called shadow banking which before the clampdown saw lenders channel huge sums of money to fund managers who then invested it in stocks and tuesday from bloomberg intelligence qian wan and chang shu the central financial and economics affairs commission cfeac the communist party s top policy body headed by president xi jinping is focused on ongoing structural reform and deleveraging citing proactive fiscal policy and prudent monetary policy as key tools officials set a pragmatic growth target of 6 0 6 5 for 2019 the government plan also indicated credit growth in line with that of nominal gdp in 2019 echoing the people s bank of china s statement of maintaining macro leverage the shanghai composite was hammered 5 6 this week after last year s scare markets have good reason to fret the prospect of a return of chinese deleveraging along with the pboc restricting the floodgates i would add that if beijing actually plans to manage credit growth to be in line with nominal gdp the entire world has a big problem over the past year china s nominal gdp increased about 7 5 meanwhile chinese aggregate financing expanded at a double digit annualized rate during q1 this would imply a meaningful deceleration of credit growth through the remainder of the year don t expect that to go smoothly april 23 bloomberg the debt pain engulfing some of china s big conglomerates has intensified in recent days with more bond defaults asset freezes and payment

assets in singapore china and the u s after the unit failed to repay a loan citic guoan group co backed by a state owned company isn t certain whether it can pay a bond coupon due on april 27 the increased repayment stress sweeping some of china s biggest corporations is a sign that the liquidity crunch induced by a two year long deleveraging campaign is far from over despite an improving economy bonds from at least 44 chinese companies totaling 43 7 billion faced repayment pressure as of last week a 25 jump from the tally at the end of march the debt crisis at conglomerates can have more of a contagion impact on the corporate bond market compared with an average corporate default because those issuers typically have more creditors and large amount of outstanding debt said li kai a multi strategy investment director at genial flow asset management co chinese officials surely appreciate the risks associated with rampant debt growth they have carefully studied the japanese experience and have surely studied the history of financial crises beijing has had ample time to research bubbles yet they still have limited actual experience with credit booms and busts china has no experience with mortgage finance and housing bubbles they have never before managed an economy with a massively leveraged corporate sector with much of the borrowings via marketable debt issuance they have no experience with a multi trillion us money market complex and minimal with derivatives beijing has zero experience with a banking system that has inflated to about 40 tn financing a wildly imbalanced and structurally impaired economy not to mention fraud and malfeasance of epic proportions i m not confident beijing comprehends how deranged credit can become late in the cycle a system dominated by asset bubbles and malinvestment over time evolves into a crazed credit glutton keeping the historic chinese apartment bubble levitated will require enormous ongoing cheap credit keeping the incredibly bloated chinese corporate sector afloat will require only more ongoing cheap credit ditto for the frighteningly levered local government sector and the acute and unrelenting pressure on the banking system to support myriad bubbles with generous lending terms will require massive unending banking balance sheet expansion worse yet at this late terminal phase of the cycle it becomes impossible to control the flow of finance it will instinctively flood into speculation and non productive purposes has china studied the late twenties u s experience if beijing is serious about managing risk they have no option other than to move to rein in credit growth last year s market instability economic weakness and difficult trade negotiations forced officials to back off restraint and instead push forward with stimulus measures this had characteristics of a short term gambit chinese officials will not be slamming on the brakes but if they re serious about trying to manage credit and myriad risks it would be reasonable to expect the imposition of restraint upon the completion of u s trade negotiations indeed there are indications this transition has already commenced if this analysis has merit the global market backdrop is near an important inflection point potentially one of momentous consequence chinese credit growth is about to slow with negative ramifications for global market liquidity and economic expansion i would further argue that the synchronized global everything rally has ensured latent fragilities even beyond those that erupted last year the conventional view that china is now full speed ahead with stimulus resolving myriad issues could prove one of financial history s great episodes of wishful thinking it s worth recalling the 2018

449 and for much of the year de risking deleveraging at the periphery supported speculative flows to core u s securities markets u s equities bounced back from february s short vol blowup and went on a speculative run throughout the summer in the face of mounting global instability after trading below 90 for much of april the dollar index had risen to 95 by late may and 97 in mid august while the fed raised rates 25 bps in june and again in september financial conditions remained exceptionally loose ten year treasury yields traded down to 2 80 little changed from early february held down by global fragilities and the surging dollar high yield debt posted positive returns through september ignoring rapidly escalating risks the s p500 traded right at all time highs to begin the fourth quarter 10 3 the dam soon broke with crisis dynamics coming to fully envelop the core after a several month respite i m back on crisis dynamics watch carefully monitoring for indications of nascent risk aversion and waning liquidity at the periphery last year s market and economic developments provided important confirmation of the global bubble thesis including the fundamental proposition that major bubbles function quite poorly in reverse years of zero rates and qe had inflated myriad bubbles and a highly unbalanced global economy surreptitiously addicted to aggressive monetary stimulus as tepid as it was policy normalization had engendered latent fragilities though this predicament remained hidden so long as risk on held sway over the markets a speculative marketplace gleaned its own 2018 experience thesis confirmation central bankers won t tolerate bursting bubbles the dovish u turn sparked a major short squeeze unwind of bearish hedges and more generally a highly speculative market rally and in global markets dominated by a pool of trillions of trend following and performance chasing finance rallies tend to take on lives of their own with 2019 s surging markets and speculative leverage creating self reinforcing liquidity last year s waning liquidity and december s illiquidity scare are long forgotten but i ll offer a warning liquidity risk lies in wait when risk embracement runs its course and risk aversion begins to reappear it won t be long before anxious sellers outnumber buyers when risk off de risking deleveraging dynamics again attain momentum there will be a scarcity of players ready to accommodate the unwind of speculator leverage and when a meaningful portion of the marketplace decides to hedge market risk there will be a paucity of traders willing to take the other side of such trades and there s an additional important facet to the analysis come the next serious risk off market dislocation a further dovish u turn will not suffice that trump card was played surely earlier than central bankers had envisaged spoon fed markets will demand rate cuts and when rate cuts prove insufficient markets will impatiently clamor for more qe in january powell s abrupt inter meeting termination of policy normalization carried quite a punch markets were caught off guard with huge amounts of market hedges in place these days with markets already anticipating a rate cut this year one wouldn t expect the actual fed announcement in the midst of market instability to elicit a big market reaction the fed is clearly preparing for the next episode where it will be called upon to backstop faltering markets our central bankers will undoubtedly point to disinflation risk and consumer prices drifting below the fed s 2 target i ll expect markets to play along but without the shock effect of spurring a big market reversal with attendant risk embracement and speculative leveraging it s likely that a 25 bps rate cut will have only ephemeral impact on marketplace liquidity markets will quickly demand more qe and chairman powell is right back in the hot seat i m getting ahead of myself here but the reemployment of fed qe should be expected to have unintended consequences depending on relative u s versus global growth dynamics and market performance if as was the case last year king dollar and speculative flows to the core temporarily boost u s output it would be an interesting backdrop for restarting qe but let s get back to the present happenings at the periphery of the periphery seem to support the global liquidity

st paul if minnesota lawmakers can overcome their differences it should be easier to file your state taxes next year you might even get a tax cut or pay more with a month left to go in their legislative session tax policy is front and center again at the capitol the legislature has more work to do on the topic than usual this year because they were unable to agree on a bill in 2018 the biggest thing they want to do is take advantage of changes in the federal tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 that requires either conforming to federal tax policy or coming up with minnesota specific tax provisions republicans and democrats agree that passing a conformity bill is important without one state taxes will remain dramatically different from the federal code advertisement the agreement pretty much ends there democratic farmer labor party members see federal tax conformity as a chance to raise new revenues to fund priorities like education health care and what they like to call community prosperity they ve proposed more than 1 billion in new revenues largely from raising taxes on businesses and the wealthy dflers also want to increase gas taxes and fees on car sales and registrations to pay for transportation needs and they don t want to let a 2 tax on health care providers sunset in 2020 as planned describing house democrats plan tax committee chair rep paul marquart of dilworth said it finds those resources and sets the foundation for a dfl budget that invests in people and invests in making this state better republicans don t like any of democrats big ideas they say higher taxes won t make minnesota better instead they ve offered a tax bill that raises some new revenue but the new money goes toward tax cuts for the middle class and businesses they ve characterized their plan as protecting the taxpayer arguing that letting residents keep more of their money is best for the economy the best thing we can do for minnesota the best social program for minnesota is a job and opportunity said sen roger chamberlain r lino lakes who leads the senate tax committee why tax conformity the federal tax changes passed by the republican controlled congress and signed by president donald trump in 2017 dramatically remade the country s tax code rates for individuals and corporations were lowered but in exchange a lot of popular credits and deductions were curtailed or eliminated advertisement since minnesota uses federal tax policy as a starting point for the state s code not aligning with the 2017 changes means computing state taxes is now more difficult officials at the department of revenue spent months last year tweaking forms and computer code to keep the process relatively seamless for most minnesotans state leaders say a lack of matching the changes in the federal bill doesn t necessarily mean minnesotans are paying more in state taxes they just might not be getting all the benefits of the federal changes changes for individuals one of the biggest benefits for individual filers under the federal bill is a near doubling of the standard deduction at 24 000 for couples and 12 000 for individuals this is the amount you can lop off your income that is subject to tax families also saw an increase in the child tax credit however to pay for the bigger standard deduction a lot of credits and other deductions shrank or went away entirely taxpayers can no longer deduct as much mortgage interest property taxes or charitable donations as they did before the legislation another caveat of these changes is many of the benefits for individuals such as the lower rates and larger standard deduction go away but most of the things individuals gave up for them don t come back minnesota lawmakers largely want to mimic things in the federal bill that make it easier to file taxes they re proposing a larger standard deduction in exchange for fewer itemized write offs both parties use part of the new revenue that s raised in their bills to give individuals and families tax cuts advertisement republicans want to cut the second tax bracket from 7 05 to 6 65 by 2022 that impacts earnings between 26 521 to 87 110 for singles and 38 771 to 154 020 for married couples democrats want to aim their tax cuts at lower income families they ve proposed increasing the working family tax credit and giving a new break to those same taxpayers to help offset the cost of a proposed gas tax hike both parties also want to modify how much social security income is subject to tax to help seniors changes for businesses the federal changes cut business taxes from 35 to 21 it also allows businesses to bring money stashed overseas in tax shelters back to the u s at a lower tax rate small business owners who file for their company with individual returns also saw lower tax rates corporations also are now able to write off equipment purchases and other expenses more quickly state lawmakers are sort of picking and choosing which of these provisions they want to adopt and which ones they don t the most consequential is what they do with foreign income democrats want businesses with money held overseas to pay state taxes on it if they bring it back to the u s they hope to raise about 1 billion in new income from taxing foreign profits republicans worrying taxing that money may bring legal trouble have declined to do that advertisement transportation and other taxes outside of tax conformity democrats have other tax proposals that will raise more than 1 billion a year for transportation projects and maintain 700 million a year for state run health care programs gov tim walz campaigned on raising the state s gas tax 20 cents per gallon he s suggested phasing in that hike over two years and then tying the tax to inflation he also wants to increase vehicle registration fees and sales taxes on autos and borrow money for road projects all of that new revenue would pay for a 10 year plan to repair aging infrastructure build new roads and bridges and fund mass transit multiple studies have shown minnesota s roads are deteriorating and need new investment republicans also want to fix roads and bridges but they don t want to raise taxes to do it they re less concerned with funding mass transit as for funding gop leaders say they want to continue to have money from the state s general fund supplement dollars from existing taxes that are already dedicated to transit projects democrats have criticized that approach saying it s doing too little finally walz and dflers seek to maintain a 2 tax on health care providers that provides about 700 million a year for the health care access fund the fund helps pay for minnesotacare insurance for the working poor and other programs that improve health care access and affordability without the provider tax democrats say health care programs for the poor would be put at risk they worry federal funds that also support these programs will eventually go away advertisement republicans say it s a sick tax that increases the cost of health care they want to fund programs for the poor with money already in the budget what s next the republican led senate and democrat controlled house plan to pass all their budget bills including tax plans by may 1 but that will be just the first step in rewriting the state s tax code then party leaders will sit down with walz to negotiate the hope is the three sides will find common ground before the session ends may 20 without agreement the challenges of having a state tax code divergent from the federal rules will continue
the governors have come and gone over the years the legislative leaders have come and gone the budget crises have come and gone but in the louisiana state capitol economist jim richardson has been the one constant on state budget and tax issues over the past 32 years the lsu economics professor has served as an independent professionally unimpeachable authority on one of the most powerful government panels in the state but the self effacing richardson not one to draw attention to himself will step down during the next two months from his appointed position on the revenue estimating conference a four member government panel that determines how much money is available for lawmakers to spend each year the panel was created to prevent elected leaders from inflating revenue estimates out of thin air to voila have more money to spend
the government of prime minister imran khan has completed first eight months lot of hopes and good will expectations of pakistani public are along with this government the major challenge present government faced while taking prime minister office is of economy before the election campaign pti active social media team projected mr asad umer as a talented economic expert he was the only individual other than imran khan who was nominated publicly as a future finance minister the day imran khan sworn as a prime minister he told nation about accountability across board and no more corruption to support a challenging economy prime minister imran khan visited friendly countries and asked for financial help both china and saudi arabia extended their cooperation for pakistan this was a better start and things gradually were moving towards stability the famous american president thomas jefferson once said that government is best which governs the least because it s people discipline themselves cabinet ministers of pti government didn t learn from the mistakes of past rulers and instead of focusing more on real issues started criticizing opposition parties maybe at some point senior leadership of pti adopted this strategy to convince their supporters instead it turned worse for the country stock markets of pakistan touched the most low mark and investors lost billions of investments us dollar market price sky rocketed and prices of general goods also increased dramatically federal bureau of revenue fbr started tightening the free floating economy all these measures created a panic in large to medium corporations entrepreneurs traders and above all in the public of pakistan the former finance minister asad umer said in early days that we will not go to imf international monetary fund later he said we have no choice but to seek bailout from imf he failed miserably in managing the economy and also on controlling the narrative ultimately pm imran khan took resignation from the finance minister and also re shuffle whole federal cabinet economic meltdown in pakistan got further more alarming by border tensions at eastern border with india modi s government violate line of control and indian air force entered the pakistani air space quick and timely response by pakistan air force not only protected the borders of pakistan but give a strong massage to indian government that don t dare to enter territory of pakistan as a diplomatic gesture pakistan government also returned the captured pilot back to india indian intelligence designs to isolate pakistan in international community and to create economic hurdles are full exposed two of the right wing journalists who have a large number of following at print media and electronic television hassan nisar and haroon rasheed both helped creating a political career for imran khan hassan is a moderate columnist and rasheed is a religious writer with leaning towards central islamic ideology they both have publicly apologized for leading voters in wrong direction by convincing them to vote imran khan governance and economic finance are most focused tasks for any government in power similarly pm imran khan should have realized that playing a cricket is a totally different affair then running a government especially the performance is judged by different aspects of the society government needs to work with patience and team work fata tribal area in kpk province got affected by terrorism and war prime minister imran khan has given special attention to enhance confidence of fata residents this is a good initiative because this region is located along the pakistan afghan border and it s stability is much important for peace another progressive step of the government is to gift state of the art 24 million value jinnah hospital to the kabul government such step was needed to bridge the social gap between citizens of pakistan and afghanistan imran khan got a celebrity status and have many connections with international media now is the right time to work with logic and in true direction pakistan image building is important for the country yes the present governing infrastructure need reforms but nobody can let it go overnight good governance means to utilize present resources and achieve amazing results there are still many options available

for two days ending on april 27 beijing rolled out the red carpet for world leaders and representatives attending the belt and road forum but there were some noticeable absences amid the fanfare countries that didn t send their top leaders and protesting citizens who tried to gather at the chinese capital but were turned away beijing launched the one belt one road initiative obor also known as belt and road in 2013 its flagship foreign policy agenda to build up geopolitical influence via investments across southeast asia african europe and latin america this year marked the second time that beijing has hosted such a forum to facilitate the signing of deals with the first one held in 2017 leaders from 37 countries attended the forum according to china s official belt and road online portal the number represents a small group considering that beijing has signed cooperation agreements with 125 countries and 29 international organizations as of the end of march chinese leader xi jinping announced on april 27 that more than 64 billion worth of deals were signed at the forum he also sought to address the growing global criticism of obor by promising to deliver sustainable growth through the projects some partner nations have complained about the high cost of obor projects while some western governments such as the united states view it as a means to spread chinese influence abroad leaving poor countries with unsustainable debt in a separate statement china said it signed memorandums of understanding with various countries including italy peru barbados luxembourg peru and jamaica top leaders from eu economic powerhouses such as france germany and the united kingdom didn t attend prime ministers from asian economic powerhouses such as japan south korea and india also didn t attend neither did canadian or u s high level officials protests meanwhile many local chinese tried to make it to the chinese capital in hopes that the central government would listen to and resolve their grievances but they were arrested before they got there david malpass the newly named president of the world bank and formerly the undersecretary for international affairs at the u s treasury also skipped the forum his predecessor jim yong kim attended the forum two years ago meanwhile many local chinese tried to make it to the chinese capital in hopes that the central government would listen to and resolve their grievances but they were arrested before they got there gu guoping a resident of shanghai and a former university instructor has been trying to petition the chinese authorities since 2001 to seek compensation for his private property that was forcibly demolished by the local government in an april 25 phone interview with the chinese language epoch times gu explained that he and a group of about 80 petitioners from shanghai had traveled to the capital but they were all arrested by police when they arrived via high speed rail on april 21 gu estimated that more than several hundred petitioners from shanghai had come to beijing and were shortly after arrested after their arrests petitioners were sent to the shanghai administrative office in beijing and ordered to return to shanghai the chinese authorities treat petitioners like us as enemy forces as unstable factors they throw us into black jails put us in detention or sentence us to prison terms gu said in the days leading up to the belt and road forum authorities in the chinese capital also took measures to silence local activists and independent journalists radio free asia rfa recently reported that activist li wei has been placed under police surveillance since april 22 and he would be monitored until the end of the month meanwhile economic experts note that while the chinese regime has continued to campaign for obor beijing could be running out of capital to sustain the projects frank tian xie a business professor at the university of south carolina aiken explained in a recent interview with voice of america that china s recent economic downturn coupled with reduced chinese exports to the united states due to the ongoing trade war has drained china s foreign exchange surpluses think tanks and media have previously reported that obor construction and investments are by and large financed by china s foreign exchange reserves but owing to the trade war now china won t be able to build up its foreign reserves at the same pace as before which could take another hit if there are trade disputes with europe in the future xie predicted as a result beijing is going to find it difficult to financially push forward obor xie said chinese citizens also feel obor is not a financially sustainable project pan lu a former high school teacher at suzhou a city in coastal jiangsu province told rfa in a recent interview that he believed obor would not bring chinese people any real benefits on the contrary pan said that it would exacerbate china s current economic troubles reuters contributed to this report
sen elizabeth warren d mass might want to work on making her free college and debt forgiveness plan more progressive that might sound like a weird criticism for a candidate already vying for the left most lane in the 2020 primary but i don t mean progressive in the sense of more palatable synonym for liberal i mean progressive in the sense of more generous to the poor than the wealthy warren deserves credit for focusing the 2020 campaign on america s need to invest in human capital a college degree is one of the best investments a person can make with higher average returns than stocks bonds gold housing some elements in warren s plan are well targeted to help the neediest and most marginal students enroll in postsecondary education persist through graduation and succeed in the workplace these include calls to expand pell grants cover more non tuition expenses and increase funding for historically black colleges and universities but the core blockbuster components of warren s plan free four year public college and a debt jubilee are more problematic that s because they give bigger benefits to higher income families than to lower income ones that actually need the help which raises questions not only about fairness but also about wasted dollars take the free tuition proposal this would be a big giveaway to high income families who plan to send their kids to college anyway and don t need to be comped free college means it s free for bill gates kids too after all you would get more bang for the buck if you offered more generous aid to low income students phasing it out as you move up the income ladder free tuition for the poor plus assistance for non tuition expenses as warren proposes highly subsidized tuition for the middle class and full freight for gates children the student loan forgiveness plan has similar problems warren would wipe out up to 50 000 in debt for everyone in a household making up to 100 000 and then progressively smaller amounts for households with up to 250 000 that is households in the united states 95th income percentile for context despite sob stories suggesting that the typical young grad is a barista with 100 000 in debt most students borrow much less and go on to earn much more among students who first enrolled in college in 2003 during the subsequent six years 44 percent hadn t borrowed at all and another 25 percent had borrowed less than 10 000 just 2 percent had borrowed more than 50 000 and who does that borrowing well about half of all student debt is owed by people in the top income quartile only 10 percent is owed by borrowers in the bottom quartile additionally most student debt is owed by households who have graduate degrees a population likely to have much higher lifetime earnings in fact these people are borrowing in order to make more money it s no wonder then that the biggest beneficiaries of warren s debt forgiveness plan would be upper income households according to an analysis by brookings institution scholar adam looney he finds that low income borrowers people beneath the bottom 20th income percentile would save 569 in annual payments under the proposal compared with 2 653 for those in the 80th to 90th percentiles you might argue that political economy necessitates kicking some goodies to people who don t need them maybe you need to buy off wealthier voters to secure their support for helping the poor but that s not the argument the warren campaign makes rather it emphasizes that the overall policy would still be progressive because it would be funded by warren s wealth tax it s a redistribution from the richest 1 percent to the bottom 95 percent the overall flow of money here is extremely progressive a senior campaign aide told me maybe but there are better ways to help the working and middle classes without transferring money from the 99th percentile to the 95th in fact we already have a program for doing this with student loans they re called income driven repayment plans which typically cap monthly payments at 10 percent of discretionary income that is adjusted gross income minus 150 percent of the poverty threshold they also generally offer forgiveness after 20 years under current law almost every borrower is already eligible for these plans but enrollment is low because a people don t know about them and b the red tape is a nightmare i get it reduce red tape to make existing programs work better is less sexy than poof everyone s debts be gone but if anyone could sell such practical wonkishness it s warren

agreements and we don t have any news any information from our saudi partners and any other opec member that they are ready to exit these agreements markets are focused on whether or not china remains critical of the us decision on ending of waivers on purchasing iranian crude putin took the opportunity to say russia would be willing to meet china s oil demand needs which would imply the russians are eager to ramp up production russia appears to have every reason to resume ramping up production levels and the base case should start to become we will not see opec agree upon extending production cuts with tweaks to cover the shortfall from iran if we do see an agreement it would be surprising if we did see the russians deliver 100 compliance the russian president did not deliver any updates on the contaminated oil in the druzhba pipeline to europe oil remains very vulnerable here but we could see some range trading here until wednesday s fed meeting if we do see the fed become more concern with low inflation and hint that we could see an insurance rate cut that could provide a major dollar reversal which should help propel risk assets and stabilize any weakness we see with crude early in the week crude prices are slowly losing some of the key catalysts from this major rally and if we see the velocity in rising us production heat up sellers may become in control in the short term the alleviation of global growth concerns will likely see a pickup in demand for oil while the supply side argument will likely become bearish in the coming months if we see a major dollar reversal that should help oil prices become supported on any major selloffs gold the precious metal did not break last week despite major dollar strength in the first half of the week the big event for this week could be the fed s rate decision on wednesday if they signal that we could see a rate cut later in the year that could be the key catalyst for gold to regain bullish momentum the fed is likely to wait until after the summer if they were to signal a rate cut but if they are overly concerned with tame inflation they could tee up a cut sooner for the end of the year content is for

rep ro khanna d calif talks to bernie sanders before the senator from vermont takes the stage in sanders khanna whose district includes silicon valley found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country s most vexing problems inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism photo by nick otto for the washington post palo alto calif a perfect california day the sun was shining a gentle breeze was blowing and at a silicon valley coffee shop rep ro khanna was sitting across from one of his many billionaire constituents discussing an uncomfortable subject the growing unpopularity of billionaires and their giant tech companies there s some more humility out here khanna d calif said the billionaire on the other side of the table let out a nervous laugh chris larsen was on his third start up and well on his way to being one of the wealthiest people in the valley if not the world realizing people hate your guts has some value he joked for decades democrats and republicans have hailed america s business elite especially in silicon valley as the country s salvation the government might be gridlocked the electorate angry and divided but america s innovators seemed to promise a relatively pain free way out of the mess their companies produced an endless series of products that kept the u s economy churning and its gross domestic product climbing their philanthropic efforts were aimed at fixing some of the country s most vexing problems government s role was to stay out of the way now that consensus is shattering for the first time in decades capitalism s future is a subject of debate among presidential hopefuls and a source of growing angst for america s business elite in places such as silicon valley the slopes of davos switzerland and the halls of harvard business school there is a sense that the kind of capitalism that once made america an economic envy is responsible for the growing inequality and anger that is tearing the country apart on a quiet weekday at a strip mall coffee shop the conversation between khanna and larsen turned to what went so wrong americans still loved technology khanna said but too many of them felt locked out of the country s economic future and were looking for someone to blame what happened to us he imagined people in these left behind places asking part of khanna s solution was to sign on as co chairman of the presidential campaign of sen bernie sanders i vt the democratic socialist who rose to the national stage by railing against the handful of billionaires who control the economic and political life of this nation and who disproportionately live in khanna s district the other part of khanna s solution was to do what he was doing now talking to billionaire tech executives like larsen who worried that the current path for both capitalism and silicon valley was unsustainable boosted by a cryptocurrency spike last year larsen s net worth had briefly hit 59 billion making him the fifth richest person in the world before the currency s value fell without an intervention he worried that wealth would continue to pile up in silicon valley and anger in the country would continue to grow it seems like every company in the world has to be here larsen said it s just painfully obvious that the blob is getting bigger at some point larsen and khanna worried something was going to break the 2008 financial crisis may have revealed the weaknesses of american capitalism but it was donald trump s election and the pent up anger it exposed that left america s billionaire class fearful for capitalism s future khanna was elected in 2016 just as the anxiety started to spread in europe far right nationalist parties were gaining ground closer to home socialists and trump inspired nationalists were winning state and congressional elections conversations of the sort that khanna was having with larsen were now taking place in some of capitalism s most rarefied circles including harvard business school where last fall seth klarman a highly influential billionaire investor delivered what he described as a plaintive wail to the business community to fix capitalism before it was too late the setting was the opening of klarman hall a new 120 million conference center built with his family s donation it s a choice to pay people as little as you can or work them as hard as you can he told the audience gathered in the 1 000 seat auditorium it s a choice to maintain pleasant working conditions or harsh ones to offer good benefits or paltry ones if business leaders didn t ask hard questions about capitalism he warned that they would be asked by ideologues seeking to point fingers assign blame and make reckless changes to the system six months after that speech klarman was struck by how quickly his dire prediction was coming to pass leading politicians such as trump sanders and sen elizabeth warren d mass were advocating positions on tariffs wealth taxes and changes in corporate governance that would have been unthinkable a few years ago klarman wasn t opposed to more progressive taxation or regulation but he worried that these new proposals went much too far i think we re in the middle of a revolution not a guns revolution but a revolution where people on both extremes want to blow it up and good things don t happen to the vast majority of the population in a revolution he said he wasn t the only one who felt a sense of alarm one of the most popular classes at harvard business school home to the next generation of fortune 500 executives was a class on reimagining capitalism seven years ago the elective started with 28 students now there were nearly 300 taking it during that period the students had grown increasingly cynical about corporations and the government said rebecca henderson the harvard economist who teaches the course what the trust surveys say is what i see she said they are really worried about the direction in which the u s and the world is heading a few dozen of those students spent their winter break reading winners take all a book by anand giridharadas a journalist and former mckinsey consultant that had hit the best seller list and was provoking heated arguments in places like silicon valley davos and harvard business school giridharadas book was a withering attack on america s billionaire class and the notion that america s iconic capitalists could use their wealth and creativity to solve big social and economic problems that have eluded a plodding and divided government this spring giridharadas took his argument to klarman hall he slammed mark zuckerberg taking aim at the facebook founder s 100 million effort to fix newark s faltering schools and his 3 billion push to end disease in a generation i m glad he s trying to get rid of all the diseases i wish facebook wasn t a plague giridharadas said he trashed starbucks ceo howard schultz s independent presidential run as an effort to protect the interests of the uber wealthy and he lambasted the notion frequently championed by the likes of bill gates and barack obama that silicon valley s innovations would disrupt old hierarchies and spread capitalism s rewards really giridharadas asked now five companies control america instead of 100 and a lot of those companies are whiter and more male than the ones they disrupted for many of the students schooled in the notion that business could make a profit while making the world a better place giridharadas ideas were both energizing and disorienting erika uyterhoeven a second year student recalled one of her fellow classmates turning to her when giridharadas was finished so what should we do her colleague asked is he saying we shouldn t go into banking or consulting added another student there was a palpable sense of personal desperation khanna experienced a version of this desperation almost every day in his district he grew up in an overwhelmingly white middle class suburb of philadelphia after college and yale law school he moved to silicon valley in 2003 hoping to use his training as a lawyer to help set the rules for a lawless online world in 2014 backed by the tech community and a long roster of billionaire donors khanna challenged an eight term incumbent in a democratic primary and lost the defeat caused him to reflect on what he had missed in particular the problems that runaway capitalism were causing in his district where the median home value in formerly blue collar cities surged past 2 million the best thing that happened to me was that i lost my 2014 election he said had i won maybe i would ve been a traditional neoliberal it really forced my self reflection and it pointed out every weakness i ever had in california khanna s home is a small apartment around the corner from a dollar tree one of only two in his district his wife and two children live most of the year in washington where home values are cheaper his days are split between meetings with billionaires and his many constituents who are struggling to stay afloat amid silicon valley s success i am an 11 year renter with a master s degree a teacher told him at a meeting with school employees her question wasn t about whether she would ever be able to afford a home but about a fellow teacher who couldn t afford health insurance a few days earlier he had met with two activists who wanted his help pressuring big tech companies to pay contract janitorial and cafeteria workers a living wage khanna agreed to host a press event on their behalf the billionaires in khanna s district meanwhile were consumed by a different worry mixed in with the valley s usual frothy optimism about disruption and inventing the future was a growing sense that the tech economy had somehow broken capitalism the digital revolution had allowed tech entrepreneurs to build massive global companies without the big job producing factories or large workforces of the industrial era the result was more and more wealth concentrated in fewer hands as technology advanced some feared things were only going to get worse robots were eliminating much factory work online commerce was decimating retail and self driving cars were on the verge of phasing out truck drivers the next step was computers that could learn and think what happens if you can actually automate all human intellectual labor said greg brockman chairman of openai a company backed by several silicon valley billionaires such thinking computers might be able to diagnose diseases better than doctors by drawing on superhuman amounts of clinical research said brockman 30 they could displace a large number of office jobs eventually he said the job shortages would force the government to pay people to pursue their passions or simply live only andrew yang a long shot presidential candidate and tech entrepreneur supported the idea of government paying citizens a regular income but the idea of a universal basic income was discussed regularly in the valley the prospect was both energizing and terrifying openai had recently added an ethicist brockman sometimes referred to her as a philosopher to its staff of about 100 employees to help sort through the implications of its innovations to brockman a future without work seemed just as likely as one without meat a possibility that many in the valley viewed as a near certainty once we have meat substitutes as good as the real thing my expectation is that we re going to look back at eating meat as this terrible immoral thing he said the same could be true of work in a future in an era of advanced artificial intelligence we ll look back and say wow that was so crazy and almost immoral that people were forced to go and labor in order to be able to survive he said khanna heard such prophecies all the time but mostly discounted them as sci fi fantasy his focus was on fixing the version of capitalism that existed today he often pleaded with big tech executives to spend just 10 percent of their time thinking about what they could do for their country and 90 percent to their companies the tougher question was exactly what he wanted them to do with that 10 percent on a warm spring evening khanna was trying to answer that question for about two dozen silicon valley tech executives software engineers and venture capitalists the group gathered at a 5 million mediterranean style villa perched atop a hill overlooking cupertino which glittered in the valley below khanna described a december trip he organized to tiny jefferson iowa for a group of tech executives that included microsoft s chief technology officer and a linkedin co founder the executives donated to the community college s scholarship fund and paid to equip its computer lab with the goal of training 25 to 35 students for software developer jobs starting at 65 000 a year khanna had made similar trips to west virginia ohio and kentucky the total number of jobs these trips produced was small and the pay wasn t great still khanna believed they served a larger purpose they proved that people in silicon valley cared about places like jefferson a rural town of only 4 200 they gave people hope that even the remotest parts of america could take part in the country s tech revolution the next step khanna told the executives at the mansion in cupertino california was a 100 million effort to build 50 technology institutes similar to land grant colleges to train workers in left behind parts of america khanna had already introduced a bill that he admitted was unlikely to pass but that wasn t really the point it sets a blueprint he said khanna s blueprint reflected his broader view of how to unite an increasingly polarized country many democrats blamed trump s victory and the country s divisions on racial tensions as the nation grew more diverse and whites lost their favored positions khanna had a different view he saw the country s problems primarily as the product of growing income inequality and a lack of opportunity sometimes khanna imagined what people in these left behind parts of the country were thinking their grandparents had fought in world war ii and helped build the country s industrial age economy now they worried people like khanna whose parents emigrated from india were surging past them they just got here and they are doing really really well khanna imagined these people saying what happened to us not everyone at the tech gathering was buying khanna s analysis atam rao a nuclear engineer told khanna that he had come to the united states from india 50 years earlier rao s son who founded a successful video game company in los angeles was born in america the day after trump was elected his son suggested shifting some money to a bank account in india just in case they needed to return someday are we welcome here he said his son asked he believed that khanna was underestimating the racial anger in the country they found someone to blame rao said of trump and his backers this is not going to be won by logic but that wasn t the america khanna knew it didn t fit with his experience growing up in suburban philadelphia or arriving in silicon valley where indians had become rock stars and ceos of companies such as google and it didn t comport with the results of the 2018 election he said now speaking directly to rao the same country that elected trump just elected the most diverse congress in the country s history khanna said khanna didn t deny the problem of racism but like sanders he saw the country s divisions primarily through the prism of capitalism s shortcomings and the economy not race a few days after the meeting at the cupertino mansion khanna was standing in front of 16 000 amped up sanders supporters the san francisco skyline rose in front of him and the golden gate bridge spanned the bay behind him in his gray suit and pressed white shirt the two term congressman looked a bit out of place an emissary from establishment washington crashing someone else s revolution khanna gave a brief speech introducing sanders who a few minutes later rushed onto the stage and into the same campaign spiel he had been delivering since the 2016 democratic primaries he bashed the billionaire class and its influence over american elections democracy means one person one vote and not billionaires buying elections sanders yelled in his brooklyn growl we say no to oligarchy he continued yes to democracy khanna s eyes fixed on steve spinner a big tech investor in silicon valley and major fundraiser for obama s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns spinner who chaired khanna s congressional win was listening with his arms folded across his fleece vest we dragged him out here khanna said he s about as far from bernie as you can get many of khanna s billionaire supporters even those who worried about capitalism and inequality seemed genuinely puzzled by khanna s affection for sanders for khanna it was simple in sanders khanna found a candidate who shared his diagnosis of the country s most vexing problems inequality and the failures of unrestrained capitalism sanders wasn t a perfect match for khanna sanders didn t really understand the tech industry though he wasn t calling for the breakup of big tech companies like warren and some other candidates warren s proposal if executed would hurt companies in khanna s district and alienate some of his wealthiest backers khanna wished sanders would talk more about the greatness of the american economy and the power of the tech industry when properly taxed and regulated to lift people out of poverty but on that score khanna believed he could help sanders we can quibble over his plans to solve this issue or that issue khanna said but i have no doubt that if bernie sanders was in the white house he d wake up every day thinking how do i solve structural inequality in america the 77 year old socialist s speech had passed the one hour mark and the crowd was still laughing cheering hooting and shouting we re probably not going to get a lot of support from the one percent and the large profitable corporations sanders said a voice in the crowd screamed an expletive that s ok sanders continued i don t need and we don t want their support the congressman in the gray suit gazed out at the crowd which stretched to the back of the park khanna saw sanders revolution as an imperfect solution to a near impossible problem for now though it was the best he could find rep ro khanna d calif

for the outstanding job they did to take care of our customers despite the challenges with our fleet during the quarter their hard work led american to record revenue performance under difficult operating conditions said chairman and ceo doug parker as we progress toward the busy summer travel period demand for our product remains strong however our near term earnings forecast has been affected by the grounding of our boeing 737 max fleet which we have removed from scheduled flying through aug 19 we presently estimate the grounding of the 737 max will impact our 2019 pre tax earnings by approximately 350 million with the recent run up in oil prices fuel expenses for the year are also expected to be approximately 650 million higher than we forecast just three months ago even with these challenges we expect our 2019 earnings per diluted share excluding net special items2 to grow approximately 10 versus 2018 parker continued as we look forward to 2020 and beyond we anticipate that our free cash flow production will increase significantly as our historic fleet replacement program winds down we are very bullish on our future and focused on creating value for our

federal aviation administration faa grounded all u s registered 737 max aircraft the american fleet currently includes 24 737 max 8 aircraft with an additional 76 aircraft on order as a result

tax income by approximately 80 million the company has removed all 737 max flying from its flight schedule through aug 19 which is approximately 115 flights per day these flights represent approximately 2 of american s total capacity each day this summer although these aircraft represent a small portion of the company s total fleet its financial impact is disproportionate as most of the revenue from the cancellations is lost while the vast majority of the costs remain in place in total the company presently expects the 737 max cancellations which are assumed to extend through aug 19 to impact its 2019 pre tax earnings by approximately 350 million strategic objectives american s success is guided by three strategic objectives make culture a competitive advantage create a world

washington momentum is growing in washington to approve an increase in the fee airline passengers pay to help improve the nation s airports with an unusual mix of democratic house leaders and historically anti tax conservatives helping push the effort the passenger facility charge is currently a maximum of 4 50 per person per flight segment and hasn t gone up in 19 years it s limited to two flight segments on a one way trip which means a consumer pays no more than 9 per trip it s up to eligible airports how much to charge the fee is folded into the price of a ticket and virtually all airports levy some amount the increase could wind up in a big legislative package aimed at improving and funding infrastructure president donald trump is scheduled to meet with democratic leaders house speaker nancy pelosi of california and senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york on tuesday morning to discuss infrastructure and related issues for years republicans in charge of house transportation legislation resisted higher fees while the senate has been sympathetic but political times have changed transportation secretary elaine chao recently said she would not rule out a higher fee advertising she was asked at a senate hearing on transportation spending last month whether she was willing to embrace the idea of lifting the cap on airport facility charges to help pay for airport improvements well i think the good news is you know nothing is off the table chao said rep peter defazio the oregon democrat who since january has chaired the house transportation and infrastructure committee called permitting a higher airline passenger fee a priority for me airports are in need of rehabilitating runways and renovating aging and overcrowded terminals they also are in need of adding more gates which will increase airline competition and lower ticket prices as well as help passengers avoid sitting on the tarmac when they land defazio told mcclatchy experts at conservative organizations such as freedomworks and the heritage foundation whose officials have long pushed for lower taxes are behind the effort they view the increase as a user fee and boost to free market forces rather than a tax all this creates a climate that s absolutely better for advocates of allowing the fee to rise said annie russo senior vice president of government and political affairs at the airports council international which has pushed for changes in the fee advertising among the ideas being discussed in washington transportation circles would be to allow airports to charge passengers as much as 8 50 per flight segment and then be able to increase the amount each year to match inflation another idea is to remove the cap altogether the opposition to increased fees remains formidable the nation s airlines whose clout has helped keep the charge unchanged for years a boom in airport construction is underway said sharon pinkerton senior vice president for policy at airlines for america the airline industry trade group she cited data showing airport revenues are soaring and noted airlines and passengers already pay billions of dollars annually through a variety of fees and taxes the passenger facility charge is expected to provide about 3 6 billion this year according to federal data other airport revenue comes from a variety of sources including other taxes federal grants and non airline operations such as parking hotels and concessions airport industry officials counter the notion that the industry is flush with funds by pointing to a study showing airports will need not only 128 billion over the next five years for infrastructure projects but have 91 5 billion in debt burden for past work some republicans and conservative groups remain wary of any increase national taxpayers union president pete sepp warned that the current fee already can cost a family of four 72 roundtrip a sum that he said could easily double should the limit be lifted advertising sepp called the passenger facility charge pfc a government imposed burden on traveling taxpayers he added congress has a responsibility to keep that burden reasonable taxpayer groups should be cautious of efforts to increase the cap on pfcs he said that if some members of congress seem willing to take the drastic step of lifting the pfc cap then they should also be willing to consider comprehensive reforms that would work far better rep sam graves of missouri the transportation committee s top republican would not rule out uncapping the fee saying in terms of an infrastructure package all funding options are on the table but graves added i am skeptical of any proposal that adds to the traveling public s burden fails to fully consider the views of local communities and passengers and lacks a full range of financing options including private capital helping push the fee change are conservatives who argue it s not a tax but a useful economic development tool now hamstrung by federal intrusion i hate taxes but this is a true user fee said jason pye vice president for legislative affairs at freedomworks a conservative advocacy group advertising while congress sets the cap on the fee and the money is used to fund projects approved by the federal aviation administration the funds go to local airports all over the country for improvements to runways terminals gates and other needs washington should therefore not be getting involved in how much airports can charge passengers for improvements said david ditch research associate at the conservative heritage foundation the federal government is trying to control how airports collect money he said the market will determine how much of a fee is too much if it s 500 per person people would stop using the airport using the fee for a specific purpose makes it different from ordinary taxes which tend to go into a general fund for a variety of uses this isn t about raising taxes said marc scribner a senior fellow at the libertarian competitive enterprise institute it s about letting the free market do its job he said advocates maintain there is little consumer resistance to a higher fee and little danger the money will be misused advertising we need approval from the federal department of transportation and we have to sell the proposal in the community if an airport aims too high or tries to spend frivolously they ll hear about it said joel bacon executive vice president for government and political affairs at the american association of airport executives airports get help not only from the fee but also from a federal grant program that gets money from a variety of sources including ticket taxes and other aviation taxes and fees those funds are used for grants to airports usually for runways and other outside projects airlines for america contends that the grants and the passenger fee as well as other revenue sources combine to give airports plenty of cash currently the group said federal taxes and fees account for about 64 of the cost of a 300 domestic one stop round trip ticket make no mistake the group said in a statement a pfc increase would be a system wide and permanent tax increase with real repercussions airport groups vigorously dispute such claims and question why a 3 or 4 increase in the passenger fee would be any more onerous than say a fee for baggage or to choose a seat airlines for america s pinkerton noted there s a big difference between those charges and the passenger fee if you re going to travel you must pay the passenger fee you don t have to pay the baggage fees the passenger fee is not driven by need she said advertising now that democrats control the house congress is tilting focus toward airport infrastructure as lawmakers see facilities badly in need of upgrades and little political risk in increasing a fee by a few dollars you cannot have a big league economy with little league infrastructure said rep rick larsen a washington democrat who chairs the house aviation subcommittee you don t need to be an economist to see that infrastructure investments in the nation s airports fall far short of meeting local needs visit the mcclatchy washington bureau at www mcclatchydc com
a night view of the central business district in beijing photo xinhua the national bureau of statistics reported last week that china s top line gdp growth rate in the first quarter was 6 4 percent at the upper end of the government s target of 6 to 6 5 percent growth for 2019 this faster than expected growth gives policymakers some breathing room to continue a stable monetary policy and to implement fiscal policies aimed both at transforming the economy and at reducing the risks of accumulated debt chinese policymakers are dealing with the hard dilemma of simultaneously transforming the long term nature of the economy while avoiding short term inflation or recession to transform the economy the nation needs to continue to reduce outstanding debt levels and shift from overcapacity heavy and extractive industries to a more innovative consumer focused economy the danger is that moving too fast in that direction could throw lots of people out of work or cause the financial collapse of companies this quarter s data show that china is avoiding this short term dangers while still moving toward long term goals the consumer inflation rate was 1 8 percent year on year and producer prices went up only 0 2 percent a standard rule of thumb used by central bankers worldwide is that the inflation rate should be targeted at about 2 percent per year this rule is actually built in to the mandate of the european central bank so the stable monetary policy of the people s bank of china the nation s central bank is working the march unemployment rate in urban areas was 5 2 percent slightly below the level last year most economists define full employment as anything below 6 percent so we are not seeing significant problematic unemployment even during a period of major economic transformation other commonly used disaggregated growth measures are consistent with the top line measured gdp growth number for example production and supply of electricity thermal power gas and water increased by 7 1 percent in the quarter plus value added index of transport storage and post increased by 7 3 percent a closer look at the highest growth sectors shows that the economy is moving toward the long term goal of shifting away from a development strategy based on heavy investment in industry and infrastructure to one based on services and domestic consumption also more productive industries that turn out higher value added goods are growing at a much faster rate than traditional heavy industry among large companies state owned enterprises grew 4 5 percent year on year while shareholding enterprises grew almost twice as fast at 7 8 percent so strong progress is being made toward the goal of promoting private enterprise which was reinforced by many policies announced at last month s meeting of the national people s congress services are growing rapidly the value added of the tertiary sector which is mainly services grew from 56 7 to 57 3 percent of gdp from the same period last year the index of services production increased 7 4 percent year on year higher than the growth rate of overall gdp overall retail sales of consumer goods also grew at 8 3 percent sales of upgraded consumer goods witnessed fast growth with the highest rates concentrated in upgraded products such as cosmetics phones and computers and high tech services grew at an astonishing rate of 21 2 percent in preparing for consumer 5g telecoms next year the output of mobile communications base stations grew 153 7 percent the data also show strong movement toward the government s goal of creating an ecological civilization new energy automobiles and solar cells grew by 48 2 percent and 18 2 percent respectively sales of urban rail vehicles grew by 54 1 percent showing the continued investment in environment friendly urban mass transit according to nbs preliminary estimates the share of consumption of clean energy such as natural gas hydropower nuclear power and wind power in total energy consumption in the first quarter was 1 5 percentage points higher than that of the same period last year energy consumption per unit of gdp went down by 2 7 percent year on year total investment in fixed assets grew by 6 3 percent with private investment growing at 6 4 percent slightly faster than the overall number this is especially significant in the light of last year s fears that private investment in the economy might collapse so the government s efforts to strengthen the private sector appear to have borne fruit investment in high tech manufacturing rose by 11 4 percent and investment in high tech services rose 19 3 percent both far higher than overall investment growth this shows that the shift toward advanced manufacturing and services is well underway and despite ongoing tensions the total value of imports and exports rebounded sharply in march reaching 9 6 percent higher than march 2018 so overall trade grew by 3 7 percent year on year in the quarter despite low growth rates in january and february exports of electrical and mechanical products which are higher value added grew by 5 4 percent in the quarter and private sector trade grew 9 9 percent far more than the overall growth rate i am worried to see that total investment in real estate grew by 11 8 percent year on year having lived through the 2008 financial crisis in the united states i m wary of continued high investment in real estate in a time when property prices are already astonishingly high and china s living space per person has already surpassed that in europe the bottom line is that fiscal and monetary policies combined with policies to promote structural transformation have achieved a stable macroeconomic situation and steady movement toward supply side upgrading
the united states has unnerved the world oil market by ramping up the pressure in its long running dispute with iran it has announced that after may 1 it will not renew the exemptions given to eight countries that enable them to buy iranian oil those affected including china india japan italy and south korea will face sanctions from washington if they do not comply the move will likely squeeze global oil supply at a time when it is already struggling from disruptions in venezuela libya and nigeria indeed the brent crude price has already risen on the back of the announcement to 74 per barrel the highest since last november president donald trump has said he is confident that a supply crunch can be avoided thanks to extra output from saudi arabia and the united arab emirates but traders and asian petrochemical firms are sceptical that these countries will fully comply in recent months saudi arabia and other members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries have cut supply dramatically to redress their fears that hefty us shale oil output and declining global energy demand could cause a supply glut that would batter prices in december the oil cartel along with russia and other allies agreed to reduce output by 1 2 million barrels per day cutting the global total volume by more than 1 they have since exceeded those benchmarks with saudi arabia alone reducing supply by 8 00 000 barrels a day in march the kingdom slashed production to a four year low of 9 82 million barrels a day making up the majority of opec s reduction of 2 95 000 daily barrels for the month to 30 3 million barrels per day oil politics trump has already been calling on opec to raise production with little success the saudis may be close allies of the americans but they will only act in concert with their opec counterparts and many around the table will be wary of risking reducing prices at an unpredictable time for the global economy no one ever forgets when the saudis famously went against western interests in the arab oil embargo of 1973 in response to us policies with similarly global consequences president richard nixon had scrapped the gold standard heavily devaluing the us dollar and then backed the israelis in the yom kippur war against egypt inflation adjusted oil prices nearly doubled during the embargo from around 26 per barrel in 1973 to over 46 per barrel the following year sending economic shockwaves around the world america s latest move against iran is making things worse for the global economy at a time when it has already been under pressure from rising interest rates and trade wars if iran s entire output were removed a big if since it is far from certain that all countries will comply with the americans it would wipe another million or so barrels per day off the world supply daily brent crude prices credit macrotrends any resulting rise in oil prices would spread to other commodity prices leading to inflationary pressure particularly in countries affected by the end of waiver such as india where inflation has already started picking up such countries would also see direct effects on their import bill and hence their balance of trade for every dollar increase in oil rates in india for instance the import bill will rise by around 1 5 billion at a time when the country s trade deficit already stands at over 10 billion in many cases such economic effects are all too capable of being exported take south korea which is the second biggest oil importer from iran after china south korea mainly imports condensate an ultra light form of crude oil used for petrochemical products like naptha which it exports to neighbouring countries if these petrochemical exports fall because korean prices are no longer competitive its neighbours will have to look further afield creating a trade imbalance in the region in the run up to trump s campaign to be re elected for a second presidential term next year assuming he makes it that far there is therefore a great deal riding on this us gambit if opec does not step up to the plate and the oil price continues surging upwards it could yet become the moment when the longstanding fears around the health of the world economy finally crystallise into a full blown downturn nafis alam is associate professor university of reading this article first appeared on the conversation

evidence has a well known liberal bias and that presumably is why conservatives prefer experts who not only consistently get things wrong but refuse to admit or learn from their mistakes there has been a lot of commentary about stephen moore the man president donald trump wants to put on the fed s board of governors it turns out he has a lot of personal baggage he was held in contempt of court for failing to pay alimony and child support and his past writings show an extraordinary degree of misogyny he misstates facts so much that one newspaper editor vowed never to publish him again and he has been caught outright lying about his past support for a gold standard oh and he has described the cities of the u s heartland as armpits of america but it s also important to put moore in context until he decided that the fed should roll those printing presses to help trump he was part of a fairly broad group that advocated tight money in the aftermath of the global financial crisis this group bitterly criticized both the fed s low interest rates and its efforts to boost the economy by buying bonds so called quantitative easing its members warned that these policies would lead to runaway inflation and seized on a rise in commodity prices in 2011 12 as the harbinger of an inflationary surge meanwhile economists at the fed and elsewhere argued that there was no inflationary risk given the depressed state of the economy and that core inflation which excludes volatile food and energy prices was a much better indicator of inflationary pressure than commodity prices sure enough the commodity price surge was a temporary blip and runaway inflation never happened the fed was right and its hard money critics were wrong in fact it s hard to think of other events in economic history in which rival doctrines received such a clear test and in which one of them emerged so decisively as the winner when it comes to evidence settling an economic dispute the monetary events of 2009 14 or so were as good as it gets but two funny things happened once the verdict of the evidence was in first aside from a vague mea culpa from larry kudlow none of the fed s critics were willing to admit that they were wrong in 2014 bloomberg contacted signatories of a 2010 open letter to then fed chairman ben bernanke warning of an inflationary explosion to ask what they thought given subdued inflation and a solid economic recovery not one was willing to admit that the letter s warnings had proved incorrect second the people who got it wrong were rewarded for their errors moore who was among the right wingers who called for interest rate hikes in 2007 08 to head off what they saw as looming inflation as the great recession was already underway was wrong about everything during the financial crisis he remained a fixture on the right wing conference circuit and in 2014 the heritage foundation appointed him as its chief economist kudlow who dismissed those warning about the housing bubble as bubbleheads and warned about looming inflation in the depths of recession is now the trump administration s chief economist so the attempt to install moore at the fed is right in character and let s be clear the issue is not simply one of having made some bad forecasts it s about being consistently wrong about everything and refusing to learn from error recently moore declared that the fed is filled with hundreds of economists who are worthless who have the wrong model in their mind they should all be they should all be fired and they should be replaced by good economists given the respective track records of moore and the fed over the past decade and more what he apparently means by the wrong model is a view of inflation that has repeatedly been proved right as opposed to his own analysis which has always been wrong but so far not a single republican senator has questioned moore s qualifications when it comes to right wing economists what we see is a clear pattern of survival of the wrongest paul krugman is a columnist for the new york times
as the house considers the fifth discretionary spending limits bill the investing for the people act since the budget control act of 2011 it is worth taking a serious look at what that debate means in the scheme of federal spending it matters but is far from the true root of our fiscal insanity nondefense discretionary spending is projected to represent about 15 percent of federal spending in 2019 or about 669 billion out of the expected budget of over 4 4 trillion according to the congressional budget office congress could eliminate all nondefense discretionary spending and still run a large budget deficit of more than 300 billion some lawmakers focus on reducing nondefense discretionary spending suggesting the programs classified as such are the source of budget deficits but nondefense spending relative to gross domestic product has declined since 1980 when it peaked at 5 percent of the economy the 2009 stimulus bill the american recovery and reinvestment act fueled a brief increase in nondefense discretionary spending but that has since declined and is expected to stay on a slow downward trajectory mosads defense discretionary spending has also declined as a portion of the economy in 2019 the government is projected to spend 693 billion on defense or about 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2028 defense and nondefense discretionary spending will be close to 6 percent of the economy however federal spending will continue to rise consuming more of the economy this is because mandatory spending including entitlement programs like medicare and social security and interest on publicly held debt will increase above historical averages in 2019 defense and nondefense discretionary spending is projected to represent nearly 31 percent of federal spending this is the spending that congress appropriates on an annual basis for the government to spend mandatory spending and interest on the national debt run on autopilot without debate mandatory spending and interest on the debt collectively represent nearly 70 percent of annual federal outlays in 2028 mandatory spending and interest on the debt is projected to represent 77 percent of outlays while discretionary spending declines to less than 23 percent between 1980 and 2017 federal spending averaged nearly 21 percent of the economy there were four consecutive years 2009 through 2012 during which federal spending exceeded 22 percent of gross domestic product reaching as high as 24 percent in 2009 this was the effect of higher stimulus spending and health care spending as a result of the affordable care act the government is expected to spend 21 percent of gross domestic product in 2019 and the share of national debt held by the public is expected to be 79 percent by 2028 federal spending may reach nearly 24 percent and publicly held debt will reach 96 percent the estimates that the congressional budget office provided are subject to change and the assumption is that if these projections do change it will be for the worse the budget deal passed by congress and signed by president trump in early 2018 busted the previously established spending limits by 296 billion over two fiscal years we are now seeing those spending limits serve as the new baseline for federal spending meaning that discretionary spending could grow above projected rates if the investing for the people act which would be far more aptly called the bankrupting the people act becomes law this will be proven accurate the level of debt the united states may see absent legislative action is concerning while estimates vary economists agree that high levels of debt create what is called a debt drag which slows economic growth a 2010 paper published by the world bank argued that the tipping point threshold for debt to gross domestic product is 77 percent the authors explained that debt above this threshold costs real economic growth the warning lights are flashing red as the fiscal future of the united states is perilous and the prosperity of the next generation is at risk some may scoff at the notion of a sovereign debt crisis happening to the strongest nation in the world but it can unless congress rises to the challenge to address the entitlement programs like social security and medicare jason pye is vice president of legislative affairs for freedomworks this column is part of a series on budget and entitlement reform in the hill
beijing china s belt and road initiative must be green and sustainable president xi jinping said at the opening of a summit on his grand plan on friday adding that the massive infrastructure and trade plan should result in high quality growth for everyone xi s plan to rebuild the old silk road to connect china with asia europe and beyond has become mired in controversy as some partner nations have bemoaned the high cost of infrastructure projects china has not said exactly how much money will be needed in total but some independent estimates suggest it will run into several trillion dollars beijing has repeatedly said it is not seeking to trap anyone with debt and only has good intentions and has been looking to use this week s summit in beijing to recalibrate the policy and address those concerns xi said in a keynote speech that environmental protection must underpin the scheme to protect the common home we live in we must adhere to the concept of openness greenness and cleanliness he said operate in the sun and fight corruption together with zero tolerance xi added building high quality sustainable risk resistant reasonably priced and inclusive infrastructure will help countries to fully utilise their resource endowments unlike the first summit in 2017 where xi said chinese banks will lend 380 billion yuan 56 43 billion to support belt and road cooperation he did not give a figure for new financing support however xi was set to give another speech on saturday western governments have tended to view it as a means to spread chinese influence abroad saddling poor countries with unsustainable debt while most of the belt and road projects are continuing as planned some have been caught up by changes in government in countries such as malaysia and the maldives those that have been shelved for financial reasons include a power plant in pakistan an airport in sierra leone and beijing has in recent months had to rebuff critics by saying that not one country has been burdened with so called debt traps since 2017 the finance ministries of 28 countries have called on governments financial institutions and companies from belt and road countries to work together to build a long term stable and sustainable financing system to manage risks china s finance ministry said in a report released on thursday debt sustainability has to be taken into account when mobilising funds the finance ministry said in the report which outlined a framework for use in analysing debt sustainability of low income belt and road nations and managing debt risks xi launched the belt and road initiative in 2013 and according to data from refinitiv the total value of projects in the scheme stands at 3 67 trillion spanning countries in asia europe africa oceania and south america chinese promises the belt and road initiative will also open up development opportunities for china just as china itself is further opening up its markets to the world xi said in accordance with the need for further opening up we ll improve laws and regulations regulate government behaviour at all levels in administrative licensing market supervision and other areas and clean up and abolish unreasonable regulations subsidies and practices that impede fair competition and distort the market he said xi promised to significantly shorten the negative list for foreign investments and allow foreign companies to take a majority stake or set up wholly owned companies in more sectors tariffs will be lower and non tariff barriers will be eliminated xi added china also aims to import more services and goods and is willing to import competitive agricultural products and services to achieve trade balance china will strengthen macroeconomic policy coordination with major economies in the world and strive to create positive spillover effects to promote a strong sustainable balanced and inclusive growth for the world economy said xi visiting leaders visiting leaders include russia s vladimir putin as well as prime minister imran khan of pakistan a close china ally and among the biggest recipients of belt and road investment and prime minister giuseppe conte of italy which recently became the first g7 country to sign on to the initiative khan told the summit that in a world of uncertainty the initiative offered a model of collaboration partnership connectivity and shared prosperity cambodian prime minister hun sen directly addressed critics who have described belt and road as a debt trap by pointing to the successful example of a chinese funded highway between phnom penh and the port city of sihanoukville cambodia has not only been able to plan this project for the benefit of the people but also achieve financial engineering that does not increase public debt to the state he said in comments translated into english the united states which has not joined the belt and road is expected to send only lower level officials and nobody from washington we continue to have serious concerns that china s infrastructure diplomacy activities ignore or weaken international standards and best practices related to development lobar protections and environmental protection a spokesman for the us embassy in beijing said reuters
this article is more than 4 years old getty with the tank on my sedan less than 1 4 full three sundays ago i stopped at the gas station roughly thirteen gallons later i was out 56 about what s going to be said anecdotes are too often substituted for statistics i use the 56 anecdote this time mainly because everyone else in washington d c pays the same gasoline prices as i do furthermore it s not anecdote to note what is a fact of life for every dollar earning american at 62 barrel the price of oil is over five times what it was back in the late 1990s about the late 90s it s useful to point out that with oil prices so low at the time the domestic u s energy industry was largely non existent all of this matters mainly because conservatives who should know better continue to promote the numerically false narrative that the fracking revolution has made oil and its byproducts inexpensive except that it hasn t conservatives are spinning a wildly fictional tale one that would make even steven spielberg blush about what s being said none of it should be construed as a polemic against oil not at all oil is wonderful and while logic dictates that entrepreneurial minds will eventually replace it lest readers forget oil itself sat unused for thousands of years as a source of fuel as a broadly used power source for now it s the best fuel we ve got my admiration for those who discovered it and for those who continue to bring it to market is endless where my admiration stops is when i along with every other american am forced to subsidize the domestic extraction of what is a globally sourced commodity and subsidization of american oil is what we americans do that s what s so disappointing about conservative rapture related to fracking nothing against the decades old innovation but it s only a prominent extraction technique insofar as oil s dollar price is artificially high oil is priced in dollars the dollar is shrunken quite a bit since 2001 against nearly every global currency and every commodity so oil costs quite a bit more to understand all this readers need only imagine their height if suddenly the foot were shrunk to 1 5th of its previous length many of us would be close to 30 feet ball despite not having grown an inch the above does a lot to explain the modern oil price and also the fracking revolution that so excites conservatives who have historically expressed an aversion to the subsidization of various industries they claim against substantial evidence from the 80s and 90s that frackers have made oil cheap but the paradoxical truth is that frackers profitably extract hard to find oil precisely because oil is nominally expensive and oil is expensive once again five times what it was in the late 90s because the dollar s value is a fraction of its late 90s self translated every american subsidizes u s based oil patch economic activity through the earning of dollars that have fallen versus nearly every major foreign currency and every major commodity including oil since 1998 while oil can be extracted for as cheaply as 3 5 barrel in places like saudi arabia it s only profitable for it to be sourced in prominent u s fracking locales at 30 60 barrel americans are supporting economic activity that wouldn t exist if dollar policy in the 21st century hadn t accented devaluation americans have had to suffer dollars exchangeable for less so that fracking could become a thing if dollar policy in the 21st century resembled what prevailed in the last two decades of the 20th oil would be cheap in dollars and americans would for the most part have never heard of fracking which brings us to president trump s decision to sanction any country including allies of the u s that imports iranian oil that the chinese are already balking at what s absurd that the iranians are already secretly exporting nearly 2 million barrels each day according to the financial times is the surest sign that trump s plan will fail it takes but one buyer to foil a plan that fights the laws of economics indeed there s no accounting for the final destination of any good so long as the iranians are selling oil the world s consumers including us americans will be buying it in short the proposed sanctions won t keep iran from selling logic dictates that the sanction will only change whom the iranians first sell to that s why the wall street journal editorial page s response to what s economically irrelevant was so puzzling an unsigned editorial suggested the sanction decision could amount to a potential shock for global oil markets not really my source the wall street journal editorial page of old the late robert bartley editorial page editor and george melloan deputy editorial page editor used to regularly make the point that oil shocks in the price sense were generally dollar shocks as in they were an effect of the shrinking measure in which oil is priced in that case the true oil shock that s lasted throughout the 21st century has been a shrunken dollar that has rendered oil artificially expensive more puzzling is what followed the above quote from the most important editorial page in the world trying to justify the trump administration s move against iran the unsigned editorial contended sans skepticism that the administration says it is working with saudi arabia and the united arab emirates to fill any gap in supplies american frackers will help too as they gear up in response to higher prices except that conservatism has long rejected government planning of markets let alone global markets furthermore if saudi and uae could control global oil markets as is assumed why was oil so cheap in the 80s and 90s yet so expensive in the 70s and the 00s why is oil still pricey in dollars right now and if american frackers could somehow move markets why is oil so much more expensive now than it was when they were near non existent the journal s editorialists surely know the planning of a global price by the trump administration will fail particularly if the plan is to set frackers loose once again fracking is only a thing insofar as oil is already expensive fracking can t make oil cheap simply because abundant fracking is a consequence of oil not being cheap as for trump officials bending global markets the view isn t serious what s serious is that every american earns dollars and americans shouldn t have to put up with nosebleed prices at the pump so that american frackers can thrive as for iran short of what would be wrongheaded a blockade of all its ports its oil will flow probably for the better politicians need to learn that when they fight markets markets always win

in his campaign for the democratic presidential nomination pete buttigieg has been telling audiences that the u s lost six times as many jobs due to automation than trade from 2000 to 2010 according to the washington post this is literally true but for all practical purposes it is a very big lie the way in which it is true is that we always lose jobs to automation which is known to economists as productivity growth productivity growth averages around 2 percent annually it has been closer to 1 percent since 2005 if productivity grows by 2 percent this means that we can produce the same amount of goods and services with 2 percent fewer worker hours this is usually thought to be good news productivity growth theoretically should allow workers to enjoy higher living standards although most workers have not gotten their share of gains over the last four decades if productivity increases by 2 percent it means that workers can get a 2 percent increase in their weekly pay or work 2 percent fewer hours for the same pay or some mix of higher pay and shorter hours in the years from 2000 to 2007 the united states lost 3 4 million manufacturing jobs more than 20 percent of the total note that this is before the great recession this job loss was due to the explosion of the trade deficit in these years which peaked at just under 6 percent of gdp in 2006 and 2007 this would be equal to a trade deficit of 1 2 trillion in today s economy while manufacturing has been declining as a share of total employment since 1970 there was actually relatively little change in the number of jobs in manufacturing over the three decades from 1970 to 2000 there were cyclical ups and downs but increased demand for manufactured goods roughly offset the increases in productivity growth to keep manufacturing employment nearly constant this changed in 2000 as the admission of china to the world trade organization coupled with a seriously overvalued dollar led the trade deficit to explode even as the economy was slowing from 2000 to 2007 imports from china and other countries displaced domestically produced goods leading to massive job loss in places like michigan ohio pennsylvania and wisconsin the loss of relatively high paying manufacturing jobs devastated whole communities as many lost their major employer with nothing to replace it this devastation is seen even more clearly if we look at what happened to the number of unionized jobs in manufacturing over these years the number of manufacturing workers represented by a union fell by more than 1 1 million from 2000 to 2007 almost 40 percent of the total these were the better paying jobs that typically allowed workers to enjoy a comfortable middle class lifestyle buttigieg s efforts to trivialize this job loss by making the comparison to the jobs lost to automation would be like telling the nebraska farmers that the recent flooding was no big deal since the rains that caused the flooding were just a small fraction of the total rainfall in a year that s a true statement but entirely irrelevant to the damage caused by the flooding while automation is wrongly seen as a sort of natural outcome of the progress of technology trade is explicitly steered by government policy through trade deals specifically the u s signed trade deals that opened domestic manufacturing workers to direct competition with low paid chinese workers at the same time we ensured that doctors and other highly paid professionals were protected from such competition furthermore when china and other countries deliberately propped up the dollar against their currencies to gain an advantage in trade the u s government looked the other way as eswar prasad who was then the chief international monetary fund official dealing with china said there were other dimensions of china s economic policies that were seen as more important to u s economic and business interests greater market access better intellectual property rights protection easier access to investment opportunities etc in other words the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs to imports was an explicit political choice because our leaders decided it was more important to promote investment opportunities in china for goldman sachs and to increase protection for pfizer s drug patents we can t reverse this disaster even if the trade deficit were to fall the new jobs in manufacturing would not pay as much as the ones that were lost and probably would not be in the same places but at the very least we should be able to talk honestly about what happened and why instead buttigieg seems intent on going the route of denial

us and china aim for trade deal in late may march data better than expected but downside risk to april data african swine fever crisis could give significant boost to inflation xi addresses concerns over belt and road initiative at the belt and road forum aiming for a trade deal in late may us president donald trump said on thursday that chinese president xi jinping will come to the white house soon a high level us delegation is set to go to beijing on tuesday and the following week chinese top negotiators are set to go to washington with the goal of closing a deal and announcing a signing summit between trump and xi see bloomberg 24 april comment trump s message suggest we are moving closer to a deal we expect it to become a reality at a trump xi summit in late may or early june more recovery signals but risk of disappointments in april data another batch of positive data for march was released just before easter industrial production retail sales property prices and home sales all improved see charts q1 gdp beat expectations with an increase of 6 4 y y consensus 6 3 y y and several banks followed up by revising up growth forecasts for 2019 to around 6 4 from 6 2 6 3 comment it is encouraging to see more signs that the worst is behind us in the chinese economy however we should brace ourselves for some slip back in april as the march data are likely somewhat distorted by the chinese new year the rise in industrial production of 8 5 for example seems too good to be true next week the april pmi manufacturing will give more clues we see downside risk to the caixin pmi manufacturing which has risen very fast in recent months however we still believe that china has started a moderate recovery driven by easing trade tensions and economic stimulus we may not see further reductions in the reserve requirement ratio but we expect targeted lending measures to be stepped up to increase credit availability for small and medium sized private companies african swine fever crisis intensifies the african swine fever in china is starting to have a bigger effect on pork output pushing up prices according to the ministry of agriculture and rural affairs the impact on china s pig industry has been very serious with stocks shrinking and prices expected to rise to an all time high later in 2019 see scmp 23 april the number of mother pigs declined 21 in march from a year earlier and in the first week of april pork prices increased 36 from a year earlier up from a rise of 2 1 y y in the first week of march china had 375 million pigs and piglets at the end of march a drop of 53 million from 428 million in december some estimates have suggested china could lose up to 200 million pigs during the epidemic close to three times the pig population of the us so far 129 cases of african swine fever have been reported but the fear is that the number is much higher due to underreporting at big pig farms comment the crisis will push up inflation in china over the coming months and to some extent also in other countries as the global supply of pork is set to shrink sharply chinese statistics do not reveal the weight of pork but estimates are around 5 hence if pork prices were to increase 70 y y as projected by the chinese ministry of agriculture it could add 3 5 percentage points to headline inflation we do not expect the people s bank of china to respond to this rise in inflation as it is a temporary supply shock but it would erode purchasing power among consumers chinese households will probably substitute to other food products but this is likely to push up prices on these as well we expect further stimulus to spur more private consumption growth in china this year and the higher food prices will add to the pressure for more consumer stimulus subsidies for certain items such as cars home appliances and electronic products are already drafted but details are scarce on the measures so far china addresses debt trap criticism at second belt and road forum china is hosting the second belt and road forum in beijing this week with participation of 37 global leaders including russian president vladimir putin italian prime minister giuseppe conte and the heads of state of the 10 asean countries xi jinping addressed the forum on friday addressing some of the criticism of the belt and road initiative bri that he kicked off in 2013 xi highlighted building infrastructure of high quality sustainability risk resilience reasonable pricing inclusiveness and accessibility he also stressed that china would continue to open up see scmp for more details us has been a fierce opponent of the initiative calling it a vanity project the eu has also voiced some criticism over debt issues and lack of transparency but has signalled openness to work with china some countries have joined the bri with italy and luxembourg recently signing memoranda of understanding with china in a commentary in fortune the chinese ambassador in washington ciu tiankai this week encouraged the us to join forces with china imagine the potential of china and united states the world s two largest most vibrant economies collaborating on the most ambitious development project in history the us launched its own infrastructure initiative for asia last year although the size is much smaller see scmp 30 july 2018 comment the bri continues to expand with new countries joining by now 126 countries have signed cooperative documents with china the us will continue to warn countries against joining but the us leverage is waning with china s economy rising and the us in relative decline china has responded to the criticism by increasing focus on debt concerns and sustainability and encourage cooperation on global development at the same time competing infrastructure programmes from the eu the us and japan will run alongside the bri boosting investments in developing countries other selected china news of the week usd cny increased 6 74 from around

via zerohedge the patient fed has been lamenting the lack of inflation for far too long it is about to get its wish american food merchants are struggling to import fruits and vegetables from mexico as wait times at port of entries along the mexico us border have surged because of a shift in customs and border protection cbp personnel away from the port of entries to remote regions of the border to fight illegal crossings as a result shipments of food have dramatically declined in recent weeks and the result is an imminent spike in imported food prices in the coming months that could put a sizeable dent in consumer wallets fruit and vegetable importers that wholesale to grocery stores throughout the us could inflate prices by at least 20 to 40 if the wait times continue with avocado prices already soaring see mexican avocado prices explode by most in a decade after trump border threat and it s not just avocados cucumbers eggplants bell peppers squash cherry tomatoes watermelons and most other fruit and vegetables imported from the tropics would be affected the mexican border it s one of the most important crossings to the united states said joshua duran amore produce sales representative about 43 of all us fruit and vegetables originate from mexico in the last several decades mexico has become the top trading partner with the us much of the us mexico commerce involves mega corporations that send products back and forth across the border as part of a critical segment of their supply chain that has increased since the north american free trade agreement nafta took effect in 1994 we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us this month distributor amore produce truck drivers hauling product from mexico have experienced a 300 wait time at the various port of entries along the mexico us border stuck in line for up to 15 hours now we are having a lot of problems in the border duran said so let s say we used to have like five hours we re getting 10 or 15 hours to pass that truck to the united states one or two gates are not enough to get all the entire trucks coming from mexico and not only for produce for all the products that people here in the united states get from mexico increase wait times have depleted cold storage inventories of mcallen produce terminal market located just 20 minutes from the border duran said the importer cannot ship fresh produce across the country anymore becuase their truck drivers are waiting almost a day to move product across the port of entry by the time it makes it to the us the produce won t make it fresh to the wholesaler we couldn t get it here and we couldn t send it to the customers in the north duran said marabella produce owner alejandro knight suggested that wait time increases have impacted his cold storage levels in the last month knight said his warehouse is always at full capacity but now the floors are covered with empty pallets most of the produce knight receives from mexico is spoiled thanks to wait time increases warehouse workers have to immediately throw out the produce once it arrives we cannot deliver a fresh product anymore if we have to wait for each load to cross five to six days it s impossible to work like this knight warned knight said mexican farmers are now afraid to export fruits and vegetables to the us because of extended wait times salavador contreras an economist at the university of texas rio grande valley said if wait times increase it could inflate produce for everyday american consumers it s going to be felt at the grocery stores when we start paying more for limes and our avocados at the grocery store contreras said if the wait times persist at the border in the coming months americans will be shocked by soaring prices in the produce section of their local grocery stores a move that could reverse consumer sentiment right before an important election year but at least the fed will be delighted it will have achieved some of that symmetric inflation overshoot it has been seeking for so long and all thanks to trump

amazon s announcement in late 2017 that it was seeking a location for a second headquarters to house 50 000 highly paid workers set off a furor in governments across north america more than 200 cities regions and states from los angeles to leominster massachusetts vied to become the home of hq2 some promised billions in tax incentives others offered customized workforce training such as a proposed amazon academy in atlanta in november amazon announced that hq2 would be split between arlington virginia and queens new york with 5 000 additional jobs in nashville tennessee then in february the company scrapped its plans for new york in response to skepticism from the city council key state legislators and some community organizations in hindsight governments pursuit of hq2 and the scrutiny that followed vividly illustrated the quandaries that governors mayors and economic development officials face as they seek large scale economic development deals officials must decide which companies to court what to offer and how to structure any agreements wrong moves could mean hundreds of millions of dollars squandered or missed opportunities to transform the local economy even when the company ends up thriving it s hard to be sure whether it would have expanded at the same pace and in the same place even without government aid if anything the challenges are more acute for state legislators when states pursue megadeals they often include company or project specific incentives that require lawmakers approval but legislators frequently have little time to review these deals let alone seek meaningful analysis of their economic and fiscal impact for instance the incentives of up to 330 million that mississippi approved for a tire plant in 2013 were so secret that most legislators weren t even told the name of the company yokohama tire corp until the day they voted promising strategies for assessing proposed deals solutions to these challenges are not simple or obvious however research by the pew charitable trusts and others points to promising strategies to help ensure that governments pursuit of economic development projects is well informed the process should start with planning under a december 2018 law michigan is developing detailed guiding principles for when and how the state will pursue business specific incentives rather than making ad hoc decisions when companies come calling governments also should have a plan for conducting independent analyses of specific proposals for instance a major incentive program in arkansas allows legislative leaders to commission an outside cost benefit analysis of proposed deals to inform decisions on whether to support incentive agreements when lawmakers vote on business specific incentives too often the only analysis they have comes from the companies seeking the help or the economic development agency that negotiated the deal the hq2 debate in new york however was informed by a thoughtful report from the city council s finance division it pinpointed population growth as one of the most consequential results of the agreement to bring amazon to queens noting that more people would be a mixed blessing higher tax revenue could be offset by challenges related to affordable housing and schools the benefits of thinking broadly economic research also suggests that some policies or approaches can be much more cost effective than the financial incentives found in typical deals as timothy bartik an economic development expert has noted financial incentives cost governments a dollar to provide a dollar of benefits in contrast he highlights evidence that offering high quality business advice technical consulting or customized job training could provide a value to companies that significantly exceeds the direct cost to states or municipalities these programs can have a particularly large impact when tailored to help small and medium size businesses overcome barriers to growth such as difficulties finding qualified workers or limited technical expertise an economic development strategy that fosters growth for a variety of businesses and workers also has the advantage of ensuring that the economic fortunes of cities and states are less tied to the success or failure of individual large companies by providing customized targeted support to small and medium size businesses and their workers states can help create an environment for broad based growth some companies will inevitably struggle in the face of competitive pressures but this diversified approach can help the local economy be more flexible and better equipped to adapt when conditions change some bids for amazon included features suggesting that officials recognized the importance of a broader approach to economic development for example pittsburgh s included significant direct financial incentives but also 2 1 billion to enhance education workforce development and small business support programs similarly boston proposed multiple initiatives to support small enterprises and better prepare the workforce for the needs of technology focused businesses instead of offering financial incentives specific to amazon and the final deal with virginia includes a commitment to build a 1 1 billion northern virginia innovation campus for virginia tech university with a mix of graduate academic instruction research and development facilities and space for startups this campus should not only serve amazon s workforce needs but also create a pipeline of skilled workers for other local businesses that means the plan could benefit the local economy even if amazon does not create the full 25 000 jobs it promised or even if nothing virginia offered actually influenced the company s location decision in its scale the interest it generated and the scrutiny it drew amazon s hq2 search was unlike anything ever seen in american economic development when or if a similar competition will come along is anyone s guess but by adopting smarter practices states can be ready to pursue economic development in ways that serve the interests of their economies budgets and workers josh goodman and mark robyn are senior officers with the pew charitable trusts state fiscal health initiative
alex tabarrok quotes from an interview of french ambassador gérard araud i don t think that anything irreparable is happening in the u s i don t know what would have happened in france if marine le pen had been elected because our institutions are much weaker let s look at the dogma of the previous period for instance free trade it s over trump is doing it in his own way brutal a bit primitive but in a sense he s right what he s doing with china should have been done maybe in a different way but should have been done before trump has felt americans fatigue but obama also did the role of the united states as a policeman of the world it s over obama started trump really pursued it you saw it in ukraine you are seeing it every day in syria people here faint when you discuss nato but when he said why should we defend montenegro it s a genuine question i know that people at brookings or the atlantic council will faint again but really yes why why should you i agree with the bit about america s institutions being strong but the rest seems disappointingly superficial to me let s take the points one by one why should we defend montenegro let s apply a cost benefit analysis to this question start with the benefits during the 1990s a series of wars in the former yugoslavia killed over 100 000 people eventually the us became involved even though the area was not a part of nato having montenegro join nato reduces the already low probability of a serbian invasion to basically zero that s a benefit consider the fate of countries that are not a member of nato such as kuwait ukraine etc as far as costs i don t see any nato s combined military strength is already greater than the rest of the world combined even before montenegro joined we don t need to beef up our military to defend montenegro we already have a military that is strong enough to deter a serbian invasion of montenegro if you don t like that green eyeshades answer and want something more poetic consider the history of nato countries in the 70 years before nato was created and the 70 years since its creation nato is not perfect but it s arguably the most successful international organization in all of world history by far let s look at the dogma of the previous period for instance free trade it s over if he means the dogma of free trade is over he s right but who cares nothing much is happening to the reality of free trade global trade is roughly as free as 10 or 20 years ago trump is doing it in his own way brutal a bit primitive but in a sense he s right what he s doing with china should have been done maybe in a different way but should have been done before but what exactly is trump doing he demanding that china adopt a more free trade regime which would boost chinese exports to america is that consistent with the previous claim that free trade is over or maybe he is referring to demands that we get tough again what does that mean ousting china from islands in the south china sea would indeed be getting tough but that s not what trump is doing demanding that china become a more free market economy and hence a richer and more powerful rival to the us is an odd way of getting tough with a country i understand that the french have never liked neoliberalism and that some are not happy that the eu keeps signing free trade agreements with countries like canada and japan but wishing something doesn t make it true and there is little evidence that the world is moving away from free trade in any meaningful way yes there are still some trade barriers but that s always been true each year a few more are added and a few are removed this isn t to say that he s wrong about the rhetoric the neoliberal rhetoric of recent decades has given way to the nationalist rhetoric of the 2010s but the reality on the ground has not reflected that change for instance the trump administration has some pretty harsh things to say about illegal immigration but the rate of illegal immigration into the us is surging partly due to the policies of trump himself stronger economic growth less foreign aid to central america failure to compromise to get a wall etc i m not the first to notice that trump ran as a populist but has often governed as a country club republican deregulating banks and big corporate tax cuts but no infrastructure program no reduction in trade deficits no reduction in illegal immigration no increase in the minimum wage and no real plan to save manufacturing intellectuals focus too much on interesting rhetoric and too little on mundane reality
the participation of germany britain france and italy in the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib gives added weight to the latter s annual general meeting and forum which will be held in luxembourg on july 12 13 the four biggest economic powers in europe openly defied u s requests to refrain from affiliation to the aiib and became its founding members in 2016 china established the beijing based multilateral bank in order to promote investment in economic and social infrastructure along a mainland belt that stretches from southeast asia across northern china and central asia and into eastern europe this is complemented by a maritime road that spans the eastern mediterranean through the suez canal across the arabian sea the bay of bengal the china seas and into the asia pacific region these routes broadly follow the ancient silk road and its maritime equivalent which date back to the han dynasty around 206 ad and which hugely accelerated closer economic and political relations between a vast number of peoples and nations strengthening those links in ways intended to benefit humanity in the 21st century is the vision which inspires modern china s belt and road initiative bri and its associated bank this too was the essence of president xi jinping s historic address at nazarbayev university in kazakhstan in september 2013 throughout the millennia the people of various countries along the ancient silk road have jointly written a chapter of friendship that has been passed on to this very day he reminded his audience more than 2 000 years of exchanges demonstrate that on the basis of solidarity mutual trust equality inclusiveness mutual learning and win win cooperation countries of different races beliefs and cultural backgrounds are fully capable of sharing peace and development this is the valuable inspiration we have drawn from the ancient silk road it is indeed a lesson from history sovereign countries with close strong and mutually beneficial trading links rarely if ever go to war with one another one month after his kazakhstan speech president xi formally launched the proposed aiib now it has 93 countries which have signed up to its articles of association and its authorized capital stock is us 100 billion china itself provides just under one third of the funding entitling it to a proportional vote in the bank s proceedings so what s really in it for china peaceful relations plenty of goodwill more prosperous neighbors and markets more efficient transcontinental transport routes enhanced experience in key aspects of development and possibly a bigger stock of economic and financial assets abroad it s important to note that every country is represented equally on the aiib s board of governors the bank s chinese president works with vice presidents from britain france india germany and indonesia alongside an equally multinational board of directors this inclusive and power sharing structure contrasts favorably with u s and western domination of long established agencies such as the world bank and the international monetary fund so what s in it for the aiib s funding recipients the list is exhaustive projects approved so far include schemes for urban water supply rural roads and metro rail india landslide prevention and urban regeneration sri lanka road improvements laos power transmission bangladesh solar power and rural sanitation egypt gas storage and renewable energy funding turkey irrigation and dam safety indonesia air quality and coal replacement china flood management philippines hydropower pakistan and tajikistan and gas pipeline construction azerbaijan aiib led packages usually comprise a low fee or interest free loan with or without additional finance from international aid agencies international development banks including the world bank itself commercial sources and the host country s national or provincial government projects are assessed for their impact on society the environment as well as on ethnic minority groups inevitably some schemes have provoked opposition from local people or from organizations with vested interests often these projects are seized upon in the west by politicians and media commentators who misrepresent the aiib and bri programs as examples of aggressive chinese expansionism genuine concerns are considered by the aiib s project affected people s mechanism and its disputes resolution procedure meanwhile hostile circles notably in the usa and japan continue to question the motives and viability of china s potentially epoch making initiative they resent china s growing prestige and cannot conceive of a developmental model that does not first and foremost serve the interests of the imperialist powers and their transnational corporations aiib projects have no austerity marketization or privatization strings attached this sets them apart from the world bank and imf funding programs and the eu imf troika bail out facility not surprisingly therefore the emergence of an alternative leading provider of finance and related services for infrastructure development has alarmed successive u s governments as well as the eu commission at the same time 20 european governments have joined the aiib the eastern and mediterranean ones in search of finance and the western ones which hope to win contracts and exercise influence on the bank s future direction whether or how the four big capitalist powers of europe can shift the basis and focus of the aiib may become clearer in luxembourg this summer robert griffiths is a former senior lecturer in political economy and history at the university of wales and currently the general secretary of the communist party of britain opinion articles reflect the

2018 was primarily due to additional interest income of 1 0 million realized in that quarter from the payoff on a non performing international commercial loan first quarter 2019 net interest income increased 5 3 compared to the first quarter 2018 mainly driven by higher rates and the remixing of the loan portfolio partially offset by lower average interest earning assets the net interest margin for first quarter 2019 was 2 96 an increase of one basis point compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 and an increase of 26 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2018 the increase in the net interest margin is mainly driven by the company s continued focus on higher yielding domestic loans loans and deposits in the first quarter 2019 we continued the company s transition to a domestically focused community bank and improving the profitability of the company s loan portfolio total net loans at the end of the first quarter 2019 were 5 7 billion down 3 1 compared to the end of the fourth quarter 2018 and down 3 6 compared to the end of the first quarter of 2018 the decline was driven by seasonally lower loan activity in the first quarter 2019 as well as the planned run off in foreign loans and the sales of non relationship syndicated shared national credits snc loans which we define as those credits where the company does not have a direct relationship with the borrower in the first quarter 2019 our sales teams received training to enhance their relationship building skills which we believe will help implement the company s transition to a relationship driven business model capturing a greater share of our customers deposits credit and wealth management business total deposits at the end of the first quarter 2019 were 5 9 billion down 2 4 compared to the end of the fourth quarter of 2018 and down 6 2 compared to the end of the first quarter 2018 the decreases included a decline in foreign deposits mainly from our venezuelan customers of 3 5 and 13 1 when compared to december 31 2018 and march 31 2018 respectively in the first quarter 2019 as living conditions in venezuela deteriorated further our venezuela based customers increasingly relied on their u s dollar deposits to fund daily living expenses the rate of decline in our venezuela deposits was consistent with that realized during 2018 we continue to proactively focus on our core domestic deposits to offset attrition in our venezuelan deposits while seeking to reduce attrition to our valued venezuela customers deposits noninterest income noninterest income was 13 2 million in the first quarter 2019 up 9 7 compared to 12 0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and down 5 7 compared to 13 9 million in the first quarter of 2018 the first quarter 2019 increase compared to the fourth quarter 2018 was mainly due to a 1 0 million loss in securities sold during the fourth quarter of 2018 a 0 6 million gain recognized on the early termination of advances with the federal home loan bank fhlb in the first quarter 2019 and higher income from interest rate derivative instruments sold to customers during the first quarter 2019 the first quarter 2019 decline compared to the first quarter 2018 was mainly due to decreases in income from brokerage advisory and fiduciary activity resulting from lower volumes of customer trading in february 2019 the united states placed new restrictions on the trading of venezuelan securities not previously restricted these restrictions have effectively eliminated our customers trading in those securities and has negatively affected our fee income during 2018 the company earned approximately 1 5 million from trading in these securities we expect these trading restrictions to continue for the foreseeable future the company s assets under management and custody or aums increased 101 6 million or 6 0 to 1 7 billion in the first quarter 2019 compared to 1 6 billion at the close of the year 2018 this was mainly due to higher market valuations on the assets held first quarter 2019 aums were relatively flat from the first quarter 2018 noninterest expense noninterest expense was 51 9 million in the first quarter 2019 down 5 0 compared to 54 6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 and down 6 7 compared to 55 6 million in the first quarter of 2018 first quarter 2019 noninterest expense included 0 9 million of restructuring expenses consisting primarily of rebranding costs fourth quarter 2018 noninterest expense included restructuring expenses of 6 4 million including 4 7 million in staff reduction costs and 1 2 million in professional fees first quarter 2018 noninterest expense included 2 8 million of costs primarily professional fees incurred in connection with the company s spin off from its former parent adjusting for these expenses first quarter 2019 adjusted noninterest expense was 51 0 million up 6 5 compared to 47 9 million in the fourth quarter 2018 and down 3 4 compared to 52 8 million in the first quarter of 2018 the first quarter 2019 adjusted noninterest expense increase from the prior quarter of 3 1 million or 6 5 is primarily attributable to higher and more normal marketing expenses in the first quarter 2019 and the 1 5 million quarterly amortization of restricted stock awarded in december 2018 the total compensation cost related to this restricted stock award during 2019 the first full year of the three year vesting period is expected to be approximately 6 0 million or 1 5 million per quarter the adjusted noninterest expense decrease of 3 4 in the first quarter 2019 compared to the first quarter 2018 is primarily attributable to lower salaries and employee benefits costs due to the staff reductions announced during the fourth quarter of 2018 for the first quarter of 2019 the efficiency ratio improved to 75 7 compared to 79 5 reported in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 83 6 in the first quarter of 2018 on an adjusted basis the efficiency ratio was 74 4 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to 69 6 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and 79 3 in the first quarter of 2018 credit quality credit quality remains strong the company s foreign loan and non relationship snc exposures are being reduced as planned the company released 1 4 million from the allowance for loan losses during the fourth quarter 2018 and recorded no provision during the first quarter of 2019

home recent posts pages top scams andy stanley the ten commandments and jesus biblenewsprophecy nuclear bombers for the beast ps coming jubilee reset could be a national nightmare cogwriter a little over a year ago financial writer porter stansberry was telling of a coming debt jubilee see trump signs new debt increase are americans to soon demand a debt cancelling jubilee now with the rise of more socialists running for the office of the presidency of the united states he is making other statements and warnings about it mark my words this political event will be unlike anything we ve seen in 50 years it will reset the american financial system in ways you can t imagine and it could be a national nightmare dear fellow american i m sure i don t have to tell you there s a radical socialist movement brewing in america in 2019 today i m contacting you with a serious warning we ve hit a serious tipping point in america here s what s coming next the bigger step which has been mentioned and endorsed by many of the most powerful people in washington is to clean the slate to wipe out debts and reset the financial system the crowds are cheering for this message like never before the violence will escalate our politicians are now promising this reset of the financial system as a way to a new and better prosperity and while it might sound like good news to those who have gotten in over their head what will really happen is a national nightmare you see this idea of erasing debts to reset the financial system is not new in fact in the bible it s referred to as a jubilee if you re unfamiliar with the term it comes from the old testament the book of leviticus chapter 25 a jubilee in the jewish tradition was said to occur roughly every 50 years it was a time for total forgiveness of debt the freeing of slaves and the returning of lands pope boniface viii proclaimed the first christian jubilee in 1300 since then it s been used dozens of times when anger among a population hits extreme levels typically because of an explosive divide between the wealthy and the working class and now millions are calling for a new debt jubilee here in america folks like carmen reinhart of harvard university and stephen roach of yale have advocated for a debt jubilee in one form or another so have financial pundits barry ritholtz and chris whalen in congress more than a half dozen jubilee style laws have been proposed by folks such as rep kathy castor and senator bill nelson from florida and many of the most powerful left wing economic experts are calling for a debt jubilee by name london school of economics professor david graeber says we are long overdue for some kind of biblical style jubilee it would relieve so much genuine human suffering the national affairs correspondent for the nation says we should think jubilee american style because it combines a sense of social justice with old fashioned common sense paul kedrosky a senior fellow at the kaufman foundation a liberal think tank says we need a fresh start and we need it now we need a jubilee as a slate magazine reporter recently wrote come 2020 at least one major democratic candidate for president is going to campaign on outright canceling a boatload of student debt you see today for millions of americans there s no more powerful political promise than a debt jubilee politicians will soon be promising it all i will wipe out your debts i will allow you to start fresh i will reward all of your bad decisions i will solve america s massive income inequality who will pay for it you guessed it you me and millions of americans with pensions retirement accounts and other types of savings just as in the past the folks in washington will disguise this jubilee under a different name they might call it a national restoration or patriotic solvency they ll pass an act like they did in 1841 or invoke an executive order as was done in 1933 executive order 6102 or simply issue a mandate to the secretary of the treasury which they did in 1971 but it all means the same thing the jubilee will redistribute hundreds of billions of dollars from those who have invested and saved to those who can no longer pay their debts what s coming next in our country will be a lot worse than the tech crash it will be a lot worse than the mortgage crisis too and i can tell you that no matter how sound your financial footing this is the most important issue facing you and your money today i believe america s upcoming jubilee will strongly resemble the one that took place in our country way back in 1841 back then the laws were temporarily changed so debtors could be discharged of their debts without the consent of the creditors over a period of 13 months more than 40 000 people wiped away their debts before the act was rescinded but of course this time around the jubilee won t be tens of thousands of people like it was in 1841 it will instead be tens of millions of people and trillions of dollars now if you don t think a debt jubilee is possible in america you haven t studied u s history and you aren t paying attention to the current political climate retrieved 04 02 19 the above is related to a promotion of a book i have not purchased and i have no financial interest in anything from porter stansberry or any business related to him while i do not expect the us government to call for a debt jubilee soon and have had pointed out problems with porter stansberry s predictions in the past see true u s collapse to be ushered in july 1 2014 the socialist policies of many candidates to become president of the united states could change the economic landscape of that country furthermore since donald trump has filed for bankruptcy several times he might even consider such a thing as a debt jubilee as far as the bible and the jubilee year here is a lot of what the bible itself teaches about it 8 and you shall count seven sabbaths of years for yourself seven times seven years and the time of the seven sabbaths of years shall be to you forty nine years 9 then you shall cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the seventh month on the day of atonement you shall make the trumpet to sound throughout all your land 10 and you shall consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land to all its inhabitants it shall be a jubilee for you and each of you shall return to his possession and each of you shall return to his family 11 that fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you in it you shall neither sow nor reap what grows of its own accord nor gather the grapes of your untended vine 12 for it is the jubilee it shall be holy to you you shall eat its produce from the field 13 in this year of jubilee each of you shall return to his possession 14 and if you sell anything to your neighbor or buy from your neighbor s hand you shall not oppress one another 15 according to the number of years after the jubilee you shall buy from your neighbor and according to the number of years of crops he shall sell to you 16 according to the multitude of years you shall increase its price and according to the fewer number of years you shall diminish its price for he sells to you according to the number of the years of the crops 17 therefore you shall not oppress one another but you shall fear your god for i am the lord your god leviticus 25 8 17 25 if one of your brethren becomes poor and has sold some of his possession and if his redeeming relative comes to redeem it then he may redeem what his brother sold 26 or if the man has no one to redeem it but he himself becomes able to redeem it 27 then let him count the years since its sale and restore the remainder to the man to whom he sold it that he may return to his possession 28 but if he is not able to have it restored to himself then what was sold shall remain in the hand of him who bought it until the year of jubilee and in the jubilee it shall be released and he shall return to his possession 29 if a man sells a house in a walled city then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold within a full year he may redeem it 30 but if it is not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to him who bought it throughout his generations it shall not be released in the jubilee 31 however the houses of villages which have no wall around them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed and they shall be released in the jubilee 32 nevertheless the cities of the levites and the houses in the cities of their possession the levites may redeem at any time 33 and if a man purchases a house from the levites then the house that was sold in the city of his possession shall be released in the jubilee for the houses in the cities of the levites are their possession among the children of israel 34 but the field of the common land of their cities may not be sold for it is their perpetual possession leviticus 25 25 34 40 as a hired servant and a sojourner he shall be with you and shall serve you until the year of jubilee 41 and then he shall depart from you he and his children with him and shall return to his own family he shall return to the possession of his fathers leviticus 25 40 41 47 now if a sojourner or stranger close to you becomes rich and one of your brethren who dwells by him becomes poor and sells himself to the stranger or sojourner close to you or to a member of the stranger s family 48 after he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his brothers may redeem him 49 or his uncle or his uncle s son may redeem him or anyone who is near of kin to him in his family may redeem him or if he is able he may redeem himself 50 thus he shall reckon with him who bought him the price of his release shall be according to the number of years from the year that he was sold to him until the year of jubilee it shall be according to the time of a hired servant for him 51 if there are still many years remaining according to them he shall repay the price of his redemption from the money with which he was bought 52 and if there remain but a few years until the year of jubilee then he shall reckon with him and according to his years he shall repay him the price of his redemption 53 he shall be with him as a yearly hired servant and he shall not rule with rigor over him in your sight 54 and if he is not redeemed in these years then he shall be released in the year of jubilee he and his children with him 55 for the children of israel are servants to me they are my servants whom i brought out of the land of egypt i am the lord your god leviticus 25 47 55 2 and they said the lord commanded my lord moses to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the children of israel and my lord was commanded by the lord to give the inheritance of our brother zelophehad to his daughters 3 now if they are married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of israel then their inheritance will be taken from the inheritance of our fathers and it will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance 4 and when the jubilee of the children of israel comes then their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe into which they marry so their inheritance will be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers numbers 36 2 4 16 if a man dedicates to the lord part of a field of his possession then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it a homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver 17 if he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee according to your valuation it shall stand 18 but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee then the priest shall reckon to him the money due according to the years that remain till the year of jubilee and it shall be deducted from your valuation 19 and if he who dedicates the field ever wishes to redeem it then he must add one fifth of the money of your valuation to it and it shall belong to him 20 but if he does not want to redeem the field or if he has sold the field to another man it shall not be redeemed anymore 21 but the field when it is released in the jubilee shall be holy to the lord as a devoted field it shall be the possession of the priest 22 and if a man dedicates to the lord a field which he has bought which is not the field of his possession 23 then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation up to the year of jubilee and he shall give your valuation on that day as a holy offering to the lord 24 in the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought to the one who owned the land as a possession leviticus 27 16 24 essentially the jubilee was a reset for society and a new chance for those who had not handled their finances as well as others may have people would get their ancestral lands back if they would have sold them and since it was supposed to be observed once every 50 years most people who did not die in childhood would have experienced it once or even twice in their lifetime yes even three times was possible it is not out of the realm of possibilities that the usa would be in a jubilee period but that is not something people can now count on as far as the meaning of the term translated as jubilee in most bibles notice the following the translation jubilee year results from a mistaken application of cognates similar words in different languages in the original hebrew the year was called the year of the horn or in hebrew the year of the yovel the latin for yovel is iobileus which just happens to sound like the latin word iubileus connected to the verb iubilare to celebrate the english jubilee year comes from the latin some have suggested that because the jubilee is not observed that this is perhaps why there tends to be major economic problems every 50 60 or so years notice the following kondratieff long wave cycle k wave was originally used to explain long wave economic cycles its originator nickolai kondratieff was a russian economist 1892 1938 in stalin s agricultural academy and business research institute long waves in economic life originally published in german in 1926 kondratieff s major premise was that capitalist economies displayed long wave cycles of boom and bust ranging between 50 60 years in duration kondratieff s study covered the period 1789 to 1926 and was centered on prices and interest rates the 50 60 year cycle of catastrophe and renewal had been observed and recorded by the ancient mayans of central america and by the ancient israelites further studies have discovered similar long economic waves from the period of the ancient greeks and romans kondratieff identified four distinct phases the economy goes through they are a period of inflationary growth followed by stagflation then deflationary growth and finally depression see also some have seen major economic disturbances throughout history beyond what we have seen this week that seem to possibly correlate with not following the admonition of having a jubilee year since it is the part of the 1 that would be harmed in modern times by a jubilee year and they have major political influence things would have to change for them to be willing to forgive debts though political pressure could be one way some have wondered when the biblical jubilee year is furthermore from time to time i receive emails from some who think they know when the jubilee year is despite the fact that history does not clearly record a particular year that the children of israel actually observed it there was for one example someone who emailed me and claimed that the 50 year biblical jubilee would begin on october 8 2011 he was upset that i would not proclaim that as he was convinced that was the year i told him i did not believe that the jubilee period could have begun then one of the reasons is that since god has a 6 000 year plan for humankind that should be up within a decade or two and since 6 000 years is divisible by 50 i did not believe that 2011 2012 could possibly have been the year of jubilee i have looked at a lot of calculations for the next jubilee year and am not absolutely certain which is correct one that is supposedly based upon the reign of king josiah seems to point to the 2028 or 2027 time period see the book of life and the feast of trumpets but there are others that point to hezekiah 2 kings 19 29 34 that suggest more like a 2050 or 2051 date which seems too distant another from the talmud that leaves over 200 years off of the age of the world seems to point to 2038 while one related to ezekiel 40 1 which the pulpit commentary says may have been 575 bc points to 2026 and one by the rabbi known as maimonides seems to point to 2025 here is some information from what seems to be a protestant source that suggests 2028 as the next jubilee the bible relates this information about the year of jubilee count off seven sabbaths of years seven times seven years so that the seven sabbaths of years amount to a period of forty nine years then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month on the day of atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants it shall be a jubilee for you each one of you is to return to his family property and each to his own clan the fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines for it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you eat only what is taken directly from the fields leviticus 25 8 12 the bible further states the jewish year begins in the first month of nisan since the time of exodus although modern jews actually begin the civil new year six months later in the seventh month tishrei so using this understanding the forty ninth year seventh sabbath would have started in the month of nisan and ended just before the month of nisan the following year there would have been no planting in that year if they followed god s laws god also says not to sow or reap in the year of jubilee as well the fiftieth year so why does he say to wait until the tenth day of the seventh month before the year is proclaimed when the jews clearly should already be observing the jubilee by not planting crops we will examine this issue shortly so a year of jubilee begins on the first of nisan is proclaimed midway through the year on the day of atonement and ends at the start of a new year in the month of nisan assuming josephus was correct on this point the year of jubilee he reported would probably have been nisan 1 3738 a m to adar 29 3739 a m this corresponds to march 28 23 b c to march 16 22 b c projecting these dates 50 years ahead across the b c to a d threshold gives us march 14 28 a d nisan 1 3788 a m to march 31 29 a d adar ii 29 3789 a m as the first year of jubilee in the year of our lord anno domini a d this period of time partially overlaps the 15th year of the reign of tiberius caesar which ended in august of 29 a d if you aspire to do your counting from the first of tishrei using that as the beginning of the new year then the jubilee year would have been september 21 23 b c to september 10 22 b c instead effectively moving the dates six months into the future the next jubilee 28 29 a d using this accounting method would have lined up very close to the 15th year of tiberius being off by only three to four weeks longer so we see from using more accurate calendar math that the next year of jubilee from josephus writings was between 28 and 29 a d not just 28 a d as we originally calculated if we project this jubilee year 2 000 years into the future forty generations fifty year periods jubilees we get the first of tishrei in the year 5789 a m this translates into september 21 2028 a d on the gregorian calendar and the end of that jewish year using the same calendar is september 9 2029 a d the tenth of tishrei of this jubilee year the day of atonement is september 30 2028 a d as you already know vargo rh 2028 god s plan for mankind chapter 26 asin b00885rj9y 2007 the same conclusion is in r h vargo s 2009 book tribulation god s plan for the end of the age p 16 i am not certain that 2028 must be the year but it could be the next jubiliee let me also add that i never accepted harbinger author jonathan kahn s belief that the shemitah year was from trumpets 2014 to trumpets 2015 nor the view that the jubilee year began in 2017 as far as the jubilee of 2017 2018 went we made a video which is available at 2017 year of jubilee and the messianic age now i would add that it is possible that the millennium could start on a year of jubilee why well since the bible teaches the land shall enjoy its sabbaths leviticus 26 34 35 the jubilee year is considered one of them in addition to the every seven year land sabbath of exodus 23 10 11 and the final day of the lord lasts one year isaiah 34 8 it is possible that the day of the lord or the period immediately after the return of jesus christ and the establishment of his kingdom will be the next jubilee year but that is speculation what is not speculation is for me to declare that according to what jesus taught in matthew 24 as well as passages in the book of daniel that jesus is not going to return in the next six years and the messianic era which some would consider to be the millennium cannot possibly start until late the next decade at the earliest as far as debt goes the bible shows that debt will be a factor in the destruction of the usa cf habakkuk 2 6 8 foreigners who have loaned the usa money will want to be repaid and will not take major default or its seeming immanency without taking action some items of possibly related interest may include does god have a 6 000 year plan what year does the 6 000 years end was a 6000 year time allowed for humans to rule followed by a literal thousand year reign of christ on earth taught by the early christians does god have 7 000 year plan what year may the six thousand years of human rule end when will jesus return 2027 or 20xx there is also a video titled

over its objections to the usd 60 billion china pakistan economic corridor cpec being laid through the pakistan occupied kashmir skipped its second edition for the same reasons the cpec which connects gwadar port in pakistan s balochistan with china s xinjiang province is the flagship project of the bri this time the us has emerged as a fierce critic of the bri asserting that its predatory financing is leaving the smaller countries in heavy debt the concerns grew louder after china acquired sri lanka s hambantota port for a 99 year lease as a debt swap addressing the roundtable meeting prime minister imran khan said cpec was a source of transformation for pakistan and the country was privileged to have been an early partner of china the premier stressed the need for further boosting connectivity under the umbrella of belt and road initiative bri we should also consider digital connectivity mobility of labour and transfer of skills cultural links and knowledge and innovation connectivity to further expand the scope of the bri pm imran said to implement these additional areas of connectivity the bri countries should establish a tourism corridor for cultural tourism exchanges they should develop programmes for improving the skills of labor from labor surplus countries to assist the labor deficient countries we should also create multi lingual digital platforms for connecting producers consumers and skilled job seekers he added pakistan is at the cross roads of important regions throughout our history we have connected ideas cultures and commerce he continued connectivity has been a part of our heritage and the cpec is giving it a modern shape in the 21st century imran further said president xi jinping has given the bri vision to break barriers connect people integrate economies and share prosperity pakistan is privileged to have been an early partner of china under the cpec we are building highways modernising rail network setting up power plants establishing a port and special economic zones cpec is not a transaction rather it is a transformation of our society the premier asserted pm imran khan noted that the connectivity of gwadar port with china s xinjiang region will provide a shorter route for china s imports reduce the cost for chinese companies and develop western china as well
after delivering a discouraging market outlook three months ago pultegroup seems more optimistic about 2019 considering the dire outlook that pultegroup s phm 2 21 management gave at the end of the fourth quarter the company s most recent earnings results were a pleasant surprise even though sales on a unit and dollar basis were mostly flat and its net income was down slightly those comparisons were coming from an incredibly strong first quarter in 2018 what s also encouraging is that management seems to have changed its tune now that interest rates are on the decline again so let s look at the company s most recent earnings results and see what could be in store for the rest of the year by the numbers metric q1 2019 q4 2018 q1 2018 revenue 2 0 billion 2 99 billion 1 97 billion net income 166 8 million 237 6 million 170 7 million eps diluted 0 59 0 84 0 59 considering the great first quarter this time last year and the fear of rising interest rates at the beginning of the quarter these results are pretty good overall total closings were more or less flat compared with this time last year and average sales prices ticked up slightly to 421 000 those numbers are largely attributed to strong performance in florida and texas as these were the only two segments to grow compared with the prior year absent these two states pultegroup saw significant declines across the board one thing that was a bit discouraging in these results was that net new orders were down 6 from this time last year as management noted though traffic to its communities were up 12 from this time last year what that probably means is that there s a lot of customer interest in buying a home today but there s probably a hurdle or two in the way of making a purchase whether that be higher sales prices interest rates or a combination of the two it seems as though the opportunity to grow is still there pultegroup also helped its cause with investors by repurchasing 25 million in stock in the quarter over the past five years the company has reduced total shares outstanding by 26 with more than 1 billion in cash on the balance sheet and a net debt to capital ratio of 28 the company should be able to do some significant share repurchases this year what management had to say in the prior quarter ceo ryan marshall described rising interest rates as the final straw among a myriad of factors that was led to slowing demand for new homes he made those comments when interest rates were closer to 5 and there were concerns that interest rates were going to head higher from there recently though the federal reserve s decision to pause any further interest rate increases for 2019 for the time being has led to a mortgage rate reprieve now we re looking at interest rates closer to 4 than 5 as a result marshall noted that customer demand is picking back up to their high 2018 levels we are experiencing a very typical seasonal upswing and are generally encouraged by the level of buyer activity that we re seeing further with the strong economic backdrop and the recent decline in mortgage rates there s every reason to believe that 2019 can be another good year for the housing industry overall our first quarter results are consistent with an improving demand environment reflective of the typical spring selling season traffic increased on a sequential basis throughout the quarter with more consumers visiting our communities each month as the quarter progressed more importantly traffic into our communities was also up each month over the same month last year both in absolute numbers and on a per community basis when adjusted for our higher community count absorption pace has also improved during the quarter although they remain below last year s level with that said it is worth noting that we experienced a very strong start to 2018 so the year over year comps are more challenging for the first half of this year you can read a full transcript of pultegroup s conference call the market s looking better but maybe it s not the best time to buy of its peers pultegroup s results are going to be especially sensitive to mortgage rates because its average selling price is notably higher its portfolio is geared more toward the move up and active adult markets than the first time buyer market that many of its peers want to target today that isn t necessarily a bad strategy as there are opportunities in all housing markets but investors should be aware of pultegroup s position in the market relative to its peers management s approach in the prior quarter was one that appeared to be bracing for a much larger market decline than what we actually saw even though it did buy back stock it was a relatively small amount considering its cash pile and modest debt levels with the housing market progressing in fits and starts however it s probably a good idea to remain conservative even though shares are seemingly cheap at eight times earnings investors should keep in mind that homebuilders consistently trade at a steep discount to the broader market so unless we see some encouraging numbers from the housing market over the next few months it s hard to get excited about this stock

by dr george venturini whoever it is that owns the big four banks one thing is clear if the same four custodian companies own similar chunks of each of the big four there is indication that the shareholders behind them do not want one bank to succeed at the expense of another the optimal result is had if all of them win together and maintain their dominant position of course thus structured the big four are regarded as too big to fail research by the productivity commission which has for quite some time arguing for more competition in the banking sector published ahead of the royal commission concluded that the four major banks were among the most profitable lenders in the world earning profit margins of 36 4 per cent in the june quarter of 2017 for the same period return on equity after tax were 13 6 per cent on the other hand the present neo liberal government has had in mind for quite some time to reward he four banks with corporate tax concessions to the tune of 3 2 billion to the a n z close to 4 billion to the c b a 2 6 billion to the n a b and 3 5 billion to westpac when the spill came in september 2015 the liberals practice no internal coups of course that ignominy is for labor a better free market expert was chosen malcolm turnbull made his fortune as chairman and managing director of goldman sachs and co australia in 1997 2001 eventually becoming a partner he has presumably maintained discreet connections and is listed as one of the former partners along with such notable such as mark carney governor of the bank of england 2013 and mario draghi president of the european central bank 2011 at mid september 2016 mr turnbull was in new york to address the united nations general assembly and to attend two special summits on refugees on that occasion he bragged on how to deal with the problem of illegal arrivals and volunteered to teach other countries on how to deal with the problems caused by more than 65 million people currently displaced around the world a situation not seen since the second world war on 20 march 2017 the turnbull government reaffirmed its commitment to multicultural australia with the release of the statement multicultural australia united strong and successful the statement was meant to outline the strategic direction and priorities for multicultural policy in australia we are a richly diverse nation it claimed and have flourished with waves of migration this cultural diversity is one of our greatest assets our immigration nation is not defined by race religion or culture but by our shared values of freedom democracy the law and equal opportunity we reject practices which undermine these shared values on 11 april 2018 a learned panel led by dr tim soutphommasane the race discrimination commissioner at the australian human rights commission returned to the theme of leading for change a blueprint for cultural diversity and inclusive leadership 2016 with a new up dated study by the same titled and launched that day the panel lamented that the story it had told in 2016 had been an unhappy one there was an almost total absence of non european backgrounds represented among the cohort of chief executives in australia two years later the panel continue the story our new report it alerted provides an updated overview of the representation of cultural diversity in the senior leadership of australian organisations leading for change a blueprint for cultural diversity and inclusive leadership revisited written in partnership with the university of sydney business school the committee for sydney and asia society australia gives a breakdown of the cultural diversity of the two most senior tiers of senior management within the asx 200 group of listed companies commonwealth and state government departments and universities the report also provides statistics for the cultural diversity of the australian parliament the findings of this report suggest we have a long way to go before realising the full potential of our multicultural population if progress is being made on cultural diversity it remains slow based on the 2016 census data on ancestry we estimate about 58 percent of australians have an anglo celtic background 18 per cent have a european background 21 per cent have a non european background and 3 per cent have an indigenous background however our examination of almost 2500 senior leaders in business politics government and higher education shows only very limited cultural diversity almost 95 per cent of senior leaders at the chief executive or c suite levels have an anglo celtic or european background of the 372 chief executives and equivalents we identified 97 per cent have an anglo celtic or european background the report offered a breakdown within the asx 200 companies there appears only to be eight ceos who have a non european background enough to squeeze into a tarago of the 30 members of the federal ministry there is no one who has a non european background and one who has an indigenous background it is similarly bleak within the public service where 99 percent of the heads of federal and state government departments have an anglo celtic or european background that s one of 103 universities don t fare much better just one of the 39 vice chancellors of australian universities has a non european background all up there are 11 of the 372 ceos and equivalents who have a non european or indigenous background a mere cricket team s worth of diversity these are dismal statistics for a society that prides itself on its multiculturalism they challenge our egalitarian self image and they challenge our future prosperity as a nation if we aren t making the most of our multicultural talents we may be squandering opportunities we reiterate that improving the representation of cultural diversity requires action at three levels leadership systems and culture through a series of case studies drawn from australian organisations experience we highlight examples of how such concrete steps can be taken the australian human rights commission report told the naked perhaps unpleasant truth and unmasked the facile pompous lies of governments writing about the report dr soutphommasane concluded if we are serious about shifting numbers it may be necessary to consider targets for cultural diversity if not quotas such measures don t stand in opposition to a principle of merit after all meritocracy presumes a level playing field yet do we seriously believe that a perfectly level playing field exists when there is such dramatic under representation of cultural diversity within leadership positions multiculturalism can be as superficial as food and festivals but if we re serious about our diversity we must be prepared to hold up a mirror to ourselves and ask if what we see looks right for an egalitarian and multicultural australia t soutphommasane australian business and other organisations persistently fall short on cultural diversity 13 april 2018 johnmenadue com see also the review by a distinguished australian scholar review leading for change corporate cultural countercurrents org on 30 november 2017 prime minister turnbull and treasurer scott morrison joined in announcing that the government would establish a royal commission into the alleged misconduct of australia s banks and other financial services entities the joint media release said that all australians have the right to be treated honestly and fairly in their dealings with banking superannuation and financial services providers the highest standards of conduct are critical to the good governance and corporate culture of those providers we have one of the strongest and most stable banking superannuation and financial services industries in the world performing a critical role in underpinning the australian economy in particular it was the view of the turnbull government that the australian banking system is systemically strong with internationally recognised world s best prudential regulation and oversight the ministers further observed that ongoing speculation and fear mongering about a banking inquiry or royal commission is disruptive and risks undermining the reputation of australia s world class financial system the government has decided to establish this royal commission to further ensure our financial system is working efficiently and effectively instead of the inquisition into capitalism that some have called for the royal commission will take a conventional focused approach it will not be a never ending lawyers picnic the view of the australian government was that our approach to banking and financial services reform has focused on ensuring that our financial system is resilient efficient and fair we have moved to establish a new one stop shop to resolve customer complaints significantly bolstered the australian securities and investments commission s powers and resources created a framework to hold banking executives accountable for their actions and acted to boost banking and financial services competition for the benefit of customers the government was concerned to ensure that the inquiry will not defer delay or limit in any way any proposed or announced policy legislation or regulation that is currently implementing the scope of the inquiry was to consider the conduct of banks insurers financial services providers and superannuation funds not including self managed superannuation funds and also to consider how well equipped regulators are to identify and address misconduct it will not inquire into other matters such as financial stability or the resilience of our banks the initiative was directed towards a sensible efficient and focused inquiry into misconduct and practices falling below community standards and expectations most australians are consumers of banking and financial services and we all have the right to be treated honestly and fairly by banking and financial services providers at this point the prime minister and the treasurer rhapsodised trust in a well functioning banking and financial services industry promotes financial system stability growth efficiency and innovation over the long term having resisted for some two years a call for a commission the government was now declaring that there was a sense of inevitability about it and furthermore praising itself for the decision as a matter of record turnbull had come under serious internal pressure and the combined pressure of the greens labor and much of the crossbench while the big four banks had written to treasurer morrison calling for an inquiry to end political uncertainty the royal commission into misconduct in the banking superannuation and financial services industry was established pursuant to the royal commissions act 1902 on 14 december 2017 by the letters patent issued by the governor general the letters patent which formally appointed the royal commissioner and outlined the terms of reference for the inquiry the commissioner the honourable kenneth madison hayne a c q c was authorised to submit an interim report no later than 30 september 2018 and was requested to provide a final report by 1 february 2019 the work of the royal commission began on 13 march 2018 it was to have a round of public hearings starting on 16 april 2018 as at 27 april 2018 the royal commission had received 4 501 public submissions of which 65 per cent on banking 10 per cent on financial advice and 9 per cent on superannuation the careful observer of business in australia would hardly find some novelties the same skulduggery had been going on for years just looking at the past ten years one would see that anz

a home being renovated in the south park neighborhood of raleigh n c feb 24 2019 raleigh and cities like it across the country have seen white residents moving into new built homes in largely african american neighborhoods at an accelerating rate logan r cyrus the new york times written by emily badger quoctrung bui and robert gebeloff in the african american neighbourhoods near downtown raleigh the playfully painted doors signal what s coming coloured in crimson in coral in sea foam the doors accent newly renovated craftsman cottages and boxy modern homes that have replaced vacant lots to longtime residents the doors mean higher home prices ahead more investors knocking more white neighbours advertisement here and in the center of cities across the united states a kind of demographic change most often associated with gentrifying parts of new york and washington has been accelerating white residents are increasingly moving into nonwhite neighbourhoods largely african american ones in america racial diversity has much more often come to white neighbourhoods between 1980 and 2000 more than 98 per cent of census tracts that grew more diverse did so in that way as hispanic asian american and african american families settled in neighbourhoods that were once predominantly white but since 2000 according to an analysis of demographic and housing data the arrival of white residents is now changing nonwhite communities in cities of all sizes affecting about 1 in 6 predominantly african american census tracts the pattern though still modest in scope is playing out with remarkable consistency across the country in ways that jolt the mortgage market the architecture the value of land itself in city after city a map of racial change shows predominantly minority neighbourhoods near downtown growing whiter while suburban neighbourhoods that were once largely white are experiencing an increased share of black hispanic and asian american residents advertisement in a country still learning to forge neighbourhoods that are racially diverse and durably so these center city neighbourhoods appear to be on a path that is particularly unstable at the start of the 21st century these neighbourhoods were relatively poor and 80 per cent of them were majority african american but as revived downtowns attract wealthier residents closer to the center city recent white homebuyers are arriving in these neighbourhoods with incomes that are on average twice as high as those of their existing neighbours and two thirds higher than those of existing homeowners and they are getting a majority of the mortgages such disparities in incomes and mortgage access aren t apparent in suburban neighbourhoods with a growing share of hispanic black and asian american residents minority borrowers in those places have incomes similar to those of their new neighbours they receive mortgages proportionate to their share of the population in some measurable ways besides race they fit in to examine these patterns the new york times identified every census tract in the country that has grown notably more racially diverse since 2000 we then used millions of home mortgage disclosure act records to track the differences when white and nonwhite homebuyers bring change to a neighbourhood renters can also alter the fabric of a community but homeowners bring the economic might advertisement in south park a neighbourhood with picturesque views of the raleigh skyline the white homebuyers who have recently moved in have average incomes more than three times those of the typical household already here whites who were largely absent in the neighbourhood in 2000 made up 17 per cent of the population by 2012 since then they ve gotten nearly 9 in 10 of the new mortgages in neighbourhoods like this white residents are changing not only the racial mix of the community they are also altering the economics of the real estate beneath everyone that s what finally came to me it s not just the fact that the neighbourhoods look different that people behave differently said kia e baker who grew up in southeast raleigh and now directs a nonprofit agency southeast raleigh promise that serves the community some of that change can be positive she said this realization was not our black bodies literally have less economic value than the body of a white person she said as soon as a white body moves into the same space that i occupied all of a sudden this place is more valuable advertisement the value of place white flight and white return are not opposite phenomena in u s cities generations apart here they are part of the same story in the places where white households are moving reinvestment is possible mainly because of the disinvestment that came before it many of these neighbourhoods were once segregated by law and redlined by banks cities neglected their infrastructure the federal government built highways that isolated them and housing projects that were concentrated in them then banks came peddling predatory loans a single family detached house with a yard within a mile of downtown in any other part of the world is probably the most expensive place to live said kofi boone a professor at north carolina state university s college of design here because of that history it s a bargain south park grew up around shaw university a historically black college founded in 1865 and in the early 20th century it was home to black professors and doctors who trained there and to dozens of black owned businesses advertisement with time the disinvestment happened here too two major roads severed the neighbourhood absentee landlords came in a cherished park built in the 1930s began to deteriorate middle class black families who d previously been excluded from the suburbs began to move there longtime residents who have remained now fear that the area s sudden reinvention will erase the last remaining signs of its history we don t want to feel like everything is so bad you ve got to tear it down said lonnette williams 72 who lives in an elegant two story home built by her godfather s family in 1922 we want people to value our neighbourhood her sense of value however is different from and often at odds with the rising value of real estate her own home is appreciating but that means little to her because she has no intention of selling she looks at the half million dollar modern homes and to her they detract from the neighbourhood s value advertisement gone with the wind houses beach houses slave houses octavia rainey calls them rainey 63 has lived her entire life in a nearby neighbourhood and to her the second story porches rising around her look too much like overseers perches as the pace of home construction has increased so too has the volume of mailers to longtime residents we pay cash as is no cost or fees third notice some even warn disguised as bills going soon to collection in the frenzy a real estate agent once told rosalind blair sanders that she wasn t using her land to its full potential she runs a child development center on the edge of downtown everyone has a price she was told advertisement she is baffled over the math of what the children are worth the rise of a new market african americans have remained so segregated in american cities in large part because white people have avoided living in black neighbourhoods and seldom even considered buying a home in one what changed then how did the first developer to renovate a home know a new market would be waiting for it i guess the answer is i didn t know said jason queen a 39 year old developer in raleigh but i did know that i wanted to be in downtown advertisement queen who had worked in historic preservation has rehabilitated or built about 100 homes in the historic corridor just east of downtown raleigh starting with a house that he and his wife lived in and renovated on the edge of south park a decade ago queen was his own market he rejected long car commutes and cul de sacs this part of the city was more affordable than anywhere else near downtown and he wanted diversity what i didn t want to do is move to a neighbourhood where all the kids look exactly the same as my kids said queen who is white i didn t think that was the right thing to do but cities across the country have changed as much as preferences like queen s have and it is hard to untangle the two crime plummeted in the years preceding all this redevelopment public housing projects were demolished for mixed income housing cities reinvested in neglected downtowns the runup in home prices in the early 2000s also left middle class households searching for affordable housing by then many working class white neighbourhoods in good locations had already gentrified predominantly african american and hispanic neighbourhoods were what remained the old housing stock close to the center of many cities was also approaching the end of its life stuart rosenthal an economist at syracuse university argues that it s often possible to predict a neighbourhood s income level 20 years into the future by the age of its housing stock today older homes are more likely to be replaced and in the u s housing market newly built or renovated housing invariably goes to higher income households south park was primed in all these ways to become much wealthier many houses had lost nearly all their value as the land underneath them grew more valuable then in the aftermath of the housing bust mortgage lending tightened particularly for african americans and hispanics white buyers got a head start in places like south park just as they were becoming newly desirable by the time more lending returned for minorities these neighbourhoods were increasingly priced out of reach the people who have bought queen s houses have been part of this process even if they did so valuing the area s diversity andrew and kelly hudgins a white couple purchased one of those homes in 2017 in south park they looked at a racial dot map of raleigh when they first moved to the area they knew they wanted to be where the white dots didn t dominate but they worried about furthering gentrification themselves we struggled with that for a long time said andrew hudgins 29 who works for two faith based nonprofits in a late night conversation with their pastor the couple made peace with it this way if we didn t somebody else was definitely going to buy that home hudgins said and perhaps that other couple would value more what south park could become than what it is now or what it has been historically their home was also built on a long vacant lot so they felt no one had been pushed out to make way for them in the two years since they ve celebrated holidays with their neighbours and played with their children from the porch swing they hung to help meet everyone they ve also watched four other homes on the block cleared for redevelopment seeking stable diversity the ship of zion church operates a small grocery store and a weightlifting gym in south park the church s pastor chris jones has occasionally tried to flag down white residents jogging by he wants to show them what the church has built and invite them to use the gym but the joggers tend to have earphones in and to look away so far he has been unsuccessful attracting any of them inside here integration is not going very well jones expects that will be the story of the neighbourhood you have a half million dollar home next to a home that s maybe 20 000 i wish that could stay i wish those families could get to know each other he said but because of economics that can t happen eight blocks away queen recently opened his largest project yet a food hall that will eventually have a full service grocery store next door the project also aspires to serve everyone shoppers with food stamps or those seeking high end snacks diners who want oysters on the half shell or 6 fish sticks this too faces uncertain prospects the development was designed to make viable the grocery store the community wanted queen said but some residents are waiting to see the prices the food hall is trying to signal that longtime neighbours are welcome too one painting inside shows a pair of african american teenagers from the neighbourhood but they must walk past the new 700 000 rowhomes outside to get here in so many ways good intentions are insufficient to manage this change they often wind up contributing to it the food hall will make the area still more desirable more fly by night flippers and property scouts will come even the city s efforts to invest in previously neglected neighbourhoods have the effect of opening this door wider the city is always the battleground when it was failing that was a problem and now that it s succeeding that s also a problem said ken bowers raleigh s planning director people used to debate whether the city was delivering equal parks or transit service in all neighbourhoods now the debate we re having is are these parks gentrifying the neighbourhood he said that s a very dysfunctional place to be in the suburbs a far different set of processes is driving the demographic change as middle class minority families seek more space or better schools as immigrant communities take root or as families are increasingly priced out of the city this kind of increased diversity may bring its own challenges but at least among the homeowners there is something stabilizing in the fact that the new households economically resemble their neighbours whether the communities around them are working class middle class or wealthy baker the 36 year old nonprofit director who grew up in southeast raleigh recently bought a home in a suburb just east of the city she calls her neighbourhood extremely diverse and she has no reason to suspect that the diversity there today will tip into segregation of a different kind tomorrow ideally said ingrid gould ellen a professor at new york university america could get to a place where the real estate market in any location isn t so sensitive to signals about race we made some progress by getting to a point where the entry of one black family did not signal that oh my god this is a neighbourhood that s going to fall apart ellen said maybe we can get to a point where the entry of one white family is not a signal that this is a neighbourhood that s immediately going to have million dollar condos near downtown raleigh something like that signal has already been sent the home next to williams has been replaced by two far more expensive ones the new home next to rainey s now dwarfs hers the lot next to jones weightlifting gym is for sale the rented duplex next to the hudginses has morphed into a newly remodeled single family home with a bright yellow door the lot next to sanders child development center is for sale too by the city she has wanted to acquire it for years but now she is in a bidding war for 0 17 acres of land that previously held a gas station and the price is up to 390 000 tracking the shift this analysis was based primarily on two data sources demographic data from the united states census bureau and home lending data published as part of the federal home mortgage disclosure act the census data was used to calculate the chance that two randomly selected residents of a tract would be of a different race tracts where this diversity index grew by at least 10 percentage points between 2000 and 2017 were considered to have diversified the home mortgage disclosure act data includes the race and income of nearly all buyers who got loans for 1 to 4 family homes in each tract it excludes cash buyers and those who got loans from friends or family members the analysis included loans made since 2012 the first year that data was reported using current census tract boundaries

china s president xi jinping hosted the second belt and road forum in beijing on april 26 27 125 countries and 40 international organisations have joined the belt and road initiative the bri is an enormously ambitious project which envisages the linkage of the entire eurasian mega continent and its near and far periphery in southeast south and west asia africa europe and latin america through interconnected land and sea infra structure trade and investment thirty seven heads of state and government scores of ministers and 5 000 delegates participated in the forum reflecting the growing endorsement of the bri this acceptance reflects a desire among developing countries to emulate the successful model of china s economic development and a recognition that it can provide an invaluable path towards global economic growth greater prosperity and peace and stability in developing countries reportedly 175 agreements have been signed under the rubric of the bri projects amounting to 90 billion have been implemented the planned outlay on infrastructure projects is 1 trillion this figure is likely to increase as non chinese sources of official finance and private sector finance join in funding bri projects the scope of the concept now envisages incorporation of various forms of cooperation such as the digital economy e commerce and creation of a br studies network linking think tanks not one of america s asian allies has the stomach to confront china their largest trading partner the us has declared its opposition to the bri and sponsored a political and media campaign to discourage developing countries and its allies from joining it the us and western refrain of china s so called debt trap diplomacy stories of corruption and failed projects have been repeated as nauseam although the basis for such reports has been credibly refuted by the parties concerned the admonitions regarding the debt owed to china are particularly galling given that over 90 per cent of developing country debt is owed to western countries and institutions servicing this debt consumes around 30pc of annual hard currency outflows from these developing countries this debt is due to flawed western development aid which has contributed only marginally to the development of recipient countries the us opposition has a strategic rationale the initiative trumps the us aim of creating a ring of alliances around china s periphery and maintaining its domination of the india pacific the us has yet to acknowledge this is a losing battle not one of america s asian allies has the stomach to confront china their largest trading partner india has declared it values economic cooperation with china japan and australia have stopped joining the us navy in freedom of navigation operations in the south china sea miffed by us tariffs japan has joined the bri as a third party a japan china fund has been set up to co invest in bri projects seventeen central european countries have formed a group with china to promote economic cooperation including connectivity projects italy was the first g7 country to officially join the bri even others like the uk france and germany who feel compelled by their alliance with the us to critique the bri are availing of every commercial opportunity emanating from china s economic expansion and the bri america s own companies are unwilling to heed the official boycott over 150 000 us companies are operating within the chinese economy only a handful are likely to move out china s further opening up is likely to further reinforce the interdependence of the world s two largest economies pakistan hosts bri s flagship component prime minister imran khan was one of only seven leaders requested to address the summit he called the bri a model of collaboration partnership connectivity and shared prosperity and a new and distinct phase along the path of globalisation cpec is now the principal vehicle for intensification of bilateral ties of the 1tr allocated by china to bri projects 72bn is envisaged for cpec of the 90bn invested so far around 27bn was in pakistan china values its strategic partnership with pakistan and recognises the imperative of ensuring its security stability and development the level of mutual trust between them is unparalleled its cooperation is essential to ensure pakistan s ability to maintain credible deterrence against india and to stabilise afghanistan after us withdrawal if india is ever amenable to normalising ties with pakistan china s and perhaps russia s intermediation may prove more advantageous than america s the opportunity for pakistan in china is more compelling china is supporting pakistan s infrastructure development and industrialisation it can be a growing market for pakistan s exports pakistan must aim not only to emulate the path of china s growth but to improve on it by learning from its successes and failures pakistan s aim should be not so much to catch up as to leapfrog into the 21st century economy in its cooperation pakistan should not seek the technologies of the past or present but those of the future which china is now introducing and applying high speed rail not old systems ai electric vehicles environment friendly energy e commerce etc pakistan needs to be well organised islamabad must identify what it wants and needs from china and formulate a strategy of how to achieve it such a strategy will need to be coordinated with china at the policy operational and execution levels pakistan must deploy the best available technical and administrative expertise from the private or public sector from within and outside pakistan in each area of cooperation the creation of an autonomous cpec authority would be useful to achieve the planned outcomes in an environment of great power rivalry there must be strategic clarity in islamabad india s enmity is a constant after elections it may be reduced to hostility or at best rivalry the us south asia strategy is predicated on india s regional domination there can be no wishful thinking that this can be changed by expressions of goodwill or clever diplomacy the only way the us will treat pakistan equitably is if it sees attractive economic opportunities in pakistan for this pakistan needs china s cooperation pakistan s best choice now is to tie itself to china with hoops of steel as proposed by the then foreign secretary s k dehlavi in 1962 it would be tragic if we turn away from history s beckoning finger once again the writer is a former pakistan ambassador to the un

thanks siya and thank you for attending our first quarter conference call we ve continued the momentum we achieved throughout 2018 and believe we re very well positioned with more scale more reach and enhanced technological capability under our belt i d like to go through a summary of some of our first quarter accomplishments we completed the greater hudson transaction in early january and integrated those systems less than 30 days after closing as of today cost saves are fully implemented and clients have seamlessly been transitions over to connectone essentially the merger is behind us from a financial perspective the benefits of this value added transaction and why we believe it would be beneficial to shareholders has proven to be true our loan to deposit ratio improved our cre concentration was reduced our net interest margin was strengthened and the upward trajectory of tangible book value per share continued as discussed on prior calls connectone is focused on disciplined growth opportunities expanding geographically within our target markets and making investments in the best interests of long term shareholder value creation as a growth company we re committed to our people first culture and continue to invest in financial technology to stay ahead of the competition in this regard we recently announced an agreement to acquire boefly a new york city and boston based privately held fintech company with dynamic patented technology boefly helps connect small to medium size businesses with professional loan brokers and lenders across the united states this transaction which is expected to close in may provides connectone with an avenue to leverage the digital foundation we ve built here at connectone while also expanding and diversifying our revenue streams additionally it allows us to jumpstart our recently established sba lending platform while we don t expect sba lending to be a significant segment of our loan portfolio going forward the risk adjusted returns in sba are strong and we will look to expand in this area in a prudent and measured way we ve received a lot of calls of interest around this transaction which has largely gone under the radar we believe partnerships like this are critical for the future of banking with the industry becoming less brick and mortar oriented given the synergies the strong cultural alignment between the companies this is a low cost transaction with very limited downside and by establishing a national presence in the digital marketplace there s a meaningful upside to enhance connectone s digital bank strategy additionally in an effort to position boefly to potentially create significant value for connectone shareholders down the road it will operate as an independent division of connectone it will be led by mike rozman boefly s current ceo under the boefly brand and business model we look forward to welcoming the boefly team and leveraging our operating expertise to drive its growth while disciplined growth is exciting we ve also been very successful in investing in process improvements in all areas of connectone as we ve discussed we ve been evaluating every area of the bank s operations funding deposit gathering and back office to determine where technology can create efficiencies while also supporting our client s demand for always on banking services as part of our approach to improve our client s digital experience we continue to partner with leading technology companies to enhance our digital products and to offer a competitive suite of consumer products towards this end our ncino platform rollout continues as you may recall the rollout was initially focused on digitizing our lending process we re now expanding the ncino process into additional business lines including deposit gathering further strengthening the alignment between our deposit and loan originations in addition to our technological investments connectone has grown responsibly within our target markets surrounding new york city we expanded our footprint while also continuing our branch rationalization strategy ultimately increasing our total assets per employee to 17 million placing us well above in fact more than double the average for banks under 10 billion in assets those who saw the earnings release you probably notice we had an isolated charge for one credit related to a loan on a new jersey commercial office building that was mismanaged by the owners and operators while we are very disappointed this is also a very rare occurrence for connectone we have various avenues to pursue a recovery and believe we are now more than adequately reserved that said overall our credit quality measures improved significantly during the quarter and bill will be sharing a little bit more about these improved metrics with you shortly before turning the call over to bill i d like to highlight that given our strong financial performance our rising capital levels and current favorable repurchase economics we recently announced the stock repurchase program the plan authorizes the repurchase of up to 1 2 million shares or approximately 3 5 of our common stock we also recently increased our quarterly dividend by 20 to 0 09 a share these decisions reflect on our track record our confidence in the future and our ability to use our free cash flow to return capital to shareholders without impeding our investment strategy at this time i ll turn the call over to bill bill burns thank you frank so it was a busy quarter but a very productive one and i m going to dig a little more into the details then frank and i will be happy to answer any of your questions as frank mentioned we closed the greater hudson acquisition at the beginning of the quarter and i m going to go through the financial impact of the transaction first the merger added about 375 million of loans and 425 million of deposits on top of that with the loan increased sequential footings by about 8 we had annualized loan growth of a little more than 5 and annualized average deposit growth of more than 10 tangible book value per share increased by nearly 2 for the quarter including dilution from the merger so organically we grew by more than 3 for the quarter and about 15 over the past year tangible book value per share is now 14 67 up from 12 93 a year ago the merger and our growth in deposits contributed to further improvement in our loan to deposit ratio which is now down to 108 from 111 at year end greater hudson bank was less concentrated in cre than connectone and that contributed to a further decline in our cre concentration metrics improved slightly to 475 for 480 our net interest margin widened by 7 basis points to 3 34 in the quarter with that increase attributable to about 1 million of pre tax purchase accounting income in this quarter that accretion amount currently maps out at a similar quarterly level until the end of 2020 tails off a little bit after that can vary of course depending on the performance of the acquired assets and even without purchase accounting accretion the nim was maintained in the sequential quarter and up 1 basis point from last year s first quarter we ve been able to maintain a fairly consistent core margin in this challenging interest rate environment but going forward i m going to be a little bit conservative and forecast slight compression due to competitive pressures over the remainder of the year as for merger cost saves as of today we already have achieved full phase in of the 40 targeted cost saves during the first quarter probably about 75 percent of those saves were realized and that was without any branch closures although we continue to rationalize our entire branch network we probably will be closing 1 or 2 in the coming months turning to overall earnings for the quarter as frank mentioned we had that one isolated charge and had an elevated provision and with it a slight decrease in our performance metrics nevertheless excluding merger charges roa was 1 18 and return on tangible common was 13 7 both very strong metrics relative to our peers meanwhile credit quality metrics improved significantly nonaccrual loans as a percentage of total loans excluding the taxis declines to 0 41 from 0 53 quarter ago and from 0 49 one year ago non performing assets ratio that includes the taxies declined to 0 79 from 0 95 sequentially and from about 1 a year ago reserves as a percent of nonaccruals excluding the taxis jumped to 181 from 147 at year end in terms of capital the holding company s tangible common equity ratio increased for the fourth consecutive quarter to 8 83 at 3 31 that s a 50 basis point increase over the past year and as you know early this year we announced the stock repurchase plan and just before the window closed for the quarter we were able to buy some stock at about 19 a share we expect to resume repurchase activity very soon also we increased our common dividend this quarter 20 to 0 09 per share per quarter based on our expectations for strong performance going forward now let me give you some color around our tax revision with new jersey still not providing any clear clarification on the exact impact of last year s legislation we re taking a middle of the road approach in other words we are reserving for a moderate increase in state taxes that raises our core effective rate to approximately 22 to 23 you may notice that our effective tax rate for the quarter came in only at 17 6 but that was largely the result of merger expenses which decreased the percentage of income from taxable versus nontaxable sources and that leads to a lower rate i like to talk a little about the boefly acquisition we view this as a low risk high reward undertaking adding digital functionality to asset generation the entry price is low in the single digit millions and is variable based on certain predefined performance targets currently boefly s revenue is strictly fee income largerly referral fees earned through marketplace platform our goal is to expand those revenues as well as provide opportunities for some sba lending at the bank either for gain on sale or for portfolio as market conditions dictate so i m going to recap these highlights for the quarter greater hudson merger is fully integrated just 3 months after it closed our performance metrics although slightly lower than usual this quarter are still very strong and we are targeting a 15 roe going forward even with a higher tax rate we continue as always to keep an eye on tangible book value per share which continues to increase at a nice pace our net interest margin has been remarkably stable in a very tough operating environment our credit quality metrics improved significantly and finally with the fintech acquisition of boefly we are now positioned to participate in the digital lending space going forward we will continue to focus on both organic growth and value enhancing opportunistic m a and now it s time to turn back over to frank frank sorrentino great bill thanks we covered a lot today and as i ll note connectone has an excellent foundation to build upon we ve demonstrated that we are that we are a skilled acquirer with a track record of integrating transactions quickly and effectively we re well positioned to continue to grow organically even in a tough environment and still see our growth rate in the high single digits for the year in both deposits and loans and we re continuing to transform by expanding our digital channels and becoming more technologically focused than even before as we look ahead to the remainder of 2019 our priorities remain solid organic execution supplementing growth with m a advancing our best in class efficiency being good stewards of our shareholders capital and continuing to make strategic investments for the future i want to thank everyone for listening we appreciate your interest in connectone and at this time operator we ll take any questions from the audience question and answer session operator thank you the first question will come from william wallace with raymond james please go ahead sir william wallace on boefly can you maybe help us with the economics of the business maybe give us a sense of currently what the run rate of loans that the business is connecting with brokers and lenders might be and then i d like to get a sense as to how aggressively you think you might be able to grow that bill burns well first the current run rate is on referral fees from that marketplace platform and that is in the 1 million to 2 million range currently look we re going to try to grow there a number on that annually and so obviously we re going to try to grow that and i can t give you an exact number william wallace as far as i believe you mentioned that there is potential opportunity that there could be a balance sheet opportunity from this business should we assume that any loans that you put on the balance sheet from boefly would be in market or does it expand your thinkings about what you might be willing to put on your balance sheet from a geographic prospective frank sorrentino wally i ll take that question so certainly we would be one of the participating lenders that are on the platform there are many banks that currently go to that marketplace for loans today we would just be added to that roster and yes we would be looking for loans that fit the same model that we ve been running all along here which is clients that are within our market area plus the ability to look at other opportunities that make sense for us maybe outside the market for organizations that are either headquartered here or have a presence within the marketplace itself william wallace and then on the office building that you had the charge up on was that already in nonperforming bill burns yes it was already on nonaccrual and there had been a previous charge on it william wallace had you had a contract on this building a while back that fell through frank sorrentino not to best of my knowledge bill burns no william wallace and then last question bill could you update us on your thoughts around the net interest margin just given the current rate environment and the potential bill burns yes we ve been very successful on maintaining the margin but it has been difficult the rate of increase in our loan portfolio i feel is going to go a little bit slower than the cost of deposits but it all depends on the mix of loans as well as our success in raising noninterest bearing deposits so my best guess is again 1 or 2 basis points quarter compression i m hopeful that we can do better than that operator thank you from the question the next question will come from matthew breese with piper jaffray please proceed with your question matthew breese bill i know you mentioned what you thought the accretable yield might be i think i missed it did you say 1 million a quarter through year end or through 2020 bill burns through 2020 matthew breese so similarlyâ bill burns and that s from the greater hudson yes from the greater hudson transaction matthew breese and then as we think about bill burns there is some left over from union center still but it was about 1 million from greater hudson matthew breese understood okay and then i was hoping to gain some color related to the loan pipeline how that stacks up now versus the prior period and how does the blended yield on that stack up versus the roughly 5 you had on the average balance sheet this quarter bill burns yes so the pipeline is strong our look we still have our growth target in the high single digits and we probably grew by 5 in the first quarter after adjusting for greater hudson and now as expected it s always a little bit slow at the beginning of the year so the pipeline is robust there is competitive pressures on the lending side but we re still originating loans on average about the 550 base so we still see continued increase in the loan yield and the only question is how is that going to compare to the increase in deposit cost frank sorrentino and just from a perspective of mix i think it s the mix you would expect with some increases in the c i portion matthew breese now you did mention deposit competition is still pretty stiff a number of your competitors have noted that competition at least this quarter seems to be leveling off are you seeing that as well or would you characterize the environment any differently frank sorrentino it depends how you see we talked about this yesterday so what i think is happening is that the level of increase in the increase in the competition has leveled off but there s clearly a heightened level of competition going on i believe the expectation though going out into the future of increasing or continued increases in rates is probably not as strong but certainly the competition for each dollar today is pretty fierce bill burns and i think this is not just affecting connectone it s everyone the spreads on deposits aren t getting better and we re still having the rollover of cd impact that is increasing the total cost of funds even if the fed isn t raising rates matthew breese my last one is just in regards to the tax rate i wanted to better understand the middle of the road approach so what are we waiting on for clarification and then best case scenario what could it be and then in a worst case scenario would it be back to the 26 is that way to think about it bill burns yes it s probably it could be up by 3 to 4 basis points or down by 3 to 4 sorry it could be up by 3 to 4 percentage points or down by 3 to 4 percentage points from that middle 22 to 23 and i think different banks are reporting different amounts right now but nobody knows for sure and this is of course what we reported it s not necessarily what we how we handle it on our tax return and i said it s a reserve so we re essentially creating a reserve right now right matthew breese so should we anticipate that for the remainder of the year it s in that 22 to 23 range where you accrue and then we ll have some clarity at the end of the year when you actually file bill burns well you re asking me to guess if we ll get clarification before the end of year i think we probably won t and that could take a very long time to know for sure and so my best guess is we ll continue that the rest of the year if it changes and everybody knows how this is going to work then obviously we ll adjust immediately operator the next question will come from austin nicholas with stephens austin nicholas most of my questions were answered but maybe just back on the expenses could you maybe just provide some outlook on how you see the expense base kind of trending from here and then on top of that kind of 1 million to 2 million of fees that you re getting from boefly can you maybe give us a feel of what the incremental expense is on that bill burns it s roughly the same it s basically a breakeven at the present time so i wouldn t change any earnings estimate relative to boefly at the current run rate as far as expense growth i mean i kind of give the same answer all the time for that it really depends on our revenue growth and i see maintaining the efficiency ratio relatively in the range we re in now so we ve been in the single probably in the mid single digit expense growth austin nicholas and then maybe just on capital any updated thoughts on uses of capital and how you re viewing the m a environment kind of with your acquisitions integrating to the remainder of the year any opportunities that you re seeing in the market frank sorrentino yes i mean i think there s lots of opportunities but as you know someone has to be a buyer and someone has to be a seller and it has to make good sense for us right it s got a check a lot of the boxes we ve got to do something where we either gain an expertise we don t have today it s got to be a deposit franchise it s got to be something that we believe is either in market or expands our market in a way that we think is meaningful so it has to check lots of boxes before it fits in it s not that we re just looking for anything just to fill out the balance sheet i think we ve demonstrated time and time again that we ve been able to be patient but strike when the transaction looks right and at the end of the day i think we ve created value for our shareholders bill burns in terms of other other than some capital changing event it looks like based on our return projections our dividends and our growth we ll be able to handle all that growth and also be able to continue the stock repurchase program and continue with the higher dividend level operator thank you for your question your next question will come from collyn gilbert with kbw please go ahead collyn gilbert just to follow up on your comment on the stock repurchase you had indicated to be able to continue do you foresee a scenario where you would go and issue another authorization or just trying to get your kind of longer term view on utilizing repurchases as part of the capital management tool bill burns well when we re done with this one we ll take a look at doing another one that s my what i would say but let s finish this one first before addressing that collyn gilbert and your price level you said before the window closed was around 19 how are you thinking aboutâ bill burns yes the stock price is growingâ collyn gilbert yes how areâ frank sorrentino yes we really think the stock is undervalued so we re very happy to buy back stock at this level collyn gilbert and then just on the loan growth front frank i know you said kind of assume similar mix of loans going forward or whatever but just as you how you re seeing sort of the construction pipeline kind of near term and then longer term too frank sorrentino yes i think our construction pipeline has been fairly consistent we re seeing a good level of turnover within the portfolio projects are getting completed and being refinanced sold or whatever and so to the extent that we can look ahead and believe that the marketplace is still an inviting place that provides for construction lending we re going to continue to do it and at this moment in time with interest rates where they are and the demand in this market the way it is and we have to get into a much bigger conversation about that relative to specific areas of the market but for the things that we re doing we feel pretty confident about what we have in the portfolio today i would not expect it to change materially one way or the other but as you ve seen over the past quarters it goes up and down depending on the completion cycle and then payoffs and whatever happens as we go through that but right now we like the asset and we like the borrowers that we have in the asset class operator thank you this concludes today s q a session i ll now turn it back to management for closing remarks frank sorrentino well great well thank you all and thanks for joining us on our first quarter earnings call we appreciate your interest and we look forward to speaking with you again next time so thank you all and have a great day operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference you may now disconnect your lines
leading up to former vice president joe biden getting into the 2020 race the corporate news logic was that only an old reliable hand like his could save the democrats from what would be a self destructive radical leftward lurch for the last few years the corporate news media s universe has been framed as a closed planetary system that has its nemesis donald trump as the solar center of all creation in this great white man cosmology like the free floating head of oz every other being is defined by their alignment with him polls are anchored in only the terrain of his gaze as the pundits make their narrative all about donald trump and now with the inflation of their biden balloon they have the race they want and it s the race they need to keep the status quo two white guys in their 70s arguing over charlottesville in the rearview mirror this reduces the american people to passive voyeurs of their own history it ignores that they themselves are already out making history in the form of rising multiracial labor militancy that s delivering change people can take to the bank these stories about workers organizing and winning are told if they are told at all in isolation because the one thing the corporate news media that serves wall street does not want is for this to catch on better to have you in a focus group than focused on taking charge of your own destiny by striking for better wages like the 30 000 stop shop workers in new england who just won their strike for higher wages and better health care members of the united food and commercial workers international union at more than 240 stop shops across connecticut massachusetts and rhode island went out for 11 days against dutch grocery giant ahold delbaize and cost the multinational 10 million a day in operating profits this is not a one off but part of a rising labor tsunami that s inspired a diverse list of workers including teachers nurses college adjuncts reporters factory workers uber lyft drivers cafeteria workers in silicon valley even prison inmates to put something at risk to organize and if needed strike since the 1970s workers have dealt with wage deflation and stagnation even as their productivity skyrocketed as owners hogged the profits at the same time both political parties did the bidding of their donors enacting a tax policy that enabled obscene wealth concentration and income inequality as a result tens of millions of working class families struggle week to week to make ends meet in a country that taxes their labor at a higher rate than it does the investment income of the idle rich that should be grounds for an overthrow of the major party duopoly right there the decline in our collective economic circumstance came as corporations increased their dominion over our politics and went to war to destroy the american labor movement their tactics evolved from the blunt force trauma of strikebreakers and private security forces that got bad press into the less messy route of lobbying and litigating which left fewer fingerprints in the post world war ii era labor union density hit its high point at 34 8 percent in 1952 that year there were 470 strikes that involved bargaining units with more 1 000 workers with close to three million workers engaged in the direct action of a strike by 1984 three years after president reagan broke the professional air traffic controllers union labor union density declined to 21 6 percent and there were just 62 strikes involving 376 000 workers in 2017 the first full year of the trump presidency an anemic 11 9 percent of the country s workforce was in a union with only seven cases in which a union went out on strike with just 25 000 workers hitting the bricks but it appears there comes a point when folks have just had enough of being told things are better when they are not or that the roaring stock market portends a great economy when it has absolutely nothing to do with their lives according to the u s bureau of labor statistics bls in 2018 there were 20 major work stoppages involving 485 000 workers the number of major work stoppages beginning in 2018 was the highest since 2007 21 major work stoppages the bls reported the number of workers involved was the highest since 1986 533 000 workers to be sure our teachers are leading the way in 2018 the largest work stoppage by days idle was between the arizona state legislature and arizona education association and involved 81 000 teachers and staff totaling 486 000 days of idleness the bls reports the second largest stoppage in 2018 involved the oklahoma state legislature and the oklahoma education association accounting for 405 000 days idle statewide major work stoppages in educational services also occurred in west virginia kentucky colorado and north carolina this is a resurgence that s been decades in the making and transcends the conventional framing of our small bore electoral politics it is generational not measured in convenient four year cycles for now the corporate news media has bestowed front runner status on biden based on their theory he is best suited to recapture the rust belt states like pennsylvania michigan and ohio all states that had a labor legacy voted twice for obama biden but fell for trump s racially spiced populism but this analysis is ahistorical because it ignores the reality that it was the eight years of obama biden corporatist neoliberalism that lost them in the first place
the federal student loan system has been a massive failure each year washington invests more in higher education topping out at 93 billion last year yet students are more indebted and ill equipped for the workforce than ever despite the fact that economists have identified federal lending as the main driver of tuition inflation sen elizabeth warren released a proposal that doubles down on failed federal education policies her plan to make college tuition free and to eliminate student loan debt is a raw deal for american taxpayers and is a gift on a silver platter to the elite the details of the senator s proposal includes cancellation of up to 50 000 in debt for households earning less than 100 000 per year and partial cancellation for families earning between 100 000 and 250 000 per year altogether this proposal would provide complete loan debt elimination for 75 percent of all borrowers ultimately loan cancellation is regressive only one third of american adults hold a bachelor s degree and presumably earn more than those who chose not to attend college a report by the urban institute found that the top 25 percent of households by income hold almost half of all student loan debt while the bottom 25 percent hold just 10 percent it s hard to escape the fact that debt cancellation proposals would reward higher income households additionally tuition free public college is a generous gift to colleges and universities which will continue to raise tuition on the backs of american taxpayers nothing would prevent colleges from increasing costs on the heels of a massive new taxpayer subsidy a study from the federal reserve bank of new york found that federal subsidized loans lead to as much as a 60 cent increase in tuition on the dollar schools have no incentive to lower tuition because generous federal subsidies have created effectively unlimited access to loans and grants at least at this point students have to pay them back imagine how much costs would increase if federal taxpayers picked up the tab entirely instead of whipping out the magic wand and erasing student loan debt or more accurately moving your student loan balance into someone else s account we should be encouraging policies that put downward pressure on tuition prices and opens the door to career based education options getting the federal government out of the business of higher education is the first step private student loans would turn off the open spigot of money flowing into universities and cause schools to start competing to offer the best education at the best price second policymakers must reform our accreditation system to make room for short term career based programs to flourish free college proposals operate under the flawed assumption that all americans would benefit from a four year bachelor s degree however many students would benefit from a skills based program that would equip students for their desired career efficiently without the bachelor s degree fluff with americans 1 5 trillion in student loan debt america needs policy proposals that cut to the source of the problem debt cancellations plans that disproportionately benefit the well off would only make it worse
