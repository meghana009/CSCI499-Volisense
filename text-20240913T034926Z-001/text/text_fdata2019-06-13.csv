foreword this 18th annual review of the international role of the euro published by the ecb presents an overview of developments in the use of the euro by non euro area residents this report covers developments in 2018 and early 2019 this period was characterised by growing concerns about the impact of international trade tensions a protracted slowdown in global growth reversals in cross border capital flows and challenges to multilateralism including the imposition of unilateral sanctions on balance these developments together with progress towards deepening economic and monetary union emu seem to have had a positive effect on the international use of the euro which showed tentative signs of recovering from historic lows in particular the euro s share in global foreign exchange reserves international debt issuance and international deposits increased as did its share in outstanding amounts of international loans its use as an invoicing currency remained broadly stable as did shipments of euro banknotes to destinations outside the euro area the european commission has launched an initiative to strengthen the international role of the euro and issued a communication to this effect on 5 december 2018 like the commission the eurosystem stresses that the international role of the euro is primarily supported by a deeper and more complete emu including advancing the capital markets union in the context of the pursuit of sound economic policies in the euro area the eurosystem supports these policies and emphasises the need for further efforts to complete emu the ecb will continue to monitor developments in and publish information on the international role of the euro on a regular basis mario draghi president 1 main findings in 2018 and early 2019 there were tentative signs of a recovery in the international use of the euro with a composite index of the euro s international role increasing in the review period albeit from historic lows see chart 1 the euro remained unchallenged as the second most important currency in the international monetary system see chart 2 the share of the euro in global foreign exchange reserves rose in 2018 by more than 1 percentage point see table 1 several emerging market economies sold foreign exchange reserves to stabilise their domestic currencies amid tighter financial conditions and reversals in capital flows a large part of those interventions took place in us dollars mechanically underpinning the share of the euro in global foreign exchange reserves tentative evidence suggests that concerns about unilateral sanctions may have been another factor supporting diversification of the reserve portfolios of some central banks such as the central bank of russia to some extent these concerns may also have contributed to a 0 5 percentage point increase in the share of the euro in international deposits additional indicators tracked in this report show the share of the euro as having increased in the review period one such indicator is international debt issuance the share of the euro increased by more than 2 percentage points as a stronger us dollar exchange rate together with higher us interest rates raised concerns among international borrowers about higher debt servicing costs borrowers in emerging market economies markedly scaled back volumes of us dollar denominated issuance to reduce exposures to us dollar exchange rate movements and risks arising from currency mismatches by contrast the role of the euro as an invoicing currency for extra euro area trade transactions and shipments of euro banknotes to destinations outside the euro area remained broadly stable all in all financial turbulence in some emerging market economies growing concerns about the impact of international trade tensions and challenges to multilateralism including the imposition of unilateral sanctions seem to have lent support to the euro s global standing over the review period moreover euro area specific developments such as progress towards completing banking union and deepening emu more generally helped to further strengthen the euro area s resilience and in turn to boost the attractiveness of the euro internationally the european commission launched an initiative to strengthen the international role of the euro and issued a communication to this effect on 5 december 2018 like the commission the eurosystem stresses that the international role of the euro is primarily supported by a deeper and more complete emu including advancing the capital markets union in the context of the pursuit of sound economic policies in the euro area the eurosystem supports these policies and emphasises the need for further efforts to complete emu this year s report contains four special features the first of these looks at developments since the start of economic and monetary union 20 years ago assessing the economic benefits and costs of the international role of the euro from a central banking perspective in particular it shows that the balance between these benefits and costs has shifted with some of the traditional effects of international currency status having declined in relevance while others have become more apparent as a result changes in the global role of the euro may have consequences for the conduct of monetary policy all of which must be understood and taken into account when designing euro area monetary policy the second special feature aims to quantify the exorbitant privilege of international currency status for major currencies it explains that the relevant metric for this purpose is the share of foreign official holdings in the stock of outstanding highly rated debt a metric for which the euro is at par with the us dollar estimates from a simple error correction model that aims to disentangle long run stock effects from short run flow effects of net purchases of sovereign debt by foreign official reserve holders suggest that the exorbitant privilege enjoyed by the euro is economically significant foreign official reserve holdings of debt securities have compressed term premia on euro area long term yields by around 110 basis points which compares with around 160 basis points for us long term yields but foreign official holdings of euro area government debt are concentrated in the few euro area sovereigns issuing highly rated debt securities strengthening the credit quality of outstanding debt notably by pursuing sound and sustainable fiscal policies would contribute to increasing the supply of safe euro area debt and raising the euro s global appeal in the longer term the creation of a common euro area safe asset if so decided by member states in a way that does not undermine incentives for sound national fiscal policies could also contribute to this objective this in turn would help the euro s exorbitant privilege to be more widely shared across euro area sovereigns the third special feature assesses the role of the us dollar in trade invoicing for the global transmission of us and euro area monetary policy shocks it provides evidence on differences in shock transmission from the traditional perspective of producer currency pricing in which exporters price products in their own currency and from the dominant currency perspective in which exporters and importers price products in a third currency such as the us dollar it provides simulations using ecb global the ecb s main structural macroeconomic model for the analysis of global spillovers it shows that dominant currency pricing amplifies the effects of us monetary policy on us and global trade by contrast dominant currency pricing does not significantly alter the domestic effects of euro area monetary policy but it does reduce the effects of euro area monetary policy on global exports the fourth special feature provides stylised facts on the relative importance of the euro and the us dollar as denomination currencies for cross border bank positions which is useful for understanding the international transmission of shocks it focuses on 28 advanced and emerging market economies to analyse cross country heterogeneity in the currency mix of banking systems using data from the locational banking statistics of the bank for international settlements bis in addition to considering variations across countries and time in currency exposures it studies their relation to the geography of cross border banking and to the currency mix of local banking positions the special feature identifies three main stylised facts namely that the majority of national banking systems have larger net assets in euro than in us dollars that dispersion in net currency exposures has declined and that net cross border exposures towards the euro and the us dollar are shaped by the geography of cross border banking positions towards the euro area and partly mirror banks currency exposures in local positions chart 1

to outstanding amounts of foreign currency total amounts 2 key developments 2 1 use of the euro as an international reserve and investment currency the share of the euro in global official holdings of foreign exchange reserves increased in 2018 unlike that of the us dollar which continued to decline at constant exchange rates the share of the euro in globally disclosed holdings of foreign exchange reserves increased by more than a full percentage point between the end of 2017 and the end of 2018 to 20 7 see chart 3 moreover the share of the us dollar continued to decline over the review period to 61 7 an all time low since the start of economic and monetary union chart 3 the share of the euro in global foreign exchange reserves increased in 2018 developments in the shares of the euro us dollar and other currencies in global official holdings of foreign exchange reserves percentages at constant q4 2018 exchange rates sources imf and ecb calculations note the latest observation is for the fourth quarter of 2018 the us dollar remains the leading global reserve currency but its share has declined by more than 7 percentage points relative to its peak level before the global financial crisis although the euro grew temporarily in importance as an international reserve unit in the wake of the global financial crisis its role declined after the outbreak of the euro area debt crisis in the period 2010 11 the share of other currencies in official reserve portfolios increased significantly in parallel pointing to diversification of global reserve portfolios a trend which continued in the review period the increase in the share of the euro in global reserve portfolios in the review period appears partly related to factors that weighed on the use of the us dollar one such factor is that several emerging market economies many of which are large reserve holders sold us dollar denominated reserves heightened financial market volatility and reversals in cross border capital flows over the summer led these economies to conduct foreign exchange market interventions to stabilise their currencies between the end of march and the end of september 2018 they sold about usd 200 billion worth of mainly us dollar denominated foreign exchange reserves see the left panel of chart 4 chart 4 changes in 2018 in the currency composition of global foreign exchange reserve portfolios

observation is for february 2019 left panel and june 2018 right panel the emerging market economies referred to in the left panel chart include argentina china hong kong india indonesia thailand and turkey another factor that weighed on the us dollar is that some central banks might have started to consider reducing their positions in financial assets exposed to the risks of unilateral actions one example is russia one of the world s largest reserve holders which sold about usd 100 billion worth of us dollar denominated reserves in the wake of new rounds of us sanctions and purchased almost usd 90 billion worth of euro denominated and renminbi denominated assets in the second quarter of 2018 see the right panel of chart 4 with a share of about 39 the euro is now the main currency of denomination of russia s foreign exchange reserve holdings ahead of the us dollar and the renminbi with shares of 27 and 17 respectively china also reduced its holdings of us treasury securities in the course of 2018 in an environment of escalating global trade tensions to the tune of about usd 60 billion from a total of nearly usd 1 1 trillion it is difficult to assess whether other official reserve holders have taken or are contemplating taking similar steps not least owing to the limited information available publicly on the currency composition of central banks reserve portfolios see table a1 the role of the remaining reserve currencies continued to increase mainly on account of the chinese renminbi adjusting for valuation effects arising from exchange rate movements the shares of both the japanese yen and the pound sterling remained broadly stable see the left panel of chart 5 stability in the share of the pound sterling in turn suggests that official reserve holders remained confident in the review period that risks associated with an exit of the united kingdom from the european union could be mitigated non standard currencies continued to gain in importance see the right panel of chart 5 their share increased by nearly half a percentage point in 2018 mostly due to investments in chinese renminbi from russia the share of the chinese renminbi reached almost 2 of global foreign exchange reserves in the fourth quarter of 2018 double that of early 2017 see also box 1 which reviews recent developments in the renminbi s global role chart 5 the stronger role of the other reserve currencies was mainly on account of the renminbi shares of the japanese yen and of the pound sterling in global foreign exchange reserves left panel as well as of non traditional currencies including the chinese renminbi right panel percentages at constant q4 2018 exchange rates sources imf and ecb calculations notes the latest observation is for the fourth quarter of 2018 non traditional currencies include the australian dollar the canadian dollar the chinese renminbi and other currencies not included in the special drawing rights basket developments in portfolio flows to the euro area suggest that weaker euro area growth prospects and the lingering effects of the ecb s asset purchase programme were important determinants in lowering the attractiveness of the euro as an investment currency balance of payments data suggest that net purchases of euro area equities by foreign investors fell to about 60 billion in february 2019 from an all time high of almost 490 billion in december 2017 see the left panel of chart 6 waning demand for euro area equities in 2018 mainly reflected global factors particularly lower levels of global investor risk appetite in an environment of slowing global growth heightened trade tensions and lingering political uncertainty however idiosyncratic euro area factors including concerns of a more severe slowdown in activity in the euro area weighed additionally on the global attractiveness of euro area equities foreign investors continued to retreat from euro area bonds see the right panel of chart 6 against the background of the ecb s asset purchase programme and low euro area yields foreign investors remained net sellers of debt securities in 2018 to the tune of 190 billion chart 6 foreign investors remained net sellers of euro area debt securities in 2018 net purchases by foreign investors of euro area equities left panel and debt securities right panel cumulated flows over 12 months sources ecb and ecb calculations notes the latest observation is for february 2019 debt securities include bonds notes and money market instruments this interpretation is supported by new statistical evidence on the currency composition of euro area portfolio debt assets and liabilities holdings by euro area investors of foreign debt securities denominated in us dollars remained higher than those denominated in the euro in the review period see the left panel of chart 7 between 2010 and 2013 euro area investors rebalanced their holdings of foreign debt securities from euro to us dollar denominated assets presumably reflecting concerns about risks raised by the euro area debt crisis however the share of the euro at constant exchange rates did not recover subsequently this might have reflected mounting market expectations about and ultimately the launch of the ecb s programme of large scale purchases of sovereign bonds expectations that yields would fall in the euro area in turn may have encouraged euro area investors to turn to foreign bonds seen as close substitutes including us treasury securities the currency composition of portfolio debt liabilities vis à vis non euro area residents is also increasingly tilted towards the us dollar see the right panel of chart 7 anecdotal evidence suggests that this reflects issuances by us multinational enterprises and financial institutions via special purpose vehicles set up in some euro area countries as well the issuance of us dollar debt by euro area banks to hedge us dollar assets chart 7 the currency composition of euro area portfolio debt assets and liabilities is increasingly tilted towards the us dollar currency composition of euro area portfolio debt assets left panel and liabilities right panel percentages at constant q4 2018 exchange rates sources ecb and ecb calculations note the latest observation is for the fourth quarter of 2018 box 1 internationalisation of the chinese renminbi state of play prepared by massimo ferrari the international use of the chinese renminbi regained some strength in 2018 after the launch of several initiatives by chinese authorities to raise its global status however international use of the renminbi remains substantially below the peak levels of 2015 one popular indicator of the internationalisation of the renminbi is its role in international payments see the left panel of chart a swift data show that the average share of the renminbi declined from 2 2 in 2015 to about 1 8 in 2018 although it remains the fifth most used currency in international payments a composite index of the renminbi s global role suggests that it is less strong in 2018 than it was in 2015 see the right panel of chart a the currency s international role actually declined just after it was included in the special drawing rights basket by contrast use of the renminbi as a currency of denomination for international bonds and reserves increased noticeably in 2018 but at less than 2 the share of the renminbi in global foreign reserve portfolios outstanding amounts of international bonds and international liabilities remains small overall see the left panel of chart b the chinese authorities have taken initiatives to foster the international use of the renminbi they launched several projects in 2017 and 2018 under the umbrella of the belt and road initiative to support use of the renminbi as an invoicing currency for trade and to create direct trade routes between china and other economies the shanghai international energy trading centre launched an oil futures contract denominated in renminbi in 2018 with the goal of elevating it to benchmark status in the asia pacific region within the space of a few months trading volumes in the contract reached levels not too far off those in more established benchmarks such as wti or brent see the right panel of chart b plans for financial products traded directly in renminbi are also under consideration the expansion of the chinese banking sector which since 2016 has held total assets larger than those of european banks notably to developing economies may also have been another factor underpinning the renminbi s global appeal through the financing of international trade in renminbi for example time will tell whether these measures will succeed in increasing the global attractiveness of the renminbi complementary reforms to open china s capital account and move to market based exchange rate determination are also likely to be important if the renminbi is to reach its full potential chart a indicators pointing to a small

depreciated markedly by about 5 0 against the us dollar in nominal effective terms i e against the euro area s 38 major trading partners the depreciation of the euro was more contained at about 0 5 see the left panel of chart 8 reflecting among other things weakness of several emerging market currencies and the pound sterling the depreciation of the euro against the us dollar reflected mainly the stronger growth momentum and a faster pace of monetary policy normalisation in the united states relative to the euro area estimates obtained from a bayesian vector autoregression bvar model where structural shocks driving the usd eur exchange rate are identified via sign restrictions suggest that the euro s depreciation against the us dollar over the review period can be largely ascribed to a combination of relatively stronger demand and a tighter monetary policy stance in the united states relative to the euro area see the right panel of chart 8 in contrast market sentiment shocks which often explain a large share of exchange rate developments played a smaller role in the review period chart 8 the euro depreciated markedly against the us dollar on the back of a weaker outlook for euro area growth and a faster pace of us monetary policy normalisation exchange rate of the euro against the us dollar and in nominal effective terms vis à vis the currencies of 38 major trading

exchange market based on quantities points to a slight decline in the use of the euro in the absence of updated data from the triennial central bank survey of foreign exchange and over the counter otc derivatives markets conducted by the bis which was last released in december 2016 quantity based evidence on the role of the euro in the foreign exchange markets can be gleaned from data on foreign exchange transactions settled in the cls system cls is operated by cls bank international a specialised financial institution providing settlement services to its members in the foreign exchange market the share of the euro in global foreign exchange settlements decreased between january and december 2018 from about 38 to about 36 see the left panel of chart 9 amid lighter volumes of euro settlements see the right panel of chart 9 data are volatile however and such developments are not unprecedented moreover a comparison of the annual averages between 2017 and 2018 shows that the share of the euro increased by 0 7 percentage points the us dollar remained the leading currency in the foreign exchange market by a wide margin being involved in about 91 of all settlements in december 2018 while the euro remained the second most actively settled currency the role of the euro as an anchor currency i e as a currency of reference for the exchange rate regime of economies outside the euro area remained stable in the review period box 2 shows evidence of the strong regional dimension of the euro s role as an exchange rate anchor chart 9 the share of the euro in global foreign

billion equivalents per month sources cls bank international and ecb calculations note the latest observation is for march 2019 box 2 global currency areas prepared by massimo ferrari the international role of a currency can be measured based on several indicators such as liquidity in the exchange rate market use in international debt markets and denomination of foreign assets these indicators measure use of a currency beyond national borders another important factor to consider is that when a currency has a dominant role in the international monetary system shocks to the currency in question propagate to other currencies one example of this is the us dollar a large array of bilateral exchange rates co move strongly with the us dollar s nominal effective exchange rate a number of factors drive that finding including the fact that many trade and debt operations are us dollar denominated and many countries track us monetary policy closely see also box 6 estimating how much a currency acts as an anchor for the exchange rates of other countries is therefore one way of splitting the global economy into currency areas i e groups of countries with exchange rates co moving strongly with the us dollar or other major currencies we use a simple framework to that end in the spirit of mccauley and ito 2018 which consists of estimating the following model equation on monthly data l c i u s d t α β n e e r t e u r β n e e r t j p y β n e e r t g b p ε t where l c i u s d t is the bilateral exchange rate of country i vis à vis the us dollar regressed on the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro the yen and the pound sterling respectively the various coefficients β j measure how much the euro the yen and the pound sterling co move with the bilateral exchange rate of country i against the us dollar which captures their relevance for currency i this is also in the spirit of the standard frankel wei methodology albeit using nominal effective exchange rates in lieu of bilateral exchange rates expressed in a common numéraire currency the coefficient for the us dollar is computed as β 1 β β β which can be seen as an upper bound the β j coefficient estimates can then be plotted on a map to provide a visual representation of global currency zones ecb staff estimates using this methodology suggest that the us dollar plays a dominant role as a global anchor currency see chart a chart a the euro currency area is the second most important in the world estimated co movement with the dollar upper panel and the euro lower panel percentages derived from the β coefficient estimates discussed above sources ecb bis and ecb staff calculations notes the estimates are for december 2018 the boundaries shown on this map do not imply acceptance by the ecb the us dollar drives the exchange rates of most countries in the western hemisphere asia and the middle east the euro is an important anchor currency for non euro area european countries and for some countries in africa which typically share strong economic historical and institutional links with the euro area intuitively the β coefficient estimate equals 1 on the us dollar exchange rate for panama which is a dollarised economy and 1 on the euro exchange rate for denmark which pegs its currency vis à vis the euro within tight fluctuation bands the role of the japanese yen and the pound sterling is more limited by contrast 2 3 use of the euro in international debt and loan markets the euro in international debt markets the share of the euro in the stock of international debt securities remained stable in 2018 see chart 10 and table a4 at constant exchange rates the share of the euro in outstanding amounts of international debt securities remained stable at about 23 the dominant role of the us dollar in international debt markets continued to increase rising by about half a percentage point to over 63 since the mid 2000s the share of the euro has declined by about 8 percentage points while that of the us dollar has increased by close to 20 percentage points chart 10 the share of the euro in the stock of international debt securities remained stable in 2018 currency composition of outstanding international debt securities percentages at q4 2018 exchange rates sources bis and ecb calculations notes narrow measure the latest data are for the fourth quarter of 2018 however analysis of debt flows provides a different perspective with an increase in the share of the euro and a notable decline in that of the us dollar recent trends in international debt markets are more clearly reflected by developments in issuance than developments in stocks in 2018 total volumes of foreign currency denominated debt issuance declined by more than 10 to about usd 1 900 billion the largest decline in a year since the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008 see the left panel of chart 11 this decline was confined to issuance in us dollars debt financing in the euro and other currencies remained stable or increased slightly as a consequence the share of euro debt issuance increased by 2 5 percentage points see the right panel of chart 11 while the share of the us dollar declined for a second consecutive year by around 8 percentage points in total to less than 61 chart 11 the share of the euro in foreign currency denominated debt issuance increased in 2018 on the back of markedly lower issuance in us dollars currency composition of foreign currency denominated debt issuance left panel usd billions right panel percentages sources dealogic and ecb calculations note the latest data are for the fourth quarter of 2018 the decline in the share of the us dollar mainly reflected a decrease in us dollar issuance by borrowers in emerging market economies in an environment characterised by a stronger us dollar exchange rate and concerns about rising debt servicing costs the ascent of the us dollar as the main financing vehicle in global debt markets in the past decade mainly reflected dynamic borrowing of emerging market issuers seeking to take advantage of low us interest rates us dollar denominated issues by emerging market economies increased almost tenfold in the last decade see the left panel of chart 12 however this trend came to a halt in 2018 in an environment characterised by a stronger us dollar exchange rate weaker global growth and concerns about rising debt servicing costs borrowers in emerging market economies cut volumes of us dollar denominated issuance by about 30 us dollar debt issuance also declined among borrowers in non eu advanced economies also probably because a stronger us dollar exchange rate weighed on its attractiveness as a funding currency interest shown by emerging market borrowers in using the euro as a funding currency increased further suggesting that they sought to diversify their currency exposures the volume of euro denominated debt issuance by emerging market residents increased for the third consecutive year in 2018 although it remains considerably lower than the corresponding dollar volumes see the right panel of chart 12 in turn the share of the euro in total international debt issuance of emerging market economies rose from 7 to 9 while that of the us dollar declined from 89 to 84 suggesting that borrowers in emerging market economies sought to diversify their funding base and reduce exposures to us dollar exchange rate movements chart 12 the decline in us dollar denominated international debt issuance in 2018 was largely driven by borrowers in emerging market economies regional breakdown of us dollar denominated left panel and euro denominated right panel international debt issuance usd billions sources dealogic and ecb calculations note the latest data are for the fourth quarter of 2018 euro denominated issuance in 2018 was also supported by the gradual decline in the cost of synthetic us dollar borrowing as measured by the cross currency swap ccs basis a negative ccs basis is equivalent to paying a premium for borrowing us dollars synthetically via another funding currency such as the euro the ccs basis across different maturities continued to contract in 2018 for instance at the ten year maturity the basis declined from about 40 to about 20 basis points see chart 13 at the one year maturity it narrowed from about 40 to about 10 basis points chart 13 the cross currency swap basis of the euro decreased in 2018 which lowered the cost of using the euro as a funding currency cross currency swap basis against the us dollar at the ten year maturity basis points sources bloomberg and ecb calculations note the latest observation is for 25 april 2019 however the share of the euro in stocks of international debt remains limited outside developed european countries aside from developed europe and canada the share of the euro in outstanding amounts of international debt remains below 16 see chart 14 and table a6 the dominance of the us dollar in global debt markets is most pronounced in the middle east and in offshore financial centres where its share is typically close to 90 in line with the us dollar s pre eminence as an invoicing currency of energy products see box 3 and in global financial transactions chart 14 use of the euro as a financing currency remains limited outside europe currency composition of outstanding international bonds and notes in selected regions percentages sources bis and ecb calculations notes narrow measure the data are for the fourth quarter of 2018 non eu developed europe refers to iceland norway switzerland and european microstates foreign currency debt issuance remains dominated by the private sector as in previous years financial institutions were the most active issuers of euro denominated and us dollar denominated international bonds accounting for about two thirds of total issuance for each see chart 15 sovereigns accounted for around 10 of total international issuance the relative importance of private versus public issuers has been remarkably stable over the past two decades since 1999 the private sector has accounted for around 90 of international bond issuance both in the euro and us dollars chart 15 financial institutions remained the main issuers of euro denominated and us dollar denominated international debt in 2018 sector breakdown of euro denominated left panel and us denominated right panel international debt issuance percentages sources dealogic and ecb calculations the euro in international loan and deposit markets the share of the euro in international loan markets continued to rise in 2018 between 2006 and 2014 the share of the euro in international loans declined continuously reflecting among other things deleveraging by euro area banks as well as regulatory efforts to reduce exposures to foreign loans denominated in the euro this trend has halted and partly reversed in the past few years the share of the euro in the stock of international loans stood at 19 3 at the end of the review period an increase of almost 1 percentage point relative to the end of 2017 see chart 16 and table a6 recent evidence suggests that the ecb s unconventional monetary policy measures in particular in the form of credit easing programmes supported cross border lending of euro area banks in response to the ecb s accommodative monetary policy euro area banks operating internationally reallocated funds abroad within their respective banking organisations which suggests that internal capital markets may amplify the strength of outward monetary transmission a greater supply of euro denominated funds outside the euro area also boosted euro lending from banks outside the euro area chart 16 the share of the euro in outstanding international loans increased notably in 2018 currency composition of outstanding amounts of international loans percentages at q4 2018 exchange rates sources bis and ecb calculations note the latest data are for the fourth quarter of 2018 the share of the euro in outstanding international deposits also increased mirroring developments in international loan markets at constant exchange rates the share of the euro in the stock of international deposits increased by 0 5 percentage points relative to the end of 2017 see chart 17 and table a9 that share now stands around 7 percentage points above its trough at the end of 2015 and close to its previous peak of 2005 the share of the us dollar also increased in the review period by almost 1 percentage point relative to 2015 the share of the us dollar is down by about 5 percentage points anecdotal evidence suggests that developments in international deposits in us dollars in the review period reflected concerns about unilateral sanctions among other factors in particular it has been observed that russian banks were faced with the risk of us sanctions banning them from conducting transactions with us legal entities including us banks with correspondent accounts that enable the russian banks to conduct transactions in us dollars anecdotal evidence from press reports suggests for instance that some russian clients shifted assets out of us dollar deposits into deposits in local currency or in foreign currencies other than the us dollar chart 17 the share of the euro in outstanding international deposits increased in 2018 currency composition of outstanding amounts of international deposits percentages at q4 2018 exchange rates sources bis and ecb calculations note the latest data are for the fourth quarter of 2018 lastly the share of the euro in outstanding loans declined further in central eastern and south eastern europe see table a12 as noted in last year s edition of the report this

decreased moderately in some of these countries see table a13 2 4 use of the euro as an invoicing currency the share of the euro as an invoicing or settlement currency for extra euro area trade in goods remained broadly stable in 2018 over 60 of extra euro area exports and 50 of extra euro area imports of goods were invoiced in euro see the left panel of chart 18 and table a10 patterns were broadly similar for extra euro area trade in services the share of the euro as an invoicing currency has been remarkably stable in the past decade unlike other dimensions of the international use of the euro the share of the euro in the invoicing of euro area international trade transactions in goods has hovered around 50 60 over the past decade however trade invoicing practices vary across euro area trading partners for instance the vast majority of euro area trade with the united states is invoiced and settled in us dollars while the bulk of euro area trade with non euro area eu countries is invoiced in euro see table a11 stability in the relative importance of the euro area s trading partners notwithstanding cyclical and structural developments in global trade may contribute to

specific features of oil as a product influence invoicing currency choice differentiated goods tend to be invoiced in the exporter s currency but more homogeneous goods such as oil are usually priced in a single or dominant currency such as the us dollar however an analysis of post world war ii data suggests that european oil imports were invoiced equally in us dollars and other currencies notably the pound sterling this suggests that even for homogeneous goods such as oil multiple invoicing currencies can coexist most commodities are also upstream i e used as inputs in the production process often firms that use commodities as inputs may want to use the same currency for their exports as for their imports for example the importance of crude oil largely invoiced in dollars as an input to petroleum products may explain why the us dollar also dominates the invoicing of eu imports of petroleum products indeed research suggests that the use of a vehicle currency is more likely for exporters with a higher share of inputs priced in that vehicle currency the limited data available on commodity invoicing currencies confirm a strong role played by the us dollar based on survey data chart a shows that more than 80 of extra eu oil imports are invoiced in dollars firm level data for the united kingdom suggest that almost 90 of mineral fuel imports are invoiced in a vehicle currency similarly data for japan suggest that about 90 of petroleum coal and natural gas imports were invoiced in us dollars in 2015 conducting an empirical evaluation of oil trade currency invoicing for the euro area is difficult as the above mentioned data are only available for a few years nevertheless the pass through of fluctuations in the exchange rate into oil import prices might provide an indirect approximation of the role of the us dollar as a vehicle currency for oil import transactions recent empirical findings do in fact show that for international transactions carried out in a vehicle currency such as the us dollar exchange rate fluctuations against that vehicle currency have much higher pass through into domestic inflation than those affecting transactions priced in the local or producer i e the partner country currency a measure of exchange rate pass through to oil import prices could therefore give some indication of the use of the us dollar as a vehicle currency this can be estimated in the following panel regression d l n p i t m o n c c i α d l n p t b r e n t u s d β d l n e i t u s d ε i t where changes in import prices are regressed on changes in oil prices and the exchange rate the closer the coefficient estimate β is to one the higher the pass through of exchange rate changes against the us dollar to oil import prices this in turn could be an indication of a higher share of us dollar invoicing in oil imports than what would be expected through the import share from the united states as a caveat it could be that prices adjust flexibly for reasons other than invoicing currency moreover borio 2019 suggests that the us dollar tends to weaken vis à vis the euro when commodity prices rise as a result oil price increases in us dollars would not necessarily match those in euro we apply the exchange rate with its lags in the spirit of the gmm methodology to control for possible endogeneity resulting from this relationship between the oil price and the us dollar exchange rate the empirical analysis points to the dominance of the us dollar as an invoicing currency for global oil trade transactions the results show that pass through is almost complete with a coefficient of 0 93 for the full sample see table a as regards advanced economies the coefficient is almost equal to 1 which could be an indication of almost complete us dollar invoicing of imports similar results hold for the eu and the euro area these estimates differ from the survey results shown in the left panel of chart a above as the latter draw from evidence gained over the period 2010 16 for belgium germany france italy spain and the united kingdom the estimates in contrast are for the period 1983 2018 and for a larger sample of countries than that covered in the survey some of which most likely use the us dollar as a vehicle currency to a greater extent for example australia or canada for emerging market economies the coefficient is statistically smaller than one still it has to be borne in mind that other factors can influence the pass through of the us dollar so that the estimation results provide only some tentative indication that the us dollar is indeed a vehicle currency for most oil imports table a regression results robust standard errors in parentheses p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 1 box 4 advances in market infrastructures and implications for the international use of the euro prepared by monika hempel the eurosystem promotes the safe and efficient functioning of the euro payment infrastructure this task is closely interlinked with its responsibilities in the field of monetary policy all actions taken by the eurosystem in this field also indirectly support the international standing of the euro by making euro denominated financial markets more efficient and more attractive to foreign investors since the launch of the euro the eurosystem has played a major part in reshaping and consolidating the infrastructure for large value payments for post trading services for financial instruments and most recently for instant retail payments the goal is to create a truly single financial market in europe where payments securities and collateral can be moved safely and efficiently between participants active in european markets without friction or restrictions the eurosystem s market infrastructure services for the settlement of payments and securities in central bank money include target2 target2 securities t2s and target instant payment settlement tips the so called target services target2 and its predecessor are the longest standing components of the eurosystem s financial market infrastructure target the first generation rtgs system commenced operations just a few days after the launch of the euro in january 1999 in 2008 it was fully replaced by target2 which offers harmonised services on a single technical platform today target2 is one of the largest payment systems in the world processing 90 of the total value settled by large value payment systems in euro t2s the integrated technical platform which processes the real time settlement of securities transactions against central bank money across europe was launched in 2015 full migration took place in waves over the following two years to ensure a smooth transition t2s provides banks and intermediaries with a single pool of collateral for the entire t2s market comprising 21 central securities depositories from 20 european countries thereby optimising settlement and triparty procedures last but not least in november 2018 the eurosystem delivered tips a market infrastructure for instant payments with settlement in central bank money tips enables payment service providers to offer fund transfers to their customers in less than ten seconds throughout the day every day of the year the upcoming technical and functional convergence of target2 and t2s will further optimise liquidity management and generate new cost efficiencies the consolidation project which will run until 2021 will introduce a central liquidity management system that will allow participants to monitor and manage their liquidity for all target services it will enable centralised management and control over the payment capacity with a clear allocation of liquidity for the different settlement purposes this will make the use of central bank money even more efficient for market participants and in turn benefit the financial market and its domestic and foreign participants in contrast to the major steps taken to overcome the fragmentation in the european payments market and in the securities trade and post trade area there is still room for progress at the front end of the securities process chain the issuance and distribution of securities still hinges on fragmented legacy standards structural constraints and complex market practices at the national level facilitating interactions and procedures between some participants still entails high costs and risks european issuers and eu institutions in particular need to be able to collect funds from investors across the continent in a fair and well defined manner reflection on pan european issuance would be in line with the endeavour to deepen the single capital market in the eu finally whilst noting the progress achieved in better integrating the retail payments market through the sepa project recent global trends in this field call for capitalizing on european strengths and develop a european strategy for retail payments taking into account the instant payment infrastructure tips and instrument sepa instant credit transfer in summary through its provision of safe and efficient market infrastructure services the eurosystem plays an integral role in strengthening the international role of the euro the full deployment of tips and the consolidation of target2 and t2s will underpin the progress in the rtgs and retail payments market simultaneously discussions on how best to remove the remaining barriers and obstacles that still exist in some segments of the securities market are under way 2 5 use of euro cash outside the euro area shipments of euro banknotes to

bosnia and herzegovina bulgaria hungary poland and romania was 13 of respondents the recent rebound of euro cash holdings in several cesee countries that can be noted in chart a may have been driven by rising incomes or a greater prevalence of remittances individuals in the region hold euro cash for a variety of reasons one main motive cited by respondents in most countries is that they hold euro cash as a general reserve scheiber and stern 2016 stix 2013 observed that a substantial share of people in cesee countries have a preference for cash over interest bearing assets a phenomenon that is mainly related to lack of trust in the local currency and banks besides being used for saving purposes euro cash is also used for domestic payments for example real estate and cars are frequently paid for in euro in a number of south eastern european see countries scheiber and stern 2016 by contrast respondents in hungary poland and particularly the czech republic reported that they plan to spend their euro cash mainly abroad this regional pattern of motives for holding euro cash correlates with self reported euro cash amounts which tend to be relatively high in countries where the saving purpose dominates one indication of the motives for holding euro area cash is through a currency substitution index csi see the right panel of chart a the measure is derived from the oenb euro survey

year marks the 20th anniversary of the creation of the euro and of the adoption of the eurosystem s position on its international role it is therefore an appropriate time to take stock of developments in the use of the euro as a global currency and to assess whether and how the economic benefits and costs of the international use of the euro have evolved this assessment takes place amid renewed calls among european policymakers to promote a stronger international role for the currency in particular the decision was taken at the euro summit of december 2018 to encourage work to be taken forward to this end this special feature assesses changes in the economic benefits and costs arising from the international role of the euro from a central banking perspective it provides evidence that the balance of benefits and costs has evolved since 1999 with some of the traditional effects of its status as an international currency having declined in relevance while others have become more apparent taking stock of the ecb s position on the international role of the euro twenty years on since the launch of economic and monetary union the eurosystem has advocated a policy of neutrality vis à vis the international role of the euro this was stressed in the first speech of president duisenberg in january 1999 and in a monthly bulletin article published in august 1999 which stated that currency status is market driven and that the eurosystem neither hinders nor fosters the internationalisation of the euro this position was the outcome of two views one emphasising the economic benefits of international currency status and the other emphasising the costs back in 1999 the main benefits of currency internationalisation discussed included seigniorage lower transaction and hedging costs added breadth and efficiency to the euro area financial markets as well as the exorbitant privilege the fact that international currency issuers have lower external financing costs in particular research suggests that the net return earned by the united states on its net international investment position due to the us dollar s role as the leading international currency is approximately 1 3 per year the main costs stressed were volatility in money aggregates and in turn in capital flows which it was believed could complicate the conduct of monetary policy see table 1 table 1 benefits and costs of international currency use assessment in 1999 source ecb 1999 op cit twenty years on the balance of benefits and costs of international currency status has evolved with rapid financial globalisation rising challenges to multilateralism and the adoption of new monetary policy frameworks across major central banks the relevance of some of the traditional effects of international currency status has declined while other effects have become more apparent these developments which may have a bearing on the conduct and transmission of monetary policy need to be considered when assessing the balance of economic benefits and costs from a central bank perspective specifically research has highlighted the following factors first that international currency status may strengthen the global transmission of domestic monetary policy impulses with potential reinforcing spillback effects for the domestic economy see table 2 and second that it lowers exchange rate pass through which helps shield inflation from foreign shocks while it may at times attenuate the effects of monetary policy on import prices and third that the exorbitant duty of international currency status the fact that international currencies appreciate in times of global stress and that their central banks of issue are called upon to assume greater responsibility for global financial stability is the flipside of the traditional exorbitant privilege i e of lower external financing costs finally it can be argued that the traditional argument against a stronger international role of currencies i e that it increases the volatility of monetary aggregates has declined in prominence the following section reviews these arguments in greater detail table 2 the balance of the benefits and costs of international currency use is changing sources ecb and coeuré b the euro s global role in a changing world a monetary policy perspective speech at the council on foreign relations new york city 15 february 2019 salient developments in principle international currency issuers enjoy greater monetary autonomy owing to the pre eminence of the us dollar in the global monetary and financial system us monetary policy drives along with global risk appetite global financial cycles in capital flows and financial asset prices see box 6 for evidence in the context of the debate on whether the traditional monetary policy trilemma has morphed into a dilemma by contrast central banks in small open economies are typically more heavily exposed to foreign spillovers in setting interest rates than those presiding over an internationally dominant currency however foreign factors may still at times influence domestic monetary and financial conditions of international currency issuers this is suggested by the past experience of the federal reserve system for instance it is well documented that the large demand for us securities by foreign central banks in the run up to the global financial crisis contributed to the decline in longer term us interest rates thereby partially offsetting the parallel tightening efforts by the federal open market committee see special feature b for further discussion expected benefits of seigniorage still exist but may have declined the low interest rate environment has tended to reduce seigniorage benefits that can be expected from the euro s international role an additional factor to consider is the impact of increased use of electronic means of payments on the demand for banknotes moreover concerns about exposure to capital flow volatility as a consequence of international currency status are now less prominent these concerns featured prominently in discussions about the internationalisation of the deutschmark in the 1970s when it was considered that volatile hot money flows into financial assets denominated in the deutsche mark increased volatility in m3 the main monetary aggregate monitored by the bundesbank thereby complicating the conduct of monetary policy the enhanced tools for the ecb s monetary analysis have made these concerns less prominent moreover in a financial globalised economy the influence of foreign factors on local monetary and financial conditions is not a feature specific to international currency issuers but a feature of any financially open economy an additional aspect on which more evidence is now available is that international currency status strengthens the global transmission of monetary policy this reflects the fact that stronger use of a currency as an international funding unit amplifies the international transmission of monetary policy this channel is well documented for the us dollar and us monetary policy when us monetary policy eases the us dollar depreciates international lending in dollars grows because the balance sheets of borrowers in emerging market economies who often borrow in dollars appear stronger in us dollar terms this in turn encourages global banks to provide the borrowers in question with us dollar denominated credit see the left panel of chart 22 another channel for greater international transmission of liquidity shocks may reflect the role of international credit markets within global banking groups global banks respond to domestic monetary shocks by managing liquidity globally through an internal reallocation of funds which affects their foreign lending monetary policy impulses may reverberate globally as a consequence with wider and possibly larger domestic effects owing to spillbacks for instance for an issuer of an international currency a domestic interest rate cut would ease financial conditions globally and feed demand across the world the domestic economy could benefit from spillback effects especially in an economy like the euro area which is more open to trade than other major economies chart 22 the balance of the benefits and costs of international currency use is changing evidence of

line is a fitted regression line on the other hand the exorbitant duty arising from international currency status has become more apparent since the global financial crisis as the flipside of the traditional exorbitant privilege because debt securities denominated in us dollars are seen as particularly safe and liquid by international investors the us dollar tends to be seen as a safe haven in times of heightened global financial stress in turn the us dollar appreciates in episodes of global stress as it did immediately after the collapse of lehman brothers in autumn 2008 this led to a decline in the us net international investment position and to large negative external wealth effects for the united states another consideration is that reserve currency issuers may face requests for currency swap lines when availability of international liquidity dries up this is suggested by the experience during the global financial crisis when major central banks were more active in providing swap lines the provision of currency swap lines has been carried out by all major central banks issuing international currencies in full independence and in line with their respective mandates standing swap networks now exist the global network of currency swap lines has expanded in the past decade driven also by china s policies to support the renminbi see box 7 for a review of the debate on the link between currency swap lines and international currency status finally it is now also more apparent that international currencies have lower exchange rate pass through the more the domestic currency is used for invoicing international trade transactions the lower the pass through to import prices from exchange rate movements this holds not only over the short run when prices are sticky but also over the long run when they are adjusted by producers the close correlation between domestic currency invoicing and exchange rate pass through is noticeable in the euro area see the right panel of chart 22 lower pass through has two main implications for the conduct and transmission of monetary policy first the effect of domestic monetary policy on import prices is more limited when pass through is low if more trade were invoiced in euro for instance import prices would react less to an exchange rate depreciation resulting from an accommodative domestic monetary policy shock as simulations from calibrated general equilibrium models suggest at the same time interest rate changes have larger spillovers and spillbacks in other words the relative importance and interaction of the interest rate and exchange rate channels of monetary policy change second lower pass through shields the consumer price index cpi from foreign disturbances affecting the exchange rate in a low pass through environment import prices and hence inflation as well as inflation expectations are better shielded from foreign exchange shocks conclusions the balance of economic benefits and costs arising from the international role of the euro has evolved since 1999 the relevance of some of the traditional effects of international currency status has declined while other effects have become more apparent changes in the global role of the euro would have consequences for the conduct of monetary policy all of which need to be understood and taken into account when designing the common monetary policy for the euro area box 6 new evidence on international currencies and the monetary policy trilemma prepared by georgios georgiadis the trilemma or impossible trinity is a cornerstone of international macroeconomics under the trilemma policymakers can have at most two of the following three a fixed exchange rate free movement of capital and an independent monetary policy the trilemma is a theoretical hypothesis that rests on the possibility of arbitrage under uncovered interest rate parity a large body of research in international macroeconomics and finance has tested the empirical validity of the trilemma traditionally the literature has confirmed its predictions which suggests that it is an empirically valid description of the trade offs faced by policymakers recent research carried out by ecb staff analysing a sample of 47 advanced and emerging market economies over the period 2002 2018 confirms these findings in general specifically the analysis is based on the estimation of taylor rules and explores whether changes to policy interest rates in so called centre countries i e the united states and euro area countries have an impact on local policy rates after controlling for fundamentals including real time forecasts of local inflation and gdp growth as well as commodity prices and global risk appetite the findings suggest that the sensitivity of local to centre country policy rates over and above what can be explained by local fundamentals is dampened by both exchange rate flexibility and obstacles to capital flows see the left panel of chart a chart a new evidence regarding the debate on the monetary policy trilemma versus the monetary policy dilemma sensitivity of the local to centre country policy rate across policy configurations left panel and sensitivity of the local to centre country policy rate among economies with flexible exchange rates right panel percentages source georgiadis g and zhu f 2019 op cit notes the bars show the coefficient estimate of the centre country policy rate see georgiadis g and zhu f 2019 op cit for details on the definition of the policy configurations and net foreign currency exposures one particular mechanism through which the dominant role of the us dollar and potentially the euro in the case of european economies could have an impact on the empirical validity of the trilemma comes from the implications of foreign currency exposures on economies external balance sheets for domestic financial stability in an economy with a flexible exchange rate regime in such an environment when the local currency appreciates in response to an easing of monetary policy in the centre economy those local borrowers that have balance sheets with net short foreign currency mismatches as a result of cross border borrowing benefit from lower perceived credit risk and increased perceived borrowing capacity ultimately this sets in motion a feedback loop in which accommodative centre country financial conditions are transmitted to local financial conditions in turn when the local currency depreciates in response to a tightening of monetary policy in the centre economy the feedback loop reverses and local financial conditions tighten with potential adverse implications for local financial stability thus instead of insulating local financial conditions from base country monetary policy the combination of flexible exchange rates and foreign currency exposures may in fact amplify spillovers from centre country monetary policy to the extent that these spillovers lead to a build up of vulnerabilities that put at risk financial stability when global liquidity conditions become more restrictive a local monetary policy response aimed at reducing exchange rate variations to mitigate unwelcome effects arising from this financial channel may be optimal in other words it may be optimal for local monetary policy to shadow centre country monetary policy regardless of the stage of the domestic business cycle even for those economies for which a flexible exchange rate regime in principle confers monetary policy autonomy recent research analysing the sensitivity of local to centre country policy rates in economies with flexible exchange rates and across different degrees of foreign currency exposure finds evidence to support this hypothesis in particular changes in centre country policy rates have a stronger impact on local monetary policy in economies with large foreign currency exposures on their external balance sheets see the right panel of chart a in line with the mechanisms discussed in recent literature further analysis suggests that the reaction of local monetary policy is particularly strong when the local economy has foreign currency liabilities that are larger than foreign currency assets when foreign currency exposures stem from portfolio debt and other investment items the reaction is also particularly strong when monetary policy in the centre country tightens suggesting that concerns about the financial stability implications motivate local monetary policies overall these findings are consistent with the view that in the presence of foreign currency exposures it may be optimal for local monetary policy not to exploit the policy space afforded by exchange rate flexibility but instead to stabilise the exchange rate by shadowing changes in centre country monetary policy rates such developments would be observationally equivalent to those in which the trilemma had morphed into a dilemma although flexible exchange rates continue to confer monetary autonomy in the absence of large net foreign currency exposures box 7 currency swap lines and international currency status prepared by livia chiţu international currency status is often bestowed with an exorbitant privilege and lower external financing costs yet another aspect of international currency status is that it may also come with an exorbitant duty and additional responsibilities in particular central banks issuing international currencies might be faced with requests for currency swap lines from other central banks when the availability of international liquidity dries up as the experience from the global financial crisis suggests however providing such currency swap lines is not a duty for central banks issuing international currencies but remains an option which they consider in full independence and in line with their respective domestic mandates the direction of causality between currency swap lines and international currency usage is unclear on the one hand some empirical studies show that international currency use helps predict whether countries received swap lines from either the federal reserve system or the ecb for instance it has been shown that the federal reserve was more likely to extend swap lines to countries with large us dollar liquidity shortages large international financial centres and emerging market countries with which us banks had large exposures on the other hand there is also evidence albeit limited that causality could flow in the other direction i e that currency swap lines might foster international currency use some studies show that swap lines encouraged inflows from recipient countries banks into assets denominated in the source country s currency moreover gopinath and stein 2018a and b show that in theory there are feedback loops between bank funding and trade invoicing as well as between bank funding and foreign exchange reserves this suggests that at least conceptually providing currency swap lines might help to foster the international use of a currency since they can be seen as a backstop for bank funding denominated in the international currency other studies however provide empirical evidence that negative policy interventions designed to discourage international use of a currency have actually been more effective than positive interventions to encourage its use suggesting therefore that actively promoting the global use of a currency with currency swap lines may not be effective historically swap lines were provided for three main purposes first for the purposes of foreign exchange policy for instance as early as 1962 the federal reserve established reciprocal currency arrangements to forestall potential official runs on the us gold stock by third countries second for trade policy purposes swap lines have been granted by reserve currency issuers to facilitate cross border trade transactions with other countries for instance this was initially one motivation for the people s bank of china to develop its currency swap network a third purpose is to offer liquidity support on third markets in the presence of serious market dysfunctions this latter purpose was particularly evident during the global financial crisis when there was a build up in risky short term funding in us dollars among european banks preceding the swap lines that were ultimately provided during the crisis to address pressures in global money markets the federal reserve together with other major central banks i e the bank of canada the bank of england the bank of japan the ecb and the swiss national bank established currency swap lines which were converted to standing arrangements in october 2013 moreover at the height of the financial crisis the federal reserve provided temporary swap lines to four emerging market economies in asia and latin america the ecb has participated in the network of currency swap lines among major central banks since the onset of the global financial crisis and similarly to the federal reserve established currency swap lines with additional economies albeit with a different regional focus centred on the euro area neighbourhood the left panel of chart a shows that the share of the us dollar in international debt securities continued to increase after the conversion of dollar swap lines to standing arrangements in 2013 however it is unclear whether this means that the swap lines in question bolstered the role of the us dollar as an international financing currency as their effect could have been confounded by other factors chart a evidence on the link between currency swap lines and international currency status federal reserve currency swap lines and international role of the us dollar left

calculations bis federal reserve system and people s bank of china note us dollar shares in international debt statistics narrow measure at constant exchange rates the pboc for its part had concluded 37 swap line agreements by the end of 2017 with various countries it has repeatedly stated that these agreements aim to foster use of the renminbi in the medium term e g because regulators in recipient countries might be more inclined to allow banks and firms to carry out business denominated in renminbi or because recipient central banks might more easily act as lenders of last resort in renminbi after activation of the currency swap lines the right panel of chart a which plots the share of the renminbi in international debt and the size of the people s bank of china s swap lines suggests however that these efforts have still not led to a material increase in the international use of the renminbi in international debt markets see box 1 for further evidence on the global role of the renminbi box 8 overview of the communication on the international role of the euro issued by the european commission on 5 december 2018 prepared by arnaud mehl on 5 december 2018 the european commission issued a communication outlining initiatives to strengthen the international role of the euro this communication followed up on president juncker s state of the union address on 12 september 2018 and was tabled as a contribution to the euro summit on 14 december 2018 it makes proposals in four areas the first area focuses on completing economic and monetary union and banking union as well as furthering the capital markets union the communication mentions initiatives adopted by euro area leaders at the euro summit of 14 december 2018 such as the common backstop to the single resolution fund or reform of the esm treaty as well as other proposals such as those for a european deposit insurance scheme for euro area bank deposits sovereign bond backed securities or euro area external representation it highlights the importance of respecting eu governance rules and sound policies the second area concerns measures to make the european financial sector more stable deeper and more autonomous the communication proposes widening the use of the euro by strengthening the liquidity and resilience of european market infrastructures for instance it refers to the option of widening the scope of clearing obligations and further incentivising the use of central clearing subject to the relevant legislative process it also mentions initiatives involving the eurosystem such as the reform of euro area interest rate benchmarks or initiatives in market and payment infrastructures such as instant payment systems solutions the commission launched a public consultation to assess whether frictions affecting euro liquidity in the foreign exchange market exist the third area focuses on initiatives targeting the international financial sector one proposal is to promote the use of the euro in payments and as a reserve currency internationally and to provide technical assistance to third countries to use euro payment systems another is to encourage european institutions such as the european stability mechanism and the european investment bank to increase their share of euro denominated debt the fourth area comprises a series of targeted consultations to explore whether the international role of the euro in specific areas can be strengthened including oil refined products and gas raw materials and food commodities and transport sector manufacturers aircraft maritime and railways the commission will report on the insights gained from these consultations by summer 2019 table a evidence on the link between currency swap lines and international currency status sources ecb like the commission the eurosystem stresses that the international role of the euro is primarily supported by a deeper and more complete emu including advancing the capital markets union in the context of the pursuit of sound economic policies in the euro area sound economic policies directly affect the economic and financial stability of the euro area and thus the global standing of its currency efforts to complete the measures on the agenda for deepening economic and monetary union would enhance the euro area s resilience deeper and better connected euro area capital markets through further development of the capital markets union would contribute to greater euro area financial integration and deeper and more liquid euro area financial markets the eurosystem supports these policies and emphasises the need for further efforts to complete economic and monetary union without prejudice to the ecb s independence the eurosystem is also aware of the european commission s support for its initiatives on market infrastructure and payments which help increase efficiency and bring greater financial market integration in the euro area these efforts may also have the knock on effect of strengthening the international role of the euro table a provides an overview of the most important determinants of the international role of the euro and recalls the key policy levers which exist to influence them quantifying the exorbitant privilege potential benefits from a stronger international role of the euro by johannes gräb thomas kostka and dominic quint a much discussed benefit of international currency status is the exorbitant privilege demand by official investors for safe and liquid foreign currency assets to acquire and hold foreign exchange reserves reduces the financing costs of governments in reserve currency countries while there is broad consensus that the united states enjoys such an exorbitant privilege as yet there is limited evidence as to how this compares to other major issuers of international currencies this second special feature aims to fill this gap focusing on foreign exchange reserve holdings in euro and their effect on euro area sovereign financing costs this special feature aims to quantify the exorbitant privilege of international currency status for major currencies it explains that the relevant metric for this purpose is the share of foreign official holdings in the stock of outstanding highly rated debt a metric for which the euro is at par with the us dollar estimates from a simple error correction model that aims to disentangle long run stock effects from short run flow effects of net purchases of sovereign debt by foreign official reserve holders suggest that the exorbitant privilege enjoyed by some highly rated euro area sovereigns is economically significant foreign official reserve holdings of highly rated debt securities have compressed term premia on euro area long term yields by around 110 basis points which compares to around 160 basis points for the united states but foreign official holdings of euro area government debt are concentrated in a few euro area sovereigns issuing highly rated debt securities strengthening the credit quality of outstanding debt notably by pursuing sound and sustainable fiscal policies would contribute to increasing the supply of safe euro area debt and raising the euro s global appeal this in turn would help the euro s exorbitant privilege to be more widely shared across euro area sovereigns the exorbitant privilege and sovereign financing costs it is often argued that countries issuing an international reserve currency enjoy an exorbitant privilege akin to lower financing costs the term exorbitant privilege was originally coined by french finance minister valéry giscard d estaing in the 1960s to emphasise the unique role of the us dollar in the bretton woods system which allegedly allowed the united states to lower external financing costs since us debt provides international official investors with insurance against volatile capital flows and exchange rate risk today it has acquired a broader meaning referring to benefits enjoyed by countries in the form of either external borrowing costs or net returns on their international investment position measured by the return on net foreign assets the united states has clearly enjoyed such a privilege over the past decades for other major issuers of international currencies the evidence is mixed and depends on the period considered however under this broader definition the term might confound different effects such as international profit shifting of multinational firms which is not related to international currency status this special feature therefore focuses on the original definition of the exorbitant privilege namely the ability of sovereigns to issue debt internationally at lower interest rates such an exorbitant privilege in terms of lower external financing costs is often attributed to the us dollar given the currency s dominant role in global official holdings of foreign exchange reserves see chart 23 not only do official investors own a large share of outstanding amounts of us treasury bonds but their demand for them displays relatively low price elasticity whatever the price or inversely the yield of the bonds in question demand remains largely stable therefore foreign reserves accumulation should contribute to compress yields by creating excess demand for these securities this relationship appeared to be particularly strong in the mid 2000s when the united states experienced strong capital inflows during that period emerging market economies notably china and oil exporters built up large holdings of foreign exchange reserves mainly in the form of us treasuries this phenomenon also known as the global savings glut was held responsible for compressing us treasury yields and keeping them from responding to the tighter monetary policy of the federal reserve system after 2004 in investigating the effects of inflows from foreign official investors several empirical studies suggest that usd 100 billion worth of foreign investor purchases of us treasuries compressed 10 year yields by around 50 basis points the effect of sovereign debt purchases by foreign official investors on yields largely depends on the stock of debt purchased with central banks implementing large asset purchase programmes after the global financial crisis a number of studies have aimed to quantify the transmission effects of central bank bond purchases on yields according to these studies stock effects are more important than flow effects the latter are defined as the response of yields to ongoing purchases whereas the former describes persistent changes in yields resulting from movements along the demand curve of the asset stock effects thus occur by reducing the free float of assets i e the

should consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of a fund before investing prospectuses for the funds contain this and other important information and are available free of charge by calling toll free at 1 800 621 1675 or visiting www ftportfolios com a prospectus should be read carefully before investing past performance is no assurance of future results investment return and market value of an investment in a fund will fluctuate shares when sold may be worth more or less than their original cost principal risk factors a fund s shares will change in value and you could lose money by investing in a fund an investment in a fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that a fund s investment objectives will be achieved an investment in a fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any portfolio of equity securities traded on exchanges the risks of investing in each fund are spelled out in its prospectus shareholder report and other regulatory filings an index etf seeks investment results that correspond generally to the price and yield of an index you should anticipate that the value of an index fund s shares will decline more or less in correlation with any decline in the value of the index an index fund s return may not match the return of the index unlike a fund the indices do not actually hold a portfolio of securities and therefore do not incur the expenses incurred by a fund investors buying or selling fund shares on the secondary market may incur customary brokerage commissions investors who sell fund shares may receive less than the share s net asset value shares may be sold throughout the day on the exchange through any brokerage account however unlike mutual funds shares may only be redeemed directly from a fund by authorized participants in very large creation redemption units if a fund s authorized participants are unable to proceed with creation redemption orders and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem fund shares may trade at a discount to a fund s net asset value and possibly face delisting one of the principal risks of investing in a fund is market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by a fund fund shares or securities in general may fall in value an actively managed etf is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing such a fund s investment portfolio the portfolio managers management teams advisor or sub advisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result a fund that is concentrated in securities of companies in a certain sector or industry involves additional risks including limited diversification an investment in a fund concentrated in a single country or region may be subject to greater risks of adverse events and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically certain funds may invest in small capitalization and mid capitalization companies such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities in any fund will declare dividends in the future or that if declared they will either remain at current levels or increase over time an investment in a fund containing securities of non u s issuers is subject to additional risks including currency fluctuations political risks withholding the lack of adequate financial information and exchange control restrictions impacting non u s issuers these risks may be heightened for securities of companies located in or with significant operations in emerging market countries a fund may invest in depositary receipts which may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market investments in sovereign bonds involve special risks because the governmental authority that controls the repayment of the debt may be unwilling or unable to repay the principal and or interest when due in times of economic uncertainty the prices of these securities may be more volatile than those of corporate debt obligations or of other government debt obligations a fund that invests in the european region is subject to certain risks because member states in the european union no longer control their own monetary policies money supply and official interest rates for the euro rather such control is exercised by the european central bank the swiss economy is dependent on the economies of other european nations as key trading partners any reduction in spending by other european countries could have a negative effect on the swiss economy the european sovereign debt crisis has resulted in a weakened euro and has put into question the future financial prospects of the surrounding region the ongoing implementation of the european union provisions and euro conversion process may materially impact revenues expenses or income and increase competition for other european companies which could have an effect on the swiss economy certain securities held by certain of the funds are subject to credit risk call risk income risk inflation risk interest rate risk prepayment risk and zero coupon risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend interest and or principal payments when due and that the value of a security may decline as a result credit risk is heightened for floating rate loans and high yield securities call risk is the risk that if an issuer calls higher yielding debt instruments held by a fund performance could be adversely impacted income risk is the risk that income from a fund s fixed income investments could decline during periods of falling interest rates inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money interest rate risk is the risk that the value of the fixed income securities in a fund will decline because of rising market interest rates prepayment risk is the risk that during periods of falling interest rates an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation earlier than expected this may result in a decline in a fund s income zero coupon risk is the risk that zero coupon bonds may be highly volatile as interest rates rise or fall senior floating rate loans are usually rated below investment grade but may also be unrated as a result the risks associated with these loans are similar to the risks of high yield fixed income instruments high yield securities or junk bonds are subject to greater market fluctuations and risk of loss than securities with higher ratings and therefore may be highly speculative these securities are issued by companies that may have limited operating history narrowly focused operations and or other impediments to the timely payment of periodic interest and principal at maturity the market for high yield securities is smaller and less liquid than that for investment grade securities income from municipal bonds held by a fund could be declared taxable because of among other things unfavorable changes in tax laws adverse interpretations by the internal revenue service or state tax authorities or noncompliant conduct of a bond issuer income from municipal bonds held by a fund may be subject to the federal alternative minimum income tax convertible securities have characteristics of both equity and debt securities and as a result are exposed to certain additional risks the values of certain synthetic convertible securities will respond differently to market fluctuations than a traditional convertible security because such synthetic convertibles are composed of two or more separate securities or instruments each with its own market value a fund is subject to the credit risk associated with the counterparty creating the synthetic convertible instrument synthetic convertible securities may also be subject to the risks associated with derivatives exchange traded notes etns are senior unsecured unsubordinated debt securities whose returns are linked to the performance of a particular market benchmark or strategy minus applicable fees the value of an etn may be influenced by various factors real estate investment trusts reits and real estate operating companies reocs are subject to certain risks including changes in the real estate market vacancy rates and competition volatile interest rates and economic recession master limited partnerships mlps are subject to certain risks including price and supply fluctuations caused by international politics energy conservation taxes price controls and other regulatory policies of various governments in addition there is the risk that an mlp could be taxed as a corporation resulting in decreased returns from such mlp blockchain technology is an entirely new and relatively untested technology and may never be implemented to a scale that provides identifiable economic benefit to the companies included in a blockchain index blockchain systems could be vulnerable to fraud there is little regulation of blockchain technology and because blockchain technology systems may operate across many national boundaries and regulatory jurisdictions it is possible that it may be subject to widespread and inconsistent regulation the values of the companies included in a blockchain index may not be a reflection of their connection to blockchain technology but may be based on other business operations currently blockchain technology is primarily used for the recording of transactions in digital currency which are extremely speculative unregulated and volatile because digital assets registered in a blockchain do not have a standardized exchange like a stock market there is less liquidity for such assets and greater possibility of fraud or manipulation a fund may invest in robotics and artificial intelligence companies which may have limited product lines markets financial resources or personnel and are subject to the risks of changes in business cycles world economic growth technological progress and government regulation these companies are also heavily dependent on intellectual property rights and challenges to or misappropriation of such rights could have a material adverse effect on such companies securities of robotics and artificial intelligence companies tend to be more volatile than securities of companies that rely less heavily on technology robotics and artificial intelligence companies typically engage in significant amounts of spending on research and development and rapid changes to the field could have a material adverse effect on a company s operating results the use of futures options and other derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives these risks are heightened when a fund s portfolio managers use derivatives to enhance a fund s return or as a substitute for a position or security rather than solely to hedge or offset the risk of a position or security held by a fund the stocks of companies that have recently conducted an initial public offering have exhibited above average price appreciation in connection with the initial public offering prior to inclusion in a fund which may not continue and these investments may be subject to additional risks price volatility and speculative trading a fund may effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than in kind securities as a result an investment in a fund may be less tax efficient than an investment in an exchange traded fund that effects its creations and redemptions for in kind securities a fund s investment in repurchase agreements may be subject to market and credit risk with respect to the collateral securing the repurchase agreements alternative investments may employ complex strategies have unique investment and risk characteristics and may not be suitable for all investors certain funds may invest in other investment companies including closed end funds cefs etfs and affiliated etfs which involves additional expenses that would not be present in a direct investment in the underlying funds in addition a fund s investment performance and risks may be related to the investment and performance of the underlying funds a fund may invest in u s government obligations u s treasury obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and u s government sponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government short selling creates special risks which could result in increased volatility of returns in times of unusual or adverse market economic regulatory or political conditions a fund may not be able fully or partially to implement its short selling strategy certain funds may invest in distressed securities and many distressed securities are illiquid or trade in low volumes and thus may be more difficult to value illiquid securities involve the risk that the securities will not be able to be sold at the time desired by the fund or at prices approximately the value at which the fund is carrying the securities on its books because the shares of cefs cannot be redeemed upon demand shares of many cefs will trade on exchanges at market prices rather than net asset value which may cause the shares to trade at a price greater than the net asset value nav premium or less than nav discount there can be no assurance that the market discount on shares of any cef purchased by a fund will ever decrease or that when a fund seeks to sell shares of a cef it can receive the nav for those shares a fund may also be exposed to higher volatility in the market due to indirect use of leverage through its investment in cefs cefs may issue senior securities in an attempt to enhance returns certain funds have fewer assets than larger more established funds and like other relatively new funds large inflows and outflows may impact such funds market exposure for limited periods of time alphadex is a registered trademark of first trust portfolios l p first trust

editors note this week we re running a mini series on argentina s current financial crisis with an election coming up it s an important moment to reflect on the failures of president mauricio macri s promises to restore the country s economy part 1 covers the specifics of argentina s macroeconomic policies and why a renewed alliance with the imf will only exacerbate austerity policies at the expense of the working class part 2 covers president macri s stunted efforts to bring fracking to argentina will argentina continue down this path or will the people seek out an alternative here s part 1 three and a half years after mauricio macri came to power in argentina in december 2015 on the promise of fixing the country s economy it has instead fallen into a deep recession in response the government has turned to the international monetary fund imf for help with memories of the last imf bailout still fresh in the minds of argentinians today what little credit existed in macri s early days has dried up and sky high interest rates are encouraging financial speculation over productive investment unemployment and poverty rates have risen sharply as have the number of people with basic needs unmet plunging economic activity has negatively affected fiscal revenue so meeting the zero deficit target requires new spending cuts to top it all off inflation has risen reaching almost 50 percent in 2018 economic growth and development are terms that have been virtually erased from official public discourse and policy objectives this panorama lies in stark contrast to macri s campaign promises which included reducing inflation to a single digit and a downpour of investments that would arrive from abroad when investors saw how business friendly the new government was this in turn would lead to greater stability economic growth and more jobs and all would be well again he claimed macri s election followed 12 years of center left rule under peronists néstor kirchner 2003 2007 and cristina fernández de kirchner often known as cfk 2007 2015 in the first years under the kirchners argentina s economy had improved steadily the first two kirchner administrations were marked by a strong economic recovery from the 1998 2002 recession and massive 2001 2002 crisis with high rates of economic growth sharp reductions in poverty and unemployment and a substantial upturn in real wages and consumption this resulted from a heterodox economic policy framework aimed at developing the domestic market using expansionary monetary and fiscal policy and a managed exchange rate that favored domestic consumption and production yet during cfk s second term however problems began to crop up first international commodity prices began to decline increasing pressure on argentina s foreign sector accounts in response cfk implemented exchange controls or government imposed limits on foreign currency operations which led to the development of a black market exchange rate where argentines traded pesos with dollars and other currencies as the value of their money depreciated second inconsistencies in the management of monetary and exchange rate policies resulted in inflation and appreciated exchange rates third new york judge griesa s 2012 ruling in favor of hold out vulture funds suing argentina temporarily interrupted debt service payments and access to foreign capital markets prompting fears of a government default the government struggled to respond to challenges requiring policy adjustments until it was too late furthermore sectors of the electorate became discontented with exchange controls and inflation decisively influencing the outcome of the 2015 presidential election big business and especially finance were optimistic in the face of macri s electoral victory bloomberg welcomed macri with a revealing headline wall street is in charge in argentina again they were right from his first day in office macri implemented typical neoliberal trade and finance liberalization policies removing most barriers to the free movement of goods and services and more importantly finance including eliminating exchange controls the government s hope was that by neoliberalizing the economy foreign investment would flow in and thus correct external imbalances for a country experiencing a shortage of foreign exchange this move risked making external imbalances worse the result of these policies was to flood the local market with imported goods killing local jobs and businesses and worsening the trade balance while foreign investments never materialized for the first two years the macri administration issued massive amounts of public debt to service the country s external deficit most of it denominated in foreign currency however by february 2018 foreign capital markets had largely stopped bankrolling argentina setting off a run on the peso resulting in devaluation and a surge in inflation the lack of access to foreign credit meant that argentina was headed for another default or a forced debt restructuring at best enter the imf at that point argentine authorities turned to the imf in desperation it wasn t the first time argentina turned to the imf in 2000 when after three years of recession it was unable to service its massive debt the imf conditioned its loans on fiscal spending cuts accelerating argentina s economic downturn and making the massive december 2001 crisis that followed inevitable not much has changed at the imf in the 18 years since argentina s last experience in mid june 2018 argentina had signed a three year stand by agreement for 50 billion the largest loan in the imf s history with a seriously flawed diagnostic of argentina s problems as a point of departure the conditions attached to the loan were vintage imf fiscal austerity with a zero fiscal deficit target excluding debt service payments a renewed commitment to an inflation targeting monetary policy a floating exchange rate regime and ending central bank financing of the treasury among others however by mid august 2018 after another run on the peso consumed most of the imf s first disbursement of 15 billion argentina s authorities once again turned to the imf to request a larger loan by the end of september the imf had approved a 6 3 billion extension to the original loan with new conditions attached and more importantly a substantially accelerated disbursement schedule 90 percent of the loan would be disbursed before december 2019 with presidential elections in october 2019 many interpreted this move as a clear show of imf support for macri s reelection among the new conditions was a 180 degree change in monetary and exchange rate policies the obvious failure of targeting inflation through a freely floating exchange rate framework led the imf to implement a zero growth target for the monetary base or no inflation a very recessionary tool the argentine central bank increased its nominal interest rate to more than 70 percent in order to withdraw pesos from circulation and meet the target it also implemented a floating exchange rate limited to an inflation adjusted range if the exchange rate moves outside of that range the central bank is allowed to intervene in the foreign exchange market all of this implies that imf lenders see exchange rate stability as key to lowering inflation in argentina what have been the results of argentina s new engagement with the imf in the foreword to the april 2019 world economic outlook report the imf noted that macroeconomic instability in argentina and turkey and numerous other factors have all contributed to a significantly weakened global expansion especially in the second half of 2018 since consumption investment and economic activity dropped significantly and inflation almost doubled since the agreement was signed the imf is implicitly acknowledging that its policy recommendations in argentina have failed and are contributing to the slowdown in global economic growth while the first stand by agreement enabled argentina to avoid a default and foreign creditors to get paid the second agreement incentivized capital flight by providing additional dollars to short term speculators not unlike the capital flight that led up to the 2001 2002 crisis in other words argentina is again at the edge of the abyss facing a potentially explosive economic and social situation just ahead of presidential elections in october what to expect will argentina end up going over the edge or turn around and find its way back to growth and development the answer depends in part on the outcome of the upcoming elections where there will likely be two clear alternatives the first is either macri or another candidate from within his political party macri s support and approval ratings have plunged since mid 2018 as a result many are suggesting that maría eugenia vidal governor of the province of buenos aires should run in his place regardless of who the candidate is the policy program is clear in a recent interview when asked what his economic program would be if reelected macri said he would continue with the same policies but at a faster rate one can expect greater austerity a reprivatization of the social security system labor flexibilization i e further erosion of workers rights and deeper cuts in public sector wages and employment in other words an acceleration of the downward spiral already in place with a major crisis as a likely outcome this would be the over the edge option the alternative is a candidacy centered around former president cfk who announced on may 18 that she would run for the primary elections of the peronist party as a vice presidential candidate to her former chief of staff alberto fernández cfk remains the opposition politician with the most support but while her approval rating has increased in recent months she still faces a considerable portion of the electorate who do not want her back in office while the fernández team has not spelled out an economic plan in detail they have spoken of the need to reactivate economic growth job creation and consumption and to control inflation through a social pact of citizen responsibility should they or a similar candidate win they will almost certainly have to negotiate a private debt restructuring but perhaps the most difficult negotiation will be with the imf since almost the entire loan as it stands must be paid off by the end of 2023 this will most certainly be the trickiest aspect of an opposition victory given how inflexible the imf has proven to be in these kinds of negotiations as imf managing director christine lagarde recently stated it would be foolish on the part of any candidate to turn their back to

home ownership has been called the quintessential american dream yet today less than 65 of american homes are owner occupied and more than 50 of the equity in those homes is owned by the banks compare china where despite facing one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world a whopping 90 of families can afford to own their homes over the last decade american wages have stagnated and u s productivity has consistently been outpaced by china s the u s government has responded by engaging in a trade war and imposing stiff tariffs in order to penalize china for what the white house deems unfair trade practices china s industries are said to be propped up by the state and to have significantly lower labor costs allowing them to dump cheap products on the u s market causing prices to fall and forcing u s companies out of business the message to middle america is that chinese labor costs are low because their workers are being exploited in slave like conditions at poverty level wages but if that s true how is it that the great majority of chinese families own homes according to a march 2016 article in forbes 90 of families in the country own their home giving china one of the highest home ownership rates in the world what s more is that 80 of these homes are owned outright without mortgages or any other liens on top of this north of 20 of urban households own more than one home due to their communist legacy what they get for their money is not actually ownership in perpetuity but a long term leasehold and the quality of the construction may be poor but the question posed here is how can chinese families afford the price tag for these homes in a country where the average income is only one seventh that in the united states the misleading disparity between u s and chinese incomes some commentators explain the phenomenon by pointing to cultural differences the chinese are inveterate savers with household savings rates that are more than double those in the u s and they devote as much as 74 of their money to housing under china s earlier one child policy many families had only one heir who tended to be male and home ownership was a requirement to score a wife families would therefore pool their resources to make sure their sole heir was equipped for the competition homes would be purchased either with large down payments or without financing at all financing through banks at compound interest rates doubles the cost of a typical mortgage so sidestepping the banks cuts the cost of housing in half those factors alone however cannot explain the difference in home ownership rates between the two countries the average middle class u s family could not afford to buy a home outright for their oldest heir even if they did pool their money americans would be savers if they could but they have other bills to pay and therein lies a major difference between chinese and american family wealth in china the cost of living is significantly lower the chinese government subsidizes not only its industries but its families with educational medical and transportation subsidies according to a 2017 hsbc fact sheet 70 of chinese millennials ages 19 to 36 already own their own homes american young people cannot afford to buy homes because they are saddled with student debt a millstone that now averages 37 000 per student and will be carried an average of 20 years before it is paid off a recent survey found that 80 of american workers are living paycheck to paycheck another found that 60 of u s millennials could not come up with 500 to cover their tax bills in china by contrast student debt is virtually nonexistent heavy government subsidies have made higher education cheap enough that students can work their way through college with a part time job health care is also subsidized by the government with a state run health insurance program similar to canada s the program doesn t cover everything but medical costs are still substantially lower than in the u s public transportation too is quite affordable in china and it is fast efficient and ubiquitous the disparity in incomes between american and chinese workers is misleading for other reasons the average income includes the very rich along with the poor in the u s the gap between those two classes is greater than in china the oversize incomes at the top pull the average up even worse however is the disparity in debt levels which pulls disposable income down a survey after the 2008 09 credit crisis found that household debt in the u s was 136 of household income compared with only 17 for the chinese another notable difference is that 70 of chinese family wealth comes not from salaries but from home ownership itself under communism all real property was owned by the state when deng xiaoping opened the market to private ownership families had an opportunity to get a home on reasonable terms and as new homes were built they traded up building the family asset base deng s market liberalization also gave families an income boost by allowing them to become entrepreneurs new family owned businesses sprang up aided by affordable loans cheap credit from state owned banks subsidized state affiliated industries as well quantitative easing with chinese characteristics all this was done with the help of china s federal government which in recent decades has pumped massive amounts of economic stimulus into the economy unlike the u s federal reserve s quantitative easing which went straight into big bank reserve accounts the chinese stimulus has generated new money for productive purposes including local business development and infrastructure sometimes called qualitative easing this quantitative easing with chinese characteristics has meant more jobs more gdp and more money available to spend which in turn improves quality of life the chinese government has done this without amassing a crippling federal debt or triggering runaway inflation in the last 20 years its m2 money supply has grown from just over 10 trillion yuan to 80 trillion yuan 11 6t a nearly 800 increase yet the inflation rate of its consumer price index cpi has remained low in february of this year it was just 1 5 in may it rose to 2 7 due to an outbreak of swine fever which drove pork prices up but this was a response to shortages not to an increase in the money supply radically increasing the money supply has not driven consumer prices up because gdp has increased at an even faster rate supply and demand have risen together keeping consumer prices low real estate prices on the other hand have skyrocketed 325 in the last two decades fueled by a chinese shadow banking system that is largely beyond regulatory control pundits warn that china s housing is in an unsustainable bubble that will pop but the chinese housing market is still more stable than the u s subprime market before 2008 with its no doc no down loans chinese buyers typically put 40 to 50 down on their homes and the demand for houses remains high the central bank is also taking steps to cool the market by targeting credit so that it is steered away from real estate and other existing assets and toward newly produced goods and services that central bank intervention illustrates another difference between chinese style qualitative easing and western style qe the people s bank of china is not trying to improve banking sector liquidity so that banks can make more loans chinese economists say they don t need that form of qe china s banks are already lending and the central bank has plenty of room to manipulate interest rates and control the money supply china s central bank is directing credit into the local economy because it doesn t trust the private financial market to allocate credit where local markets need it true to its name the people s bank of china seems actually to be a people s bank geared to serving the economy and the public rather than just the banks themselves time for more qe in early april president trump said in one of his many criticisms of the u s central bank that he thought the fed should be doing more quantitative easing expanding the money supply rather than quantitative tightening shrinking the money supply commentators were left scratching their heads because the official u s unemployment rate is considered to be low but more qe could be a good idea if it were done as chinese style qualitative easing a form of monetary expansion that would allow congress to relieve medical and educational costs grant cheap credit to states to upgrade their roads and mass transit and support local businesses could go a long way toward making american workers competitive with chinese workers unlike the u s government the chinese government supports its workers and its industries rather than penalizing china for that unfair trade practice perhaps the u s government should try doing the same china s legacy is socialist and after opening to international trade it has continued to serve the collective good particularly of its workers meanwhile the u s model has been regressing into feudalism with workers driven into slave like conditions through debt in the 21st century it is time to upgrade our economic model from one of feudal exploitation to a cooperative democracy that recognizes the needs contributions and inalienable rights of all participants

exposed weaknesses in a number of structured finance products such as collateralised debt obligations structured investment vehicles and certain derivatives and business models that were in essence arbitrage plays heavily dependent on shortterm debt funding to finance portfolios of long dated illiquid investments by way of contrast project finance has proved itself to be an asset class that has demonstrated the intrinsic value of productive tangible assets extensive due diligence strong collateral packages and transparent financial structures that have become increasingly relevant post financial crisis despite the recent market volatility there remains a pressing need throughout the world for large scale investment in infrastructure across a broad spectrum of industries in particular in emerging markets such as africa large scale project finance typically focuses on greenfield projects in sectors ranging from power generation conventional nuclear and renewables to transmission oil and gas petrochemicals infrastructure mining and telecoms global economic growth and demand for energy and commodities is a major driver for capital investment in these sectors and notwithstanding recent market volatility the economies of fastgrowing countries such as brazil india and china have underpinned the upward trend in energy and commodity prices some of the largest projects in the world are currently being developed in emerging markets projects involving capital expenditures of 10 to 30 billion are moving forward in countries such as saudi arabia the united arab emirates and malaysia the increase in global competition for resources has led to a corresponding increase in the size and complexity of infrastructure projects today s governments institutional investors and the private sector are unable to shoulder the burden of financing projects of this scale alone this means that large scale infrastructure projects are now financed using ever more sophisticated and complex financial instruments which are in turn provided by an increasingly diverse pool of public and private finance institutions in recent years project financiers and sponsors have become adept at mobilising these diverse sources of finance and developing innovative structures combining commercial banks capital markets investors export credit agencies ecas multilateral development finance institutions dfis islamic banks loans sourced from government affiliated lending institutions and in recent years debt and equity from infrastructure and private equity funds the latter becoming increasingly important even in emerging markets as a result of this seismic shift in the financial landscape project finance lawyers require a degree of familiarity with a range of financial instruments including commercial bank loans and conventional capital markets instruments domestic government funded loans export credit and multilateral agency loans and guarantees and islamic shari ah compliant financing structures whilst providing desperately needed sources of liquidity this diversity of finance and financing structures combined with the expansion of project finance into new industry sectors and jurisdictions has meant that the accompanying legal issues have become progressively more complex notwithstanding this complexity a combination of proper legal frameworks sound commercial structures and robust collateral packages have helped ensure that these new structures have been welcomed and effectively integrated into the project finance market the financial crisis demonstrated that the key to a successful project financing or indeed financing of any nature is due diligence a full awareness of the risks inherent in a particular project and its host country and who bears which of the many costs involved in financing a project is the first step in identifying mitigants to those risks a project finance lawyer must be fully conversant with evershifting market trends as well as the project company s business because in order to advise their clients on the risks associated with a project they will need to have first considered all aspects of the underlying project only once a comprehensive analysis of the underlying project has been undertaken from the security of its feedstock and fuel supply right through to any potential political regulatory legal and environmental issues will it be possible to identify the material risks to that project s future success having considered the technical political and legal risks of the project a lawyer will then use this expertise to help the parties structure the project and its financing secure consensus as to how those risks should be mitigated and finally accurately reflect the parties agreement in the underlying project agreements and financing documentation before we consider further the all important question of why the world needs project finance lawyers we have set out below some key issues that any participant in a project financing should consider a brief history of project finance although project finance techniques are applied throughout the world today in a wide range of industries project finance can trace its roots back to ancient greece and rome where it was used to finance maritime operations and infrastructure development shipping merchants utilised project financing techniques to dilute the risks inherent in maritime trading as loans would be advanced to a merchant on the basis that the loans would be repaid through the sale of shipped cargo in other words the financing would be repaid by the internally generated cash flows of the project project finance in the civil law jurisdictions of continental europe in the form of public private partnerships can find their origins in the roman concession system project finance in the anglo american world came to prominence in the mid 20th century in the united states where it was used to finance mining and rail companies and evolved into its modern incarnation in the 1980s when it was principally used by commercial banks to finance the construction of natural gas projects and power plants in europe and in north america following the 1978 public utility regulatory policy act project finance techniques developed in the 1980s were subsequently honed in the 1990s in emerging markets such as the middle east latin america and asia in the 1980s and 1990s project financiers and sponsors the term used to describe the ultimate owner of a project company were predominantly based in london new york and tokyo until the financial crisis commercial banks had dominated the project finance lending market however in recent years there has been a dearth of liquidity from such institutions an issue further amplified by the application of the basel iii framework which means that commercial banks now have to assign a higher percentage of their liquidity to back long tenor commercial debt financing as a result many sponsors have had to look elsewhere to find sources of finance and in recent years we have seen many new entrants to the project finance market including commercial banks from asia the middle east and latin america as well as larger roles for ecas and dfis due to funding pressures facing commercial banks eca direct financing has become an increasingly important feature for emerging markets greenfield infrastructure finance finance has also been forthcoming from the islamic finance market and for the largest projects the bond markets a number of the institutions that have stepped in to fill the funding gap left particularly by european banks such as japanese commercial banks appear to have access to relatively deep pools of lower cost dollar funding low exposure to sovereign debt and are aggressively seeking to expand their project finance loan portfolios the involvement of an eca in a project financing can be invaluable not least due to their provision of either or both direct loans and credit protection for the development of projects but also because ecas act as important anchors and facilitators to attract commercial banks to club deals or syndications where banks would otherwise be hesitant to participate due to risk allocation or credit concerns similarly the involvement of a dfi such as the african development bank the asian development bank or the international finance corporation can also be critical in providing a so called halo effect for a project although project finance is often seen as a tool for investment in emerging markets and a means of facilitating the construction of infrastructure in developing countries global concerns relating to climate change have led to increased activity in mature project finance markets such as europe and north america government stimulus programmes in particular targeted efforts to promote investment in renewable energy and other forms of low carbon power have resulted in an increase in project finance activity in jurisdictions such as europe where ambitious renewable energy targets have been set what is project finance defining modern project finance is an increasingly difficult task there is no universally adopted definition as project financing has evolved it has imported techniques and market evolutions from other banking disciplines one example of this can be seen in the increase in the use particularly in natural resource based projects of completion guarantees and other forms of sponsor support which historically has not been a feature of limited or non recourse lending notwithstanding this difficulty definitions of project finance will generally focus on the basic premise that a newly formed often thinly capitalised special purpose vehicle the project company will own an asset which may at that time amount to little more than a collection of licences and contracts granting the project company the right to develop and construct the project and the project company s lenders will finance in part the development and construction of the project on the basis of their evaluation of the projected revenue generating capability of the project there are key characteristics that are common to most project financings the project is developed through a separate and usually single purpose financial and legal entity the debt of the project company is often completely separate at least for balance sheet purposes from the sponsors direct obligations the sponsors seek to maximise the debt to equity leverage of the project and the amount of debt is linked directly to the cash flow potential and to a lesser extent the liquidation value of the project and its assets the sponsors guarantees if any to lenders generally do not cover all the risks involved in the project project assets including contracts with third parties and revenues are generally pledged as security for the lenders and firm contractual commitments of various third parties such as construction contractors fuel and other feedstock suppliers purchasers of the project s output and government authorities represent significant components of the credit support for the project risk assessment and allocation at the outset of any project financing the project s lenders will require a lawyer to produce a comprehensive legal due diligence report identifying the key risks to the future success of the project this is a vital stage of the financing process as an unidentified and therefore unmitigated risk has the potential to jeopardise the stability of a project in order to produce such a report the lawyer will need to work closely with a series of specialist advisers typically including insurance advisers technical advisers and environmental consultants and local lawyers in the relevant jurisdiction as the project s sponsors who are providing the equity and the project s lenders who are providing the debt may have differing perspectives as to the likelihood of future adverse events and which party should bear the risk of those events occurring during the financing process the due diligence of a project is of great importance because a project s risk profile will directly influence the structuring of its overall debt and equity arrangements an example of how this works in practice can be seen in middle eastern power projects middle eastern host governments deliberately structure their tendering processes for the right to build the power plant so as to ensure that they will have to pay the lowest possible electricity tariff typically this is achieved by the host government s utility company guaranteeing to purchase both the project s power capacity and its actual generation this arrangement significantly decreases the project s risk profile as the lenders can take comfort from the utility s strength as the off taker and can accurately predict the revenues that the project company will receive once the project has been constructed and is generating power a lower risk profile allows lenders to offer longer tenors and lower margins this decreases the sponsors cost of funding which enables the project company to offer a more competitive electricity tariff whilst still preserving the sponsors equity returns by way of contrast in industry sectors such as mining and petrochemicals a project company s off take arrangements will typically be calculated by volume and the variable market price for its output the project takes market risk because market risk means that the project s revenues are less predictable lenders will typically require sponsors to invest a greater proportion of equity into the project in a project where market risk is an issue a market analyst s report which will predict future off take and feedstock supply prices will be of paramount importance to lenders and sponsors alike in order to be able to raise finance for a project the sponsors will need to demonstrate to potential lenders that the contractual arrangements are bankable the less comfortable the lenders are with provisions involving the contractor s ability to claim extensions of time or additional costs the greater the amount of equity support the sponsors will have to provide when asked to advise as to the bankability of a project a project finance lawyer will need to pay particular attention to the supply and off take arrangements and the risk allocation arrangements in a project s construction contract a large scale infrastructure project will typically have a construction contract with an established and creditworthy engineering and supply contractor under a market tested bankable contractual form known as an engineering procurement and construction or epc contract which will typically include provisions for testing and the payment of liquidated damages in the event that the project is not constructed by a certain date failure to comply with any requirements of an epc contract will usually result in a contractor incurring monetary liabilities the bankability of a project will of course differ depending on that project s industry sector or jurisdiction by way of example the technology risk and regulatory risk associated with a satellite project will be greater than the technology risk and regulatory risk of a power project similarly the key bankability concerns for investors in a mining project situated in a developing country are likely to be influenced by factors such as political environmental and social risk which are not likely to be key concerns in a satellite project broadly speaking in a successful project financing the material project risks will have been allocated under contracts that will withstand legal challenge through the project company s contractual arrangements with its sponsors lenders suppliers and purchasers so that the party best able to bear a risk will do so once the project s material project risks have been identified the key role of a lawyer is to advise as to the optimal allocation of those risks and so far as is possible mitigate them through the documentation process in a perfect world a lawyer would hope to see the project s construction risk allocated to a contractor with an acceptable credit standing though a turn key epc contract the project s supply risk allocated through firm supply contracts that guarantee a steady supply of feedstock fuel or other necessary resources and the project s off take risk allocated through a firm long term sales contract with an off taker with an acceptable credit standing that contains firm pricing and minimum purchasing obligations commonly known as take or pay commitments naturally the actual outcome will be driven by a host of commercial legal and other factors affecting the relevant project security project financings are in essence complex secured lending transactions the willingness of lenders to extend long term credit to a project may depend on the degree of comfort they take in the viability of the underlying security package the structuring of security packages across jurisdictions and diverse assets can present numerous and unique challenges the strength of the security package on offer will also impact the bankability of a project the security package is key as lenders only collateral is the project s assets typically lenders will seek to take security over all of a project company s assets however in a project located in an emerging market with an undeveloped collateral framework the practical reality of creating and or enforcing security is that it may be expensive time consuming and uncertain in outcome in practice therefore enforcement of security over a project company s assets is generally seen by lenders as a last resort for many lenders the main driver in taking security over a project company s assets is should the project company face financial difficulties to maximise the strength of their bargaining position against i the project company s other creditors ii the host government and iii the project company s sponsors should a project face financial difficulties the lenders ability to enforce their security with subject to local law requirements no obligation to share the benefits of the enforcement proceeds with anyone else puts them in the strongest possible position in the context of any restructuring negotiations as noted throughout this guide regimes for creation or perfection of security vary greatly between different jurisdictions and whether a security interest has been validly created and whether it has priority over competing security interests is a question of local law the strength of a lender s security package will be influenced by the relevant jurisdiction s applicable insolvency law and restrictions on foreign ownership of assets will impact the efficacy of a lender s security package project financiers will want to establish at the outset of a project whether the law of the jurisdiction where the project is located will recognise their rights as secured creditors and if the project company becomes insolvent whether their claims will be dealt with equitably any relevant issues would typically be described in a legal due diligence report in which amongst other things a lawyer working closely with local counsel will at a minimum need to establish i whether the relevant jurisdiction has a registration system for the filing of security interests and ii whether the relevant jurisdiction s courts liquidator or equivalent officer will respect the security interests granted by a project company it should also be noted that in many jurisdictions particularly those with little or no track record of complex financings the cost of filing or registering security can be significant sometimes a percentage of the total amount being borrowed and sponsors may argue that the creation of security is unduly burdensome and that the practical value of the security to the lenders does not warrant the related expense particularly in jurisdictions with little experience of complex financings lenders will often seek to mitigate this by if permitted by local law requiring that certain of the project company s assets such as its bank accounts are held off shore in a jurisdiction with a favourable security regime such as england and wales or new york foreign investment and ownership restrictions where large sums of money are at stake sponsors and project financiers should assume that host governments will be insistent on ensuring that they receive what they view as their rightful share of the profits of a successful i e revenue generating infrastructure project as host governments will often require project companies to be incorporated under local law it will need to be established at the outset of a project how the law of that jurisdiction may affect the governance of the project company the sponsors will look to satisfy themselves that the project company has the ability to distribute surplus funds to its shareholders foreign sponsors who are shareholders alongside domestic sponsors will wish to satisfy themselves that whatever rights they have over the project company will be both respected and enforceable lenders will also take an interest in how the legal regime of the relevant jurisdiction treats foreign sponsors because should they need to enforce their security and sell the project company assets they may eventually need to replace the original sponsors regulatory restrictions typically a host government will impose certain regulatory restrictions on how its public utilities natural resources and infrastructure are owned and operated it will therefore need to be established at the outset of the project what impact if any that country s regulatory regime will have on the project s construction and operation for most projects the legal analysis of the regulatory environment will involve two basic areas of investigation i a determination of the rights granted to and the obligations imposed on the project company and ii an assessment of the risks associated with the change in a country s regulatory regime in order to minimise the risk involved in infrastructure development a host country will demand that a project be completed to the government s specifications as quickly as possible and seek adequate safeguards and assurances that the project will be operated properly and in line with the public s interests the second of these two areas of investigation is particularly important because although initial certainty as to the scope of a jurisdiction s regulatory regime may be achievable there will always remain the risk that the regulatory regime will change in circumstances where there is significant uncertainty as to the stability of a jurisdiction s regulatory regime in order to encourage foreign investment in their infrastructure host governments may be willing to enshrine specific contractual commitments into national law thereby allowing greater certainty that those commitments will have precedence over competing and often inconsistent laws and regulations the host government may also opt to enter into direct contractual undertakings with the project company and or its sponsors these vary from legally binding undertakings the breach of which will entitle the claimant to sue for damages or other preagreed levels of compensation such as termination payments which cover the project company s outstanding indebtedness to comfort letters which offer little if any certainty of remedy government approvals in addition to the above described regulatory restrictions a host government will usually require any large scale infrastructure project to obtain a broad range of permits and consents in relation to matters such as site use environmental impact health and safety and industrial regulation in order to determine the permits and consents that will be required by a project company a project finance lawyer will need to work closely with local lawyers and specialists in the relevant jurisdiction these specialists will also advise as to the existence of any restrictions on the provision of insurance by foreign insurers the hiring of foreign workers and importing equipment into the country at a minimum any legal due diligence report should identify what permits and consents the project company will require in order to carry out its business whether enforcement of any security interests over a project s assets could lead to a permit being revoked and whether following the enforcement of a security interest the entity to whom the lenders sell the project would be entitled to the benefit of that project s permits and consents risk relating to regulatory restrictions and approvals may be mitigated by obtaining legal opinions confirming compliance with applicable laws and ensuring that any necessary approvals are a condition precedent to the drawdown of funds under the loan agreement environmental social issues large scale infrastructure projects will inevitably have an environmental and social impact and sponsors seeking access to the financial markets will usually need to demonstrate a high level of environmental and social compliance most industrial facilities emit at least some waste and pollutants into the air water and soil and require permits and other authorisations to operate environmental concerns have become more prominent as a result of increased public awareness more stringent environmental health and safety laws and permitting requirements and heightened liability for the identification and clean up of hazardous materials and wastes traditionally lenders have required at a minimum that the project company undertakes to comply with all applicable environmental and social laws and regulations however in recent years lenders especially ecas and dfis have typically required the project company to adhere to a set of guidelines known as the equator principles which are a financial industry benchmark for determining assessing and managing social and environmental risk in project financing the equator principles incorporate the ifc and world bank environmental performance standards and guidelines thus the equator principles extended these international project based environmental and social standards into the realm of private financings amongst other things adherence to the equator principles requires the project company to develop and comply with an agreed environmental and social management plan focusing on areas such as labour and working conditions pollution prevention and abatement community health safety and security biodiversity conservation and sustainable natural resource management and protection of indigenous peoples and cultural heritage while such requirements are principally for the protection of the project s host country they are also very important for lenders as high profile international lending institutions do not want to be associated with projects that have an adverse environmental or social impact and the reputational damage potentially caused by any resulting negative publicity governing law issues sponsors and lenders to large scale cross border infrastructure projects will typically seek to have the finance documentation governed by either english or new york law although the law of each of these jurisdictions in relation to the enforceability of customary finance documents is broadly similar lenders may still have strong preferences based on familiarity with customary forms and terminology however sponsors and lenders will not usually have the ability to choose the governing law of the project s other agreements as conflict of law principles such as the doctrine of lex situs the rule that the law applicable to proprietary aspects of an asset is the law of the jurisdiction where the asset is situated may dictate which law is to be applied for specific purposes notably the creation of security interests although there is no equivalent legal doctrine that stipulates that project agreements should be governed by the law of the jurisdiction in which the project is located it is often a requirement of the host government that its own domestic law be specified as the governing law of certain agreements this is particularly true of any agreements to be signed by the government or a governmental entity since the manner in which a project s agreements will be interpreted or enforced will differ sometimes significantly according to the governing law of the contract the following will need to be established at the outset the effectiveness of the choice of the law clause to govern the various project agreements and the extent to which agreements governed by local law are legal valid binding and enforceable i e whether there are mandatory provisions of local law that will override the terms of the contract it is of course of fundamental importance that the parties are aware at the outset of the project if a country s domestic law prohibits fundamental aspects of the transaction for example a project company s obligation to pay interest on a loan is unenforceable in some jurisdictions by virtue of the general principles of islamic shari ah law disputes a project finance lawyer will also be concerned with establishing the impact of the choice of the forum for the determination of disputes arising from the transaction including the extent to which judgments or arbitral awards that emanate from that forum will be enforced in other relevant jurisdictions of particular interest to lenders and sponsors will be the following issues is the forum likely to be neutral in its decision making will the chosen forum apply the law specified by the parties in the contract which evidential or procedural rules will apply in the forum will judgments or arbitral awards be enforced in the home jurisdictions of the parties to the dispute as a result of the increasing popularity of arbitration as a means of settling disputes the parties will also need to consider at the outset whether any dispute should be the subject of judicial or arbitration proceedings the advantages in opting for judicial proceedings will depend on the country in question however key considerations will be do the country s courts have a tradition of reported case law or judicial precedent in order that a party might be able to predict the likely outcome of a dispute are there established procedural laws how independent is that country s judiciary from the legislature and executive in recent years the election of arbitration as a means of settling disputes has become increasingly common due to the relative speed and privacy that an arbitral process affords another significant advantage of arbitration given the often complex nature of disputes that arise from project financings is the ability to designate an arbitrator better equipped to address complex technical issues than a judge with more general skills it is also the case that in some instances an arbitral award may be more likely than a court judgment to be enforced in the home jurisdiction of the party against whom it is made as international treaty arrangements such as the new york convention call for member states to give effect to arbitral awards made in other member states judicial proceedings in some circumstances may still be preferable to arbitration particularly if that jurisdiction s courts have the ability to compel parties to refrain from certain actions disclose documents and order interim relief which can be very useful when one party is seeking to prevent another party from moving assets out of a jurisdiction further there is a perceived tendency of arbitrators to arrive at compromise positions so called rough justice for these reasons lenders will typically insist that the finance documents include an arbitration clause which applies only for their benefit thus preserving the possibility of recourse to the relevant jurisdiction s courts in addition as arbitration is a product of contract only parties that have specifically consented to the arbitration of a dispute can be compelled to proceed in that forum sovereign immunity another potential issue that a project finance lawyer must consider is the possibility that host governments or state owned stakeholders in the project and their assets may well be immune from proceedings before the courts of the host state with the result that a successful judicial or arbitration proceeding may prove to be a wholly unsatisfactory means of recourse sovereign immunity is widely acknowledged to be a matter of international law however there may be exceptions to its application which means that if required sovereign immunity can usually be mitigated at the outset of a project either because as a matter of local law a state entity acting in a commercial capacity may not benefit from immunity in all or any circumstances or because it is usually possible for a state entity to waive its right to immunity change of law political risk as project finance loans are generally repaid over a relatively long timeframe the host country s laws are liable to change during the tenor of the project s debt political risk arises from actions by host governments that have a negative impact on the financial performance or commercial viability of a project in an unstable country where regime change is frequent and competing policy objectives vary widely it follows that the risk of a change in law adversely impacting a project will be greater at the more extreme end of the scale actions by a host government such as expropriation of the project or the imposition of restrictions on the repatriation of a project s foreign currency earnings can have an extremely negative impact on the commercial viability of a project economic cycles will shift the relative negotiating balances between investors and host governments and as a country s economy develops its host government may seek to re negotiate contracts in order to extract more favourable terms as practitioners of energy law in the europe will attest this is not just an issue in emerging markets in 2011 in response to the fukushima nuclear disaster host governments in germany and italy took significant decisions with regard to their nuclear programmes that will have long term impacts on the price of energy and the direction of energy infrastructure investment in europe the premature shutdown of nuclear power plants in countries such as germany makes the long term revenue streams of nuclear power projects less certain for sponsors especially in countries where policy decisions are greatly influenced by public opinion notwithstanding this uncertainty at the outset of a project sponsors and lenders will still seek to satisfy themselves that they are comfortable with the political judicial economic and social stability of the country in which a project is situated in cases where there are concerns as to the stability of the host state such concerns may be capable of being addressed through the use of political risk insurance for many commercial lenders political risk insurance is often a prerequisite to their internal credit approvals or the involvement of multilateral and other public sector lending institutions such as ecas and dfis whose participation may act as a deterrent to adverse interference by the host government other potential mitigants to political risk include requiring the host government to freeze the laws that apply to the project company through for example the execution of investment agreements requiring the project s off takers to compensate the project company through tariff adjustments to cover increased costs arising from changes in law or regulation and or reliance on bilateral investment treaties which afford nationals of a contracting state treaty protection from specified actions by the government of another contracting state tax and customs virtually all projects are subject to some form of taxation and the tax regime will generally have a significant impact on the project s economics typically a project company will be required to pay corporate tax which will be determined on the basis of the profits that it generates in some jurisdictions it may also be obliged to pay royalties to the host government calculated on the gross value of its sales stamp taxes registration taxes and notarial fees may be significant and may also impact on a project s economics in addition to establishing the level of such fees and taxes at the outset a project s sponsors and lenders will want to know whether the laws of the host country will require the project company to make withholdings on account of tax on interest and dividend payments it makes to overseas lenders and shareholders if interest payments made by a project company to its lenders attract withholding tax then those lenders will require the project company to gross up interest payments so that they receive the same amount of interest that they would have received in the absence of the withholding tax the role of a lawyer in this scenario will be to determine if relief from the effects of withholding requirements can be found under an applicable double taxation treaty or the domestic tax laws of the jurisdiction in which the investors or lenders are situated whenever goods or individuals cross a border they become subject to the laws of both the country they are leaving and the country they are entering it will be necessary to ensure that the project company has the ability to import into the host country the goods equipment and raw materials required for the project as well as the ability to employ expatriate managers engineers and labour typically customs restrictions will take the form of simple import duties however certain jurisdictions impose absolute prohibitions on the import of certain goods the immigration laws of many countries will permit the employment of qualified expatriates on a limited basis but prohibit the employment of expatriates without particular skills or qualifications some host countries may permit a large influx of foreign workers during the early stages of a project particularly during the construction phase after which indigenisation laws may require that an increasing number of local citizens be trained and employed by the project company why does the world need project finance lawyers as well as the ability to negotiate a deal that works for all parties throughout the life of the project project finance lawyers need to be able to assess the bigger picture understand which points really matter in the overall commercial context and as the quote at the beginning of this chapter alludes to try to ensure that what is already a complex and challenging undertaking does not become unnecessarily complicated given the long term nature of a project financing the documentation must be sufficiently robust to withstand long term volatility it is also important that the parties realise from the outset that even after the relevant financing and project documentation has been executed they must make an effort to sustain the relationships that underpin the project this is because no matter how extensive or well drafted the legal documentation virtually every project encounters technical or commercial problems over its life and will face some kind of economic political or legal change despite the mountain of documents governing the project participants relationships issues that had not been contemplated at the time of signing and which are therefore not addressed in the documentation can and often do arise a key role for the project finance lawyer is to attempt to minimise the frequency with which any project encounters problems by undertaking a careful initial assessment of the project risks and encouraging a consensual approach between the parties to resolving risk allocation issues which arise given the complexity of the process and the large sums of money at stake project financing is a document intensive process and project finance lawyers play a crucial role in managing that process in many ways the legal skills required to close a project finance transaction are often as much to do with process management as legal analysis and drafting as it is not unusual for a project s sponsors lenders and advisers to be based in different jurisdictions across differing time zones keeping on top of the complex set of documents required for the closing of a project financing can be a significant undertaking and it is important that the lawyers work together to ensure that signing arrangements do not become overly complex or contingent today s project finance market sees sponsors and lenders from increasingly diverse backgrounds working together on larger and more complex projects in ever more remote and challenging jurisdictions in this exciting and evolving market place project finance lawyers have the unique and crucial role of being able to advise their clients whether sponsors or lenders on the effective management of risk in order to enable them to continue to push the frontiers of project financing and ensure the development and construction of much needed large scale infrastructure projects around the world the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances
for weeks we have been perplexed by one year naira denominated risk free rates lower than the 250 â 300 spread over inflation which we think foreign investors require last week rates moved back up as we argue on page 2 a soft outlook for us rates does not necessarily mean lower rates in emerging markets especially if a us slowdown in growth implies weak oil prices fx in the principal foreign exchange market the nafex market foreign investor participation remains high providing 52 of liquidity the three month moving average figure of the central bank of nigeriaâ s cbn foreign exchange reserves stands at us 45 16bn a slight increase from the beginning of the month the underpinning of the naira currently at n360 10 us 1 appears strong if there is a shock to the system â say oil prices â the cbn has sufficient buffers to absorb it in our view so we believe the naira is sound for at least the rest of this year bonds t bills the yield on a federal government of nigeria fgn naira bond with 10 years to maturity increased by 27bps to 14 60 and at 3 years rose by 26bps to 14 62 last week the yield on a 364 day t bill rose by 89bps to 14 09 the yield on a t bill with 3 months to maturity rose by 176bps to 12 55 market rates rose last week to lift the spread of one year risk free naira rates above inflation to 272bps this is within our expectations of a 250 â 300 bps spread open market operation omo yields at auction remained flat suggesting the cbn sees scope for market rates to remain low in the short term oil the price of brent decreased by 1 86 last week to us 63 29 bbl the average price year to date is us 66 58 bbl 7 13 lower than the average of us 71 69 bbl in 2018 but 21 60 higher than the us 54 75 bbl average seen in 2017 last week the world bankâ s publication global economic prospects june 2019 cut its forecast of global growth in 2019 from 2 9 y y to 2 6 y y with oil inventory levels high there was little to support oil prices at this point saudi arabia which implemented production cuts earlier this year is reported to be negotiating with russia to coordinate efforts to reduce supply much depends on the outcome of those talks in our view equities the nigerian stock exchange nse all share index recorded a loss of 2 05 last week resulting in a year to date return of negative 3 18 last week sterling bank 6 52 access bank 3 28 and fcmb 2 48 closed positive while dangote sugar 12 88 pz cussons 9 26 and seplat 6 64 fell as we argue in coronation research power to the price point 20 may listed consumer companies with the possible exception of nestle nigeria face an uphill challenge in expanding market share stiff competition from unlisted competitors exploiting the price sensitivity of the mass market causes them problems us dollar rates and naira rates us dollar rates the key influence in h1 2019 the lesson from late january this year was clear once us dollar interest rate increases were put on hold then the carry trade which for our purposes means borrowing in us dollars and investing in naira fixed income securities became more attractive than before we noted both the swiftness and the size of us dollar flows into nigeria from that point onwards gross inflows were in excess of us 11 0bn and contributed to a recovery in cbn reserves naira one year risk free rates fell by some 300 basis points bps from just over 17 00 per annum pa to just over 14 00 pa the next lesson came early this month when the leadership of the us federal reserve abandoned its neutral policy stance in favour of accommodating growth in the us economy in other words the us federal reserve has become less concerned about the inflationary effects of americaâ s various tariff wars than with the growth outlook and it is prepared to cut interest rates to preserve growth this was its second big change of the year to date us dollar rate cuts now priced in around this time us bond markets adjusted and it seems that a cut of some 100 basis points in us rates by the end of 2020 is being priced in for emerging markets this can be seen as good news lower us yields increase the spread in the carry trade in practical terms it lowers the cost of us dollar funds for investment funds which reference us dollar libor it makes their emerging market fixed income investments more profitable than before so perhaps it should not have been a surprise to us when one year risk free naira rates fell to 13 45 in late may and then 13 20 earlier this month these rates compared with recent inflation prints at 11 37 y y and therefore were short of the 250 300bps spread over inflation which we usually expect to see not that we believed it but for a brief period it looked as though we were in for a period of low naira rates do not forget about oil prices however there is no simple read through from us rates to nigerian rates risk factors come into the equation for example one reason why naira interest rates were so high at the beginning of the year was the prospect of general elections in february so it was a combination of removing electoral risk and the hold on us interest rates which caused naira interest rates fall by 300bps after january however a declining us interest rate outlook is not the only consequence of a poor us economic growth outlook so too is the global growth outlook and the prospect for commodity prices including oil oil prices are once again a risk factor for nigeria with crude oil brent ending last week at us 63 29 bbl down 13 06 from its recent high at the end of april there are two reasons to be concerned the first is that us 60 00 bbl is the oil price given in the federal government of nigeriaâ s fgn 2019 appropriation bill its budget and with production falling roughly 20 short of the assumed 2 3 million barrels per day mbpd there is implied fiscal pressure second and connected to the fgnâ s budget assumptions is the likelihood that foreign investors see an oil price of us 60 00 bbl as level above which they feel comfortable below us 60 00 bbl they may feel somewhat nervous in our view this we believe is consistent with upwards pressure on naira interest rates
go back one year on june 13 2018 the fomc voted to raise the federal funds range by another quarter percent by every account in the mainstream this was consistent with how we were told the economy was progressing the labor market was on fire and so was the economy they said two months earlier the wall street journal wrote about a quarter of economists surveyed by the wall street journal now expect federal reserve chairman jerome powell to pursue a more aggressive pace of interest rate increases than his predecessor janet yellen following u s moves to cut taxes and boost government spending it was winning on all sides the federal government had finally delivered to economists the thing they long for most fiscal stimulus the very stuff of neo keynesian fantasy a large dose of tax cuts along with continued deregulation including many of the elements like the health insurance mandate which some political economists had said were primary causes of so much of the prior lethargy how could it possibly go wrong a little over a month after the june rate hike the bureau of economic analysis reported that in its preliminary estimate for q2 real gdp the us economy had advanced by better than 4 confirmation to many of at long last an actual boom during those happy go lucky middle months of 2018 what if someone had told you that in all of 2019 not only would there be no further rate hikes the only moves the federal reserve would make would be rate cuts and not just one but likely several you might have been more open to the idea but in the mainstream it was laughable totally impossible and yet it wasn t just someone who was saying this the same day the fomc gathered to vote for that june hike the eurodollar futures curve inverted for the first time in the middle of the boom right at the apex of what was hawkish mania the slight inversion amounted to a serious if ultimately unheeded warning the chances of not just the fed but the whole mainstream forecast making a substantial error had become very high this market along with the flattening us treasury yield curve was telling the world to take a minute and really make sure first before jumping off jay powell s inflationary bridge even the 4 1 gdp was less impressive people keep forgetting we ve seen 4 quarters before they weren t totally absent during the malaise just way too infrequent in the middle months of 2014 there were two in a row not that it made any difference the message behind the flat curves before june 2018 was how the biggest deepest market in the world was telling anyone with an open mind there was trouble brewing it only started with a seriously isolated unemployment rate and the lack of inflationary confirmation for it what was really on the minds of bond traders was the potential for yet another monetary break liquidity risk in the parlance of the realm it showed up on may 29 2018 thus what was flat and worried curves became those featuring more and more conviction these policymakers have it all wrong again the signals were not missed in washington shocking i know in early july last year the fomc published the minutes of that june policy gathering in them there was a passage related to the yield curve and how us treasury rates were not in keeping with the agreed upon sentiment about the economy short version if the economy is so awesome and going to stay that way why is the yield curve flattening so much this account of the policy meeting is a sanitized and truncated version of real and often lengthy discussions in the minutes what appears to be the majority wanted to make sure to get across their message that the bond market must be wrong we know this because some detail for it was added to the final output what was released to the public they came up with excuses like r and as always term premiums and yet there must also have been a determined minority one which demanded at least some mention of a disagreement on this topic for a policymaking body that often demands uniformity and conformity it speaks to serious unease here s what the text says about it some participants noted that such factors might temper the reliability of the slope of the yield curve as an indicator of future economic activity however several others expressed doubt about whether such factors were distorting the information content of the yield curve a true economic recovery a real one in fact not just in narrative would be received first and foremost in the bond market and by bond market i mean much more than just us treasuries a paradigm shift after a decade of substantial weakness would have translated into other sovereign debt markets as well as into other parts of the us system accompanying a huge blow your head off bond massacre we would ve seen swap spreads normalize meaning interest rate swap prices moving out of the negatives or near zero spreads and shooting upwards to sixty seventy maybe even 100 basis points above those skyrocketing treasury rates all the big curves would ve gone almost vertical not horizontal none of those things were happening none of the market indications were even hinting in that direction even during the best of the boom in early 2018 these markets were at most saying the mainstream narrative isn t impossible after may 29 however that s when it shifted back to we ve seen this before to put it in ben bernanke s terms another false dawn the third in a string of them this possibility seems to have registered in that minority as entirely too familiar beginning with the contrary case staked out yet again by the yield curve and it is exactly what has unfolded and what unfolds before us still the rate cuts haven t started yet but the market is now saying soon not only are eurodollar futures prices through the roof and for contracts in 2019 even those expiring in the next few months treasury bill yields are plummeting i made a big point of them last week especially the 4 week instrument the front bill is ten basis points lower right now than when i last wrote about it the july 2019 eurodollar futures contract for instance is currently priced at just about 97 72 three month libor the money rate which eurodollar futures reference for final payout and settlement has been falling again just as the curve has forecast with its inversion on may 30 this benchmark money rate was fixed at 2 52025 as of the last posted result 2 42788 a drop of more than 9 bps in nine trading sessions it doesn t sound like much but like t bill yields it is a huge change and the whole eurodollar curve says it s going to keep on going lower and lower right now by the july contract libor should be somewhere around 2 28 when it drops off the board matures if that s what ends up happening and the curve has been spot on all year that puts 3 month libor twenty two basis points below the upper bound of the federal funds target range and only three basis points from its lower bound a growing probability of a rate cut maybe not next week but possibly next month the next contract in line august 2019 is currently priced around 97 85 this implies a 3 month libor rate around ten basis points below the current lower bound by the time you get to december 2019 the market right now expects 3 month libor just about 1 95 and that s just if you take contract prices literally they are actually a probability spectrum beginning with that number fomc officials agree today that this could happen but that s largely the point and it is not their point how could they get this so wrong in one year s time boom and aggressive rate hikes have become some number of rate cuts of an undetermined nature what was thought impossible is now the best case scenario chairman powell has said that any rate cuts the fed might consider would amount to nothing more than insurance for this boom to continue how would he know what they are the implications of a false dawn begin right in his models and conjecture that s all this boom ever was conjecture follow the bond market in both directions forward to better understand what is happening today and what that might mean for tomorrow also backward to get some sense of how we got to this point when everyone said there was no chance it could end up this way the bond market mispriced nothing the media overpriced powell just like it overpriced yellen and way way overpriced bernanke the economy is facing serious trouble at a time when it cannot afford any another downturn or following the curves worse would be devastating to suffer yet another big setback before that recovery paradigm shift before the liftoff and end to the malaise think about what the last downturn did in terms of the election s of 2016 expand that thought to populists and socialists globally gross and active dissatisfaction more generally the fed got it wrong the tax cuts and deregulation weren t the answers either what is left that keeps leading the economy astray just at the moment it seems poised to escape how this is unfolding in 2019 is in general terms not all that different from how it went in 2015 or 2012 sweeping aside term premiums which the bond market itself is doing a good job the lower yields fall economists have only r to hold on to but it s not the safety blanket they make it out to be the get out of jail free card pointing the finger at you and me it is a distraction purposefully cloaked in hands off mathematics r or r star is their conception of a natural interest rate in convention a low natural rate suggests there is something wrong with the economy itself there are structural problems which hold back what otherwise might seem normal growth potential the fed gave it everything it had but supply side considerations in investment as well as labor thwarted genius here s frbny s john williams in 2017 when he was then president of frbsf this isn t just affecting the u s economy lower r star is a global phenomenon in fact the average r star in canada the euro area japan and the united kingdom is a bit below 0 5 percent a variety of factors have pushed r star to this low level and they appear poised to stay that way the major one is that the sustainable growth rate of the economy has slowed dramatically from prior decades why to the economist today baby boomers and drug addicts williams went so far as to add another factor to the list last week how people living longer tended to hold back productivity and thus keep the u s and other developed economies in a low growth pattern i m not making this up these really are unserious people leaving the world to face the very serious consequences of getting all this stuff wrong what williams won t tell you what no economist will voluntarily point out is how even r provides us with a huge clue but recognizing and following that clue would lead central bankers to look squarely in the mirror they ll instead tell you about how the natural rate has been falling for a very long time this isn t something new it s been in the works for decades and it s happening everywhere not just here all that is technically true and yet by every mainstream measure of r whether it s a real thing or not they all show the same big point the bulk of its drop the vast majority takes place in 2008 funny how that s never mentioned it s as if some huge worldwide phenomenon punched a hole in global economic potential in a very short period of time all coinciding with something absolutely colossal that might ve showed up out of nowhere around 2008 the list of things that could possibly explain all the facts is exceedingly small in fact there is only one item on it and it s neither retiring baby boomers nor increased lifespans going back to williams in 2017 while a central bank like the fed sets short term interest rates r star is a result of structural economic factors beyond the influence of central banks and monetary policy given the way in which interest rates even money rates have developed over this last year does the fed even set the short term interest rate maybe at some times but if not the fed in other times then what the structural economic factors beyond the influence of central banks and monetary policy might include those very rates some shadow mysterious of a random error in econometric models like retiring baby boomers in the mainstream conception of r the eurodollar system also lies outside of monetary policy s boundaries for someone like john williams or jay powell it would look like the same thing an unknown the problem with preventing what are otherwise very smart people from making this connection is pure ideology i think some policymakers and some economists know it they can t keep saying the bond market is wrong like they did in 2007 dismissing all these very same signals and have it turn out to be right time and time again but to admit 2008 s role in even r would be to admit how badly they botched it like this measure of potential and the trajectory of interest rates nothing has been the same since the ugly fall it has proved to be a real inflection point in every way imaginable leaving the public with a very different image than heroic fighters saving the whole world from a worse fate and turning in that direction the entire discipline would be open and subject right away to very harsh questions about how that could ever have happened in the first place they had one job to do jay powell is not about to hold a press conference at any point during his tenure to fess up to the dirty little secret of central banking there is and has been no money in monetary policy the one thing that might ve been handy during the only monetary panic of the last four generations to monetary authorities money is that unknown there just aren t any circumstances where they can act on this fact upon hearing the truth i suspect the vast majority of the world would react with anger something along the lines of what have you been doing this whole time and why did you just let 2008 happen and the world suffer the increasing consequences in that way at least r and the curves are consistent and very much the same thing approached from different angles try plotting r against the 30 year swap spread to see what i mean nothing whatsoever had changed in 2017 and 2018 r reflected as much skepticism in monetary policy as the eurodollar and treasury curves while that means 2019 is almost certainly lost the trick is to catch up before 2020 and beyond is too having wasted all this time in between celebrating another false dawn going back to what i wrote in april 2016 central banks have proven by their own actions not their words that they will only allow their recovery which in the end means none as i have written before if they were given a choice of maintaining power and control but only leading to more lost decades or stepping aside and being guaranteed a full and sustainable recovery they would choose the former every single time in other words to avoid the entire enterprise s full and complete discredit they re going to continue to focus on dealing with the imagined fallout from the baby boomer problem we don t really have rather than face up to the broadly painful possibilities of the monetary one we do as concise as maybe i could ever be that sentence is the curves and ironically r
in my view the larger financial problems will finally force pakistan to seek accommodation with india in keeping with prime minister imran khan s austerity drive pakistan s defence budget this year announced tuesday is exactly the same as last year rs 1 15 trillion or us 7 6 billion but the alarming slide in the rupee to dollar rate and the current inflation rate of 9 41 per cent mean there will be less foreign exchange for imported equipment and less money for domestic expenditure will this net decrease impact the defence preparedness of pakistan will the ongoing economic crisis push pakistan to review its aggressive national security strategy financial catastrophe for a decade now pakistan has been facing economic crisis according to prime minister imran khan the national debt is now at 205 billion its foreign exchange reserves are at a record low its tax revenue is only 22 7 billion half of which is used for debt servicing the suspension of american aid of 1 3 billion has further aggravated the problem the 62 billion china pakistan economic corridor cpec project is the biggest hope for pakistan but also its biggest problem as it rapidly adds to the external debt being a national security state beholden to its military pakistan s defence budget hovered at about 3 per cent of its gdp and accounted for 21 per cent of annual government expenditure last year a façade in the midst of this economic crisis and a week before the 2019 20 budget there was a surprise development when the pakistan army committed itself to a voluntary defence budget cut last year the defence budget had been increased by 20 per cent there was extensive coverage of the proposed defence budget cut freeze in the indian media analysts were unanimous in their views that the pakistan military is merely putting up a façade to meet the stringent conditions laid down by the world bank and other donors and that it will continue to meet its security needs by hiding the real defence expenditure and putting it under other categories also read pakistan s defence budget unchanged due to imran govt s austerity drive a national security state assuming that 20 25 per cent of pakistan s budget is for imports and 75 80 per cent for domestic expense the net decrease in the defence budget is approximately 11 5 13 25 per cent a decrease of 10 15 per cent can be covered by clandestinely making up the deficit by diverting from other categories but given the state of pakistan s economy it is unlikely in the short term the military will tide over the problem by tightening the belt and deferring the payments of imported equipment which is mostly from china however if economic problems persist in the long run the defence preparedness to pursue current security aims will be affected pakistan needs to maintain the current levels of defence spending because of its aggressive national security strategy else it can take care of its fundamental security needs with half the current budget its nuclear weapons ensure that there can be no existential threat to pakistan from india problem child in south asia india is a status quo power that has militarily refrained from any action to recover its territories occupied by china and pakistan it seems it is even willing to settle for the line of control and line of actual control as international boundary in return for lasting peace and economic development afghanistan and iran are too weak to pose any threat to pakistan pakistan s security problems are self created it seeks the role of a major power in the region and leadership of the islamic umma pakistan seeks parity with india and actively confronts it by waging a proxy war in jammu and kashmir the war in afghanistan is driven by pakistan s regional ambition to have a government of choice in kabul a politicised military is the driver of pakistan s national security strategy also read modi is not wrong in thinking pakistan wants talks with india to earn global brownie points india s choice now the future of pakistan s economy hinges on the success of the cpec a lot is at stake for china too both financially and prestige wise the cpec cannot succeed with conflict raging north and south of it there are no black and white solutions for disputes between sovereign states to begin we can diplomatically pursue the india china bilateral model and replicate it with pakistan india should also reconsider its stand on china s belt and road initiative regional economic cooperation between india china pakistan and afghanistan can go a long way in promoting peace in the region of course all these hinge on pakistan reviewing its aggressive strategy in jammu and kashmir and afghanistan let me end with a cautionary note with reforms and modernisation of our own armed forces at a standstill for the last 20 years due to inadequate defence budget pakistan despite the economic crisis has adequate military capacity to stalemate us as a much bigger economy with a defence budget five times that of pakistan we must create an overwhelming edge in key military technologies which are beyond pakistan s economic reach lt gen h s panag pvsm avsm r served in the indian army for 40

editors note this week we re running a mini series on argentina s current financial crisis with an election coming up it s an important moment to reflect on the failures of president mauricio macri s promises to restore the country s economy part 1 published yesterday covers the specifics of argentina s macroeconomic policies and why a renewed alliance with the imf will only exacerbate austerity policies at the expense of the working class part 2 covers president macri s stunted efforts to bring fracking to argentina will argentina continue down this path or will the people seek out an alternative here s part 2 argentine president mauricio macri entered office in 2015 a darling of the investor class he vowed to the turn the page on the reckless spending and economic mismanagement of his peronist predecessors but a few years on argentina finds itself in a situation that is all too familiar an economic and currency crisis erupted last year and quickly spun out of control in 2018 macri hastily turned to the international monetary fund imf for a bailout as alan ciblis details in part 1 of this series the imf is widely reviled in argentina due to its role in past economic crises a rescue package usually comes with demands for austerity and this time was no different thus far macri has complied by having his government cut public spending and slash utility subsidies in an effort to reduce budgetary pressure but these decisions have also led to price hikes for ordinary people increasing hardship and exacerbating sky high inflation indeed consumer prices shot up 54 percent over a 12 month period ending in march the currency has also fluctuated violently argentina is now viewed as the second riskiest borrower in the world after venezuela according to the market for credit default swaps investors put the odds of a default at 49 percent within the next five years facing a public backlash macri reversed course announcing slightly less draconian austerity measures earlier this year in april he announced a series of price controls in an effort to lessen the financial blow on the average household but the peso sank in response to the news as international investors felt he was abandoning free market orthodoxy meanwhile labor unions staged multiple strikes in april to protest austerity crippling downtown buenos aires macri has been unable to break out of this conundrum and his poll numbers have sunk to new lows he is still the favorite of the business elite and international investors who view him as one of their own even if he is struggling to rescue argentina from years of malaise the failed promise of fracking aside from austerity and ingratiating himself with international capital one of macri s signature agenda items was the expansion of fracking the government has served up a lot of hype about argentina s vaca muerta shale deposits which lorena riffo explored in her article in nacla s fossil fuels and toxic landscapes report macri s campaign to exploit oil and gas seemed to serve multiple purposes at once increasing domestic energy production while also bringing foreign investors back to argentina argentina s recent oil and gas deficit has forced it to turn to costly imports macri positioned a potential oil and gas boom as a key pillar of growth for the argentine economy one that could slash imports reduce pressure on the budget and bring back strong economic growth in addition replicating a texas style fracking boom would require massive investment and macri s need to attract multinational oil and gas companies reinforced his campaign to court international finance his predecessor cristina fernández de kirchner had angered investors when she partially nationalized the yacimientos petrolíferos fiscales ypf oil and gas company under her watch shale dreams failed to materialize and business leaders said her heavy handed state involvement was to blame macri promised his business friendly approach would get the job done outside of north america argentina is typically held up as the most likely candidate to host the next shale bonanza due to the vast quantities of oil and gas in the vaca muerta shale deposit which is largely centered in neuquén province but vaca muerta competes with texas and a number of other oil hubs in terms of attracting capital fracking in argentina however is expensive and so the premise of an argentina shale revolution was always likely to be built on heavy subsidies from the state macri s government decided to subsidize natural gas production by covering the difference between market prices and a fixed price of 7 50 per mmbtu one million british thermal units for drillers because that price is higher than prices elsewhere in the world for instance natural gas prices along the u s gulf coast averaged 3 mmbtu in 2017 the government was handing cash to oil and gas companies to drill at the same time macri cut subsidies for ordinary households in an effort to save money facing hardship the argentine people are effectively being asked to pay higher utility bills to subsidize fracking in 2016 after meeting with president macri then ceo of exxonmobil rex tillerson said that the company was considering plans to spend 10 billion in vaca muerta over a 20 to 30 year period a vote of confidence in the new corporate friendly administration i m optimistic about the changes that have happened in argentina with the new government tillerson stated but subsidized gas prices were critical in attracting the expected flood of investment when argentina s peso collapsed in mid 2018 macri turned to the imf amid a rapidly escalating financial crisis last year overpaying companies to produce gas became a luxury that argentina could no longer afford between 2016 and 2018 subsidies for producing oil and gas fell by a third from 4 1 billion usd to just 2 8 billion according to the institute for energy economics and financial analysis ieefa average consumers however took on a greater share of the burden subsidies for residential gas and electricity bills declined by more than 60 percent falling by 6 1 billion which meant that households saw their utility bills soar in january macri s government announced another round of cuts abruptly announcing that it would retroactively cap subsidies to shale gas producers some companies are outraged at the about face and are suing the government for damages the change in policy could cost tecpetrol a subsidiary of italian argentine company techint group 250 300 million annually in reduced cash flow in 2019 and 2020 according to moody s tecpetrol cut staff and reduced production following the subsidy change the problems don t end there since inadequate and otherwise congested roads are not up to the task of moving oil and gas equipment hundreds of miles out of the landlocked region in and around neuquén the government also needs to subsidize the construction of railroads to make its plans work but this has also hit a snag a 780 million rail project connecting the vaca muerta to the port of bahía blanca is on the rocks because drillers balked at committing to taking on future cargo volumes a sign of lack of interest from the industry at this stage very few projects are actually moving forward the industry faces challenges from investors who are increasingly questioning highly speculative new investments over the last six years 31 projects have been launched in vaca muerta only five are in active development and some of these are now threatened ieefa wrote in the same report most projects remain in the pilot phase with companies allocating limited amounts of money despite the enormous costs macri s fracking revolution is running on fumes the environmental and human toll fracking in argentina is not only a financial drain but a poor plan for economic development due to environmental and public health consequences locally the arid neuquén region will see increased water scarcity as more water is diverted for drilling observatorio petrolero sur opsur a buenos aires and neuquén based organization monitoring the energy industry has documented some of the deleterious health effects suffered by local residents living near fracking operations in neuquén and río negro provinces effects that have become all too familiar to people living in pennsylvania texas and new mexico headaches respiratory problems and psychological stress among many other ailments a 2018 report to the un from the committee on economic social and cultural rights urged argentina to reconsider its fracking campaign in the vaca muerta and instead focus on renewable energy the report said that the push for fracking jeopardized argentina s commitments to the paris climate agreement the effects on the ground can be significant a 2018 greenpeace investigation documented large amounts of toxic waste dumping related to fracking operations at illegal facilities in neuquén the dumping has caused pollution greenpeace says and the waste site is situated close to communities and farms the way these oil companies operate is pure environmental vandalism and demonstrates how little control local authorities truly have paul horsman spokesperson for greenpeace andino s climate and energy campaign said in a december 2018 statement a few weeks later in january 2019 opsur reported that local police had detained and beat a german photojournalist named stefan borghardt for photographing the treatment plant the police allegedly demanded that he delete the photos and confiscated his equipment once released borghardt filed a complaint with the provincial prosecutor posted several pictures of the waste dump on his facebook page the neuquén mapuche confederation filed a lawsuit against several powerful oil companies who send their fracking waste to the facility including exxon total pan american energy a subsidiary of bp ypf and pampa energia the mapuche directly affected by the expansion of drilling have fought against oil and gas companies for years and in some cases have successfully disrupted development it s not a coincidence that the same report sent to the un in late 2018 urging the argentine government to reconsider its fracking plans also highlighted human rights violations violence against environmental rights defenders and indigenous peoples the report noted that perpetrators often employed by the state avoid accountability because of a culture of impunity failed vision fracking in argentina has been a signature policy item of macri s administration and so its failure at least to date symbolically sums up his first term in office it also won t work even on its own terms to the extent that argentina has grown its oil and gas industry it has done so on the backs of ordinary people macri s government demands austerity from the people even as it lavishes subsidies on the fossil fuel industry now that such largesse has become unaffordable the house of cards looks increasingly rickety more importantly the environmental social and public health toll of the fossil fuel expansion is large as it is everywhere else in the world macri s push for the vaca muerta is another example of the senseless attempt to build an extraction economy at a time when the climate crisis is deepening

via ben ruffel he tone was apocalyptic the u s federal budget is on an unsustainable path the scale of the nation s projected budgetary imbalances is now so large that the risk of severe adverse consequences must be taken very seriously the growth in the american federal debt and deficit would soon produce a fundamental shift in market expectations and a related loss of confidence both at home and abroad and the resulting fiscal and financial disarray would depress economic activity much more than the conventional analysis would suggest these warnings came not from chicken little the white paper was co authored by robert rubin president clinton s treasury secretary and peter orszag president obama s director of the office of management and budget if these two were worried perhaps there was something to worry about yet these words were published in january 2004 since then the total public debt outstanding has tripled and the debt to gross domestic product ratio has more than doubled current spending policies have steepened this trajectory the treasury department anticipates 1 trillion deficits starting in 2022 and the congressional budget office forecasts the federal debt relative to gdp to hit its highest level since the end of the second world war by 2029 and to reach unprecedented territory soon thereafter including state and local debts in addition to unfunded pension obligations all of which the federal government implicitly backstops increases the total tally of debt outstanding by about 25 percent yet in the shadow of this mounting debt pile treasury yields the compensation investors require for holding these securities sit at historic lows president clinton s chief strategist james carville s wish to be reincarnated as the all powerful bond market seems as quaint today as rubin and orszag s warnings from 15 years ago the bond vigilantes have been driven from the land their homes burnt and fields salted the bond investor of today instead channels alfred e neuman what me worry the u s treasury market is the largest and most liquid financial market in existence and it underpins all investments and asset classes if the treasury market sneezes global financial markets and the world economy will catch a cold for stewards of long term capital the sustainability of the flood of treasury issuance cannot be ignored the question arises are asset allocators worried that the end is nigh for the treasury market and should they be i worry about everything says christopher ailman chief investment officer of the 234 billion california state teachers retirement system calstrs i ve worried about the u s deficit i remember discussing it with my fixed income manager in the 1990s and it s done nothing but gotten bigger i think the most profound impact of all of this which does get lost on the average american is that the united states is a debtor nation explains ailman who manages the assets of the second largest public pension plan in the united states we owe people money and when the borrower owes money to a lender you are usually subservient to and at the mercy of that lender at some point maybe not in my lifetime ailman says being a debtor to other people is going to come home to roost we ve thought about it and talked about it says carrie thome chief investment officer of the 3 billion wisconsin alumni research foundation warf for cios there is no easy answer what we re trying to do is continue to be diversified especially geographically but there is nowhere to hide she says the chief investment officer of the 65 billion alaska permanent fund marcus frampton agrees it s a topic of conversation internally it is probably one of the more concerning factors out there i definitely worry about that says jim dunn the chief investment officer and chief executive at verger capital management an outsourced cio firm that manages about 2 billion on behalf of several entities including wake forest university s endowment if i ve learned anything in my career it s that credit is unstable when credit cracks it causes really big problems serious booms and busts if we can t rely on the u s government to manage its credit challenges there s nothing left says dunn we have nothing to fall back on such fears are not confined to domestic investors the 73 billion ontario municipal employees retirement system omers highlighted rising public indebtedness in its 2018 annual report as one of the trends that will increasingly weigh on economies asset allocators worldwide are massive holders of u s treasuries while they may well decry rising public debt in dry minutes and white papers they are much less eager to be quoted negatively on the asset class gic singapore s sovereign wealth fund with an estimated 390 billion of assets pointed to elevated debt as one of the structural headwinds that it anticipates will significantly reduce its future returns according to the fund s 2017 18 annual report but neither gic nor omers would respond to this reporter s inquiries the fact is these fears have not stopped institutional investors from lapping up treasuries as the world s most liquid asset treasuries grease the skids of financial markets and are indispensable to both physical trading and trillions of dollars in derivatives notional treasuries also represent the world s safest of safe havens backed by the full faith and credit of the most powerful nation on earth treasuries were one of the few assets that materially appreciated during the 2008 financial crisis but much treasury buying is mechanical fixed income benchmarks are market value weighted meaning the largest issuers represent the largest portion of the index as a debtor issues more bonds it takes up that much greater a share of the index institutional investors seeking to minimize their tracking error against their benchmarks then buy that debt without even thinking twice about it the changes in the composition of the bloomberg barclays global treasury total return index a commonly used global government bond index illustrate this phenomenon at the end of january 2009 japanese government bonds held the plurality representing almost 35 percent of the index while treasuries were in second at 20 percent fast forward to april 2019 and japan and the united states have traded places treasuries increased by half to more than 30 percent of the index while japan fell 6 percentage points to 28 percent unsurprisingly the portion of the index made up of relatively disciplined borrowers like germany the netherlands and sweden decreased during this period the extent of the treasury buying is striking the experience of the world s largest sovereign wealth fund norway s 1 trillion government pension fund global is representative at the end of the first quarter of 2009 the fund held 12 6 billion of u s treasuries and only slightly smaller positions in german bunds and u k gilts ten years later the fund owned 75 billion of treasuries more than three and a half times larger than its second largest bond holding japanese government bonds the sovereign wealth fund s 2019 first quarter report noted that u s treasuries accounted for almost a fourth of its fixed income portfolio making them the fund s largest holding of government debt from a single issuer and representing the highest proportion in at least ten years a spokesman for norges bank investment management which manages the fund declined to comment for this article as america s public debt piles up many have wondered when the music will stop some of the smartest investors have questioned the sustainability of u s fiscal policy and several have gone so far as to short treasuries nassim nicholas taleb recommended in february 2010 that every single human being bet on a collapse in treasury prices in april 2010 bill gross predicted that interest rates and inflation would spike due to the record issuance of u s government debt and positioned the pimco total return fund to take advantage of this eventuality julian robertson made the same call in 2009 anticipating significant inflation that would hammer long dated treasuries john paulson also reaching a similar conclusion in 2009 went long gold as an inflation hedge each of these bets proved ill founded there s a reason rates traders sometimes refer to the short japanese government bond trade as the widowmaker to short u s treasuries is to array oneself against the most powerful institutions in the financial world and given the vast size and specialness of the treasury market there exists no single mechanism that can force prices to correct it is little wonder that few high profile investors have followed in the wake of the missteps of gross robertson and paulson but given the experience of the last 15 years it may be worth asking if there s anything to fear in the first place it s the 22 trillion question were orszag and rubin premature 15 years ago or were they just wrong an increasing number would argue for the latter to the advocates of modern monetary theory stephanie kelton a professor at stony brook university and an adviser to senator bernie sanders most prominent among them the only problem with the u s debt and deficit is that they are not big enough in a recent interview kelton said i am driven absolutely to madness by people talking about the deficit as this terrifying thing softer versions of this argument have more mainstream backing and they boil down to the idea that in the current low rate low inflation environment it makes sense for governments to keep issuing debt and the u s government backed by the world s largest economy and printing the world s reserve currency has more room to run up its debt load than anyone else the siren lure of this view is obvious of those seduced by it you can count america s political leadership as three successive presidential administrations have increased the public debt the most prominent critics of deficit spending have receded lawrence summers another of bill clinton s treasury secretaries and obama s director of the national economic council has called for washington to end its debt obsession even mick mulvaney president trump s director of the office of management and budget and an erstwhile deficit hawk has conceded that nobody cares about the deficit the dueling trillion dollar spending plans of the democrats vying for their party s 2020 presidential nomination underscore the bipartisan consensus on this issue and yet surely the laws of macroeconomic gravity have not lost their pull it s a question increasingly being asked in academia at the very least countries with credible institutions have more leeway to increase their debt than we once thought says randall kroszner a professor of economics at the university of chicago booth school of business and a former governor of the federal reserve system but you don t want to test how far you can go there are two fundamental reasons why rates have remained low despite the flood of government debt explains kroszner who also served as a member of president george w bush s council of economic advisers the first was the concerted actions of central banks during and after the 2008 financial crisis to drive down rates including both traditional rate adjustments and quantitative easing overstuffed balance sheets and political backlash may mean such expedients lose their potency going forward the second is more secular the global savings glut the theory of the global savings glut holds that over the last few decades the supply of global savings has increased faster than its demand a host of factors have fueled this shift but the biggest driver is demographic an explosion of young workers who saved their earnings instead of spending them with the chinese leading the way this surplus of savings means that inflation stays muted and government bonds can offer low yields and still attract investors but the global savings glut will not last forever these factors will start to reverse says kroszner on a five to ten year horizon you will start to see demographic factors of aging populations reduce savings and change the fundamentals of real rates as china rapidly ages and workers start to spend down their savings rock bottom rates may not be long for the world rising rates transform a manageable debt load into something malign already the congressional budget office projects the debt service or what the treasury pays in interest to its debt holders to outstrip what it spends on medicaid next year if global demographic shifts raise that burden further the economic and political blowback could be considerable there is one other complication that cuts against the reversal of the global savings glut the rest of the world looks so much worse pick your metaphor cleanest dirty shirt in the laundry healthiest horse at the glue factory but staggering public indebtedness and negative yields in europe and japan make u s treasuries look good by comparison we re the highest yielding debt of all the developed markets right now says calstrs ailman we re higher than europe and japan we re attractive we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us how long one effect can balance out the other will determine the timing of what comes next asset allocators live and die by the markets and how the treasury binge plays out is no mere academic concern for them history provides some guide as to what could follow a 2010 report by the mckinsey global institute outlined four archetypes for past episodes of sovereign deleveraging austerity high inflation massive default and growing out of debt unfortunately for the optimists mckinsey identified only one instance of the lattermost that of the u s during the second world war so pick your poison from the first three grinding belt tightening hyperinflation or default to this unpleasant menu you can add another possibility provided by the japanese japan s government debt is more than twice the size of its economy but yields are as low as ever japan s economic growth and financial market performance have been anemic for decades but the country has so far coped with its mushrooming debt load importantly japanese debt is almost entirely held by domestic investors by some estimates as much as 95 percent and japanese society is homogenous whether the american public would so willingly accept low yields and the painful fiscal trade offs that accompany this path or whether it should want to is harder to predict for allocators a key calculation is when the public debt wave will start to crest for now the consensus seems to be that any dénouement is some ways off the american economy is flourishing the dollar is still the reserve currency and europe and japan make america look like a beacon of fiscal probity if the public debt story unfolds without any surprises in other words we re years away from the agony of deleveraging but the surprises are what worry allocators the biggest fear is political we ve seen the hiccups in the treasury auctions when we ve played politics with our budget deficits and raising the debt ceiling says calstrs ailman suddenly for the first time people said wait a minute you re saying this credit might not pay the federal reserve because of the market s dependence on it and what it can and cannot do during the next recession looms large in many minds there s really not a lot of backstop for a downturn says verger s dunn we saw a huge downturn in the fourth quarter based on the fed saying one thing this is a scary fragile market it gets crazy at the end of the cycle like chekhov s gun others worry about the return of the one threat that has so far been silent inflation the growing federal debt and quantitative easing are all forms of money printing says alaska permanent s frampton i think that the really dangerous situation in the markets is if inflation picks up and the fed has to respond jerome powell appears willing to do whatever it takes to not let the stock market go down continues frampton but the fed s achilles heel is inflation because they wouldn t be able to react to these other problems out there inflation seems like a relic from another era and its total absence over the last decade has puzzled economists but inflation is a lever that governments can pull to ease their debt burdens one that milton friedman called irresistibly attractive to sovereigns given that the vast majority of treasuries outstanding are nominal the temptation to inflate them away could be compelling for allocators with real spending needs however such inflation would be ruinous inflation crushes investors especially institutional investors says verger s dunn even without a crisis however the prognosis could be grim at the current tempo america s burgeoning public debt load will eventually start distorting the allocation of credit in the economy and necessitate higher taxes all of which will gradually strangle the markets it s probably one of those pernicious things says warf s thome there s no crash it s just a slow bleed of low returns and slow growth maybe there s a malaise that enters for a lot of people says thome the perspective should be worrying about long term growth as much as anything the cold truth is that immunizing a portfolio against an american public debt crisis is simply not an option however there are tactical and strategic steps that asset allocators are beginning to take to minimize the potential damage people are already rethinking fixed income says calstrs ailman historically fixed income has been your anchor to windward the key diversification in your portfolio endowments now have fixed income in the single digits and a lot of pension plans that were as much as 50 percent fixed income in the 1970s are now generally at 20 percent maybe 25 percent and some of them lower than that alternatives may provide one replacement there are a lot of fixed income surrogates though they re not as liquid says ailman things like infrastructure and lease payments think about a aaa rated lease payment in germany as a surrogate for the german bund others are also turning to alternatives as a port in the storm we do a lot of hedging here says verger s dunn we ve done things like alternatives and long short managers and short only managers and we ve invested in commodities we re heavy in macro hedge funds says alaska permanent s frampton those managers have the flexibility and the skill set that we don t necessarily have in house here to navigate economic waters that are different than what we ve seen in the recent past there s a human tendency to always fight the previous war and this maxim applies to investing as well much mean variance optimization and scenario analysis rests on the assumption that treasuries function as the supreme risk off asset as they did in 2008 but there is no guarantee that that will be the case my concern is that investment grade fixed income and treasuries may not be such a valuable portfolio tool in the next downturn says alaska permanent s frampton pointing to an unexpected inflationary spike as a scenario in which those assets could underperform frampton adds that in his personal account he holds gold a fantastic monetary asset which has the same purchasing power today as in the roman empire but which is not an option for the fund itself more broadly asset allocators must question how different the future will be from the past government bonds are in the portfolio because they re the risk off asset largely and they re designed to perform when equities are not performing says warf s thome you have to ask what would stop them being that asset the reality however is that few investments will be unaffected if the treasury market begins to short circuit the hundreds of billions of dollars in risk parity strategies that rely on leveraged fixed income the trillions in private equity investments in companies dependent on the private debt market the sprawling derivatives marketplace all are vulnerable to treasury turmoil there s not a lot you can do here as far as asset allocation admits verger s dunn there has been no shortage of those like rubin and orszag in 2004 who have claimed that the four horsemen are ready to descend on the treasury market yet rubin and orszag themselves recognized the difficulty of predicting the fiscal future in their white paper the pair argued that the congressional budget office s projections of the u s debt and deficit over the next decade were much too rose colored based on their own assumptions they reckoned that the federal debt could grow by as much as 5 trillion over the next ten years five times higher than the government s experts had estimated despite the difficulties of predicting the precise effects or timing wrote rubin and orszag the risks of financial and fiscal disarray associated with large budget deficits may be a much more important motivation for fiscal discipline than merely avoiding the costs of budget deficits suggested by conventional analysis rubin and orszag got it wrong the real tally over the following decade would be twice as much as they predicted it continues to grow today assuming you read at an average pace the federal debt increased by 28 million since you started this article

by elizabeth warren s proposal to raise the value of the chinese yuan and other currencies against the dollar is not getting good reviews in the media from economists as can be expected some of the arguments are pretty strange as the usually astute noah smith tells it in his bloomberg piece the problem with the trade deficit is u s consumers are consistently living beyond their means which seems unsustainable the implication is that if the trade deficit were lower than we would be forced to cut back consumption but the major problem the united states has faced over the last decade according to many economists is secular stagnation which is an obscure way of saying not enough demand contrary to what smith tells us u s consumers are not living beyond their means rather we actually need them to spend more money to bring the economy to full employment to be more precise we need them to spend more in the domestic economy to increase demand here as opposed to in our trading partners we can also bring the economy to full employment by having the government spend more money on things like health care or a green new deal smith also disagrees with warren s mechanism for getting the dollar down which involves a mixture of negotiations and threats of countervailing measures the idea is that the biggest actor is china who for some reason it is assumed would never agree to raise the value of its currency cnn raises similar concerns this view seems badly off the mark first it is assumed in both pieces that china is no longer acting to deliberately keep down the value of the yuan against the dollar even though most economists now concede that it deliberately depress the value of its currency to maintain large trade surpluses in the last decade they did not acknowledge china s currency management at the time it is wrong to claim that china is not now acting to keep down the value of the yuan while it is no longer buying large amounts of dollars and other currencies it holds a stock of more than 3 trillion in reserves which is well over 4 trillion if we add in its sovereign wealth fund this huge stock of foreign assets has the effect of depressing the value of the yuan against the dollar in the same way that the fed s holding of more than 3 trillion is assets helps to keep down interest rates while few economists question that the fed s holding of assets leads to lower long term rates than would otherwise be the case they seem to deny that china s holding of a large stock of foreign assets has similar effects in currency markets for those of who like their economics to be consistent this doesn t make sense if china held a more normal amount of reserves for an economy of its size e g 1 trillion the yuan would be considerably higher against the dollar which would reduce its trade surplus and possibly lead the country to run a deficit again for fans of consistent economics we should actually expect a fast growing country like china to be running a trade deficit that is what economists usually teach capital flows from slow growing countries to fast growing countries which means the latter run trade deficits as far as what could be negotiated with china given that trump wants them to totally change the way they run their economy a demand that they increase the value of their currency over time hardly seems like beyond the bounds of reason surely china s economy could adjust to a 20 30 percent appreciation of its currency over a two to three year time horizon there actually is a very good precedent for this in the plaza accord in 1985 ronald reagan s treasury secretary james baker negotiated a gradual decline in the value of the dollar against the currencies of major trading partners at the time this worked out almost exactly as planned the dollar had an orderly decline of close to 30 percent between 1985 and 1989 the trade deficit which had been 3 0 percent and rising fell to roughly 1 0 percent of gdp in 1990 even before the onset of the recession undoubtedly it would take some hard bargaining with china and other trading partners to get a similar sort of agreement today we would also have to make concessions like perhaps telling china we don t especially care whether they require technology transfers from boeing and other countries who outsource production there we have to recognize first and foremost that trade policy is not a simple story of one nation against others it is about which interests in each country gets favored a policy designed to reduce the trade deficit by lowering the value of the dollar as elizabeth warren has proposed is a policy that is likely to help u s workers by increasing total employment and the number of relatively well paying manufacturing jobs the trade policy pursued by trump and his predecessors is about redistributing more income upward in that respect it has been very successful addendum i should also mention the concern raised in these pieces about the dollar losing its status as the world s reserve currency this concern is completely misplaced the dollar is not the reserve currency it is a reserve currency among many it is certainly the predominant reserve currency accounting for more than 60 percent of central banks reserve holdings but euros yen british pounds and even swiss francs are held as reserve currencies also it could well be the case that central banks may move away from dollars so that they account for a smaller share of reserve holdings but it s hard to see any grave consequences from this outcome as long as the united states has a strong economy with inflation under control foreigners will be happy to accept and hold dollars whether it accounts for 60 percent or 30 percent of world reserve holdings does not change this

said at a financial forum in shanghai despite a slew of support measures and policy easing since last year china s cooling economy is still struggling to get back on firm footing and last month s sudden escalation in u s sino tensions has raised fears of a full blown trade war that could trigger a global recession liu s comments came a day after data showed china s credit growth was weaker than expected in may reinforcing market expectations that more monetary easing is needed factory activity contracted in may and imports fell the most in nearly three years highlighting soft demand at

more aggressive measures due to concerns that such a move could risk adding a mountain of debt leftover from past stimulus sprees sources told reuters in february that the pboc considered a benchmark rate cut a last resort but some analysts now think one or more cuts are likely if the trade dispute spirals out of control and the u s federal reserve starts cutting its rates giving the pboc more room to manoeuvre some analysts believe the chances of a trade deal are receding with both sides showing signs of digging in but u s president donald trump has said he plans to meet his chinese counterpart xi jinping at a g20 summit later this month currency risks more forceful easing could also trigger capital outflows and add pressure on the chinese yuan advertisement the yuan has fallen

china may be an odd choice for investors seeking shelter from a sino us trade war yet money managers in asia are pouring funds into chinese stocks as the long term promise of a growing middle class trumps more immediate fears about tariffs it is also a vote of confidence in beijing s aggressive policy response to a festering sino us trade standoff which has hurt its economy unsettled world financial markets and triggered fears of a global recession the anxiety has forced investors into defensive holdings such as the safe haven yen gold and us treasuries paradoxically for china the rising us import barriers have an upside as they inject impetus to the shift in its economy from an investment driven growth model towards one led by consumption and services and the nation s 400 million plus growing middle class provides a major attraction for fund managers owning domestic focused names in china has been successful in 2019 even with all the noise around trade tension weakening macro and the magic 7 level for the renminbi said sat duhra a portfolio manager for janus henderson investors asia ex japan equities strategy names in the sportswear and beverage sectors have performed well as trade issues have not impacted them and their strong branding and high margins have attracted investors looking for less cyclical and global trade exposure mr duhra said domestic consumption already drives just over 75 per cent of china s annual economic output in an effort to revive its us 14 trillion economy china has pumped cash into banks fast tracked infrastructure spending and rolled out tax cuts worth trillions of yuan to support consumers and businesses and it has said it could do more local governments have chipped in guangdong province last month rolled out 29 measures to boost consumption including relaxing restrictions on auto purchases safe boring defensive consumer shares have been relatively unscathed even as escalating trade tensions wiped out 11 per cent of the main shanghai stock market since mid april though the market is still up 17 per cent year to date the chinese consumer staples index has jumped almost 50 per cent so far this year whereas its information technology companies index has climbed over 24 per cent tracking the rise in the benchmark csi300 index csi300 has risen 22 per cent in the same period outpacing the 6 per cent gains in the msci asia ex japan index and the 15 per cent rally in the s p 500 hot pot condiment maker yihai international for instance is already up more than 100 per cent this year after sky rocketing 155 per cent in 2018 shanghai listed tsingtao brewery has risen over 30 per cent and foshan haitan flavouring and food co has surged 51 per cent we don t think the trade war will have much impact on the chinese consumption space said robert mann a singapore based portfolio manager at nikko asset management who sees opportunities in china s service sector more of what china is doing is helping consumption so that s one place to hide khiem do head of greater china investments at barings also expects the safe boring and defensive high yielding stocks from consumer staples to utilities to continue to outperform in china pimco which has us 1 76 trillion in assets under management as of march 2019 is betting on us treasuries and australian government bonds to take cover if the world slides into recession but also sees opportunities in chinese debt said its co head of asia pacific portfolio management robert mead powder dry none of the fund managers had recession as their base case scenario although most saw downside risks to growth and possibility the federal reserve would ease policy an outcome that could hurt the us dollar and ultimately benefit asian markets the futures markets currently hint at nearly 100 basis points of rate cuts in the united states by september 2020 fund managers were also wary of a worse than expected chinese slowdown or disruptions in global trade that would pose risks to the entire region which is why many of them were also squirreling away some money into markets such as indonesia and india nations less exposed to the vagaries of global trade for dwyfor evans head of apac macro strategy at state street global markets south asia is the sweet spot as things get gloomy globally the problem for north asia is that they are so beholden to global conditions that s less of an issue for india or indonesia because they are less demand driven mr evans said both these countries recently re elected their leaders paving the way for long expected economic reforms india could additionally get a lift from lower oil prices in the event of a global recession for some though just sitting tight was the ideal approach for now keeping our powder dry and being alert to future opportunities seems the best strategy said mark schofield citi s managing director for global strategy which has a modest overweight for asia focussed em equities reuters

reinforcing market expectations that more monetary easing is needed factory activity contracted in may and imports fell the most in nearly three years highlighting soft demand at present we do have

small and private companies it has now cut rrr times six since early 2018 and has also guided short term interest rates lower unlike previous downturns however the central bank has been reluctant to cut benchmark interest rates so far analysts believe it has held off on more aggressive measures due to concerns that such a move could risk adding a mountain of debt leftover from past stimulus sprees sources told reuters in february that the pboc considered a benchmark rate cut a last resort but some analysts now think one or more cuts are likely if the trade dispute spirals out of control and the us federal reserve starts cutting its rates giving the pboc more room to manoeuvre some analysts believe the chances of a trade deal are receding with both sides showing signs of digging in

costs he sees the u s emerging as one of the most attractive places in the world for investment particularly new greenfield investment among foreign investors the golden era for multinationals is over now what for decades the world was their oyster china s opening to the west in 1979 the collapse of communism in 1989 sweeping economic reforms in india in 1991 the creation of the european single market in 1992 the passage of the north america free trade agreement in 1994 the european union enlargement to 28 member states earlier this century all of these seminal events helped forge a golden era for u s multinationals so did the spread of globalization or unfettered cross border flows of capital goods ideas people and data which knitted more and more nations into the fabric of the global economy giving multinationals access to more resources more workers and more consumers one key upshot rising earnings from abroad with rest of world profits of american firms rising by over 250 since the start of the century or 6 9 annualized falling transportation and communication costs also helped to grease the wheels of global commerce allowing u s firms to operate virtually any place in the world with american firms in the forefront global foreign direct investment outflows have soared over the past few decades rising from an annual average of just 47 billion over 1980 85 to an estimated 1 2 trillion last year the more the investment the more the trade with global trade regularly outpacing the rate of global growth for decades in turn the combination of rising trade and investment has meant thicker and more complicated global supply chains and the rise of foreign affiliates as the main conduit for global commerce think of the latter as foot soldiers of globalization they are at the core of any global supply chain and key cogs in the financial success of any multinational they are also the bedrock of the global economy according to the latest figures from the united nations the total assets of all foreign affiliates in the world topped a staggering 100 trillion in 2017 with total affiliate output value added in excess of 7 3 trillion a figure well in excess of the aggregate output of the world s largest economies save china and the u s affiliates employed over 73 million workers worldwide in 2017 while sales of affiliates were nearly 31 trillion affiliate sales were some 34 larger than global exports of goods and services in 2017 and accounted for roughly 38 of world gdp versus 29 for global exports exhibit 1 underscoring the importance of foreign affiliates to u s multinationals sales of affiliates totaled an estimated 6 9 trillion in 2018 almost three times larger than u s exports with more than 37 000 foreign affiliates scattered around the world from albania to zimbabwe u s multinationals have been at the forefront of the golden era of globalization building out some of the most extensive and thickest supply chains in the world to their competitive advantage as a real world example of a global supply chain in this case boeing take a look at exhibit 2 which underscores the complexity and global scale of building assembling an aircraft however given all of the above times are changing the days of u s multinationals being largely unbound are over the tide of globalization is in retreat to the disadvantage of many firms operating outside their own borders nationalism and populism are on the rise around the world rather than being seamless the world is becoming balkanized or fragmented which is another way of saying that the golden era for multinationals is history the past won t be the prologue so what now it s a new world for multinationals forty years of declining tariffs and non tariff barriers and relatively open borders that allowed companies to disaggregate production around the world is reversing the pendulum is swinging back toward protectionism populism and nationalism all of which are inimical to globalization and existing global supply chains of multinationals escalating trade tensions between the u s and china in addition to friction with mexico india and europe not only portend weaker global growth and added market volatility near term but also a long term rethink among multinationals on how to do business on a global scale complex multinational supply chains are under review and are likely to be gradually unwound in the years ahead where for the past four decades global manufacturing operations of firms were geographically diffuse with plants spread across borders and reliant on a network of international suppliers future operations will be more local and regional in scope think less offshoring of production and a movement to re shore or near shore that is for u s firms to perform more of their manufacturing closer to home a la tijuana mexico or toledo ohio given the ongoing spat with mexico the latter looks more attractive the u s is hardly the cheapest place in the world to manufacture but higher relative u s labor costs will be offset by increased automation greater supply chain mobility lower shipping costs and very competitive energy costs thanks to the american energy renaissance add in tax reform and other government incentives like job training credits and favorable treatment of capex spending in addition to a large and wealthy consumer market and the u s emerges as one of the most attractive places in the world for investment as a footnote and as we recently highlighted the u s ranked first in terms of new greenfield investment among foreign investors in 2018 who wins one of the main beneficiaries around the rethink and reconfiguration of global supply chains will be automation in our opinion or advanced robotics artificial intelligence additive manufacturing 3 d printing digital platforms and related activities geared towards the ability to suppress costs boost margins and nimbly reach more demanding consumers yes lower cost locales like vietnam cambodia and perhaps mexico will see a rise in foreign direct investment but the attractiveness of these nations will be offset by the rapid adoption of robotics and related activities the next advancements in 3 d printing and the growing penchant among multinationals to shorten and simplify their global supply chains and build where they sell u s firms bringing their supply chain closer to home will allow them to better serve the end consumer in two main ways the first is simply by granting them more flexibility to respond to new orders and to reduce delivery times but second and perhaps more important is by improving their product offering via better integrated research development r d housing manufacturing alongside core activities such as design marketing and product development the argument goes should help to spur innovation increasing responsiveness to shifts in consumer preferences and boosting competitiveness and profitability in the process among sectors robotic manufacturers should stand to gain as global robotic penetration accelerates not only in the u s and the developed nations but also in the emerging world notably china the mainland is already one of the largest users in the world of robots and will maintain this position as it adopts to the new world order in trade and rising wage costs at home although the u s capex cycle has recently lost momentum exhibit 3 we believe that demand for robotics and ai data driven production processes among multinationals is a secular trend that should help boost investments in capital equipment and intellectual property products i e software r d spending over the long run this shift toward more automated manufacturing provides an important buying opportunity for long term investors considering

file photo introduction is there a certified financial crisis in the ghanaian banking industry we say yes the financial crisis in the ghanaian banking industry has risen as a result of the rampant fold ups merger and acquisitions occurring in the industry this has reduced the financial confidence of customers there have been several factors speculated as the cause of the crisis in the ghanaian financial system africa centre for entrepreneurship and youth empowerment argue that the higher level of information systems in the operations of the financial sector is a tacit factor contributing to the financial crisis an elaborate research was conducted to justify this argument aceye conducted this research to also examine the state of the ghanaian financial system this article expounds on the discovery made in the research the ghanaian banking industry the financial sector in 2012 experienced some changes in the competitive environment due to some major mergers and acquisitions notable ones include access bank ghana acquiring intercontinental bank of ghana with a market share of 3 20 adding to the 1 20 of access bank ecobank ghana with a market of 9 00 acquired the trust bank limited whose market share was 2 80 the growth of the sector was attributed to the discovery of oil in the nation given the rise in ghana s annual gdp growth rates from 2009 to 2011 according to professor obuobi the most essential factors that are changing the industry include development in information technology and the deregulation of the financial services at national and regional levels and globalization given the already aggressive nature of the banking industry in ghana and the fact that most banks in ghana are trying to increase their market share by implementing winning marketing strategies the banks are adopting innovations in information technology to improve their operations cut down costs attract new customers maintain old customers and to stay competitive amongst other benefits of information technology the use of the concepts techniques policies and implementation strategies of information and communication technology has become fundamentally important and a greater concern for all banks even the micro financial institutions because it has become a requirement for survival in the industry and a prerequisite to attaining local and global competitiveness how a financial system operates bhaduri 2011 indicated that the financial system facilitates trade and asset acquisition from the macroeconomic perspective the wellbeing of a country s economy depends greatly on the financial system nevertheless the financial system operates on a network of mutual confidence since the financial system deals with derivatives such as swaps options and futures which carry higher level of uncertainties due to the higher level of uncertainties in the operations of the financial system consumers bankers enter into contract with them based on the confidence that the banks will be able to raise the future price of assets the danger with the financial system and the higher intensity of ict adoption is that consumers confidence drop when their divergent expectations are not met a prior study conducted by reinhart and rogoff 2008 revealed that a drop in confidence of consumers has a detrimental potency on financial systems in general reinhart and rogoff 2008 narrated cases of prior financial crisis where the financial confidence of consumers had heightened to the peak and the consumers were at the stage of cacoethes and unexpectedly the financial system collapsed and created panic among consumers this is a plebeian incident that happens in both developed and developing economies the situation was expected to be better due to the adoption of information system and other complex technologies in the financial system this study conducted has really shown that the adoption of information systems technology and other management information systems has rather heightened the possibility of financial crisis in the banking industry that is not to debunk that information technology is not essential in the banking industry these developments in technological innovations have enabled banks to create service innovations for the banking industry according to mashhour zaatreh 2008 most of the new banking innovative strategies are as a result of either new or enhanced banking information systems some of the prominent innovations in the banking sector including electronic or internet banking e banking debit and credit cards automated teller machines atm and so on advances in the internet technology have had a big impact on business operations and have brought about a paradigm shift especially in the operations of banks what financial practitioners and industrial researchers have failed to consider and give more attention is the fact that the higher level of information systems adoption in the banking industry creates higher level of confidence in consumers as stated by rogoff and reinhart 2008 therefore a venial failure in the information system drops down the confidence of consumers to the barest minimum what appears to be a menial crisis is compounded by the reactions of consumers to become a grave crisis this research identified the plausible explanation to this phenomenon happening specifically in the ghanaian financial industry the study drew on the financial crisis theory by minsky to explain the reasons why information technology has increased the potency of financial crisis in the ghanaian banking industry is merger and acquisition really the problem merger and acquisition has been a practice in the business environment for a period of time the concept of merger and acquisition has been a significant practice that incenses economic growth a merger is a combination of two or more corporations in which only one new corporation comes to existence and the individual corporations that have merged go extinct acquisition on the other hand occurs when a corporation takes over the controlling ownership interest of another corporation a legal subsidiary of a corporation or some selected assets of the firm scott 2003 the terms are usually put together as merger and acquisition because the end result of each process is that corporations which initially had separate ownership now come under one ownership transforming a small business into a big one or a big business into an even bigger one essentially occurs in one of two ways companies can grow their revenues and profits from within by cultivating and growing demand for their products and services this strategy known as organic growth requires patience but pays big dividends when executed successfully a riskier way that companies can grow is through a merger and acquisition m a strategy an m a strategy can create synergies when companies with complementary products services and missions unite however it can also create tensions and failures when corporate cultures clash or the acquirer fails to successfully integrate the acquired company s assets systems and brands some corporate unions fail to create synergies and thereby destroy shareholder value mergers and acquisitions are more common than ever in today s business climate chances are if a firm haven t gone through some sort of integration it may integrate with another firm sometime to come yet studies show that many if not most mergers are doomed to fail the failures result in poor shareholder results layoffs and in some cases a complete dissolution of the merger one of the reasons why mergers and acquisitions fail is because the top management do not first of all enter into the merger and acquisition with the right motive moreover there is not much preparation prior to the entry of the merger and acquisition arrangement the first to be done is to understand the culture and strategies of the individual firms involved in the merger and acquisition arrangement there should be so much communication among the management of all the individual firms involved in the merger and acquisition furthermore the cultures of the firms must be integrated in a prearranged administrative process before the merger and acquisition deal takes off one approach toward improving the probability of successful is integration focuses on alignment of firm and is level integration strategies there are so many instances where mergers and acquisitions have failed due to the lack of proper planning prior to the merger and acquisition deal a typical example is the daimler and chrysler merger case when german daimler the makers of mercedes benz merged with american company chrysler in the late 1990s it was called a merger of equals a few years later it was being called a fiasco meaning a disastrous or embarrassing failure discordant company cultures had the two divisions at war as soon as they merged differences between the companies included their level of formality philosophy on issues such as pay and expenses and operating styles the german culture became dominant and employee satisfaction levels at chrysler dropped off the map one unhappy joke circulating at chrysler at the time was how do you pronounce daimlerchrysler daimler the chrysler is silent by 2000 major losses were projected and a year later layoffs began in 2007 daimler sold chrysler to cerberus capital management for 6 billion this is the point where the bank of ghana and the ghanaian financial system at large is failing hardly would the public know the laid down strategies for a merger and acquisition it always appears as a surprise on the customers of the institutions the strategic plan including all stakeholders must be mapped for the firms merging to come to a unified strategy for instance the recently consolidated bank consolidated bank of ghana has to operate on an interoperability platform and customers have challenges withdrawing their money due to the challenges with the interoperability network customers on the various banks cannot withdraw cash from atms of other banks within the consolidated bank and if even possible the customer is charged a fee as if the transaction was with a third party bank these are the same situations that occur in the various mergers and acquisitions that occur in the ghanaian financial system the problem therefore is not necessarily with the merger and acquisition as explained earlier merger and acquisition is a very risky growth strategy and as such requires adequate preparation and integration to succeed the lack of adequate planning preparation and integration of the mergers and acquisitions in the ghanaian financial system is one of the ravaging factors driving the system into crisis overview of incidences in the ghanaian banking industry gcb assumes ut bank and capital bank within three years 2016 to 2019 several banks in ghana were folded up acquired or merged with other banks because they were facing financial crisis gcb was rated behind ut bank as the riskiest indigenous ghanaian banks listed on the stock exchange in 2016 it looks so surprising and paradoxical to have gcb take over the unique trust ut bank the 2016 assessment of the indigenous banks showed that per the rate of growth in the banks gcb was riskier than ut bank nevertheless the capital base of gcb bank which appeared quite substantial over ut bank allowed gcb bank to take over ut bank in the prospect of shareholder returns ut bank was ahead of gcb bank following the progressive trend of gcb gcb struggled for survival in 2007 and underwent recapitalization to raise ghc45 000 additional capital in 2007 before the devaluation of the ghanaian cedi gcb was struggling for survival due to stunt growth shares were floated to raise additional capital and the bank was re branded the name was changed from ghana commercial bank to gcb bank and the logo was changed from the eagle on a star to the interlocked eagle one of the drawbacks of the gcb was its long queues and longer waiting times gcb has been identified over the years for overcrowding and protracted queues at most of its branches one of the notable causes of the long queue and overcrowding was the experience of frequent network failures the breakdown of the network slowed down the speed of services provided by the bank this was also an aspect that the banks taken over by gcb outcompeted it a review of the interest payout on deposits revealed that the gcb bank had relatively low interest payout on deposits compared to the firms it took over in the first quarter of 2017 just before the announcement of the assumption gcb s average interest on deposit was 9 3 whiles capital bank s ai was 13 5 and ut s ai was 12 the strongest area of operation that gcb had outcompeted all the firms in the banking industry was the e zwich services gcb was awarded as the active e zwich bank for three consecutive years this success is yet to be investigated but that could be because of the compulsory payout of national service allowance through the e zwich platform another stronghold of the gcb bank was its timely delivery of information considering its position as a bank having a part state ownership it stood to be more accountable to the citizenry than the various private sector owned banks possibly this has translated into its services to stay highly accountable to its customers gcb hooked unto the mobile banking i e mobile money transfer to account in november 2016 according to business world 2016 this appears to be a late adoption because the private firms assumed by gcb were hooked unto the platform in 2011 ut bank was awarded the best in sme banking the core focus of the ut bank was on small and medium enterprises therefore most of its products were geared towards the development of the smes in ghana ut bank offered mortgage facilities to smes and individual customers as well one of the innovative products sold by ut bank was the ut car imports designed through a web based system the ut bank developed an online platform where foreign car sellers were hooked on and the customers of the bank who wanted to import cars could also be hooked unto the platform and then ut bank mediated the transaction and ensured the smooth transfer of funds and ownership title this was a unique product which made use of the different wings of the ut group this product was introduced in march 2011 gcb bank has no such product considering the uniqueness of this product what is the implication to the gcb bank will they continue to adopt this is strategy or they will discard it entirely ut bank started in 1997 as a financial house named as unique trust financial services the financial services purchased a former bank called bpi bank in june 2010 and got listed on the gse as ut bank 6 years later it has gown down the drain ghanatrade 2017 what possibly could have gone wrong for a firm which was strong enough to take over another firm to go down the drain in just six years this shows that a merger and acquisition in itself does not mean success several other factors come to play for a purchase and assumption to yield success to the acquiring firm capital bank was established as savings and loans in 2009 and attained a license to operate as a bank in 2013 three years after that it has gown down the drain capital bank positioned itself to timely and relevant financial solution to the sme market looking at capital bank and ut bank it is clear that these banks positioned themselves in the market of sme banking that has been their competitive edge and it is not so for the assuming firm gcb therefore the challenge of aligning strategies can be a critical in the success of the acquisition failure to deal effectively with the alignment issues can cause a problem to gcb sometime to come an effective management of the alignment of the various strategies can also yield success in august 2016 capital bank was awarded as the best growing bank the best bank in household retail banking and the best bank in savings and deposits in october 2013 capital bank was awarded the 10th best performing company for the year 2012 and the best in the non bank financial institutions sector at the ghana club 100 awards organized by the ghana investment promotion center this shows that the capital bank had a good growth prospect however there had been some internal challenges that could not be dealt with and this has caused the fall of capital bank royal bank unibank beige bank sovereign bank and construction bank merger in march 2018 the bank of ghana the central bank announced the collapse of five banks priorto the collapse of these banks data was gathered by aceye on the information technology used by the royal bank the royal bank was established in august 2012 as a fully ghanaian owned bank with a capital base of fifty one million u s dollars according to b ft 2018 the bank performed extremely well in its first three years of operation and grew its loan book by 322 percent in the third year the bank s loan book underperformed and struggled to meet the bank of ghana s prudential ratios the central bank bank of ghana made an asset quality review on the royal bank and recommended that the bank impair its capital b ft 2018 the royal bank was granted liquidity support of two hundred million ghana cedis in 2016 by the bank of ghana eventually the banks performance advanced and in 2017 made a quarter repayment of the liquidity support given by the central bank according to business and financial times 2018 the royal bank suffered with liquidity issues due to higher amount of loan granted to finatrade finatrade borrowed one billion ghana cedis ghc1 000 000 000 from twenty six banks even though the total stated capital of the ghanaian banking industry was ghc 2 6 billion according to frimpong 2016 the royal bank was a victim which explains why it faced liquidity issues in 2015 however in 2017 its performance had improved significantly according to the business and financial times 2018 the collapse of ut bank and capital bank had a greater toll on the royal bank customers lost confidence in the financial system according to allotey 2018 there were very few deposits and several withdrawals from customers coupled with the central banks capital requirement of ghc 400 million the royal bank declined in its performance and by the end of 2018 it was declared as insolvent construction bank had an ill fate because it started in 2017 when ut bank and capital bank had collapsed and the confidence of consumers had dropped therefore the bank struggled with liquidity right from its inception the confidence of consumers in the financial system had dropped and so the priodos start for construction bank was wrong that is why it could not succeed confidence of consumers had dropped therefore the bank struggled with liquidity right from its inception the financial crisis theory explains ghana s financial crisis the phenomena happening in the ghanaian banking industry were passed through the lens of the financial crisis theory to examine whether the ghanaian financial system is in crisis minsky s financial instability theory is used to explain the phenomena occurring in the ghanaian financial sector according to minsky s financial instability theory every economy has some financial regimes under which it is stable and some financial regimes under which it is unstable and then also in periods of prosperity the economy can move from the stable financing regimes to unstable financing regimes in minsky s 1986 theory he asserted that a financial system is stable and robust when moderate changes in cash flows capitalization rate and payment commitments does not suppress its ability of the units in the financial system to meet their commitments on the other hand an economy is fragile when small changes in the cash flows capitalization rate and payment commitments have damaging effects such that the units within the financial system are not able to meet their financial commitments passing the happenings in the ghanaian financial system through the theory proves that the ghanaian financial system is a fragile one the bases for this conclusion are these 1 the ut bank and capital bank were performing well but the failure of some borrowers to make payment resulted in their bankruptcy 2 the collapse of the ut bank and capital bank resulted in a huge drop in the capital base of the financial system due to less deposits and higher withdrawals 3 the change in capital requirement by the bank of ghana resulted in the collapse of over 20 banks minsky s theory posits that when the hedge units against the speculative and ponzi schemes are relatively less then the financial system is more prone to fragility developing on the theory it is explained that in the first phase it is assumed that the economy goes through crisis and the speculative units are used up to run the economy lenders and borrowers become more conservative when they go through the crisis lenders would give out their funds to the financial units when they are offered higher margins of safety borrowers also become pessimistic in the prospect of their businesses and perceive that they need higher margin of safety in order not to borrow and run at a loss at this stage investment and profits though low are very stable because of this natural occurrence leading to stability the consumers eventually gain higher confidence in the financial system borrowers become optimistic in their profit making and begin to accept lower margin of safety at this point profit is maximized due to the stability lenders also begin to give out funds at a lower margin of safety judging from the profit records of borrowers having the expectations that profit will increase more and they will be in a good position to pay back the funds lent out the financial sector moves to a boom then the second phase appears in the second phase the boom becomes a bust because of borrowers increase in profitability and access to lower rate funds there is increased demand for finance for investment projects dertzer and herr 2014 stated that as long as the supply curve for finance is infinitely elastic this circumstance does not lead to increase in the interest rate the pro founder of the theory minsky explained in the theory that this statement holds true when at this stage the financial system is loaded with financial innovations or the central bank is willing to supply further reserves to banks nevertheless bottlenecks in the financial system and external pressures such as inflation and exchange rate forces the central bank to increase interest rate then the downturn begins this is where this study took a critical look at the role of management information system in the fragility of the ghanaian financial system drawing from the theory it can be explained that during the boom session banks invest in management information system that boosts the confidence of the borrowers and lenders in the financial system in essence the management information system creates extra confidence in consumers which leads to a much detrimental impact on them during the downturn information technology and the consumer confidence cycle dr mohammed explained on modernghana com that ponzi banks are banks that increase debt to pay debt their case is like the case of mansa who borrowed 10ghc from kojo at 10 per cent interest unable to pay back kojo mansa borrows 11ghc 10gch loan plus 1ghc interest from salifu to pay kojo now mansa owes salifu 11ghc and when the time is up for mansa to pay salifu again unable to pay mansa borrows 11ghc at 10 per cent interest from segbefio to pay salifu and now mansa s loan increases to 12 1ghc what s interesting is that mansa doesn t know when she will ever find the money from her own business to pay back the loans she owes and so continues borrowing from one person to pay the other until she can t borrow anymore and finally declares bankruptcy as it stands now the plight of many banks in ghana are analogous to the plight of mansa this in so many ways explain why several banks in ghana are collapsing this operation is a back office operation which may not be open to the consumer populace africa center for entrepreneurship conducted a case study at the royal bank to investigate how information technology modulate financial confidence in consumers a study was conducted in the royal bank between january 2017 to april 2017 after a careful study of the history of the royal bank the royal bank received the new era award for technology innovation and quality at an awards ceremony held in june 2014 in rome italy by the association ofotherways management consulting firm it was also declared the best bank in bank growth at the 13th ghana banking awards the bank was also declared a top emerging brand at the ghana super brands awards in december 2014 this informed aceye to choose the riyal bank for this particular research from the research conducted it was identified that the lenders and borrowers of the bank had much confidence in the ghanaian financial system and as such they were willing to transact with the banking industry to the highest level for instance some customers had left their previous banks to the royal bank because they wanted a more advanced information technology that will enhance their banking experience if customers left one bank to another for technological reasons then it implies that the customers have higher confidence in their new bank s technology than their previous bank s technology it implies that the royal bank and the banking industry in general attracted customers because of the increasing level of information technology in other words the more advanced the information technology used by a bank the more the confidence level of its customers what was discovered subsequent to the research conducted was that whiles the customers had built their confidence level to a peak and were expecting some advanced form of information technology the financial system started having a downturn the sudden collapse of ut bank and capital bank which were bigger banks and well known as highly advanced in information system and performance was an indicator that the financial system was fragile therefore the lenders and borrowers were hit hard by the sudden downturn according to minsky s financial crisis theory the borrowers were not ready to borrow unless offered a higher margin of safety and lenders were not willing to lend unless offered a higher margin of safety because the financial system was unstable the bank could not rely much on its reserve and speculative units to meet its financial commitments thus the change in cash flows coupled with the change in capital requirement had a detrimental effect on the bank eventually the bank had to be declared illiquid and consolidated the consolidation of the five banks and the recent collapse of some micro finance institutions further unstabilize the financial system and reduces the confidence of consumers further contrary to the bank of ghana s statement that these happenings will strengthen the ghanaian financial system the research conducted shows that with the level of technology in the financial system these happenings are rather weakening the ghanaian financial system and gradually heightening the financial crisis of ghana the consumer confidence level curve and ghana s financial system figure 1 shows the rise and fall in the confidence level of customers in the ghanaian financial system and the level of fragility of the system in an unstable economic period the fragility of the financial system is less yet the confidence level of customers is low when the economy becomes stable the confidence level begins to rise from level one to level two and the fragility of the financial system increases at this period the higher adoption of information systems increases the confidence level of customers further from level 2 to level 3 and the financial system becomes more fragile external factors cause changes in capital requirement cash flows and payment commitments and the banks begin to struggle with the payment of their obligations and commitments eventually the confidence of customers falls drastically from level 3 to level 1 just as a fall from a higher height has greater impact than a lower height so is the fall in the confidence level from a higher level to a lower level considering the fragility of the ghanaian financial system it takes long for the system to recover from the fall figure 1 consumer confidence curve source aceye s model in light of the discovery made it makes sense to argue that the raising of the capital requirement affected the ghanaian owned and local banks more than the multinational banks the research explains from the financial crisis theory that the local banks rested and still rest solely on the fragile ghanaian financial system whiles the multinational banks had and continue to have rest on less fragile financial system due to their reliance on other stable economies in other words during the unstable economic period in ghana international banks are able to meet their commitments from the reserves in other stable economies whiles the local banks have no reserves to fall on the study therefore concludes that 1 the ghanaian financial system is fragile and it hold s true for most developing economies 2 the financial system suffers greatly when the confidence level of customers falls significantly 3 information technology raises the confidence level of customers borrowers and lenders such that there is a greater fall in times of instability in the economy 4 higher information technology adoption in a fragile financial system as ghana s indirectly contributes to the financial crisis of the financial system conclusion the research was grounded on minsky s financial crisis theory to show that the ghanaian financial system is a fragile one as it is with every economy the ghanaian economy transits from stability to instability at various points in time whether the economy is stable or unstable its fragile nature presents some peculiar consequences because of the fragile nature of the ghanaian financial system it suffers detrimental effects at any point in time when the economy is unstable aceye s research has shown that at the period when the economy is stable and the financial system increases its information technology level the confidence of lenders and borrowers is raised very high when the economy transits to its instability period the confidence drops greatly and the financial system suffers devastating crisis source africa centre for entrepreneurship and youth empowerment aceye website www aceye org email

by s g vombatkere in the years immediately preceding world war ii winston churchill is quoted as having said the era of procrastination of half measures of soothing expedients of delays is coming to its close in its place we are entering a period of consequences world war ii purported to be a war to end all wars ended in 1945 after usa dropped two nuclear bombs on japan it did not end wars but it did have huge consequences evidence of which is unfolding even today perhaps the greatest single consequence is the combination of growth of money and banking systems rampant exploitation of natural resources and the parallel growth of production consumption pollution of all sorts this is turn has spawned environmental and ecological consequences at planetary scale with accompanying existential threats finance debt economic growth inequality a major fallout of world war ii was the formation in july 1944 of the bretton woods institutions the international monetary fund imf the international bank of reconstruction and development ibrd and the general agreement on tariff trade gatt they created the financial order of the post war world and defined the rules boundaries and goal posts of financial and economic cooperation after reconstruction of war devastated europe ibrd morphed into the world bank group which turned its attention to third world countries in 1995 wto replaced gatt the imf wb wto triad became the world s largest generator and provider of knowledge the fountain head of economic reform policies and programs they prescribed economic reforms founded on the centrality of economic growth as measured principally by the rate of growth of gdp this ideology for economic progress was taught in all major us and european and later in third world universities and created a multitude of indoctrinated economists of all nationalities who educated trained and advised the leaders and the elite of third world countries this ideology of economic growth on a corporate market consumer basis is neo liberalism promoted annually at the davos jamboree the bretton woods international financial institutions ifis were joined by banks like asian development bank and african development bank and ifis from japan and european countries even lower tier ifi executives had access to the top most echelons of governments hence ifis became the source of finance for development projects in the third world and also enablers for preparing project proposals and appointing consultants to educate and advise corruptible third world leaders to apply for and receive loans and solicit foreign investments thus banker driven debt economies expanded economic growth as the measure of national progress became the focus of economic thinking and was institutionalized in countries across the globe with impetus imparted and momentum maintained using the political economic clout of imf wb and other ifis it was accepted worldwide because it suited the elite politician bureaucrat corporate nexus or pbc sometimes referred to as the deep state which has behind the screen control of governments of all countries admittedly much of the knowledge and the finance provided for projects resulted in creation of infrastructural and other assets in third world countries but most of the accruing benefits went to economically better off sections of society with neglect of the poorer sections with grandiose plans for development calling for huge capital investments and loans from ifis available on pre condition of undertaking prescribed economic reforms many third world countries sank into debt some entered a debt trap when the outgo of interest on loans exceeded the revenue from projects plus export earnings overall this resulted in growing economic inequality within and between societies in admission of this an internal study group of the international monetary fund imf reported in july 2016 that their decades long advocacy and practice of economic reforms had serious failings the report is titled neoliberalism oversold with the boldfaced sentence instead of delivering growth some neoliberal policies have increased inequality thereby jeopardizing durable expansion thomas piketty s 2013 incisive best seller capital in the twenty first century may possibly have triggered the imf admission need for a different economic model at a recent meeting of imf and wb efforts were made to play down fears of a slowing global economy due a deteriorating trade climate the key phrases are fears of a slowing global economy and deteriorating trade climate questions which arise are why should there be fear and who feels fear also questions are about what effect a deteriorating global trade climate stated to be principally about the economic conflict between usa and china may have on the majority of the 7 2 billion global human inhabitants since the talk is global let s view other global matters the global economy being the sum of the economies of the countries on the globe and the economy of a country being the sum of the economies of its constituent states or regions it follows that at the very root of the global economy lies the economy of every human household taking the argument down to the household is justified by the etymology of the word economy which is from the greek word oikonomia referring to household management and thrift with eight of the world s wealthiest persons owning as much wealth as the bottom 50 of humanity there appears huge justification for an alternative economic paradigm to replace the current one of unending year on year economic growth which has caused unjust and growing inequality within and between nations leading to political military economic confrontation between nations and social unrest within nations current economic model put simply even simplistically the current economic model is founded upon the need for growth of the national economy as a means to generate wealth gross domestic product gdp is a measure of total economic production representing the market value of all goods and services including personal consumption institutional purchases and sales and adding exports and subtracting imports gdp is generally accepted as a comprehensive yardstick to assess a nation s economic growth and its year on year growth indicates economic health the generation of wealth money precisely by economic growth accrues to the upper economic echelons and this is expected to trickle down to people who live if that s the right word in the lowest economic layers of society this has not happened in any country rather economic disparity has widened politics is slave to economics every government attempts to gain political advantage by claiming a higher gdp growth rate as demonstrative of better performance opposition political parties always attempt to play down government s performance by contesting these figures even left oriented economists question the validity of 7 gdp growth rate claimed by the bjp led nda 2 government but do not question the economic model thus economists across the political spectrum have been and are on the gdp growth rate bandwagon and routinely quarrel about figures of gdp growth rate questioning the computation methods or the validity of the statistical data used for computation there appears to be no understanding that the economic model has failed to reach economic benefit to people at the bottom of the socio economic heap of humanity political promises notwithstanding apart from the economic model generating economic disparity and social unrest it is unsustainable from other perspectives politics is driven by an economic model that cannot address the here and now economic needs of food shelter health education jobs of vast numbers hence elections and voting are a cruel charade a drama scripted by parties and persons across the political spectrum to distract attention from the real life economic miseries of the invisible millions with promises of good days in the future the key agenda must be to accelerate growth is an article by none less than former chairman of the economic advisory council to india s prime minister the title and content of which indicates the mindset elections change governments but the economic growth ideology remains and its implementation maintains momentum even accelerates politics remains slave to economics and the pbc nexus remains in control regardless of which political party or tall leader is in power economic growth existential threat continuous economic growth year upon year is growth compounded and the size of an economy growing at say 7 would double in ten years the energy demanded acquired and consumed to enable such economic growth would also approximately double former rbi governor c rangarajan said 2016 the potential to grow at 8 to 9 per cent at least for a decade exists we have to make it happen thus by 2026 with government s concerted effort the size of the economy the energy consumed and global warming gw gases emitted for such growth would have more than doubled for india alone at global level this worldwide energy mostly fossil fuel consumption year upon year which is integral to economic growth has resulted in atmospheric co 2 rising to 415 ppm a level not exceeded for the last 3 million years this is accelerating gw and climate change cc which are existential threats to all life forms the direct cause and effect relationship between economic growth and gw cc is undeniable maintaining corporate control india s new economic policy formulated in 1991 by then union finance minister dr manmohan singh was specifically about imf wb orchestrated economic reform including structural adjustment all based firmly upon unending economic growth nep 1991 was effectively furthered by the thousands of opinion policy and decision makers in governments and indian institutions of higher education who were trained in foreign universities and wb institutes these persons have had and continue to have easy access to and disproportionate influence in the corridors of power in central and state governments regardless of the political party in power such trained persons were and are in positions of power at various levels in various ministries and they promote the mind set of ideas policies proposals plans and projects to yield targetted rates of gdp growth so that india may progress this mind set has proposed and promoted capital and machine intensive mega projects which need to acquire land water and mineral resources for this state and or central governments with help from the deep state circumvent bypass or amend laws enacted to protect people or the environment from such projects but governments justify such projects by touting economic growth a sales pitch which has always satisfied all political persuasions on the ground challenges by affected populations to such projects are met with police action in favour of the corporations and against protestors litigation is difficult and expensive and out of reach of poor project affected people and in any case usually fail sometimes the affected populations merely demand that extant laws e g forest rights act panchayat extension to schedule areas act right to fair compensation transparency in land acquisition resettlement and rehabilitation act 2013 be implemented faithfully but governments usually win against the people and corporations have their way people s resistance to amendments to weaken such laws has even been labelled as naxal or maoist to criminalize legitimate protest and individuals who help generally illiterate people affected by the project are subjected to slapp or charged under draconian laws like uapa the message as to who is boss is unequivocal the same economic policy has gained momentum with successive governments and under the bjp led nda government starting 2014 its implementation has been intensified across sectors over the years successive governments have sent top ministers travelling along with corporate honchos to the annual world economic forum at davos to decide how to spur economic growth and how to defeat economic competitors even as they propose sdgs and negotiate carbon credits notwithstanding the wisdom brought home from davos is that worldwide economic growth is uncertain and growing economic inequality and climate change are worrying issues however questioning the economic growth paradigm is economic blasphemy economist dr rathin roy believes that india s rapid growth has been essentially powered by its top 100 million citizens the leading indicators of economic prosperity he says are things that these indians consume cars 2 wheelers air conditioners and so on having had their fill of home made goods they have now moved to imported luxuries foreign holidays and italian kitchens for example money generated by gdp growth is used for industrialized production of goods and services which depends upon extraction and consumption of free natural capital of resources like minerals fuel fresh water land this year on year unending gdp growth demands year on year increased consumption of natural capital while the production processes produce more and more pollution of land water and air unending consumption of goods and services is highly energy intensive and directly connected with energy use burning of fossil fuels principally oil it generates ghgs and increases gw however the only thing that economists appear to fear is a slowing global economy because the rate at which goods and services are purchased consumed is flagging corporate influence on economic policy has resulted in capital intensive mega projects designed to boost gdp growth which have countrywide and worldwide effects the reality of sustained public protests against these projects is a part of the worry brought home from davos still rather than addressing the causes of protests state and central governments influenced by the pbc nexus ignore rubbish or suppress them by police beatings or firings charging protestors with war against the state and sedition and jailing them under draconian laws or trumped up charges another method of the pbc nexus maintaining control is the creation of the revolving door by which key executives or scientists in industrial commercial corporations are manoevred into government administrative posts where they influence policy and seamlessly revert to the parent corporate sector after a tenure climate change on the one hand the ministry of environment forests moef has been re named with climate change cc added to its designation so now moef cc and on the other this same ministry is part of the pbc nexus to slacken environmental laws rules and regulations so as to enable extractive and manufacturing industries and the hospitality industry to expand into new regions and generate profits this increases gdp and boosts economic growth but it is oblivious to the resulting intensification of gw and cc it is learned that scientists retiring or leaving the moeff cc are not replaced by scientists but by bureaucrats who cannot apply scientific rigour to environmental problems but uncritically obey bureaucratic and political dictats making a joke of environmental protection in 2008 prime minister s council on climate change government of india issued a 56 page national action plan on climate change napcc it states emphasizing the overriding priority of maintaining high economic growth rates to raise living standards the plan identifies measures that promote our development objectives while also yielding co benefits for addressing climate change effectively and outlines eight missions and three programs for implementation napcc suffers from a fundamental conflict between the priority of maintaining high economic growth rates which do not raise living standards but increase economic disparity even while enhancing the ecological sustainability of india s development path as demonstrated below maintaining high economic growth rates raising gdp growth rates involves not merely higher consumption but growing rates of consumption of all sorts of goods and services this will raise demand and consumption of oil and inevitably result in increased ghg emissions and consequent increased gw promoting the present development objectives which are based upon economic growth actually defeat measures to reduce ghg emissions and reduce the intensity of the inevitable effects of climate change this is incompatible with yielding co benefits for addressing climate change effectively the present economic policy and cc are incompatible bed mates the former cannot sleep with the window open and the latter cannot sleep with the window closed trying to tackle cc while actually working to sustain rapid economic growth is as illogical as trying to mop a floor dry without turning off the tap the economic growth ideology is clearly unsustainable and inconsistencies in the overview principles and approach of napcc display a regrettable myopia in policy consequences the current economic model of endless year on year consumption driven production of goods and services taken at national or global level has serious downstream effects drawing endlessly on the natural capital of primary mineral and other finite resources for projects to boost economic growth inevitably depletes it in turn it adversely affects the forests rivers and lakes land and oceans the ecological capital which depletes as natural capital and ecological capital are depleted by projects designed for the production consumption treadmill there is inevitable effect on people through displacement and loss of livelihood which destroys or adversely modifies the social structure of communities and families creating social tensions and unrest peace in society is social capital since development of any sort can only be successful in a peaceful society but the sacrosanct economic growth paradigm results in loss of social capital and this is evidenced by the glaring growing economic suffering and social unrest in urban rural and forest areas the divergence between money growing exponentially due to year on year economic growth and energy availability remaining stagnant or reducing can result in collapse of the financial system ominous signs of which are manifesting in different ways yet economists of all political persuasions willing prisoners within their ivory tower of economic growth urge the government of the day to adopt urgent measures to increase consumption of goods and services and strive for ever higher growth world leaders are uncomprehending or ignorant of the cause and effect relationship between economic policies and gw and cc they are unable to relate obvious negative inter societal and intra societal consequences with economic growth policies being helpless in the stranglehold of the neo liberal pbc deep state gw and cc is a major consequence of the economic growth paradigm homo sapiens has brought itself along with a host of other species to the brink of a great extinction the way forward it is not difficult to understand that tackling cc threats is priority one among a list of worldwide socio political imperatives survival is not possible without protection preservation and conservation of natural resources and bio diversity for egalitarian provision of the basic needs of water food energy clothing shelter and health education welfare and employment for all emphasizing the word all this is notwithstanding that tackling cc faces strong opposition from the ruling us administration and ignorance indifference opposition among most other governments worldwide since they all represent the interests of their respective pbc nexus more than that of the people whom they represent defeating the entrenched ideology of economic growth involves organizing socio political initiatives to give primacy to sectors such as energy food water shelter jobs employment health and education perhaps the most prominent is a political initiative in usa called the green new deal which bring economics to heel in the larger interest of human societies the gnd will convert the old gray economy into a new sustainable economy that is environmentally sound economically viable and socially responsible it seeks to solve the climate crisis by combining quick action to get to net zero greenhouse gas emissions and 100 renewable energy by 2030 along with an economic bill of rights the gnd sets a target year and proposes the way forward to meet that target unlike the sdgs which actually encourage economic growth proposed at davos the gnd is practical clear headed and socially responsible and deserves the most urgent study in all societies for implementation leaders and opinion makers in societies need to acquire the practical wisdom to understand that climate change due to global warming is an existential threat to most living species and certainly to human societes the threat is growing not receding measures based on that understanding need implementation to mitigate the effects of climate change and find an easier transition to so called deep adaptation necessary for species survival solutions for mitigation and adaptation as a survival route for human societies clearly lies in rejecting the evil of unending economic growth and adopting non fossil fuel based technologies our lives and the lives of future generations depend on it s g vombatkere was commissioned as an officer into the corps of engineers madras sappers in 1962 in 1994 president of india awarded him the visishta seva medal vsm for

expected to maintain its three month libor target at 1 25 to 0 25 although the snb says that the bank is ready to pull the rates lower with a deeply negative sight deposit rate at 0 75 thomas jordan s team has its hands tied in face of an increasingly dovish policy environment across the board moving the rates lower has serious consequences for the market such as an increased pressure on banks pension funds and the housing prices therefore any additional move on the dovish side should be thought thoroughly an undesired appreciation in the swiss franc would pretty much be the only trigger for an eventual rate cut for the snb the franc trades at its highest levels against the euro in two years and the strong franc is detrimental for swiss businesses beyond borders making the swiss exports more expensive than they already are but investors are not ringing the alarm bell just yet in that the actual dovishness also increases the risk appetite bringing investors to sail away from the franc and to adventure among riskier investments anything that could turn investors attention away from the franc should take the pressure off the snb s shoulders and save at least some time for the snb a policy normalisation on the other hand has perhaps become a faraway dream for the snb the bank will certainly not raise its rates before its european neighbours raise theirs the latter would not happen any time before mid 2020 according to the european central bank ecb president mario draghi hence the snb will likely remain seated on the current negative rates at least until 2021

13 06 2019 colours shades limits in the second of four articles jack conrad explores the good the bad and the ugly sides of green political thought like every socially significant ideological current greenism contains many schools of thought competing viewpoints rival campaigns odd groupings and strange offshoots a quick name check green alliance population matters bright blue resurgence ecologist green futures green party of england and wales greenpeace friends of the earth women s environmental network earth first friday for future extinction rebellion campaign against climate change earth liberation front green anarchist alliance for green socialism evidently greenism comes in many shades and with not a few additional colour permutations classic foundational green thinkers rachel carson ernst schumacher ezra mishan donella meadows dennis meadows jørgan randers and ivan illich had the great merit of being in the forefront of those who brought the question of ecological degradation back to public attention after many years of almost total neglect we are talking about the 1960s and early 70s the environmental damage caused by modern industrial society both western capitalism and eastern bureaucratic socialism was exposed growth for the sake of growth was condemned the concluding message was as urgent as it was blunt a sustainable balance between humanity and nature has to be re established before it is too late nowadays the greens are a real political presence with a westminster mp seven meps and well over a hundred councillors wikipedia classifies the green party as leftwing in point of fact there are many good demands in its programme abolition of the standing army navy and airforce withdrawal from nato replacing the monarchy with a republic proportional representation for local and parliamentary elections etc etc however overall and in terms of green thought it is far from alone the party remains trapped within the narrow confines of existing society basically what it envisages is a downsized a tamed a domesticated capitalism the underlying ethos is localism not globalism small businesses mutuals home and self employment are held up as an ideal meanwhile a remoulded banking system with the royal bank of scotland at its core provides cheap basic services and lends locally so banking capital is reigned in but continues essentially the same happens with industrial capital hypothetically the green new deal ends austerity ensures that the economy is based on renewable energy and reskills and retrains the workforce alexandria ocasio cortez champions a similar keynesian package in the united states but the programmatic limits are plain to see though a green economy would supposedly replace the exploitation of people and resources with decent meaningful work in actual fact wage slavery remains the norm for the vast majority of the population eg despite claiming to have big bold ideas the green party commits itself to a living wage of 10 an hour by 2020 in other words not just wage slavery but impoverished wage slavery and that as a goal clearly the interests of small capital trump the interests of labour paradoxically the green party supports the united nations and opposes brexit while simultaneously denouncing globalisation and the international division of labour not that a green government would abolish international trade no international trade will respect human rights labour standards environmental standards and climate commitments etc etc nevertheless the intention is clear haul capital back into the cramped space provided by the nation state while capitalism found an early life in the nooks and crannies of classical and feudal society it is in its mature form fundamentally a global system having captured the state tentatively in late medieval venice and genoa more surely in the dutch republic and then decisively in williamite england capital used this salient to aggressively expand outwards protectionism wartime autarchy and currency controls are for capital merely different means towards the same end capital develops by overcoming closed markets old habits and customs tariff barriers competition legal restrictions on hours and strives for universal domination the global market becomes the global economy and the means of production are revolutionised again and again what once took a day to make now takes an hour attempting to reverse that dynamic is both reactionary and bound to trigger a whole series of unintended consequences what happens when the green party s innovative collaborative forward facing economy meets the unforgiving real world leave aside sinister moves by the deep state and push back by foreign powers chopping up transnational companies into national segments breaking apart global supply chains and relying on small scale capitalist enterprises must see overall productivity tumble downwards costs must rise and profits will be squeezed there would certainly be a flight of capital and the devaluation of the national currency hyperinflation surely follows shortages spread people turn to black and grey markets corrupt fortunes are amassed social tensions become acute those with the most marketable skills flee abroad a green party government would be faced with an unenviable choice either screw up rates of exploitation and administer poverty or abandon the fight for equality unfazed the green party solemnly promises an economy that works for everyone greenism as manifest self deception in practice the gpew s programme amounts to tougher legislating against polluting industries enacting measures to reduce plastics championing wind farms and solar panels setting dates when net zero co 2 emissions will be achieved etc so the green party s big bold ideas to create a confident and caring britain are in fact exceedingly timid like their german swedish french etc colleagues the underwhelming gpew leadership caroline lucas jonathan bartley jean lambert keith taylor siân berry jenny jones overwhelmingly consist of realos not fundies they would given the chance responsibly administer not replace capitalism that explains why their lefter green opponents condescendingly dub them pale greens elites moving on from the electorally significant gpew we shall have a look at the elitist pressure groups greenpeace and friends of the earth are typical for the price of an annual subscription their millions of largely passive members get a vicarious thrill from tv internet and newspaper friendly stunts yet despite the eco warrior image such organisations are in fact top heavy with managers administrators communicators and fundraisers interminable meetings not action are the order of most days writes charles secrett foe executive director between 1993 and 2003 radicalism has certainly been blunted by a desire to cultivate and maintain links with the political establishment because greenpeace relies on propaganda of the deed it is inevitably run on a command and obey basis greenpeace has numerous offices its own fleet of ships and a helicopter and employs well over 2 000 people annual income amounts to some 300 million globally lucrative jobs as professional activists are much sought after scientists are employed too executives vie for dominance meanwhile full membership is strictly limited and most local groups concentrate on money raising street begging on a wage of about 10 11 an hour has been turned into a successful commercial model foe is somewhat different for example while in the united kingdom its ceo craig bennett is on a 80 90 000 salary and presides over 500 staff members he allows local campaigning and initiative however finance not only comes from membership subscriptions when it comes to elitist organisations such as greenpeace and foe capitalist philanthropists eg richard branson bill gates and michael bloomberg provide considerable sums and arguably set the agenda note capitalism is taken as a given albeit once again in the imagination downsized and made eco friendly almost by definition the same goes for zac goldsmith and the liberal conservative bright blue outfit right tory greenism is nothing new in october 1988 margaret thatcher made her famous green conference speech no generation has a freehold on this earth all we have is a life tenancy with full repairing lease this government intends to meet the terms of that lease in full indeed ever since the dawn of industrial capitalism there has been a strand of aristocratic conservatism which has protested against the despoliation of nature the young england movement of the early 1840s comes to mind born on the playing fields of eton oxford and cambridge it loosely grouped together an aristocratic membership george smythe lord john manners henry hope alexander baillie cochrane but most notably its figurehead and leader benjamin disraeli who was no aristocrat nor did he attend eton to gain a wider audience these gentlemen were obliged to appear indifferent to their own class interests nostalgically they put the case for a rural idyll of snug hamlets independent artisans and upright yeomen farmers everyone has their place and everyone knows their place the rich man in his castle the poor man by his gate even in our times protests against the damage wrought by capitalism can go hand in hand with barely concealed plans for a return to the feudal past roger scruton coined the term oikophobia oiko is the greek for home to castigate those who belittle or repudiate family values established tradition and patriotic love of country how to seriously think about saving the planet 2012 he singles out in particular howard zinn and noam chomsky scruton envisages environmentalists and conservatives making common cause around territory in particular its strongest political expression the nation state before him edward goldsmith 1928 2009 uncle of zac argued for cutting the population by 50 repatriating immigrants and establishing a green social order based on the patriarchal family small scale communities and something resembling the indian caste system inspired by this overtly reactionary vision of the future michael benfield freda sanders tony whittaker and lesley whittaker founded the people party edward teddy goldsmith stood for them in the 1974 general election he lost badly but in 1975 the people party became the ecology party and 10 years later in another name change it became the green party so in terms of its political origins the green party is not left but far right young england had not the least interest in nor wish for democracy dreamy poems lauded absolute monarchy the medieval church along with benevolent alms giving to the poor patronising sentiments which were the subject of much wicked mockery at the time young england accused industrialists of subordinating all moral scruples to the balance sheet utilitarianism excused greed the rich and powerful had abdicated their responsibilities to the weak and vulnerable capitalism threatened to destroy everything tried and tested everything venerated everything that rooted people in the sacrosanct soil of past generations unless halted such vandalism it was darkly prophesised would inexorably lead to a revolutionary explosion and plunge the country into unimaginable chaos memories of 1789 were seared onto ruling class brains swift action had to be taken to rescue what little remained of the national heritage historical monuments ancient woodlands and time honoured rural ways we heard a similar tune from the countryside alliance in the 1990s and 2000s a melange of aristocratic landowners plebeian retainers and the right wing of the middle classes it symbolically dressed foxhunting up in the garb of timeless tradition and in 2002 it mobilised 400 000 to march through central london not only in support of foxhunting but british food and british farms in reality things are of course very different those who still run the countryside alliance disgracefully ermined labour party members included are the very types responsible for degrading rural britain they ripped up hedgerows they are addicted to state handouts and subsidies they preside over and profit from monoculture and the wanton use of chemicals the origins of our denatured system of agriculture lie in the enclosure acts beginning in the 13th century and completed in the 19th century the mass of britain s peasant farmers were expropriated a plain enough case of class robbery declares ep thompson not only was the best land put over to grain and cattle huge tracts of moorland were turned over to killing wildlife grouse partridge and fatted deer an aristocratic playground a small army of gamekeepers were employed to keep out the hoi polloi wolf polecat eagle hawk and otter were all categorised as vermin and systematically exterminated foxhunting was invented only in the 19th century horses and dogs had by then been bred to the point where they had the needed speed and stamina today an estimated 0 28 of families own 64 of the land the totally ineffective hunting act 2004 chasing down and ripping apart exhausted foxes served to symbolise that landed wealth class domination and inherited privilege in its own illegal way it still does no surprise many tory mps

concludes that sustainability is fully compatible with a revised retuned recalibrated capitalism if that is not possible he grudgingly admits then one would be morally obliged to devote one s political activities to the overthrow of capitalism needless to say ecological responsibility cannot replace accumulation for its own sake as the mainspring of capital s laws of motion within capitalism to claim otherwise is to desert reality undaunted in 1996 sniffing the dividends porritt and sara parkin founded the forum for the future after a simmering civil war they had both resigned from the green party s executive just a few weeks prior to its annual conference forum for the future is a well heeled charity 66 staff members and an annual income of 5 2 million it courts big business and its chequebooks no one way street forum for the future magnanimously bestows green credentials on transnational corporations and translates sustainable development into the language of share price cash flow cost cutting efficiency and profit its 50 plus corporate sponsors and partners have we are reassuringly told a proven commitment to the environment amongst them are american express the british aerosol manufacturers association jaguar land rover tata nestle sky m s and aviva obviously being green is considered good public relations and therefore good business saving on inputs such as energy and other raw materials can certainly be presented in a way that buffs green credentials as motivated not by the intrinsic capitalist drive to minimise costs rather newly discovered concerns for the environment green eco taxes and subsidies emissions trading and co 2 capture and storage all chime with manufactured public opinion however these green capitalist panaceas legitimise pollution favour the most powerful concentrations of capital threaten to pass on additional costs to the consumer or simply lead to offloading dirty industries onto less developed parts of the world india china vietnam philippines etc old technologies can be abandoned or superseded but individual capitalists personify are in thrall to a mode of production which relies on constant growth hence they spare no effort go to any lengths to discover or invent novel ways to pass through the eye of awkward laws money is certainly used to purchase state guardians to open up loopholes and failing that to bulldoze down legislation essentially allowing the fundamental laws of capital to reassert themselves capital aims to expand capital not cherish the environment or promote human wellbeing neoliberalism exacerbates what is a general characteristic capital and state interweave as never before corruption becomes institutionalised normalised and except in its most overt forms nowadays goes hardly noticed environmental regulations are not only subject to outrageous abuse and constant string pulling governments willingly slough them off given sufficient bribes or pressure the us being obviously by far the most important example after all it is the biggest carbon polluter in history despite this donald trump promises to pull out of the paris international climate agreement cuts back on the us environmental protection agency dismisses climate warming as a hoax and all in all has rolled back or reversed a whole raft of existing regulations here trump walks in the footsteps of previous republican administrations george bush repeatedly invoked national security to justify abandoning environmental protection measures including granting permission for drilling oil in wildlife refuges richard nixon did the same few ceos dare speak out in favour of deregulation and yet the effects of deregulation are often cited as a factor that has buoyed the stock market undaunted by the reality of actually existing capitalism forum for the future promises companies that they can be turbo charged by sustainability legally trained proponents of green capitalism seriously at least according to their own warped precepts want to extend the ideology of rights to include rivers lakes trees mountains the very air we breathe they become legal personalities and can thereby gain protection in the courts natural objects should be given the same legal status as corporations argues christopher stone but rights like politics art and morality is obviously a human construct nor has nature as nature interests human beings have an interest in nature its preservation its variety its health because nature supports human life and enhances humanity materially culturally and spiritually nonetheless the green legalists believe that by giving nature rights this will stop exploitation history to put it mildly fails to support such a contention capital treats what is bought and sold what is property in a purely instrumental slave like fashion necessarily that entails mistreatment as a means to an end labour is exploited so too is nature do the innate laws of capital mean that the system cannot be forced to partially curb its exploitative appetites and patterns of behaviour of course it can capitalism as a total system has never moved according to the exclusive interests of capital there exists another power within it there is the political economy of need which constantly pushes in the opposite direction in short the class struggle conducted by workers and an immanent socialism life is stacking up more and more examples not only of capitalist decay but the becoming of socialism legal restrictions on working hours universal suffrage compulsory primary and secondary education free health provision unemployment and housing benefit clean air acts limits on emissions health and safety countryside access minimum pay levels etc all negative anticipations because socialism is emerging but remains unseparated from capitalism unsurprisingly all such state enforced measures cause their own problems a hybrid system is a malfunctioning system the law of value and state organisation interfere with the workings of each other they conflict they produce completely irrational results endless regulation endless deregulation privatisation deprivatisation marketisation ballooning bureaucracy chronic waste meaningless tick box targets despite capital s inherent drive to maximise exploitation not least given our present line of discussion the exploitation of nature it is held back curbed modified but attempts to organise what is decay compound existing contradictions and add new ones besides the system becomes uncontrollable even for its controllers hence the greater likelihood of nature exacting its revenge critiques prostituted apologetics of the type coming from the forum for the future notwithstanding there are anti capitalist greens overproduction waste insatiable greed and the wanton misuse of nature are all subjected to savage criticism and on occasion profound analysis many radical green thinkers fondly cite gerald winstanley william morris and peter kropotkin as their fiery inspirations others prefer the milder flavours of st francis of assisi leo tolstoy and mahatma gandhi obviously anti capitalism is a many headed beast before examining the deep greens let us discuss ernst schumacher george monbiot and murray bookchin between the three of them they cover the spectrum of ecological thought that stretches from green christianity by way of neo proudhonism to social anarchism besides a burning desire for global change the thread that joins them is that small is beautiful the future must be non capitalist but also decentralised self reliant and non hierarchical however the social agent capable of bringing about such an outcome remains totally unconvincing in each account for schumacher it is enlightened aid workers and third world bureaucrats monbiot talks of collective action by poor countries while bookchin looks to libertarian municipalism all shrink from the necessary task of organising the working class into a revolutionary party ernst schumacher 1911 77 considered unrestrained industrialisation to be the cause of unlimited sorrows especially in the former colonial countries schumacher advocated appropriate technology and rejected the bigger is better ethos characteristic of the 1950s 60s long boom he located this ethos not in the organised concentration of capital overseen by the social democratic state rather in six leading ideas inherited from the 19th century that is darwinism and natural selection the idea of competition and the survival of the fittest marx s observation that all higher manifestations of human life religion philosophy art etc are nothing but necessary supplements of the material life process the freudian interpretation which reduces human life to the dark stirrings of the human subconscious relativism and denying all absolutes positivism and the claim that no knowledge is valid unless it is based on generally observable facts and therefore denies the possibility of objective knowledge of purpose and meaning these ideas which claimed to do away with metaphysics were in fact intoned schumacher bad metaphysics and bad ethics joining natural selection and historical materialism together with positivism and scientism is not as absurd as might first appear ideologically the post world war ii period was under the tyrannical sway of positivism the official marxism of the stalinites on the one side and social democracy and mainstream liberalism on the other though undoubtedly failing to locate the real causes schumacher exposed the negative ecological results of both capitalist and stalinite development as an alternative he famously opted for what he called buddhist economics though he himself converted to catholicism his model was post independence burma a regular columnist in the guardian george monbiot has written a string of excellent books amazon watershed heat captive state feral etc his case for a democratic revolution is fully elaborated in the age of consent 2003 which dissects the global dictatorship of vested interests clearly a revolt against 21st century capitalism but just as clearly a reinvention of pre marxist utopian socialism monbiot wants to harness globalisation in order to eventually extinguish capitalism true long down the road of his democratic revolution reaching some pre set programmatic milepost the transnationals will finally be broken up and production radically decentralised once a confirmed localist he now espouses globalism at least in terms of strategy his democratic revolution begins at the global level anarchism and green capitalism are rightly rejected but monbiot suffers from what can only be described as a pavlovian aversion when it comes to marxism the merest mention of marxism sends his brain into a spin monbiot ridiculously blames marx for stalin s gulags maoism and pol pot bureaucratic socialism is put down to the communist manifesto his pathological stowe public school education clearly conditioned him all too well monbiot has gone to the trouble of drawing up a detailed blueprint for tomorrow s world there will be a 600 seat global parliament one mp for every 10 million people parliamentary voting will be weighed according to a sliding democratic scale once again courtesy of our clever friend however the authority of his august body would be purely moral national states continue to exist it is just that they would now be under moral pressure to do the right thing the world government would have no law courts no army nonetheless a fair trade organisation ensures that transnationals retract their exploitative claws and respond to popular environmental concerns and worries how such a one person one vote global institution is supposed to arise while national states and us eu and japanese transnationals still constitute the dominant economic power on the planet is lightly skated over does anyone really expect the us administration to facilitate its citizenry voting in monbiot s elections would washington shoulder the costs involved and what about china russia iran and north korea though monbiot gives a passing nod in the direction of existing campaigning organisations his elaborate schema is built on nothing more substantial than the clouds of fantasy bookchin 1921 2006 offers a slightly less utopian perspective describing himself as a libertarian communist a former official communist and then trotskyite he took theory seriously an impressive body of work contains much of value bookchin particularly targeted domination and hierarchy in class society this has produced humanity s imbalance with nature he has no time for pro capitalist greenism overpopulation panics or technophobia all have inbuilt reactionary implications a complete social revolution is needed bookchin s unwillingness to embrace the means the revolutionary party is perfectly understandable especially given the us radical milieu during his lifetime the leftwing sects which passed themselves off as parties even those which more modestly say they aspire to that aim pathetically reproduce the structures and much of the attending egotism of capitalism itself central committees behave as boards of directors the rank and file are treated as mere speaking tools then there are the proprietorial general secretaries fleeing from this madness bookchin found refuge in the idea of little communes municipalities which consist to begin with of hard core cadre somehow these bacilli survive within the decaying body of capitalist society and steadily grow into organs of dual power momentarily suspending our disbelief at the chances of this happening we are still left with a fundamental problem if for some reason these bodies managed to avoid succumbing to the antibodies of coercion the pressures and the lures of capitalist society no matter how powerful they became they would still come to grief on the reefs of localism by their very nature they would articulate sectional not universal interests and therefore quickly fall into bickering rivalry the fate of trade unions as trade unions co ops as co ops and soviets as soviets without the coordination discipline and theory provided by the highest form of working class organisation sectionalism is bound to take hold deep greens as personalities schumacher monbiot and bookchin are clearly motivated by a heartfelt desire to improve the lot of the world s population that cannot be so readily said of deep greens yes they too savage consumerism industrial effluent monocrop agriculture the whole cult of economic growth however for them the adverse effects this has on humanity is secondary nature comes first arne naess 1912 2009 the norwegian mountaineer and sage began laying the theoretical foundations as far back as the early 1950s at least to the degree that deep greenism can be considered a theory he attacked the short termism the irrationality of neo classical economics and sought to displace anthropocentric modes of thinking with what he and his followers call biocentrism or egocentrism anthropocentrism which i take as meaning that humans alone have intrinsic value dates back he argues to the neolithic revolution around 10 000 years ago the adoption of anthropocentric modes of thought is collectively remembered in the story of yehovah s expulsion of adam and eve from the garden of eden and other such myths the long and the short of it is that once human beings stopped venerating nature and started to treat it as a thing to be subdued an object fit only for exploitation then they fell from grace and condemned themselves to the endless drudgery of labour civilisation thereby becomes a terrible mistake a dangerous detour suffice to say deep greenism lacks anything resembling an adequate account of history deep greenism amounts to a retrogressive plea for humanity to adapt to nature to give up on all hope of progressive social change and return to a lost innocence of childhood but no adult can perform such a feat nor can the human species the door to the past is permanently closed it is impossible to sustain a 7 2 billion global population with paleolithic hunter gathering the only door open to us is the future according to naess there is no moral hierarchy of life he rejected all paradigms whereby species are ranked according to whether they have a soul or possess consciousness naess says the right of all forms to live is a universal right which cannot be quantified no single species of living being has more of this particular right to live and unfold than any other species this is not the self denying ordinance it might first appear to be despite the insistence on non hierarchy elementary biological necessities have to be recognised except to satisfy vital human needs there is no sanction to kill but there is a vital human need for food that must be constantly satisfied people have to consume fellow life forms and thankfully they can do so with the sanction of the deep greens in point of fact there is a deep green macho minority which actually revels in hunting shooting and fishing as a means of rediscovering their human essence nature being red in tooth and claw in the spirit of naess we find green thinkers like james lovelock expressing a scornful disregard for fellow human beings our humanist solicitude towards the poor living in the impoverished suburbs of the big cities of the third world and our almost obscene obsession with death suffering and pain as if these were harmful in themselves all these thoughts deflect our attention from the problem of our harsh and excessive domination of the natural world a line of thought which has led some deep greens to view the hiv aids virus either neutrally or as yet another addition to life s rich tapestry some actually welcomed it celebrating authenticity fragility and destiny these ecobrutalists decry anti aids drugs and the entire health infrastructure nature knows best via aids humanity is being culled when that task is finally completed it is the deep green survivalists who will inherit the earth to say the least all such viewpoints smack of anthropomorphism nature is given human attributes hence we find the american naturalist aldo leonard telling us to think like a mountain biocentrism to state an obvious truth is a human created ideology if it means recognising that humans are part of nature the uniquely conscious part that human society should cease fetishistically worshipping production that we should start looking after nature by reordering ourselves then no serious communist would disagree on the other hand if biocentrism means placing nature above the interests of humanity diminishing the human and depicting it as a disease then we must disagree deep greenism comes unencumbered by a fully debated and democratically agreed programme it is a loose conglomeration and ideologically very pick and mix deep greenism often blurs over into new ageism with its self realisation and lifestyle obsessions consequently deep greens are prone to navel gazing individualism and to falling under the spell of charismatic charlatans exponents frequently hold completely juxtaposed positions and easily lurch from elation to despair and vice versa ecofeminist deep greens blame capitalist patriarchy and male values for the degradation of the environment women are considered innately attuned to nature menstruation and motherhood separate them from men and go towards what is essentially a form of biological determinism not a few have taken to witchcraft one celebrated exponent of deep green irrationalism is the physicist fritjof capra founding director of the center for ecoliteracy in berkeley usa according to his official website he frequently gives management seminars for top executives after touring germany in the early 1980s capra co authored green politics 1984 with ecofeminist charlene spretnak in the tao of physics 1975 and later books such as the web of life 1996 and the hidden connections 2002 he details why he believes physics and metaphysics are both inexorably leading to the same stunning conclusion there are hidden connections between everything as is standard deep green fare capra dismisses as outdated the mechanical cartesian newtonian paradigm in justification he cites 20th century developments in sub atomic physics and systems theory instead he calls for a delving back to the truths that can be discovered in the ancient eastern outlook ie hinduism buddhism and taoism which maintain a mystical holism of course the truths capra finds in these religions philosophies are primitive forms of dialectics take lao tzu the 7th century bc chinese teacher and thinker brilliantly he grasped the fact that all things are changing and changing into their opposites they do so by following their own natural way tao lao tzu eschewed the gods and instead emphasised the dialectic of nature humanity must learn to quietly accept its laws other deep greens find similar truths in classical greece heraclitus circa 544 483 bc also said that there is nothing certain in the world except change he too concluded that things turn into their opposites properties of the real word were captured in the minds of these outstanding philosophers and turned into various modes of dialectical thought deep greens believe they have discovered the highway to social transformation through mentally shunning western scientism and embracing what they consider to be the esoteric secrets of ancient wisdom others not least society at large are urged to follow their path to enlightenment primitive dialectics is one sided having been developed by members of the exploiting classes specifically those intellectuals who possessed the abundant leisure time needed to contemplate and debate however their dialectics were quietist a means of interpreting not radically engaging with the world that was the great advance brought about by the marx engels team marxism is the world outlook of the revolutionary working class taking the best from previous philosophies marxism continues but transcends philosophy marxism is quintessentially about practice investigation is for the purposes of overthrowing all existing social conditions through pursuing the class struggle the political economy of the working class points far beyond the narrow confines of mere trade unionism a few hours off the working week a bit more pay at the end of the month that cannot remotely satisfy the needs of the working class the working class needs to become fully human that necessitates establishing genuinely human relationships within society and through that a human relationship with nature so the only consistent defender of nature is the working class every other social agent is illusory nothing else can conceivably organise itself into an alternative material force capable of positively transcending capital to be ecological therefore requires more than being anti capitalist it is necessary to be a partisan of the working class an undiluted red a marxist l
bernie sanders defines his vision for democratic socialism usa june 13 2019 bernie sanders on wednesday june 12th 2019 democratic presidential candidate sen bernie sanders i vt spoke about his views on democratic socialism and why it would be good for the usa in a speech at george washington university in washington dc my friends we are in the midst of a defining and pivotal moment for our country and our planet and with so many crises converging upon us simultaneously it is easy for us to become overwhelmed or depressed or to even throw up our hands in resignation but my message to you today is that if there was ever a moment in the history of our country where despair was not an option this is that time if there was ever a moment where we had to effectively analyze the competing political and social forces which define this historical period this is that time if there was ever a moment when we needed to stand up and fight against the forces of oligarchy and authoritarianism this is that time and if there was ever a moment when we needed a new vision to bring our people together in the fight for justice decency and human dignity this is that time in the year 2019 the united states and the rest of the world face two very different political paths on one hand there is a growing movement toward oligarchy and authoritarianism in which a small number of incredibly wealthy and powerful billionaires own and control a significant part of the economy and exert enormous influence over the political life of our country on the other hand in opposition to oligarchy there is a movement of working people and young people who in ever increasing numbers are fighting for justice they are the teachers taking to the streets to make certain that schools are adequately funded and that their students get a quality education they are workers at disney amazon walmart and the fast food industry standing up and fighting for a living wage of at least 15 an hour and the right to have a union they are young people taking on the fossil fuel industry and demanding policies that transform our energy system and protect our planet from the ravages of climate change they are women who refuse to give control of their bodies to local state and federal politicians they are people of color and their allies demanding an end to systemic racism and massive racial inequities that exist throughout our society they are immigrants and their allies fighting to end the demonization of undocumented people and for comprehensive immigration reform when we talk about oligarchy let us be clear about what we mean right now in the united states of america three families control more wealth than the bottom half of our country some 160 million americans the top 1 own more wealth than the bottom 92 and 49 of all new income generated today goes to the top 1 in fact income and wealth inequality today in the united states is greater than at any time since the 1920s and when we talk about oligarchy it is not just that the very rich are getting much richer it is that tens of millions of working class people in the wealthiest country on earth are suffering under incredible economic hardship desperately trying to survive today nearly 40 million americans live in poverty and tonight 500 000 people will be sleeping out on the streets about half of the country lives paycheck to paycheck as tens of millions of our people are an accident a divorce a sickness or a layoff away from economic devastation while many public schools throughout the country lack the resources to adequately educate our young people we are the most heavily incarcerated nation on earth after decades of policies that have encouraged and subsidized unbridled corporate greed we now have an economy that is fundamentally broken and grotesquely unfair even while macroeconomic numbers like gdp the stock market and the unemployment rate are strong millions of middle class and working people struggle to keep their heads above water while the billionaire class consumes the lion s share of the wealth that we are collectively creating as a nation in the midst of a so called booming economy real wages for the average worker have barely risen at all and despite an explosion in technology and worker productivity the average wage of the american worker in real dollars is no higher than it was 46 years ago and millions of people are forced to work two or three jobs just to survive and here is something quite incredible that tells you all you need to know about the results of unfettered capitalism all of us want to live long happy and productive lives but in america today the very rich live on average 15 years longer than the poorest americans in 2014 in mcdowell county west virginia one of the poorest counties in the nation life expectancy for men was 64 years in fairfax county virginia a wealthy county just 350 miles away life expectancy for men was nearly 82 years an 18 year differential the life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years in other words the issue of unfettered capitalism is not just an academic debate poverty economic distress and despair are life threatening issues for millions of working people in the country while the rich get richer they live longer lives while poor and working families struggle economically and often lack adequate healthcare their life expectancy is declining for the first time in modern american history taken together the american dream of upward mobility is in peril in fact if we don t turn things around our younger generation will for the first time in living memory have a lower standard of living than their parents this is not acceptable globally the situation is even more shocking with most of the world s wealth concentrated among a very few while billions of people have almost nothing today the world s richest 26 billionaires now own as much wealth as the poorest 3 8 billion people on the planet half of the world s population but the struggle we are facing today is not just economic across the globe the movement toward oligarchy runs parallel to the growth of authoritarian regimes like putin in russia xi in china mohamed bin salman in saudi arabia rodrigo duterte in the philippines jair bolsonaro in brazil and viktor orbán in hungry among others these leaders meld corporatist economics with xenophobia and authoritarianism they redirect popular anger about inequality and declining economic conditions into violent rage against minorities whether they are immigrants racial minorities religious minorities or the lgbt community and to suppress dissent they are cracking down on democracy and human rights in the united states of course we have our own version of this movement which is being led by president trump and many of his republican allies who are attempting to divide our country up and attack these same communities how sad it is that president trump sees these authoritarian leaders as friends and allies this authoritarian playbook is not new the challenge we confront today as a nation and as a world is in many ways not different from the one we faced a little less than a century ago during and after the great depression in the 1930s then as now deeply rooted and seemingly intractable economic and social disparities led to the rise of right wing nationalist forces all over the world in europe the anger and despair was ultimately harnessed by authoritarian demagogues who fused corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia into a political movement that amassed totalitarian power destroyed democracy and ultimately murdering millions of people including members of my own family but we must remember that those were not the only places where dark forces tried to rise up today we are all rightly repulsed by the sight of neo nazis and klansmen openly marching in charlottesville va and we are horrified by houses of worship being shot up by right wing terrorists but on february 20 1939 over 20 000 nazis held a mass rally not in berlin not in rome but in madison square garden in front of a 30 foot tall banner of george washington bordered with swastikas in new york city but back then those american extremists could not replicate the success of their authoritarian brethren across the ocean because we in the united states thankfully made a different choice than europe did in responding to the era s social and economic crises we rejected the ideology of mussolini and hitler we instead embraced the bold and visionary leadership of president franklin delano roosevelt then the leader of the progressive wing of the democratic party together with organized labor leaders in the african american community and progressives inside and outside the party roosevelt led a transformation of the american government and the american economy like today the quest for transformative change was opposed by big business wall street the political establishment by the republican party and by the conservative wing of fdr s own democratic party and he faced the same scare tactics then that we experience today red baiting xenophobia racism and anti semitism in a famous 1936 campaign speech roosevelt stated we had to struggle with the old enemies of peace business and financial monopoly speculation reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism war profiteering they had begun to consider the government of the united states as a mere appendage to their own affairs we know now that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today they are unanimous in their hate for me and i welcome their hatred despite that opposition by rallying the american people fdr and his progressive coalition created the new deal won four terms and created an economy that worked for all and not just the few today new deal initiatives like social security unemployment compensation the right to form a union the minimum wage protection for farmers regulation of wall street and massive infrastructure improvements are considered pillars of american society but while he stood up for the working families of our country we can never forget that president roosevelt was reviled by the oligarchs of his time who berated these extremely popular programs as socialism similarly in the 1960s when lyndon johnson brought about medicare medicaid and other extremely popular programs he was also viciously attacked by the ruling class of this country and here is the point it is no exaggeration to state that not only did fdr s agenda improve the lives of millions of americans but the new deal was enormously popular politically and helped defeat far right extremism for a time today america and the world are once again moving toward authoritarianism and the same right wing forces of oligarchy corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia are on the march pushing us to make the apocalyptically wrong choice that europe made in the last century today we now see a handful of billionaires with unprecedented wealth and power we see huge private monopolies operating outside of any real democratic oversight and often subsidized by taxpayers with the power to control almost every aspect of our lives they are the profit taking gatekeepers of our healthcare our technology our finance system our food supply and almost all of the other basic necessities of life they are wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the fossil fuel industry the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex and giant agri businesses they are the entities with unlimited wealth who surround our nation s capitol with thousands of well paid lobbyists who to a significant degree write the laws that we live under today we have a demagogue in the white house who for cheap political gain is attempting to deflect the attention of the american people away from the real crises that we face and instead is doing what demagogues always do and that is divide people up and legislate hatred this is a president who supports brutal family separations border walls muslim bans anti lgbt policies deportations and voter suppression it is my very strong belief that the united states must reject that path of hatred and divisiveness and instead find the moral conviction to choose a different path a higher path a path of compassion justice and love it is the path that i call democratic socialism over eighty years ago franklin delano roosevelt helped create a government that made transformative progress in protecting the needs of working families today in the second decade of the 21st century we must take up the unfinished business of the new deal and carry it to completion this is the unfinished business of the democratic party and the vision we must accomplish in order to accomplish that goal it means committing ourselves to protecting political rights to protecting civil rights and to protect economic rights of all people in this country as fdr stated in his 1944 state of the union address we have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence today our bill of rights guarantees the american people a number of important constitutionally protected political rights and while we understand that these rights have not always been respected and we have so much more work to do we are proud that our constitution guarantees freedom of religion freedom of expression freedom of assembly a free press and other rights because we understand that we can never have true american freedom unless we are free from authoritarian tyranny now we must take the next step forward and guarantee every man woman and child in our country basic economic rights the right to quality healthcare the right to as much education as one needs to succeed in our society the right to a good job that pays a living wage the right to affordable housing the right to a secure retirement and the right to live in a clean environment we must recognize that in the 21st century in the wealthiest country in the history of the world economic rights are human rights that is what i mean by democratic socialism as dr martin luther king jr said call it democracy or call it democratic socialism but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all of god s children to realize this vision we must not view america only as a population of disconnected individuals we must also view ourselves as part of an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny as dr king put it in other words we are in this together we must see ourselves as part of one nation one community and one society regardless of race gender religion sexual orientation or country of origin this quintessentially american idea is literally emblazoned on our coins e pluribus unum from the many one and i should tell you it is enshrined in the motto of our campaign for the presidency not me us let me be clear i do understand that i and other progressives will face massive attacks from those who attempt to use the word socialism as a slur but i should also tell you that i have faced and overcome these attacks for decades and i am not the only one let us remember that in 1932 republican president herbert hoover claimed that franklin roosevelt s new deal was a disguise for the totalitarian state in 1936 former democratic new york governor and presidential candidate al smith said in a speech about fdr s new deal policies just get the platform of the democratic party and get the platform of the socialist party and lay them down on your dining room table side by side when president harry truman proposed a national healthcare program the american medical association hired ronald reagan as their pitchman the ama called the legislation that stemmed from his proposal socialized medicine claiming that white house staff were followers of the moscow party line in 1960 ronald reagan in a letter to richard nixon wrote the following about john f kennedy under the tousled boyish haircut is still old karl marx in the 1990s then congressman newt gingrich claimed president bill clinton s healthcare plan was centralized bureaucratic socialism the conservative heritage foundation has claimed that the children s health insurance program chip was a step toward socialism former speaker of the house john boehner claimed the stimulus package the omnibus spending bill and the budget proposed by president barack obama were all one big down payment on a new american socialist experiment in this regard president harry truman was right when he said that socialism is the epithet they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years socialism is what they called social security socialism is what they called farm price supports socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people now let s be clear while president trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism they don t really oppose all forms of socialism they may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches trump and other billionaires let us never forget the unbelievable hypocrisy of wall street the high priests of unfettered capitalism in 2008 after their greed recklessness and illegal behavior created the worst financial disaster since the great depression with millions of americans losing their jobs their homes and their life savings wall street s religious adherence to unfettered capitalism suddenly came to an end overnight wall street became big government socialists and begged for the largest federal bailout in american history some 700 billion from the treasury and trillions in support from the federal reserve but it s not just wall street that loves socialism when it works for them it is the norm across the entire corporate world the truth is corporate america receives hundreds of billions of dollars in federal support every single year while these same people are trying to cut programs that benefit ordinary americans if you are a fossil fuel company whose carbon emissions are destroying the planet you get billions in government subsidies including special tax breaks royalty relief funding for research and development and numerous tax loopholes if you are a pharmaceutical company you make huge profits on patent rights for medicines that were developed with taxpayer funded research if you are a monopoly like amazon owned by the wealthiest person in america you get hundreds of millions of dollars in economic incentives from taxpayers to build warehouses and you end up paying not one penny in federal income taxes if you are the walton family the wealthiest family in america you get massive government subsidies because your low wage workers are forced to rely on food stamps medicaid and public housing in order to survive all paid for by taxpayers if you are the trump family you got 885 million worth of tax breaks and subsidies for your family s housing empire that is built on racial discrimination when trump screams socialism all of his hypocrisy will not be lost on the american people americans will know that he is attacking all that we take for granted from social security to medicare to veterans healthcare to roads and bridges to public schools to national parks to clean water and clean air when trump attacks socialism i am reminded of what dr martin luther king jr said this country has socialism for the rich rugged individualism for the poor and that is the difference between donald trump and me he believes in corporate socialism for the rich and powerful i believe in a democratic socialism that works for the working families of this country what i believe is that the american people deserve freedom true freedom freedom is an often used word but it s time we took a hard look at what that word actually means ask yourself what does it actually mean to be free are you truly free if you are unable to go to a doctor when you are sick or face financial bankruptcy when you leave the hospital are you truly free if you cannot afford the prescription drug you need to stay alive are you truly free when you spend half of your limited income on housing and are forced to borrow money from a payday lender at 200 interest rates are you truly free if you are 70 years old and forced to work because you lack a pension or enough money to retire are you truly free if you are unable to go to attend college or a trade school because your family lacks the income are you truly free if you are forced to work 60 or 80 hours a week because you can t find a job that pays a living wage are you truly free if you are a mother or father with a new born baby but you are forced to go back to work immediately after the birth because you lack paid family leave are you truly free if you are a small business owner or family farmer who is driven out by the monopolistic practices of big business are you truly free if you are a veteran who put your life on the line to defend this country and now sleep out on the streets to me the answer to those questions in the wealthiest nation on earth is no you are not free while the bill of rights protects us from the tyranny of an oppressive government many in the establishment would like the american people to submit to the tyranny of oligarchs multinational corporations wall street banks and billionaires it is time for the american people to stand up and fight for their right to freedom human dignity and security this is the core of what my politics is all about in 1944 fdr proposed an economic bill of rights but died a year later and was never able to fulfil that vision our job 75 years later is to complete what roosevelt started that is why today i am proposing a 21st century economic bill of rights a bill of rights that establishes once and for all that every american regardless of his or her income in entitled to the right to a decent job that pays a living wage the right to quality healthcare the right to a complete education the right to affordable housing the right to a clean environment the right to a secure retirement over the course of this election my campaign has been releasing and will continue to release detailed proposals addressing each of these yet to be realized economic rights we will also address the attacks that are being launched each day against the civil rights and civil liberties of our people and let me be absolutely clear democratic socialism to me requires achieving political and economic freedom in every community and let me also be clear the only way we achieve these goals is through a political revolution where millions of people get involved in the political process and reclaim our democracy by having the courage to take on the powerful corporate interests whose greed is destroying the social and economic fabric of our country at the end of the day the one percent may have enormous wealth and power but they are just the one percent when the 99 percent stand together we can transform society these are my values and that is why i call myself a democratic socialist at its core it is a deep and abiding faith in the american people to peacefully and democratically enact the transformative change that will create shared prosperity social equality and true freedom for all transcript available from vox com
by zheng li and david stanway shanghai reuters chinese regulators should step up support for the economy and keep ample liquidity in the financial system vice premier liu he said on thursday suggesting beijing would soon unveil more policies to bolster growth amid rising u s trade pressure trade talks between the world s two largest economies collapsed last month with u s president donald trump accusing china of watering down commitments it had made trump raised tariffs on chinese goods and has threatened even more beijing has plenty of policy tools and is capable of dealing with various challenges liu who is also the lead negotiator in the u s china trade talks told a financial forum in shanghai despite a slew of support measures and policy easing since last year china s cooling economy is still struggling to get back on firm footing and last month s sudden escalation in u s sino tensions has raised fears of a full blown trade war that could trigger a global recession graphic china s economic trends liu s comments came a day after data showed china s credit growth was weaker than expected in may reinforcing market expectations that more monetary easing is needed factory activity contracted in may and imports fell the most in nearly three years highlighting sluggish demand at present we do have some external pressures but those external pressures will help us boost our self reliance in innovation and accelerate the pace of high speed development said liu the government will announce more strong measures to promote reforms and opening up of its markets added liu the prospect of more economic support helped chinese stock markets recover from early losses tremendous room people s bank of china chief yi gang said last week that there was tremendous room to make policy adjustments if the trade war worsens earlier on thursday china daily citing economists said china is expected to adjust money and credit supply in coming weeks including cuts to interest rates or reserve ratio requirements to counter risks if the trade outlook deteriorates the commerce ministry said on thursday beijing will not yield to any maximum pressure from washington and any attempt by the united states to force china into accepting a trade deal will fail cooperation is based on principles and negotiations do have a bottom line and the chinese side will not make concessions on important matters of principle ministry spokesman gao feng told reporters at a regular briefing more rrr cuts further cuts in chinese banks reserve requirement ratios rrr and various forms of cash injections by the central bank had already been expected this year before trade ties soured last month the pboc stepped up efforts to increase loan growth and business activity announcing cuts in regional banks reserve requirements to reduce financing costs for small and private companies it has now cut rrr times six since early 2018 and has also guided short term interest rates lower unlike previous downturns however the central bank has been reluctant to cut benchmark interest rates so far analysts believe it has held off on more aggressive measures due to concerns that such a move could risk adding to a mountain of debt leftover from past stimulus sprees sources told reuters in february that the pboc considered a benchmark cut a last resort but some analysts now think one or more cuts are likely if the trade dispute spirals out of control and the u s federal reserve starts cutting its rates giving the pboc more room to maneuver some analysts believe the chances of a lasting trade deal are receding as both sides show signs of digging in but u s president donald trump has said he plans to meet his chinese counterpart xi jinping at a g20 summit later this month currency risks more forceful policy easing could also trigger capital outflows and add pressure on the the yuan has fallen nearly 3 percent since early may and is nearing the closely watched 7 per dollar mark a level last seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago china is capable and confident of maintaining stable operation of the foreign exchange market and keeping the yuan basically stable at reasonable and balanced levels pan gongsheng head of the state administration of foreign exchange said at the forum citing experts china daily said financial institutions were facing tighter liquidity in june and said authorities want to spur faster credit growth to meet economic targets beijing has set a growth target of around 6 to 6 5 for this year down from 6 6 in 2018 which was the slowest rate of expansion the country has seen in nearly 30 years analysts at bank of america merrill lynch nyse believe gdp growth could fall to 5 8 this year and 5 6 in 2020 if the trade war intensifies and expects beijing to respond with four benchmark rate cuts more rrr cuts consumption subsidies and measures to stabilize employment on monday the government announced steps to give local governments more financing flexibility so they can increase infrastructure spending a key part of the stimulus plan that has not revived investment as quickly as some china watchers had expected the escalating trade dispute has gone beyond tariffs as the two countries increase pressure on each other to cede ground chinese state media has warned that beijing could use rare earths for its next strike the united states relies on china for supplies of the rare earths to make a host of high tech products china also holds about 1 12 trillion in u s treasuries stirring talk that beijing could start dumping u s bonds but many analysts believe this so called nuclear option is unlikely given the damage it could inflict on financial markets and the global economy china is a responsible

menafn dailyfx trade war talking points the enthusiasm for the us mexico deal to avert tariffs has diminished as trump s account at odds with counterparts as the us president looks to muster support for his aggressive position with china a shift of focus back to currencies the dow ended its longest climb since may 2018 and regaining traction may be difficult without fundamental encouragement do you trade on fundamental themes or event risk see whatlive events we will cover on dailyfxahead uch as the us sentiment live data event as well as our regular webinar series meant to help you hone your trading relief rallies and fundamentally backed trends the benchmark us equity indices my preferred and imperfect measures of speculative appetite took another small but important step towards committing to a full fledged trend reversal this past session while neither the dow nors p 500registered prolific losses through wednesday s session the shift in baseline bias was apparent from the very start the two notched their first bearish opening gap in seven trading days and six trading days respectively which builds on the first official bearish close since the june climb tuesday after an intraday course reversal this course correction could simply prove a pause before reengaging bullish ambitions it could simply stall out or it could trigger a technical avalanche which course we follow depends as much on the bullish performance that preceded these technical developments as the sparks that could actively foster risk aversion over the final 48 hours of trade this week chart ofdow jones industrial averageand opening gaps daily most technical traders are familiar with the distinction between a trend s reversal versus a temporary correction in theory if not in practice that same contrast exists through fundamental and general speculative positioning considerations as well if the bullish risk on course that we ve been set on since the beginning of this month was rooted in a reliable and progressive theme the pause we are experiencing would likely steady before losing further altitude as we await the next headline or data release that reinforces the lift updates that work against the prevailing trend would need to build a head of steam between steady deterioration and or severe outcomes if it would be expected to generate a lasting bearish course in contrast a rally that was founded on primarily temporary means such as relief from a previously oppressive fundamental trend is more likely to stall out when the favorable headlines are spent such a scenario is more likely to unwind the previous trend even if the fundamental sparks dry up i believe we are experiencing the latter scenario trade wars tip the scales back to burden a grinding economic outlook haunts confidence of the major themes that have regularly driven the financial markets these past weeks and months the most prominent for coverage has undoubtedly beenthe progress of trade wars the news friday evening that the us and mexico had reached a deal to avert the former placing a 5 percent blanket tariff on the latter was clearly intended as a win for both the complicated economic engagement as well as for the capital markets yet the fear that has built up leading into impending escalations with the likes of the us china conflict never seemed to follow this side venue so while there was some relief that it hadn t gone into effect there wasn t much discount that would need to be covered by the subsequent announcement that seemed to confound the white house as the customary warnings that followed the course correction seemed to draw more attention and confusion that the initial breakthrough as for china there have not even been initial signs of a thaw in the tense relationship trump s remarks tuesday that he has held up the trade deal with the asian giant ahead of the g 20 summit at the end of the month produces more questions than answers uncertainty is risk and risk sends speculative appetite diving chart ofusdmxn daily though a less ubiquitous theme designs for monetary policy to revive the glory days of speculative appetites reinforced by external support from exceptionally dovish institutions has clearly played a key role in the market rally of through june it is not a coincidence that the charge from the s p 500 and drop from the dollar happens to align so distinctly with the sharp increase in expectations for rate cuts through july and end of year yet with the fed squarely in its two week blackout period there isn t much opportunity to further speculation of a dovish move from the largest central bank shifting subtely from september to july given the unmistakable correlation between the s p 500 s performance relative to rate expectations a freeze from the most effective international policy maker represents an unmistakable drift for an important relief rally driver chart of dow and expected rate cuts through sept in red dec in blue daily as the temporary props fade into the backdrop the systemic issues are returning to trouble the forecast assessments of global growth are lacking for official figures like the quarterly government updates or the timely pmis but there are still certain measures that carry weight with market participants this past session a survey of cfo sentiment conducted in a joint effort with duke university found that 48 percent of respondents expected a us recession was possible by mid 2020 that negative shift in activity rose to 69 percent through the end of next year while better than the 82 percent anticipation of an consecutive quarter contraction in growth by next year assessed this past december it still paints a troubling outlook it further reinforces the nabe s own survey of economists which predicted a us recession next year as a 60 percent chance there are other international headlines such as the suggestion from a former senior economic adviser that india had drastically overstated its growth for years which reminds us of the general course the world is on traders should be mindful of our underlying value trends as they weigh the pull of temporary distortions chart of us gdp annualized change and russell 2000 weekly a balance of power reversal on eurusd volatility potential for aussie dollar and swiss franc when it comes to the shifting poles of regional power the dollar is clearly a currency which is losing traction the greenback was finally put into step with interest rate expectations these past few weeks when the certainty of a rate cut in the near future shot higher the fundamental charge was enough to drive thedxydollar index to the floor of its 12 month rising trend channel though whether we broke that floor or not is up for debate regardless of the arguments to the particulars the 200 day moving average for the benchmark pair never faltered with rate speculation cooling until the group announces its intentions next week we are left to source our motivations elsewhere is there anything material from which the benchmark currency can draw a systemic appeal as a safe haven requires a full tilt liquidity collapse while its carry trade appeal seems a hill too far to climb in other words the dollar is more likely drift and play the supplicant counterpart to more motivated cross currencies with a innate drift towards range reversal certain opportunities may arise chart ofeurusdwith 100 and 200 day moving averages daily one such pair that is positioned with enough event risk to cause a stir though whether it supports a cohesive anti dollar drive is dependent on the outcome of the fundamentals is eurusd theeuroabsorbed ecb president draghi s remarks this past session but his warning of trade war fallout is routine at this point what was more interesting was the surprise auction of 20 year italian bonds which surprisingly were purchased on the market at reasonable yield despite the threat of an excessive debt procedure edp ruling and fine by the eu if that same pass is reinforced today when the eurozone finance ministers meet then there could be a significant charge in store for the euro more likely the currency s recent passive climb will be challenged by the financial realities if that is the case a drift back or motivated retreat could reinforce some appealing technical opportunities like the eurusd s rejection from its 200 day moving average with a break of the 100 day as a support trigger oreuraudat range resistance chart of euraud daily there are other currencies that don t face the

the trump administration insists the only deficit to worry about is the bilateral trade deficit with china but even if china bowed to us demands and eliminated the bilateral deficit america s imbalance of saving and investment would merely shift its external deficit like water in a squeezed balloon towards other surplus economies like the eu japan and south korea the targets of the threatened automotive tariffs for decades the us saving shortfall seemed like a problem to be managed not solved since the us started running structural deficits in the 1970s there has been a kind of global grand bargain on the topic the world willingly finances america s current account deficit in us dollars in exchange the us acts as a guarantor of free trade and global security the trump doctrine upends that bargain by weaponising america s economic leverage including the us dollar it aims to force the world to uphold its end with no guarantee the us will respond in kind this approach will end up costing virtually everyone beginning with american consumers with its trade war the trump administration is engaging in tax subterfuge historically governments have addressed their excessive debts with tax increases spending cuts higher inflation with negative real interest rates or in the case of the roman empire conquest of creditors it seems to be politically impossible for the us government to raise taxes domestically so the trump administration has found a workaround tariff increases end up serving effectively as consumption taxes but because they can be blamed on foreigners they are more palatable to the american public from trump s perspective the costs of this approach appear low with the us economy still growing sharemarkets at record highs and unemployment at record lows jpmorgan has estimated the trade war s direct costs will amount to just 0 2 per cent of gdp for the us 0 4 per cent of gdp for china and 0 22 per cent of gdp for the rest of the world through 2020 advertisement but today s prosperity hinges mainly on the temporary effects of budget busting tax cuts and quantitative easing by the us federal reserve which expanded its balance sheet by 3 6 trillion from 2007 to 2017 it has since reduced that total by 391 billion historically low interest rates and liquidity inflated asset bubbles financed the fiscal deficit and enabled the household sector to deleverage it was thanks largely to qe that us net wealth increased by 33 6 trillion from 2010 to 2018 that wealth was not however shared equally on the contrary the qe centered approach has deepened domestic inequality for example every time the s p 500 has dipped over the last decade corporate share buybacks amounting to 5 trillion from 2008 to 2018 provided a cushion this was technically good for growth the s p 500 index rose by a total of 319 per cent from its 2009 trough to its march 2019 peak but trump s trade war is threatening even those narrowly shared and for the fed costly gains for the top 25 s p companies with a combined market capitalisation exceeding 20 trillion just under one third of revenues come from china and taiwan weighted average meaning tariffs on chinese imports will hit profits tech giants that depend on chips components and software sales to china amounting to 20 65 per cent of total revenue will face particularly high costs as will us shoe importers the trade war seems not to have caused much pain yet because financial markets assume perhaps wrongly that central banks will bail them out with more qe but after 117 consecutive months of economic expansion compared to an historical average of 48 months the us could soon find itself in a painful recession owing to disruptions caused by trump s trade war perhaps then it will be ready for a truce andrew sheng is distinguished fellow of the asia global institute at the university of hong kong xiao geng is professor and director of the research institute of maritime silk road at peking university hsbc business school

june 11 2019 cairo in many instances international trade and politics go hand in hand with strong political ties often leading to stable or thriving trade and exchange between countries such however is not the case when it comes to egypt and turkey whose political relationship is icy at best but who are bound by a mutually beneficial free trade agreement fta which is set to expire in 2020 in 2018 egypt and turkey set a record for bilateral trade between them with turkish exports to egypt totaling 3 05 billion an increase of 29 4 compared to in 2017 and egyptian exports to turkey amounting to 2 19 billion an increase of 9 68 for the same time period yet the egyptian turkish fta signed in december 2005 and entered into force on march 1 2007 faces possible suspension amid the apathy prevailing between ankara and cairo

in a speech at george washington university on wednesday sen bernie sanders laid out his vision of a democratic socialist society and made the case for why an ambitious agenda centered on economic rights for all is the only way to confront america s deep inequities and defeat far right authoritarianism we must recognize that in the 21st century in the wealthiest country in the history of the world economic rights are human rights said sanders a 2020 democratic presidential candidate and that is what i mean by democratic socialism decrying an economic system that has left millions of families one accident or sickness away from complete devastation while billionaires thrive sanders said the democratic party must take up the unfinished business of the new deal and carry it to completion by guaranteeing healthcare education housing and a clean environment to all as a right sanders acknowledged that he and other progressives fighting for a bold transformation of american society will face relentless attacks from the oligarchs and corporate forces invested in upholding the status quo from wall street to the military industrial complex to the pharmaceutical industry on this point sanders quoted a famous line from franklin delano roosevelt never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today they are unanimous in their hate for me and i welcome their hatred i must say the vermont senator added it does sound a little contemporary doesn t it sanders argued that the corporate forces standing in the way of necessary economic political and environmental change can only be overcome by a grassroots progressive movement committed to creating a just society the united states sanders said must reject the corporatist economics and xenophobia of president donald trump and other far right leaders and instead choose a path of compassion justice and love watch sanders s speech entitled how democratic socialism is the only way to defeat oligarchy and authoritarianism sanders s unwavering embrace of the democratic socialist label sets him apart from other 2020 presidential contenders many of whom proudly tout their capitalist credentials and openly scoff at the vermont senator for embracing an alternative economic vision during his state of the union address in february president donald trump took a shot at socialism and declared america will never be a socialist country sanders was one of the few lawmakers who remained seated as republicans and many democrats responded to the president s line with a standing ovation while president trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism they don t really oppose all forms of socialism sanders said they may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches trump and other billionaires in an interview with the nation ahead of his speech sanders detailed what he means by economic rights and last but certainly not least sanders added we re talking about the right to a clean environment over this country you ve got people who are turning on their water faucets today and the water that s coming out is not drinkable it s toxic my friends we are in the midst of a defining and pivotal moment for our country and our planet and with so many crises converging upon us simultaneously it is easy for us to become overwhelmed or depressed or to even throw up our hands in resignation but my message to you today is that if there was ever a moment in the history of our country where despair was not an option this is that time if there was ever a moment where we had to effectively analyze the competing political and social forces which define this historical period this is that time if there was ever a moment when we needed to stand up and fight against the forces of oligarchy and authoritarianism this is that time and if there was ever a moment when we needed a new vision to bring our people together in the fight for justice decency and human dignity this is that time in the year 2019 the united states and the rest of the world face two very different political paths on one hand there is a growing movement towards oligarchy and authoritarianism in which a small number of incredibly wealthy and powerful billionaires own and control a significant part of the economy and exert enormous influence over the political life of our country on the other hand in opposition to oligarchy there is a movement of working people and young people who in ever increasing numbers are fighting for justice they are the teachers taking to the streets to make certain that schools are adequately funded and that their students get a quality education they are workers at disney amazon walmart and the fast food industry standing up and fighting for a living wage of at least 15 an hour and the right to have a union they are young people taking on the fossil fuel industry and demanding policies that transform our energy system and protect our planet from the ravages of climate change they are women who refuse to give control of their bodies to local state and federal politicians they are people of color and their allies demanding an end to systemic racism and massive racial inequities that exist throughout our society they are immigrants and their allies fighting to end the demonization of undocumented people and for comprehensive immigration reform when we talk about oligarchy let us be clear about what we mean right now in the united states of america three families control more wealth than the bottom half of our country some 160 million americans the top 1 own more wealth than the bottom 92 and 49 of all new income generated today goes to the top 1 in fact income and wealth inequality today in the united states is greater than at any time since the 1920s and when we talk about oligarchy it is not just that the very rich are getting much richer it is that tens of millions of working class people in the wealthiest country on earth are suffering under incredible economic hardship desperately trying to survive today nearly 40 million americans live in poverty and tonight 500 000 people will be sleeping out on the streets about half of the country lives paycheck to paycheck as tens of millions of our people are an accident a divorce a sickness or a layoff away from economic devastation while many public schools throughout the country lack the resources to adequately educate our young people we are the most heavily incarcerated nation on earth after decades of policies that have encouraged and subsidized unbridled corporate greed we now have an economy that is fundamentally broken and grotesquely unfair even while macroeconomic numbers like gdp the stock market and the unemployment rate are strong millions of middle class and working people struggle to keep their heads above water while the billionaire class consumes the lion s share of the wealth that we are collectively creating as a nation in the midst of a so called booming economy real wages for the average worker have barely risen at all and despite an explosion in technology and worker productivity the average wage of the american worker in real dollars is no higher than it was 46 years ago and millions of people are forced to work two or three jobs just to survive and here is something quite incredible that tells you all you need to know about the results of unfettered capitalism all of us want to live long happy and productive lives but in america today the very rich live on average 15 years longer than the poorest americans in 2014 in mcdowell county west virginia one of the poorest counties in the nation life expectancy for men was 64 years in fairfax county virginia a wealthy county just 350 miles away life expectancy for men was nearly 82 years an 18 year differential the life expectancy gap for women in the two counties was 12 years in other words the issue of unfettered capitalism is not just an academic debate poverty economic distress and despair are life threatening issues for millions of working people in the country while the rich get richer they live longer lives while poor and working families struggle economically and often lack adequate health care their life expectancy is declining for the first time in modern american history taken together the american dream of upward mobility is in peril in fact if we don t turn things around our younger generation will for the first time in living memory have a lower standard of living than their parents this is not acceptable globally the situation is even more shocking with most of the world s wealth concentrated among a very few while billions of people have almost nothing today the world s richest 26 billionaires now own as much wealth as the poorest 3 8 billion people on the planet half of the world s population but the struggle we are facing today is not just economic across the globe the movement toward oligarchy runs parallel to the growth of authoritarian regimes like putin in russia xi in china mohamed bin salman in saudi arabia rodrigo duterte in the philippines jair bolsonaro in brazil and viktor orbán in hungry among others these leaders meld corporatist economics with xenophobia and authoritarianism they redirect popular anger about inequality and declining economic conditions into violent rage against minorities whether they are immigrants racial minorities religious minorities or the lgbt community and to suppress dissent they are cracking down on democracy and human rights in the united states of course we have our own version of this movement which is being led by president trump and many of his republican allies who are attempting to divide our country up and attack these same communities how sad it is that president trump sees these authoritarian leaders as friends and allies this authoritarian playbook is not new the challenge we confront today as a nation and as a world is in many ways not different from the one we faced a little less than a century ago during and after the great depression in the 1930s then as now deeply rooted and seemingly intractable economic and social disparities led to the rise of right wing nationalist forces all over the world in europe the anger and despair was ultimately harnessed by authoritarian demagogues who fused corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia into a political movement that amassed totalitarian power destroyed democracy and ultimately murdering millions of people including members of my own family but we must remember that those were not the only places where dark forces tried to rise up today we are all rightly repulsed by the sight of neo nazis and klansmen openly marching in charlottesville va and we are horrified by houses of worship being shot up by right wing terrorists but on february 20 1939 over 20 000 nazis held a mass rally not in berlin not in rome but in madison square garden in front of a 30 foot tall banner of george washington bordered with swastikas in new york city but back then those american extremists could not replicate the success of their authoritarian brethren across the ocean because we in the united states thankfully made a different choice than europe did in responding to the era s social and economic crises we rejected the ideology of mussolini and hitler we instead embraced the bold and visionary leadership of president franklin delano roosevelt then the leader of the progressive wing of the democratic party together with organized labor leaders in the african american community and progressives inside and outside the party roosevelt led a transformation of the american government and the american economy like today the quest for transformative change was opposed by big business wall street the political establishment by the republican party and by the conservative wing of fdr s own democratic party and he faced the same scare tactics then that we experience today red baiting xenophobia racism and anti semitism in a famous 1936 campaign speech roosevelt stated we had to struggle with the old enemies of peace business and financial monopoly speculation reckless banking class antagonism sectionalism war profiteering they had begun to consider the government of the united states as a mere appendage to their own affairs we know now that government by organized money is just as dangerous as government by organized mob never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today they are unanimous in their hate for me and i welcome their hatred despite that opposition by rallying the american people fdr and his progressive coalition created the new deal won four terms and created an economy that worked for all and not just the few today new deal initiatives like social security unemployment compensation the right to form a union the minimum wage protection for farmers regulation of wall street and massive infrastructure improvements are considered pillars of american society but while he stood up for the working families of our country we can never forget that president roosevelt was reviled by the oligarchs of his time who berated these extremely popular programs as socialism similarly in the 1960s when lyndon johnson brought about medicare medicaid and other extremely popular programs he was also viciously attacked by the ruling class of this country and here is the point it is no exaggeration to state that not only did fdr s agenda improve the lives of millions of americans but the new deal was enormously popular politically and helped defeat far right extremism for a time today america and the world are once again moving towards authoritarianism and the same right wing forces of oligarchy corporatism nationalism racism and xenophobia are on the march pushing us to make the apocalyptically wrong choice that europe made in the last century today we now see a handful of billionaires with unprecedented wealth and power we see huge private monopolies operating outside of any real democratic oversight and often subsidized by taxpayers with the power to control almost every aspect of our lives they are the profit taking gatekeepers of our health care our technology our finance system our food supply and almost all of the other basic necessities of life they are wall street the insurance companies the drug companies the fossil fuel industry the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex and giant agri businesses they are the entities with unlimited wealth who surround our nation s capitol with thousands of well paid lobbyists who to a significant degree write the laws that we live under today we have a demagogue in the white house who for cheap political gain is attempting to deflect the attention of the american people away from the real crises that we face and instead is doing what demagogues always do and that is divide people up and legislate hatred this is a president who supports brutal family separations border walls muslim bans anti lgbt policies deportations and voter suppression it is my very strong belief that the united states must reject that path of hatred and divisiveness and instead find the moral conviction to choose a different path a higher path a path of compassion justice and love it is the path that i call democratic socialism over eighty years ago franklin delano roosevelt helped create a government that made transformative progress in protecting the needs of working families today in the second decade of the 21st century we must take up the unfinished business of the new deal and carry it to completion this is the unfinished business of the democratic party and the vision we must accomplish in order to accomplish that goal it means committing ourselves to protecting political rights to protecting civil rights and to protect economic rights of all people in this country as fdr stated in his 1944 state of the union address we have come to a clear realization of the fact that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence today our bill of rights guarantees the american people a number of important constitutionally protected political rights and while we understand that these rights have not always been respected and we have so much more work to do we are proud that our constitution guarantees freedom of religion freedom of expression freedom of assembly a free press and other rights because we understand that we can never have true american freedom unless we are free from authoritarian tyranny now we must take the next step forward and guarantee every man woman and child in our country basic economic rights the right to quality health care the right to as much education as one needs to succeed in our society the right to a good job that pays a living wage the right to affordable housing the right to a secure retirement and the right to live in a clean environment we must recognize that in the 21st century in the wealthiest country in the history of the world economic rights are human rights that is what i mean by democratic socialism as dr martin luther king jr said call it democracy or call it democratic socialism but there must be a better distribution of wealth within this country for all of god s children to realize this vision we must not view america only as a population of disconnected individuals we must also view ourselves as part of an inescapable network of mutuality tied in a single garment of destiny as dr king put it in other words we are in this together we must see ourselves as part of one nation one community and one society regardless of race gender religion sexual orientation or country of origin this quintessentially american idea is literally emblazoned on our coins e pluribus unum from the many one and i should tell you it is enshrined in the motto of our campaign for the presidency not me us let me be clear i do understand that i and other progressives will face massive attacks from those who attempt to use the word socialism as a slur but i should also tell you that i have faced and overcome these attacks for decades and i am not the only one let us remember that in 1932 republican president herbert hoover claimed that franklin roosevelt s new deal was a disguise for the totalitarian state in 1936 former democratic new york governor and presidential candidate al smith said in a speech about fdr s new deal policies just get the platform of the democratic party and get the platform of the socialist party and lay them down on your dining room table side by side when president harry truman proposed a national health care program the american medical association hired ronald reagan as their pitchman the ama called the legislation that stemmed from his proposal socialized medicine claiming that white house staff were followers of the moscow party line in 1960 ronald reagan in a letter to richard nixon wrote the following about john f kennedy under the tousled boyish haircut is still old karl marx in the 1990s then congressman newt gingrich claimed president bill clinton s health care plan was centralized bureaucratic socialism the conservative heritage foundation has claimed that the children s health insurance program chip was a step towards socialism former speaker of the house john boehner claimed the stimulus package the omnibus spending bill and the budget proposed by president barack obama were all one big down payment on a new american socialist experiment in this regard president harry truman was right when he said that socialism is the epithet they have hurled at every advance the people have made in the last 20 years socialism is what they called social security socialism is what they called farm price supports socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent labor organizations socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the people now let s be clear while president trump and his fellow oligarchs attack us for our support of democratic socialism they don t really oppose all forms of socialism they may hate democratic socialism because it benefits working people but they absolutely love corporate socialism that enriches trump and other billionaires let us never forget the unbelievable hypocrisy of wall street the high priests of unfettered capitalism in 2008 after their greed recklessness and illegal behavior created the worst financial disaster since the great depression with millions of americans losing their jobs their homes and their life savings wall street s religious adherence to unfettered capitalism suddenly came to an end overnight wall street became big government socialists and begged for the largest federal bailout in american history some 700 billion from the treasury and trillions in support from the federal reserve but it s not just wall street that loves socialism when it works for them it is the norm across the entire corporate world the truth is corporate america receives hundreds of billions of dollars in federal support every single year while these same people are trying to cut programs that benefit ordinary americans if you are a fossil fuel company whose carbon emissions are destroying the planet you get billions in government subsidies including special tax breaks royalty relief funding for research and development and numerous tax loopholes if you are a pharmaceutical company you make huge profits on patent rights for medicines that were developed with taxpayer funded research if you are a monopoly like amazon owned by the wealthiest person in america you get hundreds of millions of dollars in economic incentives from taxpayers to build warehouses and you end up paying not one penny in federal income taxes if you are the walton family the wealthiest family in america you get massive government subsidies because your low wage workers are forced to rely on food stamps medicaid and public housing in order to survive all paid for by taxpayers if you are the trump family you got 885 million worth of tax breaks and subsidies for your family s housing empire that is built on racial discrimination when trump screams socialism all of his hypocrisy will not be lost on the american people americans will know that he is attacking all that we take for granted from social security to medicare to veterans health care to roads and bridges to public schools to national parks to clean water and clean air when trump attacks socialism i am reminded of what dr martin luther king jr said this country has socialism for the rich rugged individualism for the poor and that is the difference between donald trump and me he believes in corporate socialism for the rich and powerful i believe in a democratic socialism that works for the working families of this country what i believe is that the american people deserve freedom true freedom freedom is an often used word but it s time we took a hard look at what that word actually means ask yourself what does it actually mean to be free are you truly free if you are unable to go to a doctor when you are sick or face financial bankruptcy when you leave the hospital are you truly free if you cannot afford the prescription drug you need to stay alive are you truly free when you spend half of your limited income on housing and are forced to borrow money from a payday lender at 200 interest rates are you truly free if you are 70 years old and forced to work because you lack a pension or enough money to retire are you truly free if you are unable to go to attend college or a trade school because your family lacks the income are you truly free if you are forced to work 60 or 80 hours a week because you can t find a job that pays a living wage are you truly free if you are a mother or father with a new born baby but you are forced to go back to work immediately after the birth because you lack paid family leave are you truly free if you are a small business owner or family farmer who is driven out by the monopolistic practices of big business are you truly free if you are a veteran who put your life on the line to defend this country and now sleep out on the streets to me the answer to those questions in the wealthiest nation on earth is no you are not free while the bill of rights protects us from the tyranny of an oppressive government many in the establishment would like the american people to submit to the tyranny of oligarchs multinational corporations wall street banks and billionaires it is time for the american people to stand up and fight for their right to freedom human dignity and security this is the core of what my politics is all about in 1944 fdr proposed an economic bill of rights but died a year later and was never able to fulfil that vision our job 75 years later is to complete what roosevelt started that is why today i am proposing a 21st century economic bill of rights a bill of rights that establishes once and for all that every american regardless of his or her income in entitled to the right to a decent job that pays a living wage the right to quality health care the right to a complete education the right to affordable housing the right to a clean environment the right to a secure retirement over the course of this election my campaign has been releasing and will continue to release detailed proposals addressing each of these yet to be realized economic rights we will also address the attacks that are being launched each day against the civil rights and civil liberties of our people and let me be absolutely clear democratic socialism to me requires achieving political and economic freedom in every community and let me also be clear the only way we achieve these goals is through a political revolution where millions of people get involved in the political process and reclaim our democracy by having the courage to take on the powerful corporate interests whose greed is destroying the social and economic fabric of our country at the end of the day the one percent may have enormous wealth and power but they are just the one percent when the 99 percent stand together we can transform society these are my values and that is why i call myself a democratic socialist at its core is a deep and abiding faith in the american people to peacefully and democratically enact the transformative change that will create shared prosperity social equality and true freedom for all

chinese regulators should step up support for the economy and keep ample liquidity in the financial system vice premier liu he said on thursday suggesting beijing would soon unveil more policies to bolster growth amid rising u s trade pressure trade talks between the world s two largest economies collapsed last month with u s president donald trump accusing china of watering down commitments it had made trump raised tariffs on chinese goods and has threatened even more beijing has plenty of policy tools and is capable of dealing with various challenges liu who is also the lead negotiator in the u s china trade talks told a financial forum in shanghai despite a slew of support measures and policy easing since last year china s cooling economy is still struggling to get back on firm footing and last month s sudden escalation in u s sino tensions has raised fears of a full blown trade war that could trigger a global recession liu s comments came a day after data showed china s credit growth was weaker than expected in may reinforcing market expectations that more monetary easing is needed factory activity contracted in may and imports fell the most in nearly three years highlighting sluggish demand at present we do have some external pressures but those external pressures will help us boost our self reliance in innovation and accelerate the pace of high speed development said liu the government will announce more strong measures to promote reforms and opening up of its markets added liu the prospect of more economic support helped chinese stock markets recover from early losses tremendous room people s bank of china chief yi gang said last week that there was tremendous room to make policy adjustments if the trade war worsens earlier on thursday china daily citing economists said china is expected to adjust money and credit supply in coming weeks including cuts to interest rates or reserve ratio requirements to counter risks if the trade outlook deteriorates the commerce ministry said on thursday beijing will not yield to any maximum pressure from washington and any attempt by the united states to force china into accepting a trade deal will fail cooperation is based on principles and negotiations do have a bottom line and the chinese side will not make concessions on important matters of principle ministry spokesman gao feng told reporters at a regular briefing more rrr cuts further cuts in chinese banks reserve requirement ratios rrr and various forms of cash injections by the central bank had already been expected this year before trade ties soured last month the pboc stepped up efforts to increase loan growth and business activity announcing cuts in regional banks reserve requirements to reduce financing costs for small and private companies it has now cut rrr times six since early 2018 and has also guided short term interest rates lower unlike previous downturns however the central bank has been reluctant to cut benchmark interest rates so far analysts believe it has held off on more aggressive measures due to concerns that such a move could risk adding to a mountain of debt leftover from past stimulus sprees sources told reuters in february that the pboc considered a benchmark cut a last resort but some analysts now think one or more cuts are likely if the trade dispute spirals out of control and the u s federal reserve starts cutting its rates giving the pboc more room to manoeuvre some analysts believe the chances of a lasting trade deal are receding as both sides show signs of digging in but u s president donald trump has said he plans to meet his chinese counterpart xi jinping at a g20 summit later this month currency risks more forceful policy easing could also trigger capital outflows and add pressure on the chinese yuan the yuan has fallen nearly 3 percent since early may and is nearing the closely watched 7 per dollar mark a level last seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago china is capable and confident of maintaining stable operation of the foreign exchange market and keeping the yuan basically stable at reasonable and balanced levels pan gongsheng head of the state administration of foreign exchange said at the forum citing experts china daily said financial institutions were facing tighter liquidity in june and said authorities want to spur faster credit growth to meet economic targets beijing has set a growth target of around 6 to 6 5 for this year down from 6 6 in 2018 which was the slowest rate of expansion the country has seen in nearly 30 years analysts at bank of america merrill lynch believe gdp growth could fall to 5 8 this year and 5 6 in 2020 if the trade war intensifies and expects beijing to respond with four benchmark rate cuts more rrr cuts consumption subsidies and measures to stabilise employment on monday the government announced steps to give local governments more financing flexibility so they can increase infrastructure spending a key part of the stimulus plan that has not revived investment as quickly as some china watchers had expected the escalating trade dispute has gone beyond tariffs as the two countries increase pressure on each other to cede ground chinese state media has warned that beijing could use rare earths for its next strike the united states relies on china for supplies of the rare earths to make a host of high tech products china also holds about 1 12 trillion in u s treasuries stirring talk that beijing could start dumping u s bonds but many analysts believe this so called nuclear option is unlikely given the damage it could inflict on financial markets and the global economy china is a responsible investor in global financial markets pan said source reuters

spread the love hong kong is in danger of blowing up and could drag mainland china along with it beijing appears set on ending the one country two systems principle as it pushes forward in supporting an extradition bill that would allow hong kong residents to be sent to the mainland the extradition bill is something that threatens hong kong s autonomy and will discourage many business and investors staying in hong kong thousands of protesters marched on major highways attempting to storm the legislative council in protest of the extradition bill and that could continue for days the situation remains tense as tear gas was used during yesterday s protests the protest leader jimmy sham noted demonstrators will remain in the streets until the government withdraws the proposed bill chief executive carrie lam noted that the withdrawal of the proposed extradition bill would weaken hong kong s rule of law it appears we could see an extended standoff here china is in tough position as they are short dollars and running down their reserves they use hong kong as hub to raise dollars for their working capital to do trade with the rest of the world most of their transactions are done with the dollar but if hong kong loses favor with the international community chinese growth would be dealt another blow the hong kong crisis could continue to escalate in the coming days and should weigh on risk appetite trade deal updates could fall to the second page of papers but eventually we could see chinese politics blend together us stocks finished the day modestly lower across the board as trade tensions wiped away earlier gains that stemmed from the morning release of cooler us inflation data that cemented many analysts view that rate cuts are coming this july chinese politics hong kong protests to weigh on trade deals fed rate cut bets supported on soft inflation readings eur trump considering blocking nord stream 2 gbp parliament rejects bill to block no deal brexit hong kong dollar surges on funding squeeze oil crude production continues to outpace demand gold higher on hong kong protest trade uncertainty and fed rate cut bets chinese politics markets are still processing how the hong kong protests could unravel chinese politics and possible trade deals will the us link these developments to the trade deal beijing s push for this extradition bill could prove costly as investors and businesses value hong kong s autonomy uncertainty with hong kong s autonomy will dampen business prospects and put a further strain on chinese growth if the us and europe become involved it could complicate relations and future trade deals hong kong is china s primary spot for raising us dollars is critical for china s business with the rest of the world the us could escalate this political problem into a major trade issue that could see the ending of hong kong s favored trading status hong kong is the most over levered economy in the developed world the banking system is close to 900 of gdp if we see this proposed extradition bill become law over the next couple months we could see hong kong s economy crumble us inflation softer than expected us inflation in may supported fed rate cut bets to occur at the july 31st meeting slowing economic readings will continue to solidify the end of the fed s tightening cycle and expectations should grow for two rate cuts to get priced in by the summer odds for a rate cut at the july 31st meeting rose to 7 percentage points to 82 3 while the next week s meeting remained around 20 the core consumer price index which removes energy and food costs climbed 2 from a year earlier missing forecasts of 2 1 while the monthly reading delivered its fourth straight monthly muted inflation will make the fed s job easier and with the risks of increased hitting the global economy the question is no longer will they cut but by how much the yield on 10 year treasuries slumped 2 3basis points to 2 120 while the dollar initially fell to the weakest levels in almost two months but settled slightly higher on the day eur the euro sank after president trump stated he is considering sanctions to block the nord stream 2 gas pipeline between russia and germany the us has been skeptical of thwarting off germany s dependence on russia for energy and this is one of the rare topics that trump does have bipartisan support the nord stream 2 is under construction and could split the eastern european nations away from the central and western parts the us is concerned this will solidify russia s control over the region s energy supply possibly threatening fuel to the ukraine which is now a key transit hub sanctions on companies contracted to work on the pipeline could derail the pipeline which is expected to begin at the end of the year the effects to the russian economy would be very negative on lost energy revenue and loss of doing business with the west today s headlines reminded market participants trump remains the tariff man and that the eventual trade talks between the us and europe will likely see a barrage of tariff threats to enhance the us negotiating stance gbp while expectations remain low for any new conservative leader to deliver brexit by october 31st the risk of a no deal brexit remain firmly in place mps voted 309 to 298 rejecting labour s attempt of stopping a no deal brexit boris johnson kicked off his partly leadership campaign and assuaged cable traders after stating i am not aiming for a no deal brexit outcome the candidate that was supposed to be the one leading the charge for a hard brexit appears to be trying to win over votes with a slightly softer stance hkd the protests over the extradition bill is delivering a squeeze in local lending rates which makes it more expensive to borrow the hong kong dollar in the front end which has strengthened hkd today the hong kong currency is at its strongest levels since december expectations are for hkd to return to the weaker part of the band after the funding squeeze ends oil the eia crude inventory report delivered another surprising build of 2 21 million barrels last week expectations were for a draw of 1 million barrels with a wide range of estimates of a 3 7 million draw to a 3 0 million build oil was already sharply lower going into the data and eventually extended losses cushing accounted for 2 096 million barrels of the total build confirming the api s rise which saw the strongest gains since february the rise in cushing is mainly being attributed to the midwest flooding that disrupted many pipelines and refineries west texas intermediate crude fell to a four month low following trump s gloom comments on trade oil prices will be unable to shrug off global growth concerns along with rising us inventories gold gold prices rose as uncertainty persists with how chinese political uncertainty and trade deals will unravel in the coming month the yellow metal also got a boost from cooler inflation data that also increased fed rate cut bets which could coincide with a pullback with the us dollar the softer than expected inflation data should be supportive gold in the short term

file photo an employee counts chinese yuan banknotes at a bank of china branch in hefei by zheng li and david stanway shanghai reuters chinese regulators should step up support for the economy and keep ample liquidity in the financial system vice premier liu he said on thursday suggesting beijing would soon unveil more policies to bolster growth amid rising u s trade pressure trade talks between the world s two largest economies collapsed last month with u s president donald trump accusing china of watering down commitments it had made trump raised tariffs on chinese goods and has threatened even more beijing has plenty of policy tools and is capable of dealing with various challenges liu who is also the lead negotiator in the u s china trade talks told a financial forum in shanghai despite a slew of support measures and policy easing since last year china s cooling economy is still struggling to get back on firm footing and last month s sudden escalation in u s sino tensions has raised fears of a full blown trade war that could trigger a global recession liu s comments came a day after data showed china s credit growth was weaker than expected in may reinforcing market expectations that more monetary easing is needed factory activity contracted in may and imports fell the most in nearly three years highlighting sluggish demand at present we do have some external pressures but those external pressures will help us boost our self reliance in innovation and accelerate the pace of high speed development said liu the government will announce more strong measures to promote reforms and opening up of its markets added liu the prospect of more economic support helped chinese stock markets recover from early losses tremendous room people s bank of china chief yi gang said last week that there was tremendous room to make policy adjustments if the trade war worsens earlier on thursday china daily citing economists said china is expected to adjust money and credit supply in coming weeks including cuts to interest rates or reserve ratio requirements to counter risks if the trade outlook deteriorates the commerce ministry said on thursday beijing will not yield to any maximum pressure from washington and any attempt by the united states to force china into accepting a trade deal will fail cooperation is based on principles and negotiations do have a bottom line and the chinese side will not make concessions on important matters of principle ministry spokesman gao feng told reporters at a regular briefing more rrr cuts further cuts in chinese banks reserve requirement ratios rrr and various forms of cash injections by the central bank had already been expected this year before trade ties soured last month the pboc stepped up efforts to increase loan growth and business activity announcing cuts in regional banks reserve requirements to reduce financing costs for small and private companies it has now cut rrr times six since early 2018 and has also guided short term interest rates lower unlike previous downturns however the central bank has been reluctant to cut benchmark interest rates so far analysts believe it has held off on more aggressive measures due to concerns that such a move could risk adding to a mountain of debt leftover from past stimulus sprees sources told reuters in february that the pboc considered a benchmark cut a last resort but some analysts now think one or more cuts are likely if the trade dispute spirals out of control and the u s federal reserve starts cutting its rates giving the pboc more room to manoeuvre some analysts believe the chances of a lasting trade deal are receding as both sides show signs of digging in but u s president donald trump has said he plans to meet his chinese counterpart xi jinping at a g20 summit later this month currency risks more forceful policy easing could also trigger capital outflows and add pressure on the chinese yuan the yuan has fallen nearly 3 percent since early may and is nearing the closely watched 7 per dollar mark a level last seen during the global financial crisis a decade ago china is capable and confident of maintaining stable operation of the foreign exchange market and keeping the yuan basically stable at reasonable and balanced levels pan gongsheng head of the state administration of foreign exchange said at the forum citing experts china daily said financial institutions were facing tighter liquidity in june and said authorities want to spur faster credit growth to meet economic targets beijing has set a growth target of around 6 to 6 5 for this year down from 6 6 in 2018 which was the slowest rate of expansion the country has seen in nearly 30 years analysts at bank of america merrill lynch believe gdp growth could fall to 5 8 this year and 5 6 in 2020 if the trade war intensifies and expects beijing to respond with four benchmark rate cuts more rrr cuts consumption subsidies and measures to stabilise employment on monday the government announced steps to give local governments more financing flexibility so they can increase infrastructure spending a key part of the stimulus plan that has not revived investment as quickly as some china watchers had expected the escalating trade dispute has gone beyond tariffs as the two countries increase pressure on each other to cede ground chinese state media has warned that beijing could use rare earths for its next strike the united states relies on china for supplies of the rare earths to make a host of high tech products china also holds about 1 12 trillion in u s treasuries stirring talk that beijing could start dumping u s bonds but many analysts believe this so called nuclear option is unlikely given the damage it could inflict on

excerpts from recent editorials in the united states and abroad ___ june 5 china daily on the united states approach to chinese telecommunications equipment company huawei us secretary of state mike pompeo may think he has been doing a good job in throttling the growth of chinese telecommunications equipment company huawei because wherever he goes he has tried to sell the notion that the company poses a severe threat to national security and intelligence and dissuade the countries concerned from doing any business with it but he might have been overdoing it a little bit even to the extent that the well intentioned advice as he claims it is has sounded more like coercion that even his hosts find it hard to accept during his visit to the netherlands early this week pompeo told his hosts not to do anything that would endanger our shared security interests by embracing huawei prompting his dutch counterpart to retort that every country must make its own security decisions the us top diplomat had already harped on the same string in germany last week urging chancellor angela merkel s government to take actions against chinese espionage and warning the us might have to change its behavior regarding intelligence sharing if berlin failed to do so the fact that pompeo has often received a cold shoulder when trying to smear huawei in this way shows his audiences know when they are being fed a line he seems to have forgotten that country to country relations are built on common interests not one dictating to another what the other can and cannot do that s why the united kingdom has so far resisted washington s call to shun huawei in its new 5g network despite the tremendous pressure it faces from the us because it knows firsthand that the chinese company does not threaten its national security as it has already been closely involved in its 4g network if he truly believes that huawei is bent on helping the chinese government spy on other governments even after it has proposed to sign no spy deals with possible partners and even after countries have put themselves on high alert in response to the us sounding constant alarm bells pompeo should at least consider changing tactic rather than keep on babbling about an imagined danger he should have confidence in the counterintelligence capabilities of the world s sole superpower and let other governments give huawei s equipment and system a try if huawei is spying the us should be able to catch it red handed that outcome if it materialized would save pompeo all the trouble of traveling around the world trying to convince a largely incredulous audience after all facts speak louder than words online ___ june 4 the virginian pilot on the victims of a mass shooting in virginia beach keith cox served the residents of virginia beach in the public utilities department for 12 years well liked by co workers he spent his final moments on friday working to protect them from a gunman in the municipal center sacrificing his life in the process the remembrance of cox published in the pilot on monday is one of many heartbreaking stories to emerge from the darkness that still hangs over this community four days after the worst mass shooting in the city s history attention should be paid to the criminal investigation being conducted by local state and federal law enforcement agencies they are diving into the details of the shooter s life his movements prior to the attack and the possible motivation for this horrific act in the hope of gaining some insight into why and how this happened but for now our focus should be on those precious lives cut short on friday celebrating their memory and paying tribute to their selflessness they deserve no less from the community they served so let us remember cox the public utilities account clerk who was described as a jovial caring co worker and a talented singer in the choir at new hope baptist church where his father serves as pastor as the shooter roamed the building cox ushered several employees into an office telling them to lock the door while he looked for others to help rich nettleton spent 28 years working for the city as a utilities engineer a norfolk resident and old dominion university graduate he was a lieutenant for the army s 130th engineer brigade in germany where he served with beach city manager dave hansen joshua hardy spent more than four years as an engineering technician but loved ones remembered him as a devout christian whose love for children led him to author the abc book on protecting yourself from strangers a book he self published in 2011 missy langer worked as an administrative assistant in the public utilities department for 12 years neighbors recalled her as a passionate pittsburgh steelers fan she had a tough few years long both her parents in the last five years but was proud of the life she built in virginia beach kate nixon was an engineer with a decade of experience working for the city whose love of her husband and three children was plainly evident to all who knew her alex gusev came to this country from belarus in 2003 and was recalled by a colleague as a model professional who handled right of way issues for virginia beach he was also a graduate of odu who was quick to help friends and loved ones in need for most of her 24 years in virginia beach government mary lou gayle worked as a right of way agent who was recalled by neighbors for the upkeep and improvements made to her home which was described as gorgeous a parishioner at st john the apostle catholic church gayle was well thought of by all those in her orbit tara gallagher a graduate of portsmouth s woodrow wilson high school earned two engineering degrees from odu before joining the city six years ago laquita brown a chesapeake resident was a right of way agent for more than four years bert snelling was a contractor visiting building 2 for a permit when the shooting began another odu graduate chris rapp joined the city 11 months ago after serving as stafford county s public works director for two years he was recalled for his love of bagpipes which he played with tidewater pipes drums and his devotion to family and friends and bobby williams who joined the city in 1981 was repeatedly honored for his lengthy public service throughout his career he was the type of employee who provides invaluable continuity and institutional memory to municipal government stories about each of the victims are available to read they have been told with respect grace and sensitivity honoring the memory of each life lost and the emotional toll on those left behind hold them all in your hearts online ___ june 4 the wall street journal on u s economic policies as the election results became clear in 2016 financial markets rose amid a surge of economic optimism that surge continued for two years as donald trump and republicans pursued a pro growth agenda of tax reform deregulation and encouraging domestic energy production but with democrats now controlling the house and mr trump already campaigning for re election washington is again taking an anti growth turn don t be surprised if slower growth follows that s the disappointing big picture if you step back from the daily fray and look at the direction of u s economic policy mr trump s first two years were focused relentlessly on ending the economic malaise of the obama years nearly every policy was seen through a growth prism but as he focuses on re election mr trump is returning to the issues that marked the worst moments of his 2016 campaign he is restrictionist on immigration increasingly protectionist on trade and more interventionist in regulating business he favors price controls on drugs a mandate for paid family leave and his regulators are revving up what looks like it could become the largest federal antitrust campaign since the 1970s meanwhile house and senate democrats are advancing their own election agenda that includes higher taxes and new regulation on finance and industry the only pro growth measure that could pass would be mr trump s renegotiated nafta deal but that is in greater jeopardy after last week s tariffs on mexico gridlock will probably prevail through 2020 but investors will have to start discounting the chance that democrats could implement much of their agenda in 2021 all of this is already hurting growth and especially business investment the institute for supply management s manufacturing index fell to 52 1 in may its lowest since 2016 surveys of cfos show that investment plans for 2019 have slowed sharply amid the new policy uncertainty a majority of business earnings calls mention trade as a major concern the residual good news is that the policy reforms of 2017 built considerable pro growth momentum that led to 3 1 growth in 2018 the labor market is still buoyant and wages are rising yet these are often lagging indicators and consumer confidence typically declines if markets and growth fall falling bond yields are signaling a growth slowdown and the yield curve is inverted in what nearly always predicts a recession if it continues for three months the atlanta federal reserve s gdp now estimate for second quarter growth is down to 1 3 and even some long time bulls are warning that we may be looking at a return to the slow growth of the obama years mr trump seems to believe the federal reserve can make everything great again by cutting interest rates and he may get the rate cuts he wants this year we opposed the fed s rate increase in december and that advice looks vindicated by declining inflation but the fed can t offset bad trade policy by itself u s tariffs have a negative impact on growth around the world which in turn hurts u s exports that s part of the explanation for the recent decline in u s manufacturing as slower growth abroad means declining demand for american goods we aren t predicting recession though you can t rule that out if mr trump follows through on his worst trade threats against china mexico and europe asterisk asterisk asterisk a conceit of nearly all politicians is that they can get away with bad economic policies without paying too high a price barack obama believed that his regulatory assaults on business had more benefits than costs his economic advisers told him that higher tax rates don t matter they should have learned otherwise after eight years of 2 growth and slow wage gains that laid the path for mr trump in 2016 now mr trump and his republican fellow travelers think they can impose tariffs willy nilly with little damage they say the doomsayers were wrong about the impact of the initial round of china tariffs and in any case the tariffs are popular with the public they say mr trump needs wedge issues against democrats in 2020 and he can run as a trade hawk on china against joe biden but mr trump campaigned in 2016 on reviving the economy and the surge of growth has helped to offset his personal unpopularity bad policies operate at the margin and their effect is cumulative the initial tariffs were dwarfed by the growth effects of tax reform and deregulation but the damage from tariffs will rise if they increase in severity and are imposed impulsively sooner or later bad policies always exact a high economic and political cost online ___ june 4 the plain dealer of cleveland ohio on the anniversary of d day on june 7 1944 readers of the plain dealer got a firsthand account of the allies pivotal d day landing the day before from the paper s war correspondent roelif loveland writing from a balcony seat high up in god s heaven as flak and tracer bullets lit up the sky around his aircraft and the cleveland family of 1st lt howard c quiggle was also able to read that he was alive and well and piloting the b 26 marauder that had ferried loveland to his eagle s perch above the battle riding the tail of a comet to see history in the making as loveland wrote in his page one story after that fateful day the d day landings that changed the course of war and accelerated adolf hitler s slow descent to defeat were launched 75 years ago this week we will accept nothing less than full victory came the order from supreme commander of the allied expeditionary force u s gen dwight d eisenhower yet victory was never certain a handwritten note from ike written in case of defeat concludes the troops the air and the navy did all that bravery and devotion to duty could do if any blame or fault attaches to the attempt it is mine alone fortunately bravery and devotion as well as luck planning daring and deep sacrifice by those who launched and fought on those bloody beaches did the trick attacking along 50 miles of shoreline more than 4 000 allied troops fell on that first day but many more followed beginning the drive for berlin where are they now those intrepid paratroopers bombardiers pilots medics army rangers and all those others who stormed ashore on june 6 1944 like 1st lt quiggle and roelif loveland a world war i combat veteran considered one of the greatest writers ever to grace the pages of the plain dealer most have passed on to their rewards only about 30 american survivors are expected to attend this year s d day battle anniversary in france nearly 350 world war ii veterans die every day the u s veterans affairs department estimates according to the associated press pretty soon they all will be gone and the rest of us must be the ones to carry forward their stories and remember the history they forged and their sacrifice and that of their fallen comrades longtime plain dealer military affairs reporter brian albrecht has helped by spending years compiling vivid stories from d day survivors and others who fought in or contributed to the war effort during world war ii twelve of those stories were highlighted in sunday s plain dealer from the 2008 remembrances of the late english clerk betty leighty of parma heights who came to the united states as a war bride in 1946 to john bistrica s vivid 1994 depiction of the tumultuous bloody landing at omaha beach and the night he spent freezing wet and hungry in a 20 foot hole he had to dig himself bistrica at 95 was recently profiled in the vindicator of youngstown where he lives their powerful stories need to be remembered along with the d day fight so crucial to ultimate victory in that war but are our collective memories fading too fast an associated press story in the plain dealer tuesday reported that many states no longer require d day to be part of the history curriculum the ohio department of education s 52 page model american history curriculum posted at education ohio gov does not mention d day that doesn t mean that teachers can t teach it and many probably do and educators might argue that as we get farther away in time from a conflict teaching its root causes and long term impacts becomes more important than the specifics of any given battle but specifics of battle also matter the nitty gritty reality of war matters so on this 75th anniversary of the d day battle we collectively should resolve to work harder to make sure this history this sacrifice this longest day isn t lost when the last veteran of that battle departs his earthly existence online ___ june 4 the los angeles times on the tiananmen square protests thirty years ago tuesday the world watched in horror as chinese troops cracked down brutally on peaceful protests by students who sought to give the chinese people more say over their daily lives the lingering image of the pro democracy movement though was from the next day when a lone unarmed man stopped a column of tanks in tiananmen square it was a symbol of courage defiance and the power of an individual sustained perhaps by the fact that he s never been identified and his fate is unknown to many in the west the crackdown was but a death rattle of an authoritarian system on the wrong side of history as the growing liberalized chinese economy spread prosperity across the country and as the internet opened a window into free world thought and culture they believed the pressure for democracy and self determination would become irresistible in the three decades since then the chinese economy has in fact grown spectacularly lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty and creating a strong middle class but the technology that helped chinese people to connect to one another in unprecedented ways also enabled orwellian surveillance and propaganda operations that have helped cement the chinese communist party s autocratic grip on power the chinese government has also used concerns about terrorism as a pretext to enact cynical security laws that give it even more power to spy on online traffic suppress dissent and block foreign nonprofits from assisting its critics meanwhile by allowing some public pushback on the digital margins tolerating small scale online agitation for consumer protection or improvements in public works the government pantomimes the accountability found in a democracy true change remains a mirage as a result china s pro democracy movement seems to be sustained mainly by activists who ve fled to safer shores it s telling that while we in the west can still see the tank man photos watch the video and read about the incident the chinese government is trying to erase them from its people s memory but then tanks are so 20th century today the fist of chinese oppression is best symbolized by the reeducation camps in xinjiang province roughly 2 000 miles west of tiananmen square where the chinese government has detained up to 2 million muslims in an effort to combat alleged separatism and religious extremism among the native uighurs not coincidentally the province is a key outpost in china s belt and road initiative that aims to increase china s exports to and its influence over south asia africa and europe we certainly hope that china s growing prosperity and integration into global commerce will prove inimical to its authoritarian impulses but the years since the tiananmen square protests have shown us that progress toward liberty and democracy is not inevitable in china the government sells stability as the guarantor of the economic growth that the public craves when its real aim is to keep the forces of change at bay online ___ june 4 the houston chronicle on storm recovery funds can you hear us now the trump administration s outrageous delays in making available more than 12 billion in storm recovery funds about 4 3 billion of the total is for texas have finally been dealt with the house on monday approved a senate bill that sets a 90 day countdown for the administration to formally invite states such as texas to submit spending plans for the money that will kick start the release of the funds that means flood recovery funds approved by congress just months after hurricane harvey hit in 2017 will get to texas in 2020 that s astoundingly tardy and yet even getting that much grease in the gears took quite literally an act of congress when texas land commissioner george p bush began raising hell with the administration over the delays early this year folks at housing and urban development which administers the funds and the office of management of budget which approves all new rules seemed anything but fazed at that time aides to both sen ted cruz and sen john cornyn told the editorial board that they had also been hammering at the administration to add a sense of urgency none of that got far instead what worked was individual members of congress decided to cross party lines and introduce legislation that would force the administration s hand cornyn teamed with sen joe manchin the west virginia democrat on a bill to require the disbursement of the funds a similar bill was authored in the house by a gaggle of members of congress including rep lizzie fletcher d houston neither bill passed but cornyn and others managed to include its basic provisions in a larger disaster funding bill that did now all that s required is president donald trump s signature which he s expected to give congratulations to cornyn manchin and the house members who made it so perhaps there s a lesson about dealing with the president talk is cheap but legislation can produce results as we await the presidential signature we note that many questions have been left unanswered why was the administration so slow hud officials told the editorial board earlier this year that because the funds were being spent in new ways on preventing future flood damage rather than repairing damage from previous floods new rules were needed congress was right to change the focus of these funds but hud should never have allowed the simple change to slow things down so profoundly others worried that the real reason for the delays flowed from the president s bitter reaction to puerto rico and the recovery it so badly needs in the wake of hurricane maria absent proof we ll pray that the latter feud played no role in the delays and either way the intricacies of team trump s machinations can be the subject for a debate another day the welcome news this week is that congress intervened in a way that should pay dividends for texas and fairly soon online ___ june 1 the new york times on recent deaths on mount everest because it s there for those who grew up on george mallory s famous explanation for his yearning to scale mount everest with all the romance danger and spirit of exploration it implied that viral photograph of an endless line of climbers in puffy parkas inching their way to the summit came as a profound shock danger there is at least 11 people died on the mountain this year as did mr mallory in 1924 the year after that interview with the times leaving forever open the question of whether he had first reached the summit all but two of those who died this climbing season perished on the way down overcome by altitude sickness and exhaustion after the hourslong delays created by the traffic jam in the oxygen starved atmosphere above 28 000 feet the other two fell as the snow and ice on the mountain succumb to climate change it is becoming common for climbers to come across the remains of those who died over the years but romance for mr mallory the need to reach the highest point on the planet was instinctive a part i suppose of man s desire to conquer the universe the conquest however has turned out to entail a landscape littered with tons of plastic bottles food tins excrement ropes and tents and scores of oxygen starved tourists lining up to take a selfie on the summit the fatalities this year were more than double last year s and the estimated 810 climbers to reach the 29 029 foot high 8 848 meters peak were the most ever as the climbing season came to an end the recriminations began many focused on the loose standards set by the government of nepal and the proliferation of dubious expedition companies china also runs expeditions from its side of the mountain but fewer use that route and the controls are said to be tighter on the nepal side anyone can pick up an everest permit for 11 000 and the total package with guides equipment food and lodging for a six week expedition can easily exceed 50 000 in one of the world s poorest countries that s a flow of money the government is loath to reduce nepalese officials are belatedly considering setting proficiency standards for climbers and limiting the numbers on the mountain to reduce congestion and garbage at the summit that should happen before the next climbing season begins but however disturbing the deaths and the queues everest still poses one of the greatest physical and mental challenges our planet has to offer and trying to deny it to people is as futile today as it was when the times writer interviewing mr mallory concluded with this appeal be not beguiled o armchair explorer stick to the comparative security of your subway strap online

taylor said india looks fantastic in that way people are prepared to pay out for that quality because the earnings are probably going to hold up better if trade tensions continue or escalate further southeast asia also is looking pretty safe he said the one thing that has hurt over the last year or 18 months has been the rise of rates in the us and the dollar taylor said if trade tensions continue you either have no rate hikes or you have potential cuts in terms of that the main thing is you re not going to have that pressure in the other emerging markets of having the dollar go up

treasury secretary steven mnuchin accused china on saturday of allowing the value of the yuan to slide in order to offset the cost of tariffs if i was the i wouldn t cut rates until i saw the evidence that the things were slowing down he said unless there is evidence that they over tightened i would be surprised if they acted that quickly and i d also be surprised that they didn t keep some ammunition ready for later to get through the uncertainty fed chairman jerome powell said last week that the central bank was closely monitoring how trade tensions between the us and other countries including mexico and china might affect the us economic outlook and would act as appropriate to sustain the expansion the trump administration has since called off a plan to place tariffs on all goods from mexico first at 5 per cent and then escalating them up to 25 per cent if the us southern neighbour did not take action to stop the flow of undocumented immigrants the threatened tariffs against mexico announced last month shook american businesses and financial markets the longer term view is very positive for asia in terms of different sources of domestic demand valuations cheap sovereign

rates lower unlike previous downturns however the central bank has been reluctant to cut benchmark interest rates so far analysts believe it has held off on more aggressive measures due to concerns that such a move could risk adding to a mountain of debt leftover from past stimulus sprees sources told reuters in february that the pboc considered a benchmark cut a last resort but some analysts now think one or more cuts are likely if the trade dispute spirals out of control and the u s federal reserve starts cutting its rates giving the pboc more room to maneuver some analysts believe the chances of a lasting trade deal are receding as both sides show signs of digging in but u s president donald trump has said he plans to meet his chinese counterpart xi jinping at a g20 summit later

municipal issuers are benefiting from lower interest rates and investor demand that seem at least partly driven by the nearly constant talk of tariffs and trade wars though in the longer term that volatility could hurt credit market participants discussed the effect of trade uncertainty after president donald trump last week rescinded his plans to impose a 5 tariff on mexican imports saying he had reached an agreement with mexico to reduce the flow of migrants through the border mexico is the u s s second largest trading partner totaling about 671 billion in goods and services last year according to the u s trade representative trump said in 2018 that trade wars are good and easy to win and has not been shy to threaten the use of tariffs against countries he believes are treating the u s unfairly in may the u s increased existing tariffs to 25 from 10 on more than 300 billion of imports from china and reportedly contemplated more the u s imported 450 billion of goods from china in 2018 the majority through seaports according to a fitch ratings report the apparent constant threat of trade wars creates ripples in the municipal bond market as investors begin to search for safe tax advantaged investments and borrowing costs decline we see and we ve seen for the last year or more continual inflows into the mutual funds and that s additional money to be invested in the muni space said ben watkins director of the division of bond finance in florida that means additional money to be invested which means additional demand for munis so that s clearly positive for the issuer community ben watkins director of the division of bond finance at the florida state board of administration speaks during a panel discussion at the annual meeting of the securities industry and financial markets association sifma in new york u s on tuesday oct 27 2009 the theme of this year s meeting is building a new foundation for investor confidence economic stability and growth photographer ramin talaie bloomberg local caption ben watkins ramin talaie bloomberg watkins said the trade uncertainty affects the muni market indirectly through the interest rate effect and stokes fears that global economic growth will slow a year ago you had robust global growth and people were talking about how many times the federal reserve was going to increase interest rates in the future watkins said now as a consequence of the trades wars and talks of tariffs there s fear that global growth is going to go down it leaves central banks less able to increase rates and instead decrease them to stimulate growth to offset the potential effects of tariffs and trade wars watkins said there s been a significant and unexpected improvement in interest rates from a borrower s perspective and that s another good thing watkins said for the municipal bond market that means additional refundings more issuers will move issuances up by three to six months to take advantage and lock down the low rates for future projects watkins said tariffs could be part of a handful of explanations as to why interest rates have been low said david erdman wisconsin s capital finance director something is driving municipal rates to where they re at right now erdman said i don t think many economists predicted that this is where the market would be as summer approaches normally slow months could see more activity as issuers look to take advantage of lower interest rates issuers are looking to sell longer term fixed rate bonds because they are able to lock in lower interest rates erdman said supply is probably going to be a little bit heavier this summer compared to the typical summer months erdman said i think it reflects the current market and that issuers are probably lining up some financings with a little bit of urgency to take advantage of the current market state impacts a strong economy has blunted trade war effects but it is still something to keep an eye on analysts said trade wars are bad for the economy but it s a really strong economy right now and so it hasn t tipped the balance said john ceffalio municipal credit research analyst at alliance bernstein but we are absolutely monitoring this and paying attention for its impact on credit tariffs are beginning to impact farm states such as north dakota south dakota nebraska iowa and illinois ceffalio said however since the dakotas and nebraska don t issue many municipal bonds it isn t having an impact on the market ceffalio said in a moody s report released in may the group said china s boycott on u s soybeans will dampen income in iowa s agricultural sector an agricultural trade war with china will have an outsized impact on iowa the report said iowa s total soybean exports are at about 2 of gross state product and are larger relative to the state s economy than all but two other states south dakota and north dakota according to moody s investors service moody s estimated that iowa s total soybean exports to china alone were equivalent to 1 of the state s gsp ports inevitably ports are affected by ongoing trade wars one of the larger impacts will likely be on seaports to the extent that the tariffs have an impact on chinese imports and exports particularly on the west coast where there s a lot of trade activity between those ports said scott monroe director in fitch ratings global infrastructure and project finance group gantry cranes unload maersk a s containers from a ship at the port of los angeles in los angeles california u s on wednesday march 28 2018 long only exchange traded funds etfs linked to broad baskets of energy metals and agricultural products attracted 2 66 billion this quarter bloomberg intelligence estimates show while that s the largest quarterly inflow in data going back to 2005 the stream of money slowed in march as the u s china trade row clouded the outlook for economic growth photographer patrick t fallon bloomberg patrick t fallon bloomberg revenue structures used at ports protect them in the short to medium term ports will sometimes have long term guaranteed contracts that provide a revenue floor helping to insulate port revenue from trade related volume volatility said emma griffith senior director for global infrastructure at fitch to date griffith hasn t seen a drop off but sees volatility as shippers try to get their volumes in before tariffs go into effect also import volumes aren t falling because production is still in china and shipped to the u s that could change in the long term if producers decide to move to other countries and decide to ship to other ports for example switching from the west coast to the east coast griffith said then you would start seeing shifts in where volumes might be coming into the united states and so that could affect some ports but that s a much longer term effect she said cranes are also becoming an issue for ports as some of the cranes used are on the tariff list the port of charleston recently learned that the state ports authority would have to pay an extra 36 million for 12 cranes the american association of port authorities signed on to a letter earlier this month with 140 associations to the u s chamber of commerce opposing tariffs in mexico and supporting the united states mexico canada agreement a product of the renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement nafta is still in effect and the usmca would still need a congressional vote tariffs on mexican imports would harm u s consumers workers farmers and businesses of all sizes across all sectors making us less competitive and undermining efforts to negotiate strong trade deals in the future the letter said we oppose unilateral tariffs and any subsequent retaliation

image shutterstock some argue that us tariffs will force china to make large concessions on trade but there is a risk that the growing pressure will make beijing less not more likely to compromise on key issuespresident xi jinping set a hard tone for china s intensifying trade war with the united states back in june when he met with a high powered group of american and european executives in beijing the us had just threatened to impose tariffs on 200 billion of chinese goods and the chinese leader warned his foreign guests that this action would have consequences in the west you have the notion that if somebody hits you on the cheek you turn the other cheek xi reportedly told the assembled ceos in our culture we push back the message xi was sending was clear after decades of hiding its strength and biding its time beijing had decided to go toe to toe with washington on issues it considered central to its interests in the months since many analysts have been waiting for beijing to abandon this hardball approach as us tariffs began to inflict economic pain beijing would be forced to soften its stance to secure a much needed end to the trade war the implementation of the 200 billion round of tariffs in september did accelerate china s economic slowdown though domestic factors were possibly more important as winter rolled on business sentiment plummeted the stock market continued its precipitous decline and exports retail and property sales all took a hit however there have been few signs of a change in beijing s negotiation tactics according to zhang baohui director of the centre for asian pacific studies at lingnan university in hong kong xi s team is unwilling to make meaningful concessions on two issues in particular the government s support for large state owned enterprises soes and for high tech companies in emerging industries through initiatives like the made in china 2025 industrial strategy the chinese have said that they can make concessions they will stop forcing american companies to transfer technologies do better to restrain cyber theft and open more service sectors these are not big deals for china says zhang but they have stood firm on the most controversial issues several senior figures in the trump administration including us trade representative robert lighthizer view forcing beijing to cut back its preferential policies for soes and domestic high tech firms as a key goal of the trade war it was assumed that any deal to roll back tariffs would include chinese pledges on these structural issues yet those expecting a chinese climb down have continually been disappointed after a crunch meeting between presidents trump and xi at the g 20 summit in buenos aires on december 1 both sides released statements summarizing discussions and the issues for further negotiation neither version mentioned soe reform or made in china 2025 a few days later xi delivered a speech in the great hall of the people which he was expected to use to unveil eye catching reforms designed to address us concerns instead he extoled the party s achievements and declared no one can be the master jiaoshiye of the chinese people the us is sure to keep pressuring china to make changes on soes and made in china 2025 which the country believes hands chinese companies an unfair advantage lighthizer discussed china s industrial strategy with vice premier liu he during a call shortly after the g 20 the wall street journal reported but reports that the chinese leadership plans to abandon the policy appear wide of the mark beijing does not talk about made in china 2025 anymore but things haven t changed much on the ground one chinese entrepreneur told nikkei asian review in january i don t think the government will ever pull back their support an economic crisis or another escalation in the trade war could still force beijing to backtrack and lighthizer may lobby to raise tariffs further for this reason if thinks he s not going to get a good deal he ll be content keeping the tariffs on a senior lobbyist told the financial times in november but the theory that china can be pressured into abandoning centrally controlled industrial policies may be a miscalculation american discussions of the trade war have focused on the costs for china of not doing a deal without considering how china weighs up the other side of the ledger capitulating to washington would have profound political consequences for the chinese government ideology is a foundation of the party s position trumping all other issues on top of that there is a long history largely forgotten in the us but studied keenly in the corridors of zhongnanhai the leadership compound next to tiananmen square informing china s trade war strategy and this history makes china cautious of acceding to us demands for many in beijing the trade war confirms long held suspicions that the united states is determined to thwart china s rise as the world s next superpower more and more in china s elite circle now think trump s trade war is not just about fair trade and trade balance zhang told bloomberg in september rather it is a containment program to change china s long term power trajectory as a result us demands that china abandon made in china 2025 have tended to be viewed by beijing as being motivated not by concerns over fair competition but by a desire to make sure america keeps its lead in the global innovation race public statements from senior figures in the trump administration have fueled these concerns when i came we were heading in a certain direction that was going to allow china to be bigger than us in a very short period of time the president said at a west virginia rally in august that s not going to happen anymore when asked last year whether the administration s trade policy aimed to prevent china becoming a world leader in high tech industries peter navarro director of the white house national trade council replied exactly beijing views the trade war not as an isolated incident but part of a longer history of us attempts to undermine rival powers according to richard mcgregor senior fellow at the lowy institute china pays particular attention to the trade dispute between america and japan in the 1980s i know from talking to chinese officials that they have studied the japan us example thoroughly says mcgregor the chinese saw the plaza accord as a deliberate effort by the americans to hobble a competitor and they re determined that they won t allow it to happen to them the plaza accord was a 1985 agreement between washington and tokyo under which japan promised to revalue its currency to lower its trade surplus with the us a move that many argue created japan s bubble economy most japanese don t see it like that points out mcgregor but it s like a catechism inside the people s bank of china china and the us have largely moved on from arguments over the value of the rmb but the distrust of american intentions lingers another lesson beijing appears to have drawn from the japan us dispute is that capitulating to american demands simply embolden us negotiators to ask for even more as mcgregor explains in his book asia s reckoning which charts the history of china japan us relations the reagan administration pressured tokyo for years to limit exports of semiconductors to the us market and buy more american chips japan eventually agreed to a deal guaranteeing us chip companies 20 of the japanese market while japan insisted the deal was a one off the united states would later try to use the agreement as a template for demanding similar targets for market share of american goods in other sectors mcgregor writes comments from chinese officials involved in negotiations with the us suggest that beijing fears a similar situation today will the us side keep coming back for more after we strike a deal one policymaker asked the wall street journal in january the upshot is that beijing may not see striking a deal with washington as a way to gain relief from us pressure rather it may see the cost of surrender as even higher than that of carrying on the fight as a result if washington wants to secure a lasting agreement with beijing it may first have to convince it that its intention is to protect a rules based system not undermine china s long term development as many in china fear this will be a tough sell on the issue of made in china 2025 as beijing considers this policy crucial to china s future there is an enormous gap between how china and the united states perceive the strategy which aims to make china globally competitive in several high tech industries american reporting on the policy often describes it as china s plan to dominate the industries of the future the council on foreign relations an influential washington think tank has described made in china 2025 as a real existential threat to us technological leadership lighthizer appeared to be alluding to this analysis when he commented in march there are things that if china dominates the world it s bad for america for beijing by contrast made in china 2025 is considered the only way to counter an existential threat to its own economy rising labor costs in the country s manufacturing sector factory wages rose 64 between 2011 and 2016 according to euromonitor this is undermining the competitiveness of chinese manufacturers which have been the engine of china s growth for decades and still generate nearly 30 of the country s gross domestic product gdp these trends are of concern to beijing because many countries have followed a similar growth trajectory to china in the past but ended up losing their economic dynamism and falling into what economists call the middle income trap according to the world bank there were 101 economies considered middle income in 1960 meaning that their per capita gdp was between 1 000 and 12 000 by 2008 only 13 of these economies had managed to achieve high income status with a per capita gdp of 8 827 as of 2017 china is right at the most challenging stage in the development cycle failing to make the transition to a high income economy is a real prospect the top leadership is highly concerned about the middle income trap says zhang jun dean of the school of economics at fudan university making the transition to a high income economy will need increasing productivity across all sectors but also moving up the value chain to high end manufacturing and technology this is what made in china 2025 is designed to achieve made in china 2025 is crucial to leading the chinese economy out of the middle income trap says zhang you have to keep upgrading manufacturing over time for this reason china is unlikely ever to agree to roll back made in china 2025 completely the potential long term economic costs are simply too high the us is more likely to convince china to make changes to the strategy if it focuses talks on the technicalities of the policy rather than china s technological ambitions more generally however this trade conflict ends i don t think it s going to involve much of a climb down by china from what it regards as its sovereign right to pursue the objectives laid out in made in china 2025 says george magnus former chief economist at ubs and author of red flags why xi s china is in jeopardy the two sides will have to agree on rules perhaps with regard to industrial policy beijing will understandably point to examples of other major countries pursuing industrial policies such as germany with its industrie 4 0 plan for advanced manufacturing to justify its use of a state led development model but the us may be able to shift made in china 2025 onto a more market friendly trajectory the trade war and the sudden economic slowdown have forced beijing to rethink assumptions about its growth model according to zhang of fudan university the top leadership is reviewing the package of policies that was created over the past couple of years says zhang they now specify that china should continue to make the system more open and to continue with structural reform this may allow washington to press beijing to open made in china 2025 for more participation by foreign companies the strategy currently sets targets that 70 of core components in key technologies should be domestically made by 2025 and the foreign business community has repeatedly complained that this is leading local governments to prevent overseas firms from bidding for contracts china s large scale government support for research and development and startups however is likely to be nonnegotiable beijing s overall support for innovation is almost certain to increase not decrease the past year has driven home to beijing just as much as washington that relying too much on foreign technology could have national security implications in november the us department of commerce revealed that it was considering trying to curb exports of a wide range of strategic technologies from fields including artificial intelligence robotics microprocessors and quantum computing if this policy became law it would have profound consequences for the chinese economy china is still highly dependent on foreign technology in several areas the country buys 27 of the world s industrial robots and imports 260 billion of semiconductors per year even the risk of a us export ban or other restrictions on china s access to key technologies will force beijing to accelerate the development of domestic technology firms it s quite obvious that the threat from the us will reinforce the commitment of the chinese leadership to put more emphasis on domestic innovation says zhang china would mobilize resources to support development work on several of the key technologies including microchips how washington would react to remains to be seen there will be those urging the white house to hit beijing harder in the hope of extracting further concessions on this issue however the extra pressure may simply lead china to retreat further into its shell

corresponding period of the prior fiscal year continued organic sales growth was fuelled by balanced growth in both comparable store sales and in the total number of stores over the past twelve months from 1 170 stores on april 29 2018 to 1 236 stores on may 5 2019 comparable store sales grew 5 8 in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 over and above comparable store sales growth of 2 6 in the same quarter a year ago comparable store sales growth for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 consisted of a 4 9 increase in average transaction size primarily driven by an increase in units per basket and a 0 9 increase in the number of transactions gross margin was 42 1 of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 43 8 of sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 gross margin is lower due to a small decrease in the product margin higher sales of lower margin items and the timing of certain logistics costs general administrative and store operating expenses sg a for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 122 1 million a 8 0 increase over 113 1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 this increase is primarily related to the continued growth in the total number of stores sg a for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 represented 14 7 of sales compared to 15 0 of sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the 0 3 improvement is mainly the result of ongoing labour productivity initiatives and the positive impact of the annualization of a non labour related initiative implemented at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2019 net financing costs increased by 3 2 million from 22 4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 to 25 6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 the increase is mainly due to increased borrowings on long term debt and net financing costs now include costs related to lease liabilities as calculated under ifrs 16 for both periods net earnings increased to 103 5 million or 0 33 per diluted common share in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 compared to 101 5 million or 0 31 per diluted common share in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 this increase in net earnings is mainly the result of a 9 5 increase in sales and lower sg a as a percentage of sales partially offset by a lower gross margin earnings per common share were also positively impacted by the repurchase of shares through the corporation s normal course issuer bid over the past 12 months dividend on june 13 2019 the corporation announced that its board of directors had approved a quarterly cash dividend for holders of its common shares of 0 044 per common share the

supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance we believe that non gaap measures are important supplemental metrics of operating and financial performance because they eliminate items that have less bearing on our operating and financial performance and thus highlight trends in our core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on gaap measures we also believe that securities analysts investors and other interested parties frequently use non gaap measures in the evaluation of issuers many of which present non gaap measures when reporting their results our management also uses non gaap measures in order to facilitate operating and financial performance comparisons from period to period to prepare annual budgets and to assess our ability to

how socialism presidential election 2020 could affect the gold market the 2020 presidential election is already shaping up to be one of the most bitterly contested in history the outcome could have enormous ramifications for all asset markets including precious metals in the meantime a lot can happen before november 2020 especially with the federal reserve apparently set to turn dovish and cut interest rates this summer some historical research into presidential election cycles suggests that the stock market tends to perform well heading into an election year the incumbent administration tends to focus on padding economic statistics and during election years fed officials who swear up and down they aren t motivated by politics tend to avoid making policy moves such as rate hikes that could make them vulnerable to political attacks gold and silver fared well last time a republican stood for re election gold and silver which are less tied to the economy than stocks show little recent correlation with election years the last time a republican incumbent was up for re election was 2004 incumbent president george w bush faced off against democrat challenger john kerry gold and silver markets performed well in the second half of 2003 and made modest gains in 2004 the metals were in the early stages of a major bull market in 2008 when barack obama and john mccain were vying for the white house the financial crisis hit silver got slammed along with virtually all other assets during that infamous autumn gold however weathered the storm quite well and ended up putting in a gain for the year the stunning election victory of donald trump in 2016 lit a fire under the stock market and put something of a damper on retail demand for physical precious metals in the united states although gold prices are now up since trump s election win and inauguration silver has trended lower and coin and bar demand remains soft compared to the heady years under president obama unlike stocks precious metals tend to benefit from the fear trade if a pro socialist democrat actually wins the white house in 2020 you can bet a lot of investors will decide to hunker down and get defensive gold and silver markets may begin to display an inverse correlation to trends in president trump s poll numbers however larger macro forces now in motion namely steadily rising government debt and accommodative monetary policy will stay in motion through next year s election and beyond regardless of who wins it s only a matter of whether the election results accelerate the debt fueled monetary crisis that is coming if the gop keeps the white house in 2020 it s not necessarily bad news for metals investors recall that when george w bush won re election in november 2004 gold was trading at a mere 450 oz the money metal went on to hit a record 1 000 oz in early 2008 over that same period silver advanced from under 8 oz to over 20 oz importantly precious metals vastly outperformed the stock market through the four years of bush ii s second term radical leftists push democrats to go for broke on spending promises some in the conservative media stamp democrats as suffering from trump derangement syndrome unhinged hatred of the president is only part of what s driving democrats to take increasingly radical positions packing the supreme court abolishing the electoral college abolishing ice censoring the internet medicare for all green new deal etc even before trump the base of the democrat party had been lurching ideologically to the left today democrat candidates are being pushed to reject mixed economy welfare statism and fully embrace socialist doctrines nearly the entire field of democrat presidential candidates has essentially adopted bernie sanders platform one exception former colorado governor john hickenlooper who is running as a pragmatic problem solver with a business background he recently gave a speech to california democrats in which he said socialism was the wrong way to go he was roundly booed meanwhile 76 year old uncle joe biden is disavowing himself to appease far left activists but that is proving to be difficult for him under pressure he suddenly reversed his decades long support of the hyde amendment which bars federal funding of most abortions biden is also trying to play catch up to the trillions in new spending programs proposed by bernie sanders and elizabeth warren clumsily rolling out a partially plagiarized clean energy revolution that would cost the economy at least 5 trillion 2020 prediction winner will embrace more money printing as for senator pocahontas warren has gone off the reservation when it comes to taxing spending and printing currency out of thin air she would pay for her multi trillion dollar progressive wish list by instituting a new wealth tax and pushing the u s dollar lower i e inflation as warren put it her monetary policy vague as it is would entail more actively managing our currency value it sounds like modern monetary theory mmt which is likely coming in one form or another in the years ahead as the government struggles just to pay interest on an exponentially growing debt load under mmt the government would directly print the dollars it needs to close its deficits rather than issue new bonds similar monetary experiments didn t work out so well in zimbabwe and venezuela given president trump s repeated clashes with the federal reserve over what he sees as too tight monetary policy he might be all too willing to support a bipartisan push for a more actively managed more inflationary monetary system investors who are thinking about selling precious metals or refraining from buying until trump leaves office should check their premises

the art of the new deal photo david mcnew getty images from a certain angle bernie sanders s case for socialism is the same as margaret thatcher s for free market capitalism there is no alternative in a speech at george washington university on wednesday afternoon the vermont senator made several arguments for his political philosophy many of these aimed to dispel the misconception that the self avowed socialist and his political revolution are trying to do anything particularly radical rather sanders suggested that what he calls democratic socialism is akin to 21st century new deal liberalism seventy five years ago the united states had a president who insisted that true individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence and proposed the establishment of a second bill of rights one that would guarantee all americans health care housing and a useful and remunerative job in a sense sanders s modest ambition is to revive and update the conventional wisdom of the democratic establishment circa 1944 this is a sound rebuttal to the claim that sanders s vision is extreme or un american though for that reason it does little to clarify why the senator insists on branding his ideology with a term that much of the american electorate still associates with soviet communism nevertheless by coopting the right s expansive definition of socialism which holds that any major government intervention in the economy that conservatives don t like is a fulfillment of marx s vision sanders was able to recast the terms of america s economic debate in 2008 after their greed recklessness and illegal behavior created the worst financial disaster since the great depression with millions of americans losing their jobs their homes and their life savings wall street s religious adherence to unfettered capitalism suddenly came to an end sanders said wednesday overnight wall street became big government socialists and begged for the largest federal bailout in american history over 1 trillion from the treasury and even more from the federal reserve but it s not just wall street that loves socialism when it works for them it is the norm across the entire corporate world one can pick many bones with sanders s wording here e g wall street was a beneficiary of big government largesse long before 2008 but his remarks call attention to an important fact americans already live in a country where unelected bureaucrats pick economic winners and losers where public policy exerts a massive influence over the distribution of income where some indolent americans live off the hard labor of others and where the state directs investment toward official conscious ends if these are the defining features of socialism then the united states lost the cold war before it began and the real debate between left and right in the u s isn t over whether big government should intervene in markets or even how much it should but rather who should have a say over how it intervenes and whose interests such socialism should serve there may be more politically optimal ways of making this point or at least ones that do less violence to marx s conception of socialism but sanders s broad argument is a vital one america s existing political economy is much easier to defend if one posits that the gross inequities it produces are ordained by an invisible hand if some natural economic process dictates that wage growth must be tepid while corporations sit on cash or that urban workers must be rent burdened while landlords live high off their labor or that major financial institutions must be insulated from risk while underwater homeowners are left to drown then one can plausibly argue that government action to alter such outcomes would be hubristic and self defeating who is man to challenge the wisdom of the market gods by contrast if the electorate were to recognize that these outcomes are largely determined by public policy then apologists for the existing order would have a much harder time rationalizing acquiescence of course many libertarians will readily concede that the state has its grubby fingers all over american capitalism they disdain the bank bailouts the corporate subsidies and the massive government jobs program that is the military industrial complex some may even object to the generous patent protections the state uses to shelter drug companies from the threat of competition but even if it were politically possible to excise all these distortions our nation s economy would still bear the imprint of human hands after all legal markets are themselves a kind of big government program absent a sovereign entity capable of enforcing contracts by commanding a monopoly on violence mass commerce between strangers is nigh impossible less abstractly the introduction of private property across the north american continent required massive state violence and investment meanwhile some human agency must decide roughly how much sovereign currency should be in circulation at any given time and this decision will inevitably have large economy wide implications on how markets function and whose interests they best serve tight money will privilege those rich in cash by increasing the value of their holdings and thus the interest rates they can charge for lending them loose money can privilege borrowers by triggering inflation that reduces the cost of their debts these points may seem banal sophisticated conservative thinkers are well aware that money doesn t grow on trees and markets do not make themselves but efforts to naturalize the economy s basic ground rules by obscuring the state s inescapable role in setting them remain pervasive in america s political discourse which is unfortunate the case for re politicizing the foundations of our economy has rarely been stronger than it is today as sanders suggests the 2008 crisis exposed the depths of the financial industry s dependence on the u s government and simultaneously the u s government s extraordinary capacity to shelter its favorite constituents from the slings and arrows of outrageous irresponsibility less transparently the crisis and the long lackluster recovery also exposed the profound and inescapably political powers wielded by the federal reserve as mike konczal and j w mason wrote for the roosevelt institute in 2017 during 2007 and 2008 it was the decisions of the fed that determined which troubled financial institutions would survive which would be absorbed by other institutions and which like lehman brothers would be allowed to fail during the summer of 2008 when the commercial paper market that provides short term financing to the nation s largest corporations had essentially ceased to function the fed stepped in to replace private lenders by making loans directly to nonfinancial as well as financial businesses that had previously borrowed in the commercial paper market the fed effectively replaced private banks as the source of short term loans for corporate america during the slow recovery that followed the fed continued purchasing large volumes of mortgage backed securities as well as longer dated treasuries through the programs the explicit logic of these policies was to induce private financial institutions to hold a different mix of assets than they would have chosen on their own ultimately in the hopes of financing activities that would eventually boost aggregate demand in other words unelected bureaucrats picked the finance industry s winners and losers created a public option for short term corporate financing and manipulated asset prices by creating artificial demand for various securities all for the sake of promoting their conception of the public interest these moves combined with the fed s more mundane decision to start hiking interest rates which is to say to deliberately cool the economy even as labor force participation wages and inflation all remained aberrantly low were among the most consequential policy choices of the past decade by driving up the value of financial assets quantitative easing exacerbated wealth inequality by suppressing demand in a noninflationary environment the fed s rate hikes since 2015 have served to needlessly consign americans to involuntary unemployment and reduce the leverage workers exercise over their employers when one further considers the myriad other ways the fed could have attempted to stimulate demand but chose not to the weight of its decisions grows even heavier and yet the supposedly self governing american people were almost unanimously oblivious to these decisions which were treated as purely technical matters that required little to no democratic input elite conservatives attuned to these developments did not hesitate to criticize the fed for its socialistic violations of the free market s purity but as konczal and mason explain this critique is naïve for many both inside and outside the fed these kinds of large scale asset purchases represent undesirable distortions of financial markets but as bernanke 2017 notes these criticisms are incoherent the goal of all monetary policy is to set financial conditions consistent with full employment and stable prices so it is always going to produce a different pattern of asset prices and yields than it would have obtained otherwise and in any case there is no such thing as undistorted values of interest rates terms and risk premia etc these are always influenced by the policy choices of both the central bank and the elected government we should adopt a more expansive and thus more realistic and more politically productive view of the central bank s role in directing credit and shaping outcomes in financial markets the crisis and the response to it are not exceptional they reflect the need for and the reality of conscious planning in financial markets when the federal reserve first began purchasing mortgage backed securities in the aftermath of the crisis it did so to facilitate interbank lending by removing toxic assets from the private sector s balance sheets but by keeping the policy in place long after financial stability was restored the central bank has effectively been encouraging banks to make more housing loans by inflating demand for mortgage backed securities which may be a fine policy but if our central bank is now in the business of subsidizing certain forms of credit creation to advance specific social goals such as home ownership should we perhaps have a democratic debate about which social goals we would like to pursue for example if the demos decided that long term human survival was a worthy objective perhaps the fed could finance investments that address climate change including the development of non carbon energy sources and building retrofits to reduce energy use judy shelton the top candidate for donald trump s next fed nomination understands the hazards of acknowledging that america already resembles a socialist country at least in the nomenclature of a conservative polemicist like many other conservatives shelton recoils from the realities of modern monetary policy and naïvely advocates a return to a natural prepolitical market economy as she told the financial times how can a dozen slightly less than a dozen people meeting eight times a year decide what the cost of capital should be versus some kind of organically market supply determined rate the fed is not omniscient they don t know what the right rate should be how could anyone ms shelton said if the success of capitalism depends on someone being smart enough to know what the rate should be on everything we re doomed we might as well resurrect gosplan she said referring to the state committee that ran the soviet union s planned economy sanders s implicit argument is quite similar if our capitalist economy depends on constant discretionary interventions by policy makers we might as well determine those interventions through democratic debate and aim them at advancing the best interests of the 99 percent we are all socialists now some of us just happen to be democratic ones

introduction and summary as policymakers think about solving college affordability for future students they must not forget about the tens of millions of borrowers already holding college debt fortunately the policy community is starting to develop new ideas for current borrowers as well for instance multiple presidential campaigns have outlined policy proposals that forgive some student loans or make changes to repayment options policymakers increasingly recognize the importance of bold ideas to address college affordability those ideas include beyond tuition a plan that moves toward debt free higher education rolled out by the center for american progress 1 under the plan families pay no more than what they can reasonably afford out of pocket with additional expenses covered by a combination of federal state and institutional dollars there are also strong proposals for debt free college from sen brian schatz d hi and for tuition free college including one from sen bernie sanders i vt as well as calls for free community college championed by sen tammy baldwin d wi and rep bobby scott d va 2 understanding the potential implications of each of these policies overlaid with considerations about equity simplicity aiming for broad impact and whether the solution provides tangible relief can provide policymakers with a clearer sense of the different ways to address the nation s 1 5 trillion in outstanding student debt that said it is important to acknowledge that there are other types of student debt that need future solutions for example borrowers hold an estimated 119 billion in private loans for college 13 private student loans carry no government guarantee against default and typically have less generous terms than federal student loans such as the ability to repay loans based upon income 14 in addition families may also accrue college debt through the use of credit cards or home equity loans but there are no available data on the extent to which these forms of credit are used these items merit further discussion and their own set of solutions which at the very least should start with making private student loans easily dischargeable in bankruptcy this report focuses only on options for federal student loans which are the largest single source of college debt representing more than 92 percent of outstanding student loan balances 12 in addition because federal student loans are held or guaranteed by the federal government it is easier for the executive or legislative branches to implement program changes that can help borrowers regardless of when they borrowed this report considers different options for addressing issues for current borrowers of federal student loans these solutions are meant to be independent of broader loan reforms such as giving relief to borrowers whose schools took advantage of them these options also presume keeping and preserving key existing benefits such as public service loan forgiveness pslf intentionally this report does not endorse or recommend a specific policy rather it assesses the benefits and potential considerations around a range of ideas going from the most aggressive forgiving all student debt to more technical changes involving interest rates or repayment plans by examining the trade offs and the targeting of each policy the hope is that policymakers and the public can make the most informed decision when it comes to selecting which policy best supports their goals and values broad breakdowns of borrowers by debt level and attainment status can also mask particular challenges related to equity for instance black or african american students who earned a bachelor s degree had a default rate nearly four times higher than their similarly situated white peers 10 students who are veterans parents first generation college students or are low income are also likely to face higher risk of default 11 by contrast borrowers who completed a degree especially at the graduate level are less likely to default but may still face struggles related to repayment for instance the u s department of education projects that just 6 percent of the dollars lent to graduate students ultimately go into default compared with 13 percent of funds lent to college juniors and seniors or a quarter of loans for students in their first or second year at a four year institution 8 graduate borrowers however might face a different set of challenges related to having unsustainably high debt burdens more than one third of borrowers who owe 40 000 or more an amount of debt that only graduate students or independent undergraduates can obtain in principal are paying their loans back on a repayment plan that ties their monthly payments to their income suggesting that their student loan debt otherwise represents too large a share of their income 9 if these plans are not well managed by the federal government and easy for borrowers to use they could put millions of individuals in financial distress this could take a few forms one of which is causing borrowers who use these plans to accumulate large amounts of additional interest that they must repay if they fail to stay on the plan or if their payments do not fully satisfy outstanding interest effectively targeting key stress points when it comes to the student debt crisis requires understanding the different ways student loans can and do create challenges for borrowers for example two thirds of those who default on their student loans are borrowers who either did not finish college or earned only a certificate 5 at 45 percent the average default rate for these individuals is three times higher than the rate of all other borrowers combined 6 the median cumulative student loan debt for all defaulters is rather low at 9 625 7 no matter the proposal solutions for current borrowers must go hand in hand with tackling affordability for tomorrow s students about 43 million adult americans roughly one sixth of the u s population older than age 18 currently carry a federal student loan and owe 1 5 trillion in federal student loan debt plus an estimated 119 billion in student loans from private sources that are not backed by the government 3 moreover college debt is even more concentrated among young people an estimated one third of all adults ages 25 to 34 have a student loan 4 and while it is true that not every student borrower is in distress student debt is an issue that both has an acute effect on many borrowers lives and raises broader concerns for the overall economy policy goals for helping current borrowers regardless of specifics the relative costs of these proposals are relevant in considering which approach to take and how these options should be assessed in the context of other progressive goals within and beyond higher education policy that require new investments a one time policy also has the benefit of heading off concerns about moral hazard for individuals as well as institutions policies that anticipate regular forgiveness could result in institutions intentionally overpricing programs because they know students debt would be forgiven or similarly for students to borrow more than they need by contrast making forgiveness a one time benefit based on circumstances at the time of its announcement makes the program much less likely to be exploited the costs associated with these proposals are also different from many other policy ideas because they are not intended to be ongoing expenses these ideas are meant to be course corrections that will be addressed going forward by large new investments in college affordability that lessen if not eliminate the presence of debt that means they have a high upfront cost but should not require ongoing expenses the one exception to this is student loans stemming from graduate education because existing affordability proposals currently focus only on undergraduate education this report attempts to consider the cost of various options where possible unfortunately it is impossible to model many of these proposals due to data limitations for example the authors cannot model changes to idr because the education department does not release data on incomes paired with debt levels of borrowers who use these plans similarly the cost of changes to interest rates are unknown because they are affected by assumptions about broader economic situations 26 finally the costs presented here do not consider potential returns to the federal government in terms of economic stimulus which are plausible should americans be unburdened from their debt in other cases meaningful relief might require the reform to be sufficiently substantive so the borrower notices for example a borrower who owes 30 000 at a 5 percent interest rate will pay less in total if their rate goes down by half a percentage point but that only translates into savings of 7 28 a month which is unlikely to feel like a meaningful difference student debt is not just an abstract thing that lives on a spreadsheet for borrowers in debt a loan can feel like an unending stressful obligation with no relief in sight for this reason it is important for borrowers to see and feel actual relief under any program solution for current student debt in some cases this might entail addressing potential unintended consequences for example income driven repayment idr may solve unaffordable monthly payments by aligning borrowers payments with how much money they earn however because interest keeps accumulating borrowers who make smaller payments on these plans may watch their balances grow leaving the borrowers with the sense of digging a deeper hole even if forgiveness is an option while it is crucial that every policy option for current student loan borrowers contain a focus on equity striving for broad impact is also important reaching as many people as possible can help build support for an idea it also interrelates with simplicity broader eligibility definitions that reach more people could result in less work to figure out who should be eligible for relief finally aiming for broader impact also increases the chances of capturing additional people who desperately need relief but whose situation may not be as clear from just a look at their income educational attainment or other easily measurable characteristics therefore a successful policy for current borrowers should be clear and simple both in its message and in its execution that means striving wherever possible for approaches such as automatic enrollment or reenrollment that ensure that government employees and contractors not borrowers bear any complexity that might exist in the policy too often public policy may seem effective in the abstract but suffers from overly complex execution public service loan forgiveness is a prime example the basic idea of forgiving federal student loans for individuals who work a decade in a public service job is easy to communicate but when overlaid with four gating criteria qualifying loans employment repayment plans and payments the policy in practice becomes a complex nightmare which leads to borrower frustration and delayed or lost benefits 25 there is significant overlap among these populations for example nearly 60 percent of black or african american students also received a pell grant as did almost half of hispanic or latino students 23 similarly about 60 percent of students who are single parents received a pell grant and about 30 percent of single parent students are black or african american versus 15 percent of all students 24 the result is that a policy specifically aimed at one population such as relief for pell recipients will also affect many but not all the individuals in these other groups more specifically an equity lens should consider the following groups of borrowers and how well a given proposal would serve them these are individuals who are traditionally not well served by the higher education system or who data show are highly likely to struggle with student loans while the exact reason why they struggle is unknown it may because of factors such as an absence of generational wealth or the economic safety nets from their family that their peers have it is crucial therefore that any policy aimed at current student loan borrowers include an equity lens to acknowledge and tackle these differences the continued unaffordability of higher education has forced too many students into debt that a rational financing system would support only with grant aid these students then experience significant challenges repaying their loans which can in turn affect their ability to build wealth and access a middle class lifestyle while the various challenges student loans present may be clear for certain individuals who are in different situations and financial circumstances meaningful variations exist even for borrowers who otherwise have the same levels of educational attainment and or income this can be due to other factors such as the presence or absence of familial wealth or discrimination in housing or employment the worries and challenges facing student loan borrowers are not uniform for some a student loan represents a significant risk of delinquency and default such an outcome can be catastrophic ruined credit garnished wages and social security benefits seized tax refunds denial of occupational and driver s licenses and the inability to reenroll in college 15 for other borrowers student debt constrains or delays their ability to access and sustain the most basic markers of the middle class such as saving for retirement and purchasing a home which can in turn increase wealth student loan debt may also deter family formation as couples may be concerned about covering the additional expense of having a child regardless of which problem a given policy tries to solve it is important that it consider four factors equity simplicity striving for broad impact and providing a sense of meaningful relief understanding how a given policy idea lines up against each of these goals can help policymakers ensure they optimize their solutions for the problems they want to address and in a manner that would be effective more on each of these goals follows below overall the purpose of any policy proposal for current student loan borrowers has to be about reducing the negative effects of these debts that said each policy idea may attempt to address a different negative effect for example policies focused on interest rates target negative effects related to the size of monthly payments which can help with faster repayment over time meanwhile policies focused on immediate forgiveness are about reduction in the amount owed right away while those with longer term forgiveness may be about creating a safety net for those with perpetual struggles 6 policy options to assist existing student loan borrowers rather than recommending a specific proposed option this report offers a combination of both commonly proposed ideas and new ones generated by the center for american progress and generation progress staff it is also worth noting that these options are intended to be one time solutions that could pair with a larger plan for tackling affordability going forward such as cap s beyond tuition combining a prospective affordability plan with this relief should cut down on the number of future loan borrowers and lessen the need for subsequent large scale relief policies 1 forgive all federal student loan debt under this proposal the federal government would forgive all outstanding federal student loans this option would also require waiving taxation of any forgiven amounts estimated cost 1 5 trillion in cancellation plus an unknown amount of anticipated interest payments both of which would be adjusted by whether education department already expected it to be repaid for example a 10 000 loan that the agency did not expect to be repaid at all would not cost 10 000 in forgiven principal there would also be costs associated with not taxing forgiven amounts which also must be part of the policy estimated effects it would eliminate debt for all 43 million federal student loan borrowers 27 considerations does it address equity forgiving all debt would get rid of loans for all the populations identified in the equity goal outlined above that said by helping every student loan borrower it will also end up providing relief to some individuals who are otherwise not struggling or constrained by their loans in other words while helping eliminate loans for all single parents it will also provide a windfall for borrowers with higher balances who are having no trouble with repayment how simple is it from a borrower standpoint this policy should be easy to implement for borrowers since it should not require any opting in or paperwork how broad is its impact this policy would help all 43 million federal student loan borrowers will it feel like relief yes borrowers will not have to make any payments so they will feel the change who are the greatest beneficiaries from a dollar standpoint the highest balance borrowers have the most to gain from this proposal especially those who also have higher salaries they would experience the greatest relief in terms of reduction of monthly payments while also having the wages to otherwise pay back the debt this is because undergraduate borrowing is capped in law at 31 000 or 57 500 depending on if they are a dependent or independent student whereas there is no limit on borrowing for graduate school 28 those who have higher incomes would also feel larger benefits by freeing up more of their earnings to put toward other purposes therefore those with debt from graduate education especially for high paying professions such as doctors lawyers and business would significantly benefit that said this proposal would help anyone who is particularly worrying about or struggling with their student loans whether they are in or nearing default in addition research suggests loan cancellation would help stimulate national gross domestic product which has broad based societal benefits 29 what is the biggest advantage the policy is universal and it could be implemented without the need of action on the part of borrowers as long as there are no tax implications for forgiveness what is the biggest challenge this option carries the largest price tag by far it also would result in forgiving a substantial amount of loan debt of individuals who have the means to repay their debt this includes borrowers with graduate degrees and potentially high salaries in law medicine or business how could this option be made more targeted limiting forgiveness to only undergraduate loans would help target the plan s benefits because there are many graduate students studying in fields linked to high incomes who have no undergraduate loan debt 30 the education department unfortunately does not provide a breakdown of the amount of outstanding undergraduate student loan debt thus it is not possible to know the cost of this policy tweak 2 forgive up to a set dollar amount for all students this option forgives the lesser of a borrower s student loan balance or a set dollar amount such as 10 000 25 000 50 000 or some other amount it would also require waiving any required taxes on the forgiven amounts doing so provides a universal benefit that ensures loan debt will be completely wiped away for borrowers who have a balance below the specified level while those with higher debts also get some relief estimated cost the total cost varies depending on the dollar level chosen for example forgiveness of up to 40 000 for all borrowers would result in canceling 901 2 billion while forgiveness of up to 10 000 would cancel 370 5 billion both cases would also have additional costs in the form of expected future interest payments but it is not possible to calculate this amount with current education department data these amounts would also be adjusted by the education department s existing expectations around which loans would be repaid finally there would be costs associated with not taxing forgiven amounts estimated effects effects vary by dollar amount chosen forgiveness of up to 10 000 would eliminate all student loan debt for an estimated 16 3 million borrowers or 36 percent of all borrowers and reduce by half balances for another 9 3 million or 20 percent of all borrowers 31 forgiveness of up to 40 000 would wipe out debt for 35 million borrowers about 77 percent of borrowers the number of borrowers who would have all their debt canceled under this plan might be a bit lower depending on the dollar amount because some individuals who currently appear to have low debt levels are in school and are thus likely to end up with higher loan balances as they continue their studies table 1 shows the estimated effects and costs across a range of maximum forgiveness amounts considerations does it address equity yes though the exact equity implications will vary somewhat based on the level chosen table 2 breaks down the percentage of borrowers in a given racial ethnic category based upon the cumulative amount of federal loans borrowed table 3 flips this analysis to show the distribution of debts within a given racial or ethnic category both tables are based on borrowers who entered higher education in the 2003 04 academic year and their cumulative federal loan amounts within 12 years while this is the best picture of longitudinal student loan situations by race and ethnicity the fact that these figures represent students who first enrolled prior to the great recession means it is possible that were they available newer numbers might show different results in considering these tables it is important to recognize that higher amounts of forgiveness would still provide benefits for everyone at the lower levels of debt as well that means increasing forgiveness by no means leaves those with lesser balances worse off hispanic or latino borrowers for example will disproportionately benefit from a forgiveness policy that picks a smaller dollar amount because this group makes up an outsize share of borrowers with 20 000 or less in student debt 32 these same individuals would still benefit from forgiveness at higher dollar amounts but their concentration among lower balance borrowers means the marginal benefits of forgiving greater dollar amounts is smaller the story is different for black or african american borrowers they make up a roughly proportional share of low balance borrowers but a disproportionate share of those who took out between 40 000 and 100 000 33 that means the marginal effect on black or african american borrowers will be greater for higher dollar amounts looking at borrowers based on pell grant receipt tells a slightly different story individuals who have received a pell grant are proportionately represented among lower balance borrowers and underrepresented among those with the highest balances but they are most overrepresented among those who took out between 20 000 and 60 000 34 table 3 presents a different way of considering this issue by showing the distribution of debts within a given racial or ethnic category for example though black or african american borrowers make up a disproportionate share of borrowers with balances between 40 000 and 100 000 77 percent of these individuals had debt balances below this amount this highlights the importance of considering not just the marginal effects of different forgiveness plans on equity but also how many individuals within a given group might benefit at varying benefit levels looking at the effects of cancellation only from a distributional standpoint can however miss other dimensions of equity that merit consideration for example borrowers at the same indebtedness level may be in quite different circumstances discrimination in housing and employment a lack of familial wealth or other conditions could mean that a borrower who otherwise might seem less in need of assistance would still benefit in a meaningful way that could spur wealth building and address generational asset gaps how simple is it from a borrower standpoint this option is fairly simple and could be implemented administratively with no affirmative work required from borrowers as long as there are no tax consequences for forgiveness how broad is its impact this policy would provide at least partial relief for all federal student loan borrowers will it feel like relief yes borrowers would see a reduction in their balances and payments though that relief would be proportional to their outstanding balances who are the greatest beneficiaries at lower dollar amounts the biggest beneficiaries are smaller balance borrowers who are more likely to have all their debt wiped away as the amount of forgiveness rises those individuals will already have no balance and thus have no additional debt to forgive this means that those who have the full dollar amount forgiven will increasingly be borrowers with higher balances what is the biggest advantage this is a way to hit a target level of relief that could wipe away debt for those in the greatest distress while providing a more universal benefit there may also be benefits for the overall economy allowing people to purchase homes save for retirement and attain the traditional middle class staples that may be harder for borrowers with student loan debt to obtain what is the biggest challenge because the benefit is universal it will end up providing partial relief to a large number of individuals who may not need assistance unless other elements are added to the policy to target it as described below those receiving relief would include individuals with graduate loans working in the areas of finance law business and medicine how could this option be more targeted in addition to varying the dollar amount forgiven there are a few ways to improve targeting and reduce costs although these approaches would add some complexity to the overall plan and its administration one way would be to apply the policy only to undergraduate loans another would be to tie the forgiveness amount to a borrower s earnings so that higher income individuals receive less forgiveness 3 forgive debt held by former pell recipients pell grant recipients are college students determined by the federal government to be sufficiently low income to qualify for financial help that does not have to be repaid in the case of students receiving the maximum award there is an understanding that their family should not be asked to contribute anything for the price of college as first proposed by temple university professor sara goldrick rab in 2015 this option would cancel all student loans held by individuals who previously received a pell grant 35 the rationale is that pell students were never supposed to borrow loans were for financially better situated upper or middle income students as a result the presence of debt among these individuals is a policy failure of the college financing system estimated cost the education department unfortunately does not break down the share of outstanding loan dollars held by pell grant recipients however these individuals do represent a majority of undergraduate borrowers as well as of graduate borrowers in recent years 36 there would also be costs associated with not taxing forgiven amounts table 4 shows the share of borrowers in a given year who ever received a pell grant reported separately for graduate and undergraduate borrowers these figures suggest that a conservative estimate of loan forgiveness for pell grant recipients should be somewhere around half the cost of forgiveness for the full population in reality the cost might be a bit lower than half because pell recipients debt loads tend to be a bit below the debt amounts of those who did not receive the grant for example pell recipients represent 68 percent of all students who entered college in the 2003 04 academic year and borrowed a loan by 2015 but just 43 percent of those who took out loans of at least 100 000 37 unfortunately existing data are not good enough to calculate more precise estimates of how much outstanding debt is held by pell recipients estimated effects the exact number of students helped is not completely clear but a look at the number of pell recipients each year and their borrowing rate suggests it would be millions of students the number of annual pell recipients has gone from about 5 3 million in the early 2000s to a high of 9 4 million during the great recession and about 55 to 60 percent of these students borrow considerations does it address equity yes pell recipients are disproportionately concentrated among borrowers with student loan struggles nearly 90 percent of students who defaulted on a loan within 12 years of starting college received a pell grant substantial shares of undergraduate borrowers of color also received pell grants meaning they would be in line for forgiveness for example 78 percent of black or african american borrowers in the 2015 16 academic year received a pell grant as did 71 percent of hispanic or latino borrowers 61 percent of asian borrowers and 78 percent of american indian or alaska natives who borrowed 38 how simple is it from a borrower standpoint operationally the process should be straightforward as long as records still exist that a student received a pell grant there might be some confusion for borrowers who incorrectly think that they are eligible how broad is its impact though this policy would not affect every borrower as discussed above a significant share of student loan holders received a pell grant at some point will it feel like relief yes former pell recipients would no longer have to repay their loans who are the greatest beneficiaries students who were lower income while they were in college would benefit greatly from this policy what is the biggest advantage this is an easy way to target relief in a way that uses income to address equity issues what is the biggest challenge forgiving debt only held by former pell grant recipients can create a cliff effect where individuals who just missed the award get no relief this could include those who might have received a pell grant had the maximum award been higher during the years they were enrolled in college in addition income alone does not capture generational wealth disparities that may still be present meaning that there may be individuals who did not qualify for pell who would otherwise fall in the group of people this policy wants to serve finally some analysts have pointed out that using pell is not a perfect proxy for income because it may miss some low income students and captures some middle income individuals 39 how could this option be more targeted forgiving only undergraduate loans would not necessarily increase the proposal s targeting but it would bring down the expense of the option 4 reform idr to tackle interest growth and provide quicker paths to forgiveness twelve years ago congress created the income based repayment plan as its answer to unaffordable student loans 40 with the creation of additional plans there is now a suite of income driven repayment options available to borrowers the exact terms vary but the basic idea is to connect monthly payments to how much money borrowers earn and provide forgiveness after some set period of time in repayment though idr plans are increasingly popular there s also a sense among some policymakers that in their current form they do not fully provide relief for borrowers part of this is due to the complex and clunky program structure borrowers must fill out paperwork to get on the plan and then reapply each year failure to do so can kick them off the plan leading to capitalized interest delayed forgiveness and a larger balance 41 but idr s other major problem relates to accumulating interest while borrowers can lower their monthly payments on idr even paying nothing each month if they are earning little to no income interest continues to accrue the result is that borrowers can feel like they are trapped with their loans and with a balance that keeps growing even as they make payments the only way out being forgiveness that is potentially two decades down the line this option would make idr more attractive by changing the terms so that borrowers no longer have any interest accumulate on their debt borrowers would make a monthly payment equal to 10 percent of their discretionary income even if that would result in repayment taking longer than the 10 year standard repayment plan borrowers with no discretionary income would not have to make monthly payments just as in the past however any interest not covered by that payment would be forgiven ensuring that borrowers balances never increase undergraduate debts would be forgiven after 15 years while graduate borrowers would have to wait five years longer 20 years forgiving all interest would be an expansion of some benefits that currently exist for instance the federal government covers all unpaid interest on subsidized stafford loans for the first three years of repayment on most idr plans 42 and on the revised pay as you earn plan the federal government also covers half of unpaid interest for the duration of repayment for all loan types this includes interest on subsidized loans beyond the three year period 43 estimated cost unfortunately there are not enough available data to get a sense of the overall cost of this proposal costing out the option would require at least knowing more information about the distribution of borrowers using idr in terms of their income and debts currently the education department only provides information on the distribution of debt balances in idr without better data it is not possible to know what share of borrowers on idr make payments below the rate at which interest accumulates and would benefit from a greater subsidy moreover the costs of this change are also affected by the amount of subsidized loans a borrower has because those carry different interest accumulation rules the net result is that there is no clean way to get an accurate cost estimate estimated effects there are currently about 7 7 million borrowers using an idr plan to repay 456 billion 44 it is unfortunately not clear what share of these individuals would benefit from these suggested changes considerations does it address equity available data are insufficient to fully answer this question because there is no information on the usage of idr by the groups described in the equity goal section however the answer at least partly depends on what is done to make the plans more attractive for lower balance borrowers that group includes nearly half of hispanic or latino borrowers as well as large numbers of individuals who have debt but did not finish college and are at significant risk of defaulting meanwhile current idr plans might be beneficial for black or african american borrowers on paper just by looking at where they are disproportionately represented on an analysis of debt levels but that presumes payments viewed as affordable through the formula are actually feasible table 5 illustrates the challenge of making idr work for borrowers who have a low balance and a low income by showing their repayment plan options under the current options for these borrowers the graduated plan combines the most initial monthly payment relief with the shortest repayment term of the four idr plans these borrowers are not eligible for one because of their debt and income levels two plans offer a monthly payment amount that is just a dollar less than the standard plan and one has the same initial monthly payment as the graduated plan but has them in repayment for almost 20 years even if the borrower had a lower income and therefore a lower monthly idr payment the plans would not provide a great deal see table 6 instead of seeing a decreasing balance the borrower will instead see it balloon because she is not able to pay down interest as fast as it is accruing forgiving the interest on idr plans will make the option more attractive but the requirement of having to wait as long as 20 years to retire a debt that came from a semester or two of school is not going to be an easy sell this solution also still has technical and gatekeeping issues as borrowers need to opt in to use idr plans how simple is it from a borrower standpoint it would be very simple for borrowers who are on idr but the paperwork complications of applying for and staying on idr plans remain a challenge that needs to be addressed how broad is the impact about one fourth of borrowers in repayment currently use an idr plan thus the effect will be somewhat limited unless changes result in increased usage of these plans 45 in particular this option would need to boost usage among borrowers who owe 20 000 or less currently less than 10 percent of borrowers with debt of 20 000 or less use an idr plan compared with 38 percent of those with debts of 60 000 or more 46 though this slightly understates usage of idr by low balance borrowers because some of these individuals are still in school the fact remains that there are more borrowers with debts greater than 100 000 on idr than those who owe 10 000 or less 47 will it feel like relief psychologically yes borrowers would still be making the same monthly payment but they would not feel like they are digging themselves into a deeper hole borrowers encouraged to enroll in idr as part of this change would likely see monthly payment relief who are the greatest beneficiaries the biggest winners are individuals who make payments through idr but who are not paying down their interest each month within that group the amount of relief will be greater for those with larger debt balances higher interest rates or both what is the biggest advantage this solution makes idr a more viable and attractive long term plan what is the biggest challenge it may still not be enough to help borrowers with very low balances or who are likely to default because they still need to navigate the paperwork challenges to sign up for idr or the timeline to pay down the debt will still be viewed as too long relative to the amount of time it took to incur the debt it also presumes 10 percent of discretionary income is affordable or 150 percent of the poverty level is a large enough income exemption 48 how could this idea be more targeted capping the maximum dollar amount of interest that can be forgiven each year would better target the benefits of the option because it would provide less relief for borrowers with larger loan balances reducing forgiveness time frames for lower balance borrowers or adding opportunities for interim forgiveness such as 5 000 forgiven after five years on the plan would especially help lower balance borrowers and make idr a more attractive option for them 5 provide interim principal forgiveness on idr idr plans guarantee that borrowers have an eventual way out of debt by forgiving any balances remaining after a set number of years while this is a crucial benefit taking as long as 20 years or 25 years depending on the plan to get forgiveness can make the promise feel abstract and like something that might not happen this proposal would change forgiveness terms to provide interim principal relief for borrowers this idea is flexible for example all borrowers could receive 2 000 in principal forgiveness for every two years they spend on an idr plan or they could get a larger amount forgiven in five year intervals the idea is that borrowers would not be in an all or nothing situation where they must wait so long to get relief estimated cost unfortunately there are not enough available data to get a sense of the overall cost of this proposal costing it would require at least knowing more information about the distribution of borrowers using idr in terms of their income and debts as well as how long they have been on idr looking at the number of borrowers on all idr plans might provide one way to ballpark the possible cost for example by the end of the 2016 5 6 million borrowers were on an idr plan if they were all still on those plans by the end of 2018 it would cost 11 2 billion to forgive 2 000 for each of them 49 if those who were on idr at the end of 2018 stayed on the cost of forgiving 2 000 for each of them at the end of 2020 would be 14 4 billion this assumes that the two year clock for forgiveness would only start going forward estimated effects for most borrowers on idr small forgiveness would be helpful but not transformative however there are about 1 million borrowers on these plans who owe 10 000 or less meaning they would receive a substantial amount of forgiveness in percentage terms the more likely effect is that interim forgiveness could make idr more attractive for lower balance borrowers who may be discouraged from using it today because waiting up to 20 years for forgiveness on small amounts of debt may not seem worth it considerations does it address equity there are not enough data to definitively answer this question however an interim relief system if paired with other reforms to accumulating interest on idr would make this repayment option much more effective for lower balance borrowers this is particularly important for targeting help to individuals who did not finish college or hispanic or latino borrowers low balance borrowers currently do not have much incentive to use idr because waiting two decades for unloading debt accumulated over a semester or a year does not seem like a good deal under this option those low balance borrowers could retire their debt much faster while higher balance borrowers would keep paying for longer the data are less clear for other groups on whom policies should focus such as black or african american borrowers however these solutions overall increase the generosity of idr in a way that should make this option better for anyone who has high levels of debt relative to their income that in turn should help individuals whose earnings do not match the expected return on their debt such as due to wage discrimination how simple is it from a borrower standpoint there would be some work involved to ensure that borrowers apply for idr and are making necessary payments but the relief itself could be handled by the education department and student loan servicers how broad is the impact slightly more than one quarter of borrowers in repayment currently use an idr plan so the effect will be somewhat limited unless interim principal forgiveness encourages increased usage of these plans 50 as discussed in the prior option it would particularly need to boost usage among lower balance borrowers will it feel like relief yes providing help at interim periods will show that forgiveness is not an abstract concept years in the future it will also strengthen support for idr who are the greatest beneficiaries though this policy targets everyone interim relief will help borrowers with lower balances get rid of their debt faster than those who owe more what is the biggest advantage interim relief employs a universal benefit to provide more targeted relief to those who owe the least what is the biggest challenge borrowers would still have to navigate idr which can be time consuming and confusing how could this idea be more targeted the tiered relief could be limited to undergraduate loans only 6 allow refinancing this solution entails allowing federal student loan borrowers to get a lower interest rate for the duration of their repayment term this concept comes from the mortgage market where refinancing typically pairs a lower interest rate with a longer repayment term refinancing proposals for higher education on the other hand generally do not include a term extension this proposal would be most effective when paired with lower caps on interest rates for all future federal student loan borrowers estimated cost there has not been a public score of a student loan refinancing proposal since 2014 when the congressional budget office estimated one option would cost about 60 billion over a decade to refinance federal loans 51 it is unclear what the cost of such a proposal would be today and it is also highly affected by the rate offered if the rate is not too low around 4 percent or 5 percent for example the cost might be a bit lower at least relative to the amount of volume because federal changes to student loan interest rates in 2012 led to lower rates for several years the inclusion or exclusion of graduate and plus loans will also have significant cost implications estimated effects one way to think about the implications of refinancing is to consider which borrowers currently have student loans with interest rates that would come down under a refinancing opportunity for example interest rates for plus loans to parents or graduate students have been at 6 31 percent or more every year dating back to at least 2006 52 that means any refinancing opportunity would likely be attractive to the roughly 3 6 million borrowers who have unconsolidated plus loans for parents 53 by contrast if student loans could be refinanced at 5 percent only some undergraduate borrowers would take advantage from 2010 to 2018 the interest rate on subsidized loans for undergraduates was below 5 percent as was the interest rate on unsubsidized loans from 2013 to 2018 54 table 7 shows the interest rates on different types of federal student loans since 2006 to show during which years borrowers might have benefited from refinancing at different new interest rates the range of interest rates also means the financial benefits of refinancing will vary for example a borrower with 30 000 in loans at 6 8 percent saves about 27 a month and 3 245 on a 10 year amortization schedule if their interest rate goes down to 5 percent by contrast if a borrower could take out the same amount at a rate of 5 05 percent they would save just 0 73 a month and 88 over 10 years considerations does it address equity available data make it hard to answer this question but there are two ways to consider it first is whether the problems facing the groups identified in the equity goal above are related to the interest rate on their loans in some cases the answer is probably not for example borrowers who did not finish college typically have balances below 10 000 that translates into about 115 a month if repaid over 10 years on a 6 8 percent interest rate not charging interest at all still leaves a payment of 83 which may be unaffordable for a low income family and therefore may not decrease their odds of defaulting similarly about half of hispanic or latino borrowers have low loan balances such that the relief from an interest rate cut is not going to be significant the story would be different for other groups black or african american borrowers for example are overrepresented among borrowers with moderate to high loan balances between 40 000 and 100 000 at that level a lower interest rate would provide a greater reduction in monthly payments in dollar terms the challenge however is knowing whether that would be enough to address concerns such as the fact that black or african american borrowers on average make no progress retiring their debts within 12 years of entering college a lower interest rate and monthly payments could help address that challenge but if the reason for student loan struggles lies more with external factors such as employment discrimination then it may not have a significant effect on improving their outcomes how simple is it from a borrower standpoint it would vary if the interest rate is at or below the rate paid by all borrowers it might be possible to automatically change the rates for borrowers if the new rate is only advantageous for some borrowers it could end up requiring an opt in framework considering some borrowers have interest rates below 4 percent any interest rate above that would require opting in 55 how broad is the impact it depends upon the new interest rate chosen as noted above some interest rates will not result in much benefit for undergraduate borrowers thus a new interest rate of 0 percent would affect all borrowers but one at 5 percent would affect only some cohorts of undergraduate borrowers will it feel like relief higher debt or higher interest borrowers who are not on idr will see lower monthly payments borrowers on idr may only notice the change in terms of how much their monthly payment grows if their payments are not covering accumulating interest the psychological effect of lessening a ballooning total repayment balance is difficult to measure but not negligible who are the greatest beneficiaries refinancing makes the biggest difference for borrowers with higher interest rates larger balances or both this is most likely going to be someone who borrowed for graduate school or a parent borrower what is the biggest advantage for borrowers who can largely afford their loans but just need a bit more assistance refinancing could give them some breathing room lower rates may also have some public relations benefit in regard to arguments over whether the government makes money off the loan programs what is the biggest challenge in many ways this solution duplicates the relief that idr provides as both lower the monthly payment the biggest difference is that refinancing can also reduce the total amount paid over the life of the loan the trade off is that idr offers forgiveness for those who do not pay their loan off before the end of the repayment term but in its current form may increase the total amount paid due to accumulating interest how could this idea be more targeted this option could pair refinancing with a small amount of forgiveness for low balance borrowers who do not benefit from the policy for example if borrowers who owe under 10 000 each got 1 000 in forgiveness they would likely be better off than they would be under a refinancing system
