get quote raquo weekly review is the trade war over two momentous events during the week just ending the us and china signed a phase one agreement calling a truce in their trade war and the us house of representatives sent the bill of impeachment to the senate starting the trial of trump the impeachment process is so far a non event for the fx market it s widely assumed that the republicans will simply ignore the customary oath to do impartial justice according to law and vote to acquit trump no matter what the facts are rather the focus now is on the us china trade agreement together with the usmca the us mexico canada agreement or the trade agreement formerly known as nafta these two agreements will sharply reduce the level of uncertainty around us and hence global trade policy there are still several other disputes pending such as european autos but those are relatively minor as you can see from the indicators of us economic policy uncertainty trade is far and away the biggest uncertainty facing the markets nowadays for fx monetary policy has traditionally been the most important uncertainty but that appears to be a little less uncertain than usual nowadays advertisement the uncertainty has caused the global economy to slow for two reasons the direct reason of course is the reduced level of trade the indirect reason is that the uncertainty has caused a global slowdown in investment as companies were unsure what to do with the problems resolved or at least on their way to being resolved we can look forward to an improvement in the global economy driven by investment on two fronts first companies are likely to resume the domestic investment that they had put on hold for the time being secondly i expect that they ve begun to question the value of putting so many of their eggs in the chinese basket and may therefore continue the process of diversifying their sources to other countries such as vietnam i think the chinese have also learned the same lesson and while the new agreement requires china to meet some aggressive targets for purchases of us goods notably agricultural products i doubt if they will return to previous levels if i were the chinese i d make sure i developed other suppliers and other markets in case something like this happens again the trade war was particularly damaging to emerging market em currencies as many of those countries rely on commodities and export led growth oddly enough asia was relatively less affected probably because several of those currencies are managed floats and therefore not exposed completely to market forces i would expect the em currencies to recover somewhat as global growth picks up enthusiasm over the accords or at least relief that things aren t getting worse has pushed global equity markets up to a record market capitalization however we shouldn t get too excited by the agreements because a it s possible that china won t fulfil its requirements and b as i mentioned there are still other trade feuds pending the american bankers association s economic advisory committee a group of chief economists from major banks this week forecast 2020 us gdp growth would be the same as the 1 9 pace of 2019 i e no pickup in the us at all from the agreement the group cited lingering trade uncertainty as a major risk nevertheless for the time being i think we are likely to see a revival of risk on trades until such time as it s seen that the trade agreements are not having an impact that probably means a weaker jpy particularly vs aud chf jpy is also moving up not only from the risk on factor but also because the us treasury department monday added switzerland to its monitoring list of major trading partners that merit close attention to their currency practices as for carry trades there s been little to go for among the g10 currencies over the last two years as monetary policies converge and volatility falls em carry trades have been more successful however em carry trades could be even more profitable in the future if as i expect em currencies benefit from an improvement in the global trade outlook upcoming week boj boc ecb preliminary pmis davos the main point of interest during the coming week besides the us political circus will be three central bank meetings the bank of japan boj tuesday the bank of canada boc wednesday and the european central bank ecb thursday no change in rates is expected from any of them or indeed even seen as a possibility so the main thing the market will be looking for is a change in bias since the global trade friction has been a major concern for all three of these banks indeed for policy makers everywhere i think the agreements that have been reached are likely to result in a modest upgrade in their views and outlooks that could lead to some appreciation for the currencies involved particularly cad where the inflation picture is most promising i think the only one of the three meetings that s likely to involve any suspense is the bank of canada the market sees the ecb as being on hold for the rest of the year while the bank of japan is seen as possibly cutting at some point but no one has any clear idea of when that might be only the boc is seen as being more likely to cut rates over the course of the year however i think the bank of canada is likely to upgrade its outlook further at this meeting at its last meeting on 4 december the boc changed its view from fears of the global slowdown spreading to nascent evidence that the global economy is stabilizing the main concern for canada is of course the global trade picture and with the passage of the usmca those fears have diminished considerably that should lead them to upgrade their view the boc said at that meeting that future interest rate decisions will be guided by the bank s continuing assessment of the adverse impact of trade conflicts against the sources of resilience in the canadian economy notably consumer spending and housing activity while the trade picture has improved since then the domestic news has been disappointing both retail sales and housing starts have continued to slow on the other hand with inflation on target and starting to trend higher there s certainly no urgency to cut rates the december cpi data will come out 1 Â½ hours before the results of the meeting are announced i d expect the committee members to have them at the meeting no forecasts available yet net net i expect the boc to adopt a more optimistic tone thanks to the improvement in the global trade outlook and for cad to appreciate following the meeting as for the bank of japan it too may well upgrade its assessment of overseas economies in its quarterly outlook report the key point of interest will be whether that upgrade causes it to alter or even remove its rate cut bias in the forward guidance contained in the statement it issues following the monetary policy meeting in particular in a situation where downside risks to economic activity and prices mainly regarding developments in overseas economies are significant the bank will not hesitate to take additional easing measures if there is a greater possibility that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target will be lost however the turmoil in the middle east and subsequent rise in oil prices may keep that statement intact for the time being the boj may well upgrade its fy2020 growth forecast from october s 0 7 rate as a result of the fiscal stimulus package that the government announced in december since that forecast was already above the boj s estimate for japan s potential growth rate of 0 57 they are likely to stick with their view that the output gap is expanding gradually and inflation should eventually move back towards their 2 target good luck with that is my personal view and the view of the market too but they have to retain a show of confidence in their hopeless quest japan s national inflation data comes out on friday but this is of less interest ever since they started announced the tokyo figures about two weeks before the national figures accordingly i think the odds of a boj rate cut could also fall following the meeting but i wouldn t expect that to have much impact on the yen because with inflation so far below their target policy is likely to be on hold indefinitely jpy neutral the ecb is probably the least interesting of the three meetings i don t think anyone expects very much from them at all for the time being at their december meeting they upgraded their view on the eurozone economy somewhat the statement said that the risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook related to geopolitical factors rising protectionism and vulnerabilities in emerging markets remain tilted to the downside but have become somewhat less pronounced emphasis added given the further improvement in the trade picture since then they could well upgrade their view further but i don t think anyone believes they re out of the woods yet they re still likely to retain their easing bias the governing council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments as appropriate to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner in line with its commitment to symmetry the ecb could be encouraged by a modest rise in the german and eu wide manufacturing purchasing managers indices pmis for january but unfortunately those aren t due out until friday the day after the meeting so they will have to comfort themselves with the forecasts in any case while the trend may be upward they are still in contractionary territory and the expected improvement isn t that much probably a lot of the responses came before the us china trade agreement was inked besides while that problem may be on the back burner for now the trump regime is still taking aim at the crucial german auto industry so the improvement in the outlook may be muted for now eur neutral the uk pmis are also expected to improve but i m not sure that will have much impact on the currency outgoing boe gov carney put the market on alert when he said recently that there is a debate at the monetary policy committee over the relative merits of near term stimulus to reinforce the expected recovery in uk growth and inflation two mpc members silvana tenreyro and gertjan vlieghe subsequently said they d vote for cutting rates if there are no signs of improvement in the economy this would be in addition to the two members jonathan haskel and michael saunders who said at the december meeting that they would like to see a cut in rates two two four nearly half of the nine member committee the question here is whether the mpc members focus on the composite pmi which tends to track the service sector pmi closely and is expected to poke its nose back above the 50 boom or bust line or the more cyclical manufacturing pmi which although it s expected to improve is forecast to remain in contractionary territory i m not sure whether they ll consider less of a contraction to constitute an improvement my guess is that they are concerned about the business cycle and it s the manufacturing pmi that correlates with the business cycle and hence these figures will not show enough improvement to ally their fears accordingly i d say that they will be negative for gbp finally the markit pmis for the us are expected to be mixed the manufacturing pmi is forecast to rise but the services pmi is forecast to fall here too i think the manufacturing pmi is likely to be viewed as the more significant one and hence this result may be positive for the dollar especially after this week s better than expected empire state manufacturing index and much better than expected philadelphia fed business outlook finally we have the annual world economic forum at davos switzerland from tuesday to friday there s no particular announcement that people are waiting for from this event but with the global great and good assembled in one place it s non stop interviews on cnbc bloomberg and other news agencies someone is bound to say something market moving at some point you can look at their wide and varied agenda on their website

by charles c krulak larry hatheway jerry grinstein and alexander friedman davos the world economic forum s annual flagship meeting this year will focus on how to build a more cohesive and sustainable world as always the topic is timely but also a little abstract to help give it more concrete form we have a few proposals to put the prevailing economic model on a better track and focus the discussion first it is time to overhaul the us tax code to reduce structural wealth inequality to that end america should get rid of the carried interest loophole a provision that was originally intended to encourage long term investment has become a massive tax break for financiers working in private equity and at hedge funds although the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act placed some limitations on this finance friendly rule it remains in place by the same token america should do away with the stepped up cost basis loophole which has become a key way by which the rich avoid taxation when bequeathing their wealth to their heirs as such it has enabled the rich to become dynastic undermining america s ostensible commitment to meritocracy second the united states desperately needs to clean up its student loan mess a huge burden on the young by establishing a national trust along the lines of what australia has done in australia a student borrows what she needs to fund her education and the loan is repayable from a predetermined proportion of her subsequent income for a specified number of years students who end up with lower future incomes pay less than they borrowed but this is offset by higher earners and graduates who enter certain forms of public service should be offered debt forgiveness incentives third we need to change corporate reporting to encourage more long term sustainable thinking the first step is to end the obsession with quarterly earnings the pursuit of financial analysts targets every three months warps the way ceos and boards make decisions and undermines long term thinking on a related note share buybacks deserve more critical attention s p 500 companies now routinely use profits or borrowed money to repurchase their shares instead of investing in new factories business lines or other key capital expenditures over the last ten years around 5 trillion has been spent on this method of boosting reported earnings per share and thus the stock price corporate reporting should be changed to explain clearly how much of a share price movement is largely attributable to buybacks and boards and shareholders should adjust executive compensation accordingly moreover corporations worldwide should start reporting sustainability metrics corporate reporting influences corporate behaviour but companies generally are required to report only their financial position based on audited income and balance sheet accounting standards this should be expanded to include broader stakeholder metrics such as customer satisfaction ratings diversity scores carbon footprints charitable giving political donations and the pay gap between senior executives and average rank and file employees boards for stakeholder reporting standards special purpose bodies akin to the financial accounting standards board should be created to oversee newly agreed worldwide conventions for non financial reporting fourth a global agreement to levy a 0 1 per cent tax on financial transactions similar to what is done in hong kong would help to rein in the financial system a transaction tax benefits long term investors over short term speculators adds just enough friction into the financial system to help reduce bubbles and most critically better aligns the cost of managing the system to those who benefit the most from it according to the congressional budget office cbo a 0 1 per cent transaction tax could produce around 1 trillion in much needed extra revenue in the us alone over a decade fifth countries need to raise minimum wages and index them to inflation in the us a federally mandated 15 per hour national minimum wage would help to level the playing field and automatically adjusting it in line with the rising cost of living would help everyone keep up according to the chicago federal reserve bank these steps would also increase aggregate demand in the world s largest economy sixth in all countries an overhaul of national income accounting is in order since it was introduced in the 1940s gross domestic product has assumed unofficial status as the primary measure of national welfare yet when progress is equated with gdp policymaking becomes an exercise in boosting gross national income without regard to the attendant social or environmental costs new metrics are required to measure wellbeing net of cost national income should include the costs of externalities such as environmental degradation or greenhouse gas emissions thus measured net income would more accurately reflect sustainable growth moreover all countries should agree to common standards for incorporating other measures of social progress these could include life expectancy infant mortality the detection prevention and treatment of common diseases ghg emissions per capita biodiversity educational attainment income distribution human trafficking levels and socioeconomic achievement by gender and minority groups the bretton woods institutions could research and develop the new common standards of national welfare that we need and introduce them through their widely followed publications last but by no means least urgent action must be taken to address climate change in a way that shares the costs fairly within countries and between generations mitigation policies must be made appealing carbon taxes are necessary but so are subsidies according to the us joint committee on taxation and the cbo a carbon tax of 25 per tonne with annual inflation adjusted increases of 2 per cent would raise 1 trillion in the us over a decade it makes sense to earmark even more than that amount to help those made worse off by the tax namely today s coal oil and gas producing communities as well as families on low or modest incomes hit by regressive taxation subsidies could take the form of cash payments re training new infrastructure projects and investment in alternative energy industries in coal and oil country importantly the subsidies must be greater than the carbon tax revenues the resulting increase in national debt is rightly the obligation of future generations who will benefit most from the transition to a low carbon economy in short climate policy must have tangible benefits today if it is to be politically acceptable consider this as e commerce reduces demand for physical shopping communities should buy vacant malls and stores again with debt to be paid off by future generations and replace them with carbon capturing green spaces these practical steps in aggregate would go a long way toward helping realise

under such circumstances brics countries are thinking about introducing their own payment system an alternative to swift which would serve settlements in national currencies the existing procedure of foreign trade settlements via swift is of concern to many since swift is controlled by the us the system can be used as an instrument of political pressure for example the united states has already disconnected iran from swift which has caused a drop in gdp and exports higher inflation and devaluation of the national currency washington periodically threatens to disconnect russia from swift as well china was in no hurry for some time with de dollarisation and transitioning to alternative payment systems however the trade conflict with the us has shown that it is very risky to rely on the us financial infrastructure director of the department for multilateral economic cooperation at the ministry of economic development natalia stapran said initiatives such as settlements in national currencies should contribute to trade facilitation this issue is being actively discussed but it is not always easy with china i can see why the chinese are in no hurry because they did not really need it after all settlements in national currencies are a tool for overcoming sanctions restrictions as soon as the chinese felt that this could affect them when it hinders transactions they do not think about volumes and turnover and have shown great interest the russian expert said however china s own national payment system appeared back in 2015 it is called the cips international payment system currently more than 20 local and foreign banks are connected to it the system allows making direct cross border payments in rmb it is not necessary to open correspondent accounts often called nostro or vostro accounts ed note sputnik this reduces costs and transaction time russia has a similar solution system for transfer of financial messages spfs recently it was reported that india is working on a similar system since the brics countries already have experience with their own payment systems at the last summit in brazil it was proposed to unite efforts and create a single alternative mechanism for mutual settlements director of the department for international financial relations of the ministry of finance of russia andrey bokarev told sputnik at the gaidar forum our brazilian colleagues proposed the idea last year in the form of creating a brics cross border payment system the idea was to minimise the involvement of mechanisms related to the opening of correspondent accounts of our commercial banks and to make the most of the opportunities offered by the national central banks of our countries for such transactions bokarev explained the topic deserves the utmost attention and i can t say that we don t hear enough involved remarks from any of the participants another issue is that the topic is not a simple one and requires a whole range of solutions he continued assessing the capacity of each national stakeholder russia s international financial relations department director andrey bokarev continued needless to say such an issue cannot be solved solely employing efforts or on the initiative of national regulators there must also be movement from below and interest on the part of the participants themselves first of all these are banks and companies in our countries and there must be a clear demand and interest in creating such systems otherwise it will be a mechanism that will be in little demand bokarev said according to the government official now there is a search for frameworks that are mutually acceptable to all member countries of the brics association which will allow for the formation of a system of settlements from the perspective of the russian side one of the first steps could be the creation of a system for the transfer of messages on financial transactions a swift analogue such a system is already used in settlements in russia and with some of our counteragents and we are thinking about extending that scheme to all five member states next we will talk about the implementation of all other components of mutual settlements he concluded according to the russian finance ministry official the more convenient the swift alternative settlements systems are the greater the demand for them among market participants will be the growth of trade volume is not enough for this you also need a user friendly interface on the bilateral level the work is progressing
by democratic socialism the us senator from vermont means scandinavia more or less and what s wrong with that bernie sanders supporters are quick to make clear that their guy doesn t want to turn america into cuba or venezuela or the old soviet union by democratic socialism the us senator from vermont means scandinavia more or less and what s wrong with that the nordic nations are pretty nice even president trump has conceded that norway produces a quality immigrant but does sanders really want to import scandinavian socialism he brags that his universal health care plan eliminates patient cost sharing but scandinavia has it sanders wants to raise a lot revenue though heavy taxes on business and investment scandinavia doesn t sanders has a big problem with billionaires scandinavia doesn t indeed as i have written the egalitarian nordic nations have as many billionaires relatively as the us and more concentrated wealth at least as measured by the share of wealth controlled by the top 10 percent i could do on and on mentioning how the nordics score highly in the conservative heritage foundation s economic freedom index especially when it comes to government regulation they re also free traders unlike sanders who opposed the north american free trade agreement in the 1990s and its successor agreement today as a jpmorgan analysis cautioned copy the nordic model if you like but understand that it entails a lot of capitalism and pro business policies a lot of taxation on middle class spending and wages minimal reliance on corporate taxation and plenty of co pays and deductibles in its healthcare system here s a tale of scandinavian socialism that team bernie never tells via a milken review institute piece from swedish economist andreas bergh in the 1970s several well intended political reforms backfired the desire to increase income equality through high marginal tax rates and generous welfare benefits weakened work incentives and created strong incentives for tax avoidance indeed in the 1970s and 1980s many wealthy swedes notably bjorn borg left the country to avoid the taxman meanwhile the desire to tame the business cycle and minimize unemployment led to the subsidization of noncompetitive industries the unions desire to drive wages ahead of productivity growth led to inflation while efforts to restore sweden s competitiveness through repeated currency devaluations led to both a lower living standard and investment sapping uncertainty perhaps most important the mix of subsidies and devaluations sent the signal that firms in trouble could turn to the government for help rather than be forced to innovate in order to stay competitive when that happens economies inevitably pay a price after the crisis of the early 1990s the swedish economy recovered smartly in many ways sweden learned from its mistakes and took measures to avoid large budget deficits and inflationary wage pressures by the mid 1990s these changes were institutionalized and strikingly often with support from social democrats as well as the right wing parties prominent examples include a tax reform that lowered marginal rates substantially and a pension reform that balanced the risks between pensioners and taxpayers by automatically adjusting payments to demographic and economic conditions whatever sanders wants to turn america into it doesn t sound much like scandinavia as it exists in current reality then again as that jpmorgan report concluded a real life proof of concept for a successful democratic socialist society like the lost city of atlantis has yet to be found this article by james pethokoukis first appeared at the american enterprise institute

is breaking out in global economic relations but beneath the surface the tectonic plates of commerce are shifting see briefing america s financial muscle flexing through the use of sanctions tariffs and bans on blacklisted firms has not escaped the attention of other countries which have been intensifying efforts to avoid the global dollar based financial plumbing though these could herald a more balanced international monetary system they also carry risks for the world economy listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element the trump administration has turned its financial might on not only china but also iran russia and a host of others including even allies such as the european union and turkey the latest iranian sanctions announced last week will heap more pain on an economy already pummelled by economic missiles aimed at banks oil production and shipping so dollar centric is global commerce that other countries have long found it difficult to trade even among themselves without recourse to america s currency banks and payments infrastructure at least half of all trade invoices are in dollars a majority of cross border transactions are ultimately cleared through new york america started using the dollar system as a geopolitical weapon in earnest after the attacks of september 11th 2001 president donald trump has taken this policy to a new level of intensity using sanctions as his main foreign policy tool and even targeting allies with secondary sanctions that punish anyone who trades with states in america s bad books america s power ultimately stems from its ability to prohibit firms from using its financial system in turn leaving them isolated and unable to interact with most counterparties often the effect is fatal the moves to explore alternatives to dollar dependence in the face of this bellicosity are varied russia has substantially de dollarised its trade flows foreign debt and bank assets its energy giants have started switching contracts to roubles russia china india and others are discussing and signing bilateral or wider deals to settle trade in national currencies they are also exploring alternatives to swift the dominant payments messaging network over which america holds sway europe meanwhile has built instex a clearing house that could allow its firms to trade with iran while bypassing america s financial cops the search for workarounds has been given further impetus by the technological revolution sweeping through finance central bankers from europe to china are stepping up work on public digital currencies these could help bring down the cost of electronic cross border payments which is still relatively high some foresee the creation of cryptobaskets of reserve currencies it would be overdoing it to say these initiatives pose an immediate threat to the dollar instex has yet to be used the swift alternatives have yet to gain traction the dollar s share is holding up on most measures though in forex reserves it has slipped from around 70 to 60 since 2000 it continues to enjoy strong network effects the most complex bits of global finance including a huge mesh of derivatives are generally dollar based moreover potential rivals have drawbacks the euro is hobbled by structural and governance problems not least the lack of a proper banking or markets union in the euro zone and a dearth relative to america of risk free financial assets such as german bunds blockchains alone cannot overcome such flaws the yuan too has had false dawns the tightening of capital controls after a financial crash in 2015 put paid to brash predictions that it would overtake the dollar by the early 2020s nevertheless an inflection point has been reached since mr trump began firing off financial ordnance his targets have gone from merely musing about breaking free from the dollar to doing something about it albeit tentatively for most it is hard to see those efforts being wound down even if america eases up a world in which the dollar is tested from several sides will be unpredictable in the longer term more balance among global reserve currencies may make the global monetary system less vulnerable to shock and the dollar s current pre eminence is not an unalloyed good for america it distorts the currency s value upwards and market interest rates downwards in the interim however the new era of monetary experimentation carries three big risks first a further escalation of sanctions could cause a financial shock for instance if china s giant banks which together have over 1trn of dollar assets were targeted the second worry is that the more politicised america s financial hegemony becomes the less reliable it will be in its long standing role as a lender of last resort to offshore dollar based financial markets and banks the third is that transitions in the global monetary order are inherently unpredictable some economists believe the depression was partly caused by the absence of a hegemon to steady the world economy mr trump s upping of the financial pressure will have repercussions far beyond tehran or moscow

china posts weakest growth in 29 years as trade war bites but ends 2019 on better note china s economic growth cooled to its weakest in nearly 30 years in 2019 amid a bruising trade war with the united states and more stimulus is expected this year as beijing tries to boost sluggish investment and demand but data on friday also showed the world s second largest economy ended the rough year on a somewhat firmer note as a trade truce revived business confidence and earlier growth boosting measures finally appeared to be taking hold as expected china s growth slowed to 6 1 last year from 6 6 in 2018 data from the national bureau of statistics showed though still strong by global standards and within the government s target range it was the weakest expansion since 1990 this year is crucial for the ruling communist party to fulfill its goal of doubling gross domestic product gdp and incomes in the decade to 2020 and turning china into a moderately prosperous nation analysts reckon that long term target would need growth this year to remain around 6 though top officials have warned the economy may face even greater pressure than in 2019 more recent data along with optimism over a phase 1 u s china trade deal signed on wednesday have raised hopes that the economy may be bottoming out fourth quarter gdp rose 6 0 from a year earlier steadying from the third quarter though still the weakest in nearly three decades and december industrial output investment and retail sales all rose more than expected after an improved showing in november policy sources have told reuters that beijing plans to set a lower growth target of around 6 this year from last year s 6 6 5 relying on increased infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown key targets are due to be announced in march on a quarterly basis the economy grew 1 5 in october december also the same pace as the previous three months we expect china s growth rate will come further down to below 6 in the coming year said masaaki kanno chief economist at sony financial holdings in tokyo the chinese economy is unlikely to fall abruptly because of government policies but at the same time the trend of a further slowdown of the economy will remain unchanged signs of improvement but will it last december data released along with gdp showed a surprising acceleration in industrial output and a more modest pick up in investment growth while retail sales were solid industrial output grew 6 9 from a year earlier the strongest pace in nine months while retail sales rose 8 0 fixed asset investment rose 5 4 for the full year but growth had plumbed record lows in autumn easing trade tensions have made manufacturers more optimistic about the business outlook analysts said though many of the tit for tat tariffs both sides imposed during the trade war remain in place despite the recent uptick in activity we think it is premature to call the bottom of the current economic cycle julian evans pritchard and martin rasmussen at capital economics said in a note external headwinds should ease further in the coming quarters thanks to the phase one trade deal and a recovery in global growth but we think this will be offset by a renewed slowdown in domestic demand triggering further monetary easing by the people s bank among other key risks this year infrastructure a key part of beijing s stabilisation strategy has remained stubbornly weak infrastructure investment grew just 3 8 in 2019 decelerating from 4 in january november despite sharply higher local government bond issuance and other policy measures this shows that local governments continued to face funding constraints said tommy xie china economist at ocbc bank in singapore some analysts are also worried about signs of cooling in the housing market a key economic driver property investment growth hit a two year low in december even as it grew at a solid 9 9 pace in 2019 property sales fell 0 1 the first annual decline in five years beijing has worked for years to keep speculation and home price rises in check and officials vowed last year they would not use the property market as a form of short term stimulus more support measures china will roll out more support measures this year as the economy faces further pressure ning jizhe head of the statistical bureau told a news conference ning noted that per capital gdp in china had surpassed 10 000 for the first time last year but analysts believe more painful reforms are needed to generate additional growth beijing has been relying on a mix of fiscal and monetary steps to weather the current downturn cutting taxes and allowing local governments to sell huge amounts of bonds to fund infrastructure projects banks also have been encouraged to lend more especially to small firms with new yuan loans hitting a record 16 81 trillion yuan 1 87 trillion pounds in 2019 the central bank has cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrr the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves eight times since early 2018 most recently this month china has also seen modest cuts in some lending rates analysts polled by reuters expect further cuts in both rrr and key interest rates this year but chinese leaders have repeatedly pledged they will not embark on massive stimulus like that during the 2008 09 global crisis which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt containing financial system risks will remain a high priority for policymakers this year corporate bond defaults hit a new record last year while state linked firms had to step in to rescue several troubled smaller banks even with additional stimulus and assuming the trade truce holds economists polled by reuters expect china s growth will cool this year to 5 9 source reuters reporting

by econimica we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us this may not be a surprise to many males but human females are unlike the rest of the animals on earth human females have a unique and totally differentiating factor from nearly all other animal life their bodies cease being capable of pregnancy approximately half way through their life cycle this natural change to sterility menopause does not happen in the animal kingdom nor in human males essentially so long as they live ok actually there may be a couple of whales and porpoises that may also go through menopause but i digress animals and male humans are still able to reproduce nearly until the end but not human females even before menopause fully takes over typically around 50 years of age fertility rates drop radically after 40 and miscarriages surge among those able to get pregnant by 45 pregnancies essentially cease what the hell does this have to do with economics you may be asking yourself judging the size and change of humankinds population is quite different than any other species on earth because of this truncated period of fertility among human females thus to gauge the direction of our species and the future consumption and potential economic activity we must focus on annual births versus the 20 to 40 year old female population and understand that the post childbearing 40 year old female population is from a fertility perspective simply an inert echo chamber the 20 to 40 and 40 year old populations shown below through 2040 are not estimates or projections but actual persons which already exist and absent some pandemic world war or change in life spans will slide through the next 20 years all data except where noted comes from the un world population prospects 2019 and they collect compile all the data from the national and regional bodies the only real variables in what i ll show below are immigration deaths and births over the next 20 years i also primarily focus on the world excluding africa africa consumes so little has relatively very low emigration rates is highly reliant on the rest of the world for it s economic growth but from a population perspective is growing so rapidly as to skew the picture but at the onset of a declining childbearing population excluding africa and ongoing declines in fertility rates the un projects that the decline in births excluding africa since 1989 will only continue but i ll show why significantly lower annual births are far more realistic than the un projections and given nation after nation is reporting shocking declines in births in 2018 and again 2019 the estimated numbers of births are only set to be significantly lower as something very momentous is appears to be happening last 70 years 1950 89 32 million annual births 375 million female 20 40 year olds 320 million female 40 year olds 1989 20 17 million annual births 230 million female 20 40year olds 680

be about 50 lower than the 1989 peak and given the known decline of a minimum of 45 million females of childbearing age by 2040 and almost 70 million fewer or 30 fewer than the 2000 peak there is

are terminal as even the 40 year old segment is now making its turn to decline along with births and the childbearing population by 2040 there will be more than 3 7 post childbearing females for every potential mother what saved japan during the long decline in domestic demand a long rise in global export demand is now over the japanese german models of reliance on exports to make up for decelerating declining domestic demand was premised on fast rising global demand which is simply no longer supported by a growing population of potential consumers south korea again and again i am shocked when i look at south korea the 70 collapse in annual births will only continue picking up speed to the downside as those capable of childbearing are in freefall while the 40 population dwarf s the under 40 year olds by more than 2 to 1 now and will be almost 4 to 1 by 2040 a done deal not a prediction absent state mandated pregnancies or the like births will fall in excess of 80 and may even be down 90 by 2040 a society collectively choosing not to reproduce or replace themselves essentially committing a collective suicide at a time of the most relative plenty korea has ever known it

last few centuries has been a rising population more people need more of everything this means more factories more supply networks more infrastructure more homes more cars creating more employment etc including more loans and debt being lent into existence particularly among the younger populations allowing for the purchase of vehicles homes etc in the present to be repaid later but when the collective younger adult population undertaking the vast majority of leverage ceases growing and all the growth shifts to older and elderly adults who undertake relatively low levels of debt or in elderly years move to outright deleverage the money supply ceases to grow organically and begins to shrink antithetically to a perpetually growing system what is the point of all this the global

supply ceases to grow organically and begins to shrink antithetically to a perpetually growing system it has been a long run up since wwii to get here decades of rate hikes during accelerating demand constricting supply of money and causing inflation then decades of rate cuts during decelerating demand expanding supply of money and causing deflation but simultaneously asset inflation resultant debt through individuals corporations and federal governments all intertwined with the deceleration of population growth since 2009 the fed is committed to buying bonds so as to avoid a free market pricing for those bonds and avoid yields on us debt that would soar and consume much most of the federal taxes collected the fed is also now committed to not allow free market pricing of assets based on decelerating population growth of young and large deleveraging among elderly i think it is also highly likely the fed and or agents at its direction are also manipulating precious metals and or crypto s so as to hide the severity of the situation all of this is inorganic money creation taking place now is to mask the fundamental accelerating weakness that a low population growth can organically support the federal government and federal reserve have now gone so far that any deceleration in inorganic growth let alone outright declines in balance sheet rate hikes declines in excess reserves tax hikes lower federal deficits have a high potential to take the economy into not a recession but a depression unlike the world has known the primary ingredients for removing ourselves from previous recessions depressions no longer exist global demand will begin declining indefinitely as this demographic picture plays out and rates back at zero will do little to move the needle aside from more asset inflation the fast rising population of elderly will continue to consume less than they did in their prime years and deleverage more far beyond the capability of the young adults to offset the financial economic and currency impacts the true picture is that a generations reset is likely in the offing before the demographic and depopulation dynamics can be turned around before the debt can all be extinguished before the overcapacity can be expunged and i guess the trillion dollar question should be how did we get here were the gyrations in the population and subsequent decelerations and imminent population collapses in many nations regions simply the result of birth care becoming widely available urbanization female employment rates etc etc that happened of their own accord or if instead this is by design as central banks had an over riding mandate since the 1970 s not unlike china but by a different means only now becoming clear was this simply humankind going beyond itself or was this imminent collapse centrally designed and engineered
comment malaysia is a trading country its gross domestic product is slightly above one third of a trillion us dollars which means malaysia has a lot of room to grow after all indonesia made it as a trillion dollar gdp although indonesia has 10 times the population of malaysia putrajaya is the first country in the malay archipelago to have tackled poverty systematically and strategically some policies such as the national economic policy nep may have serious leakages leading to corruption and false claims such as a freight transporter of the sugar trade to sarawak instead of claiming one shipment has been made reliable sources from anti corruption agencies across the country have detected multiple false claims making these false claims it seems has become more profitable than shipping the sugar to sabah or sarawak sometimes it is not the policy that is at fault like the new economic policy it is the implementation that scuttles the attainment of those lofty aims this year marks the coming of the asia pacific economic cooperation or apec summit while malaysia will be the first country to host apec twice in 22 years the previous one in 1998 as reported by the diplomat prime minister dr mahathir mohamed is determined to make it his swan song as for after apec mahathir has decided to trigger the oft discussed leadership transition to anwar ibrahim of course there are murmurs of discontent that the handover should be may 2020 but this is more noise than anything else either way the key is the free volition of both leaders to make malaysia achieve great strides in international trade there are six reasons why malaysia needs to take apec seriously even though apec is losing its steam first of all hong kong one of the entities of apec will enter into a recession this year china s economic growth is merely 6 1 percent too not forgetting its us 2 trillion domestic debt bubble while the gdp of india halved from 9 percent to 4 5 percent between 2015 2019 due to multiple reasons like demonetisation and the ongoing bjp led political instability secondly when the train ticket prices of chileans were raised by a mere 4 cents chileans demonstrated in large numbers leading to santiago the capital of chile cancelling apec altogether in november 2019 the cost of living in kuala lumpur remains high there is no telling if malaysians would challenge the utility of apec too times are indeed hard on many countries that are members of apec indonesia alone experienced a shortage of us 120 billion in tax collection last year and roughly the same amount the year before thirdly the only bright spot is the us wall street crossed the growth of 30 percent last week only the fifth time in the history of the us given the strength of the us economy washington dc can decide to play coy president donald trump who is up for reelection anyway won t be able to make it to the apec summit again indeed the third time on a roll in other words other than the us almost all major powers are stuttering to a stop mahathir for the lack of better words has to make apec work and anwar too in order to maintain malaysia s status as a trading nation fourthly it would be wrong to assume apec is all about diplomatic pageantry and state ceremonies where the leaders get to strut themselves like a peacock in 1994 under the leadership of president suharto of indonesia in bogor the member states agreed to focus on sectoral liberalisation which permits each country to deregulate their economy sector by sector rather than all in one go japan us china and all the rest were agreeable to this organic approach if they had agreed once a visionary malaysia leader can persuade them to do it all over again fifthly apec will involve all member states mindful of the trade and technology nationalism of the us and china both countries have to be brought to bear to understand that any kind of war will spook the market and even if wall street alone is doing better the wall can crumble as it once did in the 2008 2009 global financial crisis finally the agenda of apec has to lead the way for the regional comprehensive economic agreement rcep to become an important template where india will not feel threatened by the economic prowess of china to subsidise its way in all industries a fear shared by the us and japan malaysia must shape up or ship out since some of the agendas would be carried over by what has been left behind by chile when they cancelled the summit last november more importantly pakatan harapan has to hold true to the work to reinvent malaysia as malaysia baru based on open regionalism without the latter malaysia would be stuck in the rut putrajaya cannot get itself out of the middle income trap nor can it assure voters and investors alike that it capable of pioneering a new strategic breakthrough for great and medium powers alike rais hussin is president ceo at emir research an independent think tank focused on

by claudio grass with godfrey bloom via claudiograss ch interview with godfrey bloom the latest election in the uk promised to bring about a long overdue end to the brexit story getting out the eu has been a long and winding road for britain and the multiple delays and setbacks have both infuriated and disappointed the millions of citizens who voted to leave by now three times already ever since the referendum all at least foreign eyes have been fixed on the latest brexit updates however there have been other important shifts and changes in the nation both economic and socio political that could have a more meaningful impact going forward this is why i reached out to godfrey bloom to get his perspective on these developments and to better understand britain s present and future challenges i find that his refreshingly direct and no nonsense approach really helps separate the signals from the noise which can be especially useful for investors his professional experience is also particularly valuable in this regard before entering the world of politics in 2004 he worked in the city of london for forty years and won fixed interest investment prizes he served as a member of the european parliament mep for a decade and became widely known as a vocal opponent of government regulation and centralization a firm euro skeptic bloom was also heavily involved in the brexit leave campaign as an independent activist he is an associate member of the royal college of defense studies holds the territorial decoration sovereign s medal european parliamentary medal and westminster armed forces parliamentary medal he is also an author with seven books to his credit he is married to one of europe s leading equine physiotherapists claudio grass cg it would appear that after the last election in the uk we ve finally entered the last chapter of the brexit saga given how committed boris johnson is to get brexit done do you expect it all to be over by january 31 swiftly and uneventfully or do you foresee any further surprises and political tensions within the country godfrey bloom gb on the plus side after one referendum and two general elections the british electorate has overwhelmingly endorsed brexit for the third time however although the government has been returned on a brexit platform the british establishment is still on the remain side the house of lords the civil service mainstream media and the majority of backbenchers are all on the remain camp now we all know that a trade deal would be easy to reach if there was mutual goodwill but there isn t if it gets to no deal the government majority could disappear overnight or the lords could block it of course we will leave on january 31 but will it be the brexit we voted for or some kind of associate membership we will know more in july and i m disinclined to make a prediction i have been right in my assessments for decades but i am no longer so sure i have been a brexiteer for 30 years and i have known only betrayal i am now too cynical to be objective nevertheless there is a great feeling of optimism in britain with the exception perhaps of some central london postal districts we haven t had that in a while and i sincerely hope it won t be cut short by another political betrayal cg ever since the referendum the political climate in the uk has been getting increasingly polarised do you think these frictions and toxic divisions peaked with the overwhelming defeat of jeremy corbyn will the british society really begin to heal now as johnson urged in his victory speech gb there has been much talk of a divided nation this is an oversimpli fication the nation is only divided between the establishment and the electorate the last election proved this in spades public sector employees academics mainstream media the political and bureaucratic establishment are lined up against ordinary working people butchers bakers mechanics cab drivers hairdressers small businessmen over 17 million of them sent a strong and united message and showed where the division lines are really drawn in the nation the times of london the bbc and others are still campaigning for remain even now they still can t accept the will of the electorate and yet ordinary folk are less divided than ever before in peacetime but ordinary people don t control the levers of power and they don t get to write headlines or determine the narrative that s being promoted cg what is your position on the break apart scenarios on scottish independence and on the remainer warnings that brexit will revive the troubles in northern ireland gb scotland returned 91 nationalist seats classically no one admits voting for them heard that before the dilemma is that scots detest the english but can t survive without english money it was ever thus since 1707 ironically the english actually want to get rid of the scots but nobody asks them westminster has now 48 english hating socialists from scotland yet they have their own parliament this position is absurd scotland is bankrupt and something will have to give sooner or later as for northern ireland nobody understands irish politics the majority in ulster want to stay in the uk the ira tried to bomb their way into a united ireland and failed and nobody wants to revisit that scenario so common sense will probably prevail the irish republic are terrified of a united ireland and they think all ulstermen are crazy but they will only tell you that in private cg what about the political and economic outlook post brexit do you expect a shift towards more decentralisation less state control and a leaner public service or do you think the opposite is more likely despite their rhetoric the modern conservative party is a tax and spend keynesian neo socialist and centralist outfit the uk national debt has doubled on their watch and their manifesto doubled down on more spending as usual the national debt went undiscussed at the general election the uk tax take is currently the highest in 50 years it is encompassed in the goal of higher minimum wages and no reform of the ludicrous nhs there is some hope however dominic cummings who is the brains behind this government is committed to serious reform of the civil service this alone is worth giving modest hope to all thinking brits claudio grass cg the pound has had quite the wild ride over the last couple of years but it would appear that it is finally stabilizing how do you evaluate the part that the bank of england has played so far and the impact of its interest rate policy godfrey bloom gb central banks globally are the problem and not the solution nor have they ever been they have facilitated national corporate and personal debt to an estimated 257 trillion money printing and fake interest rates have destroyed international banking fiat currencies and ultimately pension funds the system is doomed to collapse nothing can be done now in my opinion we must just watch it play out and see what rises phoenix like from the ashes regarding the future of the pound we ve heard too many histrionic arguments and end of days proclamations all of them politically motivated with no factual basis however the truth of the matter is quite simple really just imagine if you will you are an economics undergraduate and the following question is in your exam paper there exists a protectionist trade cartel called the eu it is made up of 27 countries most of which use a fiat currency called the euro one member doesn t it uses the pound sterling it is an ancient currency and it is recognised globally this member is called britain it is the second biggest contributor to the cartel 14 billion pa it is a net importer of eu goods to the tune of an 80 20 imbalance in favour of the eu britain has decided to leave the cartel join a global trading platform and stop paying 14 billion pa exports from britain to the eu are falling but rising in the rest of the world and britain will now be free to negotiate international trade deals which currency would you expect to weaken and which to strengthen explain your reasoning cg speaking of the bank of england what do you make of the appointment of andrew bailey as its new governor do you expect him to change course or continue with the policy direction set by his predecessor mr carney we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us gb i recently wrote an article on the matter taking a closer look at his background and professional record and explaining my serious reservations regarding his appointment of course he might seem a good choice compared to his predecessor but that really doesn t say much mark carney did such a profoundly poor job that next to him anyone looks good on paper andrew bailey ticks all the boxes necessary to gain the establishment s approval he has done alright in his previous roles he made no waves and ruffled no feathers however it is obvious that he is a creature of the establishment a card carrying member of the same club that is directly responsible for the mess we re in today as such he is seriously ill equipped to deal with what will hit the bank and the nation s economy on his watch having learned nothing from the past decade he ll most likely respond to the coming crisis by printing and cutting interest rates to zero cg the government recently announced a 6 2 rise to the minimum wage which many have celebrated as a step in the right direct direction given however that this is far above the inflation rate do you think it will be beneficial to the economy as a whole gb the minimum wage is a system specifically designed to deny employment to unskilled workers hence the growth in robots and self service pay counters where these can t replace people the business closes or offers a poorer service at a higher price restaurants suffer in particular moreover there is a moral question at the heart of this issue that few seem to acknowledge let alone be willing to discuss is it the role of government to set private sector wages in a free society cg do you see moves like that as part of a larger trend in the country of increased interventionism and government spending gb the key is to create a low tax regulatory britain and let the market decide however the incoming government had a manifesto of massive public spending especially in the north of england they will make the age old mistake of letting bureaucrats apportion the money so it will be squandered and wasted the initiative will fail the government will assume they didn t spend enough money and double up all to no avail the state is the problem not the solution cg what is the single biggest risk going forward for british savers soon to be pensioners and investors and what do you think they can do to protect themselves at this stage gb private sector pensions are on average 35 underfunded stocks and bonds must eventually crash deposits are not safe bail ins will crucify even the ultra cautious fake low interest rates have pushed transfer values through the roof on final salary schemes so it might be wise to get out whilst you can for those with self invested schemes buy gold coins at the royal mint which will have to be held in specie take the tax free sum before they take the option away and again buy british legal tender gold coins in the uk they have no vat or capital gains tax the same goes for ordinary savers don t buy etfs they are only bank promissory notes and thus worthless when things go wrong and they will gold sovereigns are international money if you take big positions hold in specie at a private safe deposit company do not keep your assets at a bank or state owned depository the state is more likely to steal your money than any burglar the american government has proven as much switzerland is the safest bet if you are a big hitter cg on a socio political level it would appear that the focus has decisively shifted from the economy to diversity and now to climate change many officials have highlighted it as a policy priority including the outgoing bank of england governor the idea that more should be done centrally with policy changes new regulations and tax money allocations seems to be gathering steam do you agree with this or do you think this might be a slippery slope gb i sat for a few years on the eu environment committee it focused my mind on personal research on the facts to hand i am not a scientist but i am a research economist by profession so i am trained in how to read statistics funny things like reversion to the mean the simpson paradox statistical provenance and such i also put on my staff some brilliant young researchers it became very clear in a short space of time that the apocalyptic global warming agw hypothesis was deeply flawed sometimes fraudulently promoted there is no correlation between co2 man made or natural and global warming quite the reverse atmospheric co2 follows global warming it does not precede it i shared a platform with prof ian plimer the world s leading climate scientist whose book blows the hypothesis out of the water it took three years for the penny to drop with me that the agw hypothesis is a neo political faith system to promote a form of global governance which otherwise would be unacceptable to democrats note the support and constant promotion by the establishment mainstream media international banks academics bureaucrats why is nobody allowed to raise a protest on bbc or other tv channels why have climate skeptics been sidelined or dismissed why are children at the forefront of the debate not scientists even when three thousand scientists called agw a hoax it was not reported we now see the un colluding with some of the most crooked institutions on the planet goldman sachs to name but one this is all about money and political control as solar activity decreases and we probably enter a new mini ice age it will be interesting to see just how long the eco fascists agenda can prevail against thousands dying of hypothermia they won t be the first people killed by green policies they are dying as i write in australia cg over the last year we ve seen economic uncertainty geopolitical tensions and massive protests spread around the globe what s your outlook for 2020 and what would be your advice for the average citizen and saver in the west gb the seeds have been sown for unrest in 2020 in europe along with a banking crisis which might or might not come about it could be 2021 there is a major immigration crisis which we dare not speak its name northwestern european countries are committed to welfarism the state commits to protect the citizen from cradle to grave with public education healthcare social welfare pensions housing this is unsustainable in any event but with masses of unskilled labor pouring in from deeply alien countries sweden could become the template for us all welfare was designed as a safety net for the indigenous population not a come one come all freebie existence britain is taking in 300 000 every year that is just the ones we know about the population of a middle sized town it is national suicide and germany france italy are all the same although britain is considered to be the greatest prize of all on top of that the crazy green agenda is crucifying some major exporting industries nobody goes to the barricades with a full stomach but we can expect more layoffs in the german auto industry which at present has no political voice france is already on the brink of another revolution which is not reported of course it is assumed there is a d notice on it from the government certainly there are no pictures on tv any more than the historical highs of the antarctic ice caps are shown my advice is to stay out of debt as far as possible keep a gold reserve in a reputable safe depository and to be doubly safe depending on where you live muster the means to defend yourself and your family claudio grass hÃ¼nenberg see switzerland

by stella qiu and kevin yao beijing reuters china s economic growth cooled to its weakest in nearly 30 years in 2019 amid a bruising trade war with the united states and more stimulus is expected this year as beijing tries to boost sluggish investment and demand but data on friday also showed the world s second largest economy ended the rough year on a somewhat firmer note as a trade truce revived business confidence and earlier growth boosting measures finally appeared to be taking hold as expected china s growth slowed to 6 1 last year from 6 6 in 2018 data from the national bureau of statistics showed though still strong by global standards and within the government s target range it was the weakest expansion since 1990 this year is crucial for the ruling communist party to fulfill its goal of doubling gross domestic product gdp and incomes in the decade to 2020 and turning china into a moderately prosperous nation analysts reckon that long term target would need growth this year to remain around 6 though top officials have warned the economy may face even greater pressure than in 2019 more recent data along with optimism over a phase 1 u s china trade deal signed on wednesday have raised hopes that the economy may be bottoming out fourth quarter gdp rose 6 0 from a year earlier steadying from the third quarter though still the weakest in nearly three decades and december industrial output investment and retail sales all rose more than expected after an improved showing in november policy sources have told reuters that beijing plans to set a lower growth target of around 6 this year from last year s 6 6 5 relying on increased infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown key targets are due to be announced in march on a quarterly basis the economy grew 1 5 in october december also the same pace as the previous three months we expect china s growth rate will come further down to below 6 in the coming year said masaaki kanno chief economist at sony financial holdings in tokyo the chinese economy is unlikely to fall abruptly because of government policies but at the same time the trend of a further slowdown of the economy will remain unchanged signs of improvement but will it last december data released along with gdp showed a surprising acceleration in industrial output and a more modest pick up in investment growth while retail sales were solid industrial output grew 6 9 from a year earlier the strongest pace in nine months while retail sales rose 8 0 fixed asset investment rose 5 4 for the full year but growth had plumbed record lows in autumn easing trade tensions have made manufacturers more optimistic about the business outlook analysts said though many of the tit for tat tariffs both sides imposed during the trade war remain in place despite the recent uptick in activity we think it is premature to call the bottom of the current economic cycle julian evans pritchard and martin rasmussen at capital economics said in a note external headwinds should ease further in the coming quarters thanks to the phase one trade deal and a recovery in global growth but we think this will be offset by a renewed slowdown in domestic demand triggering further monetary easing by the people s bank among other key risks this year infrastructure a key part of beijing s stabilization strategy has remained stubbornly weak infrastructure investment grew just 3 8 in 2019 decelerating from 4 in january november despite sharply higher local government bond issuance and other policy measures this shows that local governments continued to face funding constraints said tommy xie china economist at ocbc bank in singapore some analysts are also worried about signs of cooling in the housing market a key economic driver property investment growth hit a two year low in december even as it grew at a solid 9 9 pace in 2019 property sales fell 0 1 the first annual decline in five years beijing has worked for years to keep speculation and home price rises in check and officials vowed last year they would not use the property market as a form of short term stimulus more support measures china will roll out more support measures this year as the economy faces further pressure ning jizhe head of the statistical bureau told a news conference ning noted that per capital gdp in china had surpassed 10 000 for the first time last year but analysts believe more painful reforms are needed to generate additional growth beijing has been relying on a mix of fiscal and monetary steps to weather the current downturn cutting taxes and allowing local governments to sell huge amounts of bonds to fund infrastructure projects banks also have been encouraged to lend more especially to small firms with new yuan loans hitting a record 16 81 trillion yuan 2 44 trillion in 2019 the central bank has cut banks reserve requirement ratios rrr the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves eight times since early 2018 most recently this month china has also seen modest cuts in some lending rates analysts polled by reuters expect further cuts in both rrr and key interest rates this year but chinese leaders have repeatedly pledged they will not embark on massive stimulus like that during the 2008 09 global crisis which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt containing financial system risks will remain a high priority for policymakers this year corporate bond defaults hit a new record last year while state linked firms had to step in to rescue several troubled smaller banks even with additional stimulus and assuming the trade truce holds economists polled by reuters expect china s growth will cool this year to 5 9 reporting by kevin yao editing by kim coghill
president donald trump s much discussed phase one trade deal with china sets aside some of the economic uncertainty that has generated market volatility and depressed business investment but trade experts say it falls far short of justifying a globally damaging trade war between the world s two largest economies what s more this resolution could mean higher costs for u s companies and consumers while threatened tariffs on finished consumer goods such as clothes and electronics were avoided the deal also reaffirmed the white house s commitment to tariffs as an enforcement mechanism leaving in place sanctions on 370 billion worth of chinese imports for the foreseeable future this gives american buyers of those goods primarily parts for items made in the u s a greater degree of certainty in their input costs albeit not in the direction they wanted trade analysts said this means companies facing higher input costs would probably begin passing those along to consumers in the form of higher prices if they had not done so already as tariffs become semi permanent chinese producers and u s retailers will have even more reason to pass on price increases said peter petri a professor of international finance at the brandeis international business school overall petri called the deal signed wednesday a valuable agreement saying this is a fragile truce but it s an opportunity for confidence building but he also added several caveats it stopped the downward spiral of retaliations but it is less than what its supporters claim he said some of its provisions are vague and some are unachievable other experts were less impressed i m just underwhelmed said michael o moore professor of economics and international affairs at george washington university i think most people will give a sigh of relief that it s not going to get worse but the real issues remain some said the white house gained nothing by blowing up a nearly completed agreement last spring compared to the may 2019 deal is much thinner and does not entail a long list requirements for china to change its domestic laws and regulations said jacob kirkegaard a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics the trump administration made much of the agricultural purchase concessions in the deal but while the consensus was that the u s agricultural sector will likely be a key beneficiary experts were skeptical that china could or would meet the target of importing an additional 200 billion worth of american goods and services including an additional 80 billion in agricultural purchases over two years above pre trade war levels this requires a 40 percent increase this year and another 40 percent increase in 2021 that seems like a stretch goal said david dollar a senior fellow at the brookings institution it s redistributing income from one group of firms to another one in a very complex way it s not obvious it s a benefit for the u s economy he said with no specific dollar targets per agricultural commodity farmers won t know how many soybeans to plant or pigs to raise making them potentially unable to fulfill much larger orders and petri pointed out that the deal s verbiage gives china wiggle room chinese officials say that they will buy u s goods based on market demand but demand won t grow that fast on its own he said to get such spectacular growth china would have to create massive subsidies for u s goods a huge government intervention that we should not be asking for petri said creating government sanctioned demand at that scale could raise the price of those goods and distort the market some said china also risked running afoul of world trade organization regulations against countries playing favorites with their trading partners in short what was a large and steadily growing market for u s commodity producers in china has now become and will remain highly politicized and hence risky for u s farmers kirkegaard said purchase guarantees weren t deemed the only questionable part of the deal provisions meant to hold china accountable for infractions such as forced technology transfers were anemic according to people who analyzed the text on trade secrets to be honest the language that s in the agreement is pretty loose and generic said harry g broadman managing director at berkeley research group who chairs the firm s emerging markets practice on the face of it i don t see at least on that portion of the agreement a lot that s significantly different from previous types of agreements some of the practices and changes agreed to by beijing were changes that were already in the works or had been previously agreed upon petri said some of these provisions will benefit both american and chinese interests and are in keeping with beijing s longer term economic goals china wants foreign investment and may well roll out new reforms in opening insurance and other financial sectors he said china is trying to create more of an environment in which investment innovation are self reinforcing processes said dean a pinkert senior counsel at the law firm of hughes hubbard reed and a former commissioner of the u s international trade commission pinkert suggested beijing s concessions in these areas were what chinese policymakers wanted anyway i think in the long run it s as much in china s interests to address those structural reform issues as much as it s in the u s s interests he said many criticized the dispute resolution provisions for not including a mechanism for third party arbitration and worried that enforcement ultimately would hinge on the threat to reinstate or ratchet up tariffs while china certainly seeks to mitigate the impact its own economy has sustained as a result of two years worth of trade sanctions the administration s choice to lean into tariffs risks inflicting more damage on the american economy as well the people who are paying the tariffs are u s firms and u s consumers broadman said it s not clear to me what the actual economic impact will be as a dispute resolution measure to threaten china with more tariffs
u s review 2020 is off to a good start most of this week s economic reports showed the economy ended 2019 with strong momentum while the senate passage of the usmca and the signing of phase i of the china trade deal reduce some of the uncertainty hanging over the outlook mild weather helped housing starts surge 16 9 in december to a 1 61 million unit pace the highest in 13 years manufacturing surveys from the new york fed and philadelphia fed both rose more than expected in december december retail sales were soft with a 0 5 gain in core retail sales offset by downward revisions to the prior two months a pretty good start to the year this morning s much stronger than expected rise in housing starts capped off a very good week for the economy housing starts surged 16 9 to a 1 61 million unit pace the highest level since december 2006 big jumps like this are not unusual for december the seasonal adjustment factors are huge and unseasonably mild weather as we had this past month can often lead to exaggerated jumps in the seasonally adjusted data there is also a tendency for multifamily starts to surge at year end as apartment developers race to begin projects ahead of new legislative mandates december s data appear to have been impacted by both forces single family starts jumped 11 2 to a 1 06 million unit pace the highest since july 2007 multifamily starts surged an even stronger 29 8 to a 553 000 unit pace a 33 year high permits which are less impacted by temporary market distortions fell in december with single family down 0 5 and multifamily down 9 6 the level of construction for both single family and apartments however has been strong for the entire second half of 2019 which means that even if activity stabilizes at recent levels we would still see sizable year over year gains to start 2020 moreover we expect to see continued gains the nahb index a measure of homebuilder optimism held near a 20 year high in december we also got some positive signs from the manufacturing sector while industrial production fell 0 3 that was entirely due to unseasonably warm weather dragging on utilities output manufacturing output exceeded expectations rising 0 2 aside from the gm strike and boeing s issues with the 737 max the factory sector is showing signs of stabilizing amid a nascent rebound in global industrial output and some more positive developments in trade policy domestic manufacturing surveys are already beginning to reflect this with the new york fed 4 8 vs 3 6 expected and philly fed 17 0 vs 3 8 expected both rising more than expected in january the improvement in the regional surveys should eventually show up in the national ism survey elsewhere in survey evidence the nfib small business index dipped slightly to 102 7 in december but owners generally remain optimistic and expect improved economic conditions in coming months the trade deal will likely boost confidence going forward while impeachment proceedings may weigh on the january data owners are still seeing solid sales which was reflected to some extent in the december retail sales report which showed sales up 0 3 downward revisions took some of the shine off the report and meant that 2019 holiday sales were up 4 1 year over year slightly below our expectation final data for the holiday period are still a few months away strength in control group sales gives us confidence in our q4 pce forecast of 2 1 a slowdown to be sure but still well above most initial forecasts for the period inflation meanwhile remains relatively tame the cpi rose 0 2 in december pushing the year over year change to 2 3 the core cpi is also up 2 3 year over year the fed s preferred measure the core pce deflator remains stuck at 1 6 low inflation provides the fed some leeway to maintain an easier monetary policy in place and expect the fed to remain on hold this year u s outlook existing home sales wednesday the pace of existing home sales likely continued to climb in december to around 5 45 million the housing market in general is now solidly a positive and resales have been no exception benefitting from the decline in mortgage rates and improving sentiment on a year over year basis sales have risen the past five months after 16 straight months of declines with rates unlikely to break out to the upside we see this strength continuing however the pace of improvement is unlikely to accelerate as there are simply not enough available homes for sale last month inventories fell 5 7 year over year to the lowest november level since 1999 the dearth of inventory is exerting upward pressure on prices now rising 5 4 annually and capping further improvement in the buying environment for 2020 as a whole we expect resales to come in at around a 5 44 million unit pace up from around 5 36 million in 2019 previous 5 35 m wells fargo 5 45 m consensus 5 43 m jobless claims thursday next week is extremely light on new economic data which means the thursday jobless claims print will probably get too much attention we would caution that week to week movements in claims are far too noisy to gather much insight but the trend is nevertheless clear claims are incredibly low on a historical basis and even lower after adjusting for the growth in the labor force and attest to the strength and resilience of the u s labor market last week claims fell by 10 000 to just 204 000 pulling the four week moving average down to 216 000 we expect the unemployment rate to remain between 3 5 3 6 in 2020 while underlying payroll growth should gradually moderate the actual headline payroll numbers will begin to see some serious distortions from 2020 census hiring for now claims have yet to point to any major deterioration in the labor market and we think this will continue to be the case in coming quarters previous 204k consensus 214k lei thursday the december reading of the leading economic index lei will likely point to a very modest fall in economic growth prospects the lei which is a composite of ten different variables designed to signal peaks and troughs in the economic cycle was flat in november after three straight declines weakness has mainly been concentrated in manufacturing while equity market strength and an upturn in residential building permits have boosted the index stocks kept rolling in december while manufacturing output actually surprised to the upside the signing of the phase i trade deal may modestly lift the index in coming months more broadly the conference board states that the lei is indicating that economic growth is likely to stabilize around 2 percent in 2020 this characterization is in accord with our own forecast of full year growth of 2 1 in 2020 previous 0 0 wells fargo 0 3 consensus 0 2 global review central banks keeping it easy data this week continued to point to further easing from the bank of england while dovish commentary from policymakers remains consistent with that narrative we acknowledge that the case for a boe rate cut has risen dramatically over the past week and although our official call is for no change in january we nonetheless agree that a rate cut is a distinct possibility in emerging markets both turkey and south africa s central banks cut interest rates this week given subdued gdp growth in each country elsewhere chinese gdp growth held steady in the fourth quarter and december activity data exceeded expectations adding to signs of a stabilizing chinese economy prospects of a boe rate cut rise this week data this week continue to point to further easing from the bank of england boe while dovish commentary from policymakers remains consistent with that narrative following weak growth and inflation figures earlier in the week markets are now pricing in a roughly 70 chance of a boe rate cut compared to about 25 at the start of the week the u k s inflation rate unexpectedly slowed to a three year low in december rising just 1 3 year over year while core inflation which excludes volatile components such as food alcohol and tobacco also disappointed rising just 1 4 meanwhile december retail sales unexpectedly fell 0 8 monthover month matching the revised november figure while sales were also down 0 9 quarter over quarter in q4 separately boe policymaker saunders said in a speech this week that stimulus measures may be needed to avoid a prolonged period of belowtarget inflation as u k economic growth remains sluggish our view has been for the boe to remain on hold at its policy meeting this month but given the weaker than expected data we acknowledge that the case for a boe rate cut is looking stronger by the day turkey and south african central banks ease the south african reserve bank sarb caught markets off guard with a 25 bps rate cut to 6 25 in the accompanying statement the sarb noted that the domestic economic outlook remains fragile significantly lowered its medium term inflation outlook compared to its november forecast and lowered its gdp growth forecasts the sarb s implied path of policy rates indicated additional rate cuts are likely over the course of 2020 the rand initially weakened following the announcement but retraced its losses in other central bank announcements turkey s central bank cut rates further reducing its one week repo rate 75 bps to 11 25 the fifth straight decrease the lira jumped following the announcement given that the move was less than the 100 bps cut some market participants expected given that headline inflation increased to 11 84 in december the latest interest rate cut pushed the real interest rate below zero middle chart the central bank s decision to ease monetary policy despite elevated inflation and underwhelming growth performance reinforces our view that rate cuts may be premature signs of stabilization in the chinese economy chinese gdp growth was unchanged at 6 0 year over year in the fourth quarter in line with expectations december activity data topped expectations as industrial output rose 6 9 year over year while retail sales growth was steady at 8 0 year over year the last quarter of 2019 seemed to end on a solid note a sign that china s growth supportive policies are beginning to have a positive impact on the economy this is also consistent with our view of a stable outlook for the chinese economy with u s china trade tensions now lessened in addition to continued stimulus support from the pboc we expect real gdp growth in china to remain near 5 9 in 2020 and 2021 global outlook bank of japan policy decision tuesday the bank of japan boj held its main policy rate steady at 0 10 at its december 19 policy meeting and outlined its rules for the etf lending program which was first announced in april the boj sounded a bit more upbeat on the global economy and noted that the domestic economy has been showing a moderate expanding trend we do not expect the boj to make any major changes to policy in the near future especially now that a fiscal easing package has been announced to counter a slowdown in the economy on the price front the boj made little changes to its inflation expectations even though inflation remains well below the central bank s 2 target in november headline prices rose 0 5 year over year likely in part due to the october sales tax increase despite education costs declining 7 8 after free preschool education started in october previous 0 10 wells fargo 0 10 consensus 0 10 ecb policy decision thursday at its final monetary policy announcement for 2019 the european central bank ecb held monetary policy steady as expected and made minimal changes to its economic projections since its december 12 meeting incoming data have been relatively more stable december headline inflation was the strongest since april 2019 and the three month average of core inflation edged higher to the strongest pace since 2015 an encouraging sign for the ecb meanwhile retail sales rose more than expected in november and industrial data were sturdy we still expect the ecb to cut rates an additional 10 bps in march given that inflation remains below the central bank s target rate and growth remains soft that said we acknowledge that risks are skewed toward no policy easing previous 0 50 wells fargo 0 50 consensus 0 50 u k pmis friday in the united kingdom recent data point to slower growth as the services and manufacturing pmis were below 50 on average in q4 2019 and gdp data surprised to the downside in november falling 0 3 month over month given the disappointing data over the past couple of months in addition to dovish commentary from bank of england boe policymakers the market is now pricing in roughly a 70 chance of a 25 bps rate cut at the january 30 meeting we recognize the case for a boe rate cut has risen dramatically over the past week and although our official call is for the boe to remain steady in january we nonetheless agree that a rate cut is a possibility last we note that the upcoming pmi data release next week should provide some additional insight to the u k economy prior to the policy meeting and may result in more market volatility than usual previous 47 5 manufacturing 50 0 services consensus 48 7 manufacturing 51 0 services point of view interest rate watch waiting on inflation but does the fed have the tools amid a slew of price data this week one thing was clear inflation remains subdued while good for consumers the persistently low rate of inflation this expansion has vexed the fed sub target inflation leaves the fomc less room to cut real interest rates and stimulate the economy in an environment when nominal rates are already low core pce inflation currently stands at 1 6 on par with its average this expansion the prolonged shortfall from 2 0 illustrated in the top chart has made inflation a key criteria to the fed cutting rates again even as other risks to the outlook have eased what levers then might the fomc pull to spur higher inflation there is of course the traditional lever of lower interest rates but given that inflation s struggle for 2 has been in a period of historically low rates it is reasonable to question the traditional strength of this relationship the subdued response of inflation to lower interest rates comes as only about 40 of the inflation basket has a significant link with slack in the economy as a result the fomc may have to run the economy quite hot so inflation in cyclically sensitive areas can offset weakness in areas that have historically been unresponsive to the economic cycle middle chart inflation expectations play a significant role in actual inflation as a result the fed has been reviewing ways in which it may lift inflation expectations as part of its ongoing policy tools and communication review we discussed a number of those options in a report last year in our view the fomc has already implicitly moved toward an average inflation target via its emphasis on the committee s symmetric target communicating that inflation would be allowed to run above 2 if credible should raise expectations but that credibility will be difficult to win given continued misses if its tools are insufficient to raise inflation the fed could be looking at a mismatch with its mandate which opens up longer term questions beyond the policy review credit market insights demand perks mortgage apps jump the first full week of the year saw a surge in housing demand as mortgage applications jumped 30 in the week ended january 10 refinancing applications led the surge up 42 7 likely stemming from lower mortgage rates which remain near their lowest levels in three years the conventional 30 year mortgage rate slipped nine basis points over the past four weeks to 3 65 low rates are not only encouraging refinancing among existing owners but are also enticing prospective buyers to enter the market as purchase applications climbed 15 5 last week low rates should support home buying but the pace of sales remains restricted by affordability challenges for first time buyers sales of existing singlefamily homes continue to be limited by extremely low inventories particularly of homes priced at or below the median we do not expect this headwind to disappear overnight as low inventories of existing homes have often been a problem this business cycle but there may be some room for improvement increased optimism among home builders may lead to more entry level construction but demographics may also provide a boost with the tail end of baby boomers now 55 years old or older which is when labor force participation begins to diminish we expect housing turnover and inventories to increase over the course of the decade topic of the week phase i trade deal signed president trump and chinese vice premier liu he signed the phase i trade deal in washington on january 15 the chinese agreed to crack down on intellectual property theft and forced technology transfer to avoid currency manipulation and to buy an additional 200 billion of american goods and services relative to 2017 over the next two years in return the united states agreed to not implement tariffs on more than 100 billion of american imports from china roll back tariffs to 7 5 from 15 on roughly 120 billion of imports and to not label china as a currency manipulator however 25 tariffs on roughly 250 billion of american imports from china will remain in place as we wrote in a previous report the agreement is a welcome step because it helps to de escalate trade tensions between the world s two largest economies in addition increased chinese purchases of american goods and services if they materialize as specified would provide a modest boost to the u s economy 200 billion over a two year period would be equivalent to roughly 0 5 of u s nominal gdp over that period it remains to be seen how much the trade deal will effect business fixed investment bfi spending in the united states by ratcheting down trade tensions the trade deal should reduce some of the uncertainty that exerted headwinds on bfi spending in 2019 on the other hand tariffs remain in place on nearly 400 billion of chinese imports and it seems overly optimistic to conclude that trade tensions with china are now a thing of the past our forecast looks for bfi to accelerate modestly over the course of the year but the 3 rise in bfi that we forecast will occur between q4 2019 and q4 2020 is hardly robust we believe that a renewed bout of tariff hikes is not likely in 2020 but the ball is now in china s court if china does not honor the commitments that it made in the recently signed trade deal then we could eventually be in for another round of trade tensions in 2021 or 2022

a common claim is that genetically modified organisms gmos are essential to agriculture if we are to feed an ever growing global population supporters of genetically engineered ge crops argue that by increasing productivity and yields this technology will also help boost farmers incomes and lift many out of poverty although in this article it will be argued that the performance of ge crops to date has been questionable the main contention is that the pro gmo lobby both outside of india and within has wasted no time in wrenching the issues of hunger and poverty from their political contexts to use notions of helping farmers and feeding the world as lynchpins of its promotional strategy there exists a haughty imperialism within the pro gmo scientific lobby that aggressively pushes for a gmo solution which is a distraction from the root causes of poverty hunger and malnutrition and genuine solutions based on food justice and food sovereignty last year in the journal current science dr deepak pental developer of genetically engineered ge mustard at delhi university responded to a previous paper in the same journal by eminent scientists pc kesavan and ms swaminathan which questioned the efficacy of and the need for genetically modified organisms gmos in agriculture pental argued that the two authors had aligned themselves with environmentalists and ideologues who have mindlessly attacked the use of genetic engineering ge technology to improve crops required for meeting the food and nutritional needs of a global population that is predicted to peak at 11 2 billion pental added that aspects of the two authors analysis are a reflection of their ideological proclivities the use of the word mindlessly is telling and betrays pental s own ideological disposition his words reflect tired industry inspired rhetoric that says criticisms of ge technology are driven by ideology not fact if hunger and malnutrition are to be tackled effectively the pro gmo lobby must put aside this type of rhetoric which is designed to close down debate it should accept valid concerns about the gmo paradigm and be willing to consider why the world already produces enough to feed 10 billion people but over two billion are experiencing micronutrient deficiencies of which 821 million were classed as chronically undernourished in 2018 critics valid concerns or ideologues the performance of ge crops has been a hotly contested issue and as highlighted in kevasan and swaminathan s piece and by others there is already sufficient evidence to question their efficacy especially that of herbicide tolerant crops which by 2007 already accounted for approximately 80 of biotech derived crops grown globally and the devastating impacts on the environment human health and food security not least in places like latin america we should not accept the premise that only ge can solve problems in agriculture in their paper kesavan and swaminathan argue that ge technology is supplementary and must be need based in more than 99 of cases they say that time honoured conventional breeding is sufficient in this respect conventional options and innovations that outperform ge must not be overlooked or sidelined in a rush by powerful interests like the bill and melinda gates foundation to facilitate the introduction of ge crops into global agriculture crops which are highly financially lucrative for the corporations behind them in europe robust regulatory mechanisms are in place for gmos because it is recognised that ge food crops are not substantially equivalent to their non ge counterparts numerous studies have highlighted the flawed premise of substantial equivalence furthermore from the outset of the gmo project the sidelining of serious concerns about the technology has occurred and despite industry claims to the contrary there is no scientific consensus on the health impacts of ge crops as noted by hilbeck et al environmental sciences europe 2015 adopting a precautionary principle where ge is concerned is therefore a valid approach as hilbeck et al note both the cartagena protocol and codex share a precautionary approach to ge crops and foods in that they agree that ge differs from conventional breeding and that safety assessments should be required before gmos are used in food or released into the environment there is sufficient reason to hold back on commercialising ge crops and to subject each gmo to independent transparent environmental social economic and health impact evaluations critics concerns cannot therefore be brushed aside by claims that the science is decided and the facts about ge are indisputable such claims are merely political posturing and part of a strategy to tip the policy agenda in favour of ge in india various high level reports have advised against the adoption of ge crops appointed by the supreme court the technical expert committee tec final report 2013 was scathing about india s prevailing regulatory system and highlighted its inadequacies and serious inherent conflicts of interest the tec recommended a 10 year moratorium on the commercial release of all ge crops as we have seen with the push to get ge mustard commercialised the problems described by the tec persist through her numerous submissions to the supreme court aruna rodrigues has argued that ge mustard is being pushed through based on outright regulatory delinquency it must also be noted that this crop is herbicide tolerant which as stated by the tec is wholly inappropriate for india with its small biodiverse multi cropping farms while the above discussion has only scratched the surface it is fair to say that criticisms of ge technology and various restrictions and moratoriums have not been driven by mindless proclivities can ge crops feed the world the gene revolution is sometimes regarded as green revolution 2 0 the green revolution too was sold under the guise of feeding the world however emerging research indicates that in india it merely led to more wheat in the diet while food productivity per capita showed no increase or actually decreased globally the green revolution dovetailed with the consolidation of an emerging global food regime based on agro export mono cropping often with non food commodities taking up prime agricultural land and unfair liberalised trade linked to sovereign debt repayment and world bank imf structural adjustment privatisation directives the outcomes have included a displacement of a food producing peasantry the consolidation of western agri food oligopolies and the transformation of many countries from food self sufficiency into food deficit areas and yet the corporations behind this system of dependency and their lobbyists waste no time in spreading the message that this is the route to achieving food security their interests lie in business as usual today we hear terms like foreign direct investment and making india business friendly but behind the rhetoric lies the hard nosed approach of globalised capitalism the intention is for india s displaced cultivators to be retrained to work as cheap labour in the west s offshored plants india is to be a fully incorporated subsidiary of global capitalism with its agri food sector restructured for the needs of global supply chains and a reserve army of labour that effectively serves to beat workers and unions in the west into submission global food insecurity and malnutrition are not the result of a lack of productivity as long as these dynamics persist and food injustice remains an inbuilt feature of the global food regime the rhetoric of ge being necessary for feeding the world will be seen for what it is bombast although india fares poorly in world hunger assessments the country has achieved self sufficiency in food grains and has ensured there is enough food in terms of calories available to feed its entire population it is the world s largest producer of milk pulses and millets and the second largest producer of rice wheat sugarcane groundnuts vegetables fruit and cotton according to the united nations food and agriculture organization fao food security is achieved when all people at all times have physical social and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life food security for many indians remains a distant dream large sections of india s population do not have enough food available to remain healthy nor do they have sufficiently diverse diets that provide adequate levels of micronutrients the comprehensive national nutrition survey 2016 18 is the first ever nationally representative nutrition survey of children and adolescents in india it found that 35 per cent of children under five were stunted 22 per cent of school age children were stunted while 24 per cent of adolescents were thin for their age people are not hungry in india because its farmers do not produce enough food hunger and malnutrition result from various factors including inadequate food distribution gender inequality and poverty in fact the country continues to export food while millions remain hungry it s a case of scarcity amid abundance where farmers livelihoods are concerned the pro gmo lobby says ge will boost productivity and help secure cultivators a better income again this is misleading it ignores crucial political and economic contexts even with bumper harvests indian farmers still find themselves in financial distress india s farmers are not experiencing financial hardship due to low productivity they are reeling from the effects of neoliberal policies years of neglect and a deliberate strategy to displace smallholder agriculture at the behest of the world bank and predatory global agri food corporations little wonder then that the calorie and essential nutrient intake of the rural poor has drastically fallen however aside from putting a positive spin on the questionable performance of gmo agriculture the pro gmo lobby both outside of india and within has wasted no time in wrenching these issues from their political contexts to use the notions of helping farmers and feeding the world as lynch pins of its promotional strategy ge was never intended to feed the world many of the traditional practices of india s small farmers are now recognised as sophisticated and appropriate for high productive sustainable agriculture it is no surprise therefore that a recent fao high level report has called for agroecology and smallholder farmers to be prioritised and invested in to achieve global sustainable food security it argues that scaling up agroecology offers potential solutions to many of the world s most pressing problems whether for instance climate change and carbon storage soil degradation water shortages unemployment or food security agroecological principles represent a shift away from the reductionist yield output industrial paradigm which results in among other things enormous pressures on soil and water resources to a more integrated low input systems approach to food and agriculture that prioritises local food security local calorific production cropping patterns and diverse nutrition production per acre water table stability climate resilience good soil structure and the ability to cope with evolving pests and disease pressures such a system would be underpinned by a concept of food sovereignty based on optimal self sufficiency the right to culturally appropriate food and local ownership and stewardship of common resources such as land water soil and seeds traditional production systems rely on the knowledge and expertise of farmers in contrast to imported solutions yet if we take cotton cultivation in india as an example farmers continue to be nudged away from traditional methods of farming and are being pushed towards illegal ge herbicide tolerant cotton seeds researchers glenn stone and andrew flachs note the results of this shift from traditional practices to date does not appear to have benefited farmers this isn t about giving farmers choice where ge seeds and associated chemicals are concerned it is more about ge seed companies and weedicide manufactures seeking to leverage a highly lucrative market the potential for herbicide market growth in india is enormous and industry looked for sales to reach usd 800 million by 2019 the objective involves opening india to ge seeds with herbicide tolerance traits the biotechnology industry s biggest money maker by far 86 per cent of the world s ge crop acres in 2015 contain plants resistant to glyphosate or glufosinate and there is a new generation of crops resistant to 2 4 d coming through the aim is to break farmers traditional pathways and move them onto corporate biotech chemical treadmills for the benefit of industry calls for agroecology and highlighting the benefits of traditional small scale agriculture are not based on a romantic yearning for the past or the peasantry available evidence suggests that non gmo smallholder farming using low input methods is more productive in total output than large scale industrial farms and can be more profitable and resilient to climate change it is for good reason that the fao high level report referred to earlier as well as the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food prof hilal elver call for investment in this type of agriculture which is centred on small farms despite the pressures including the fact that globally industrial agriculture grabs 80 per cent of subsidies and 90 per cent of research funds smallholder agriculture plays a major role in feeding the world that s a massive quantity of subsidies and funds to support a system that is only made profitable as a result of these financial injections and because agri food oligopolies externalize the massive health social and environmental costs of their operations but policy makers tend to accept that profit driven transnational corporations have a legitimate claim to be owners and custodians of natural assets the commons these corporations their lobbyists and their political representatives have succeeded in cementing a thick legitimacy among policy makers for their vision of agriculture from world bank enabling the business of agriculture directives to the world trade organization agreement on agriculture and trade related intellectual property agreements international bodies have enshrined the interests of corporations that seek to monopolise seeds land water biodiversity and other natural assets that belong to us all these corporations the promoters of gmo agriculture are not offering a solution for farmers impoverishment or hunger ge seeds are little more than a value capture mechanism to evaluate the pro gmo lobby s rhetoric that ge is needed to feed the world we first need to understand the dynamics of a globalised food system that fuels hunger and malnutrition against a backdrop of subsidised food overproduction we must acknowledge the destructive predatory dynamics of capitalism and the need for agri food giants to maintain profits by seeking out new foreign markets and displacing existing systems of production with ones that serve their bottom line and we need to reject a deceptive haughty imperialism within the pro gmo scientific lobby which aggressively pushes for a gmo solution

calvin woodward and hope yen associated press washington size matters to president donald trump so much that he exaggerates continually sometimes spectacularly the size of what he does just as his tax cuts are far from the biggest in history the economy isn t the best ever and his election victory in 2016 was no landslide of historic proportions trump s two trade deals don t stand atop the field of presidential endeavors one is a partial settlement of trade grievances with china the other is a refresh of what past presidents created for north america the opening of the senate impeachment trial stirred other fabrications from the president this past week while democratic presidential contenders engaged in their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 campaign in iowa a sampling from a week in political rhetoric trade trump on his trade agreement with china this is the biggest deal there is anywhere in the world by far remarks wednesday at the signing trump on the china deal and his updated north american trade agreement so we ve done two of the biggest trade deals they are the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done remarks at the white house on thursday the facts neither claim is true the china agreement is not nearly as big as the u s mexico canada agreement so it s not the largest ever much less by far the deal with canada and mexico was an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton more ap fact check trump says pelosi dems defended iran general more ap fact check trump s ukraine defense collides with facts the north american agreement also is not the largest ever for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union was formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations ___ trump on china deal i did the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country yesterday in terms of trade and probably other things too if you think about it remarks thursday the facts trump is even more wildly off the mark in speculating that his china trade deal eclipses all other international agreements even outside trade the montreal protocol aimed at protecting earth s ozone layer was ratified by every member state of the united nations a variety of other agreements on the rights of children world health standards droughts achieved nearly universal ratification more than 190 countries signed the paris accord on climate change of which more than 180 have ratified it the u s is pulling out of it ___ impeachment trump we demand fairness shouts pelosi and the do nothing democrats yet the dems in the house wouldn t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions tweet monday referring to house speaker nancy pelosi d calif the facts not true the house judiciary committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time is split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial ___ trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power ___ economy trump in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history milwaukee rally tuesday the facts he s citing outdated figures wisconsin did post a record low unemployment rate of 2 8 in april and may but it has since edged up and is now at 3 3 that s slightly lower than the u s average of 3 5 but suggests that the state hit a rough patch in the middle of last year ___ trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department figures these gains reflect the recovery from the great recession as well as population growth more than 4 8 million people have joined the labor force in three years of trump s presidency ___ trump under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest gains earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionally milwaukee rally the facts actually the top 10 of earners saw the biggest raises of any income bracket over the past year their usual weekly earnings jumped 8 or 168 according to the labor department the bottom 10 saw weekly incomes grow 7 or 30 over a broader range the top and bottom 25 weekly earnings also grew at faster rate for the wealthier group ___ trump we ve created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs nobody thought that was possible milwaukee rally the facts his numbers are roughly right though they are less impressive than trump claims job gains under trump over the past three years were lower than during the final three years of obama s presidency more than 8 million jobs were added during that period under obama including 1 2 million combined in manufacturing and construction what these figures suggest is that much of the job growth under trump reflects the momentum from a recovery that officially began in the middle of 2009 ___ immigration trump we have loopholes like a visa lottery we put things in the lottery and they come in they become american citizens do you think these countries are giving us their finest oh let s give them our best citizens milwaukee rally the facts this is a perpetual falsehood from the president countries don t nominate their citizens for the program they don t get to select people they d like to get rid of foreigners apply for the visas on their own under the program citizens of countries named by the u s can bid for visas if they have enough education or work experience in desired fields out of that pool of qualified applicants the state department randomly selects a much smaller pool of tentative winners not all winners will have visas approved because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks like other immigrants ___ trump mexico s paying for the wall you know that it s all worked out milwaukee rally the facts mexico isn t paying for trump s long promised border wall trump has argued that the updated trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico ___ child care biden on his early days in washington i was making 42 000 a year i commuted every single solitary day to wilmington delaware over 500 miles a day excuse me 250 miles a day because i could not afford child care it was beyond my reach democratic presidential debate tuesday the facts that s a stretch biden s wife and daughter died in a car accident after he won a senate seat in 1972 as a single parent working far out of town biden might have faced steeper child care costs than people who work locally do but his senate salary actually 42 500 was worth more than 256 000 in today s dollars that s more than four times the median household income ___ health care trump i was the person who saved pre existing conditions in your healthcare you have it now tweet monday the facts that s false people with preexisting medical problems have health insurance protections because of obama s health care law which trump is trying to dismantle one of trump s major alternatives to obama s law short term health insurance already in place doesn t have to cover preexisting conditions another alternative is association health plans which are oriented to small businesses and sole proprietors and do cover preexisting conditions meanwhile trump s administration has been pressing in court for full repeal of the obama era law including provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination with obamacare still in place insurers in the individual marketplace must take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who have poor health or past medical problems before obama s law any insurer could deny coverage or charge more to anyone with a preexisting condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy ___ bernie sanders medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo democratic debate the facts there s no guarantee of that the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last year that total spending under a single payer system like the vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate favors might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system those features have to do with the design of the system questions such as payment rates for hospitals and doctors and whether patients are required to pay part of the cost of their care sanders says his plan would require no cost sharing from patients no copays and no deductibles but completely free care could trigger a surge in demand for medical services raising costs other countries that provide coverage for all do use cost sharing to help keep spending in check a research report last year by the nonprofit rand think tank estimated that a medicare for all plan similar to what sanders wants would modestly raise total u s health spending ___ military trump on killing iran gen qassem soleimani the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy tweet monday trump you know what bothers me when i see a nancy pelosi trying to defend this monster from iran when nancy pelosi and the democrats want to defend him i think that s a very bad thing for this country remarks on jan 9 at event on environmental regulations the facts that s a fabrication democrats did not praise or defend the iranian general they criticized the action trump took pelosi called the u s missile strike provocative and disproportionate while branding soleimani a terrible person similarly democratic presidential candidates criticized trump s strategy and the fact he didn t notify or consult congress in advance while making clear they considered soleimani anything but wonderful the iranian was a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands including hundreds of americans said massachusetts sen elizabeth warren even so republican rep doug collins of georgia asserted democrats were in love with terrorists then retracted the statement and apologized i left parts of my body in iraq fighting terrorists democratic sen tammy duckworth of ilinois a former army pilot who lost both her legs while serving in iraq told cnn after hearing collins initial remarks i don t need to justify myself to anyone ___ trump our military has been totally rebuilt milwaukee rally the facts it hasn t the administration has accelerated a sharp buildup in defense spending but it will take years for freshly ordered tanks planes and other weapons to be built delivered and put to use the air force s minuteman 3 missiles for instance a key part of the u s nuclear force have been operating since the early 1970s and modernization started under the obama administration they are due to be replaced with a new version but not until later this decade ___ biden i was asked to bring 156 000 troops home from that war which i did i led that effort democratic debate the facts biden is roughly right about bringing troops home but he didn t mention that the u s had to send some back obama did designate biden his vice president to take the lead in pulling u s forces out of iraq and coordinating efforts to maintain stability in baghdad his results were mixed biden and obama failed to win agreement from the iraqi government to keep a limited number of u s troops there after december 2011 that was the deadline for a complete u s pullout under a deal negotiated by the bush administration biden was still vice president when obama was compelled to return american troops to iraq in 2014 after the rise of the islamic state group ___ electability trump on the 2016 election there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of the nowhere won the state of new hampshire won iowa won south carolina down the way won a state someplace but we won 32 states the facts trump won 30 states not 32 it was no landslide he won with about 57 of electoral votes a comfortable margin but no better than average or below average obama and clinton each won bigger victories twice and many other presidents outperformed trump moreover republican trump lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton a rare occurrence for a winning candidate trump routinely inflates the number of electoral votes he won too ___ warren the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent republican any time in the past 30 years is me democratic debate sanders just to set the record straight i defeated a republican incumbent running for congress warren i said i was the only one who s beaten an incumbent republican in 30 years the facts sanders wins this argument one of the stranger disputes of the night by a matter of months in november 1990 sanders beat republican incumbent peter smith to take vermont s only house seat that was 29 years and two months ago sanders win technically slips in the 30 year window associated press writers josh boak paul

as the world s business elites trek to davos for their annual gathering people should be asking a simple question have they overcome their infatuation with us president donald trump two years ago a few rare corporate leaders were concerned about climate change or upset at trump s misogyny and bigotry most however were celebrating the president s tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and looking forward to his efforts to deregulate the economy that would allow businesses to pollute the air more get more americans hooked on opioids entice more children to eat their diabetes inducing foods and engage in the sort of financial shenanigans that brought on the 2008 crisis today many corporate bosses are still talking about the continued gdp growth and record stock prices but neither gdp nor the dow is a good measure of economic performance neither tells us what s happening to ordinary citizens living standards or anything about sustainability in fact us economic performance over the past four years is exhibit a in the indictment against relying on these indicators to get a good reading on a country s economic health start by looking at the health of its citizens if they are happy and prosperous they will be healthy and live longer among developed countries america sits at the bottom in this regard us life expectancy already relatively low fell in each of the first two years of trump s presidency and in 2017 midlife mortality reached its highest rate since world war ii this is not a surprise because no president has worked harder to make sure that more americans lack health insurance millions have lost their coverage and the uninsured rate has risen in just two years from 10 9 percent to 13 7 percent one reason for declining life expectancy in america is what

at almost four times their 1999 level the only time i have seen anything like these declines in health outside of war or epidemics was when i was chief economist of the world bank and found out that mortality and morbidity data confirmed what our economic indicators suggested about the dismal state of the post soviet russian economy trump may be a good president for the top 1 percent and especially for the top 0 1 percent but he has not been good for everyone else if fully implemented the 2017 tax cut will result in tax increases for most households in the second third and fourth income quintiles given tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the ultrarich and corporations it should come as no surprise that there was no significant change in the median us household s disposable incomebetween 2017 and 2018 again the most recent year with good data the lion s share of the increase in gdp is also going to those at the top real median weekly earnings are just 2 6 percent above their level when trump took office and these increases have not offset long periods of wage stagnation for example the median wage of a full time male worker and those with full time jobs are the lucky ones is still more than 3 percent below what it was 40 years ago nor has there been much progress on reducing racial disparities in the third quarter of 2019 median weekly earnings for black men working full time were less than three quarters the level for white men making matters worse the growth that has occurred is not environmentally sustainable and even less so thanks to the trump administration s gutting of regulations that have passed stringent cost benefit analyses the air will be less breathable the water less drinkable and the planet more subject to climate change in fact losses related to climate change have already reached new highs in the us which has suffered more property damage than any other country reaching some 1 5 percent of gdp in 2017 the tax cuts were supposed to spur a new wave of investment instead they triggered an all time record binge of share buybacks some usd 800 billion in 2018 by some of america s most profitable companies and led to record peacetime deficits almost usd 1 trillion in fiscal 2019 in a country supposedly near full employment and even with weak investment the us had to borrow massively abroad the most recent data show foreign borrowing at nearly usd 500 billion a year with an increase of more than 10 percent in america s net indebtedness position in one year alone likewise trump s trade wars for all their sound and fury have not reduced the us trade deficit which was one quarter higher in 2018 than it was in 2016 the 2018 goods deficit was the largest on record even the deficit in trade with china was up almost a quarter from 2016 the us did get a new north american trade agreement without the investment agreement provisions that the business roundtable wanted without the provisions raising drug prices that the pharmaceutical companies wanted and with better labour and environmental provisions trump a self proclaimed master deal maker lost on almost every front in his negotiations with congressional democrats resulting in a slightly improved trade arrangement and despite trump s vaunted promises to bring manufacturing jobs back to the us the increase in manufacturing employment is still lower than it was under his predecessor barack obama once the post 2008 recovery set in and is still markedly below its pre crisis level even the unemployment rate at a 50 year low masks economic fragility the employment rate for working age males and females while rising has increased less than during the obama recovery and is still significantly below that of other developed countries the pace of job creation is also markedly slower than it was under obama again the low employment rate is not a surprise not least because unhealthy people can t work moreover those on disability benefits in prison the us incarceration rate has increased more than six fold since 1970 with some two million people currently behind bars or so discouraged that they are not actively seeking jobs are not counted as unemployed but of course they are not employed nor is it a surprise that a country that doesn t provide affordable childcare or guarantee family leave would have lower female employment adjusted for population more than ten percentage points lower than other developed countries even judging by gdp the trump economy falls short last quarter s growth was just 2 1 percent far less than the 4 percent 5 percent or even 6 percent trump promised to deliver and even less than the 2 4 percent average of obama s second term that is a remarkably poor performance considering the stimulus provided by the usd 1 trillion deficit and ultra low interest rates this is not an accident or just a matter of bad luck trump s brand is uncertainty volatility and prevarication whereas trust stability and confidence are essential for growth so is equality according to the international monetary fund so trump deserves failing grades not just on essential tasks like upholding democracy and preserving our planet he should not get a pass on the economy either joseph e stiglitz a nobel laureate in economics is a university professor at columbia university and

for one week the iran united states military crisis gripped the crypto community it began on jan 3 with a u s drone strike on a convoy traveling near baghdad international airport killing iranian major general qasem soleimani of the islamic revolutionary guard corps the price of bitcoin btc soared as reported by cointelegraph at the time there is strong evidence to suggest that btc s price surge from 7 000 to nearly 8 500 is strongly linked to the tensions between the two nations for example the push toward 8 500 took place at the same time as mainstream media began to report on a retaliatory attack by iran on the american forces based in iraq according to data from google trends the search term bitcoin iran surged 4 450 in the seven days to jan 8 cointelegraph disclosed the crisis spurred a surge in cryptocurrencies the nikkei asian review proclaimed as migrant workers and investors turn to digital gold as financial conduit and safe haven nigel green ceo of the united kingdom s devere group said on the matter this latest bitcoin price increase underscores a mounting consensus that bitcoin is becoming a flight to safety asset related bitcoin is becoming more valuable to iranians amid tensions with us after u s president donald trump announced on jan 8 that he would seek no further military action against iran following its u s air base bombings the crisis was effectively over at that point it seemed that the btc price retreated to the 8 000 mark as reported by cointelegraph all is quiet on the iranian front for now that said the crisis arguably inspired some new respect for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and also raised some questions will more investors flock to crypto now with an escalation in geopolitical turbulence which typically unsettles traditional markets it can be expected that a growing number of investors will decide to increase their exposure to decentralized non sovereign secure currencies such as bitcoin commented green this new hedging group will include retail and institutional investors one might indeed see heightened demand for bitcoin after the past week of tensions in the middle east as investors in the region may look to move funds away from traditional investments such as gold or global bonds edward moya senior market analyst at oanda told cointelegraph he added bitcoin may have seen a bottom put in place and some investors may feel more confident that bitcoin can reach 10 000 a lot easier than gold can return to its 2011 record highs just above the 1 900 level opinion isn t uniform however sima baktas founder of globalb law told cointelegraph that global tensions will play a big role in the short term adding that it s important to remember that if bitcoin becomes too popular a commodity in a country where the capital outflow is bringing down the local currency it could become a victim of its own success and see the government step in to clamp down on investment did the crisis confirm that bitcoin has become a flight to safety asset green s assessment on bitcoin becoming a flight to safety asset has some qualified support but not all agree completely moya believes that it may take some time before the assets may be counted as equals bitcoin at times has rallied alongside other well known safe havens but it is far from becoming a more traditional flight to safety trade bitcoin lost most of its safe haven trade allure after regulatory concerns grew in both china and the u s in the last half of the past year for many iranian traders there is more hope in the consistently volatile nature of bitcoin than in the consistently inflationary nature of the iranian rial globalb law s max lurya told cointelegaph adding that s not to say that bitcoin is perceived as a flight to safety asset as bitcoin is not considered a low risk investment relative to gold or silver this isn t the first time btc price has surged during geopolitical tensions recently in august it jumped as global stocks were rocked by the devaluation of china s yuan during the trade war with the u s noted green when cointelegraph asked mati greenspan founder of quantum economics if his view of bitcoin had changed significantly as a result of the iran u s crisis he answered yes it has it was quite profound to see bitcoin acting as a clear safe haven in the face of a global risk event is btc digital gold bitcoin jumped 5 per cent as news of the strikes broke around the world on friday observed green simultaneously the price of gold known as the ultimate safe haven asset also moved higher bitcoin is living up to its reputation as digital gold green continued it is a store of value like gold and is perceived as being resistant to inflation like gold and as a result it could potentially dethrone gold in the future as the world becomes increasingly digitalized again green s sweeping view was endorsed only up to a point by others in the crypto community greenspan for instance wrote in a jan 6 newsletter the resemblance between digital gold and the physical stuff is uncanny they ve basically been moving in a very similar pattern throughout most of last year this is a departure noted greenspan because until recently bitcoin has been seen mostly as an uncorrelated asset that does not react directly to what s happening in other markets as reported by cointelegraph during the crisis the price of oil also surged by 4 to just under 72 per barrel while dow jones s p500 and nasdaq saw slight pullbacks that said it may be premature to call btc the new gold greenspan told cointelegraph gold has been a backbone of the global economy for thousands of years and is a much more reliable safety asset bitcoin is only a decade old and still presents all kinds of existential risks the hope is that it eventually becomes the new backbone of the digital economy but it s too early to make such a claim now will developing nations embrace crypto when tensions rise as has been widely reported economically troubled venezuela is a hotbed of crypto activity as recently as december venezuela and argentina set new peer to peer bitcoin trading volume records as citizens reportedly attempted to mitigate the inflation risks however one must be careful about generalizing from one country s experience as lurya told cointelegraph during the most recent anti government protests iran experienced a complete internet shutdown some iranian traders resorted to international travel in order to close their positions others logged back into their accounts several days later only to find their positions liquidated the crackdown will most likely serve as a major deterrent against speculative trading related five countries where crypto regulation changed the most in 2019 blockchain adoption and cryptocurrency adoption are far from being one and the same and there are plenty of countries with governments hostile toward cryptocurrency that are more than eager to adopt blockchain technology baktas added for iranian investors bitcoin is the embodiment of financial independence for an economy that has been teetering on the brink of collapse iranians cannot invest openly on the nasdaq or the london stock exchange and investors have relatively few investment opportunities bitcoin has the attraction too of being a currency that cannot be taken away either by the iranian government or foreign actors it seems to me they re just getting started another option before declaring crypto as a leading flight to safety option like gold however it might be wise to reflect again upon what actually happened in iran when tensions rose in the past year the authorities simply shut down the internet meaning traders couldn t easily apply their skills programmers compensated for work abroad in btc didn t get paid according to some reports as lurya told cointelegraph it appears a decent internet connection is crypto s newest achilles heel adding i cannot imagine cryptocurrency being more appealing than traditional flight to safety assets to anyone at the onset of conflict if iran were to experience further political unrest i would expect iranian margin traders to rush to abandon their positions in preparation for the likely event of another shutdown still it seems clear that those who viewed crypto as a totally uncorrelated asset pre crisis may have to reassess given that the price of bitcoin and other cryptos seemed to rise as world tensions ratcheted up and subside along with the turmoil much like gold and silver

however it certainly wasn t a foregone conclusion that 2019 would be a record breaker as markets initially had to contend with considerable headwinds the usa s trade disputes with europe and china threatened to escalate global economic growth weakened and central banks initially moved to tighten their extremely loose monetary policy to make matters worse the wrangling over the uk s withdrawal from the eu repeatedly weighed on share prices as recession fears faded shares received a boost in 2019 but the critical assessment that many investors made at the beginning of 2019 proved to be too pessimistic signs of easing in the trade disputes came to fuel hopes that their paralyzing effect on the global economy might abate it was also helpful that leading central banks rowed back from their earlier tightening and injected more liquidity into the economy to boost growth as a result coupon rates on bonds in europe and the usa fell to extremely low levels by august fears of a possible recession had already receded and stock markets took off to finish 2019 at or near their annual high gold also proved to be a good source of yield in 2019 it was in demand all year not just because interest rates were low and sometimes even negative but also because it offered a safe haven in the context of an unsettled trade and geopolitical situation on a dollar basis gold rose by 19 percent to reach its highest value since 2013 while the us currency itself was less volatile than it has been for a long stime floating in a narrow corridor between 1 09 and 1 15 euros 2020 market excesses unlikely what is the outlook for 2020 in its baseline scenario dws is cautiously optimistic about the future central banks in the usa and the eurozone will probably maintain their loose monetary policy political uncertainties should diminish and corporate profits should see moderate rises at the moment no excesses are in sight that could cause the economy and markets to collapse however trade disputes and escalations in political tensions such as the recent conflict between the usa and iran remain a significant risk factor one tweet from us president donald trump could be enough to scupper the relative calm and send markets into a downward spiral the basis for this market assessment is dws s forecast that the global economy will not weaken further but will instead grow by 3 1 percent in 2020 as it did last year although there will be substantial regional differences for example us gdp is expected to grow by just 1 6 percent compared with 2 2 percent last year mostly thanks to a solid service sector dws s prediction for the s p 500 s level at the end of 2020 is 3 300 points n the eurozone by contrast consumers should be the mainstay and growth is only expected to slow slightly to 0 9 percent against 1 1 percent last year much will depend on how well brexit is implemented if it goes well exports could provide a positive surprise dws expects the euro stoxx 50 to rise to 3 770 points by the end of the year for the dax it predicts a slight increase to 14 000 points by the end of 2020 emerging markets to be the growth engine emerging markets em which now account for 60 percent of global economic output should provide the global economy with a stronger impetus this year despite a slight slowdown in china em economic growth should pick up to 4 4 percent from 4 2 percent last year above average earnings growth and moderate valuations could then translate into rising share prices however a flare up of the trade conflict and the ongoing protests in hong kong could create risks dws expects the msci emerging markets index to reach 1 120 points this year
new york as the world s business elites trek to davos for their annual gathering people should be asking a simple question have they overcome their infatuation with us president donald trump two years ago a few rare corporate leaders were concerned about climate change or upset at trump s misogyny and bigotry most however were celebrating the president s tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and looking forward to his efforts to deregulate the economy that would allow businesses to pollute the air more get more americans hooked on opioids entice more children to eat their diabetes inducing foods and engage in the sort of financial shenanigans that brought on the 2008 crisis today many corporate bosses are still talking about the continued gdp growth and record stock prices but neither gdp nor the dow is a good measure of economic performance neither tells us what is happening to ordinary citizens living standards or anything about sustainability in fact us economic performance over the past four years is exhibit a in the indictment against relying on these indicators to get a good reading on a country s economic health start by looking at the health of its citizens if they are happy and prosperous they will be healthy and live longer among developed countries america sits at the bottom in this regard us life expectancy already relatively low fell in each of the first two years of trump s presidency and in 2017 midlife mortality reached its highest rate since world war ii this is not a surprise because no president has worked harder to make sure that more americans lack health insurance millions have lost their coverage and the uninsured rate has risen in just two years from 10 9 per cent to 13 7 per cent one reason for declining life expectancy in america is what anne case and nobel laureate economist angus deaton call deaths of despair caused by alcohol drug overdoses and suicide in 2017 the most recent year for which good data are available such deaths stood at almost four times their 1999 level the only time i have seen anything like these declines in health outside of war or epidemics was when i was chief economist of the world bank and found out that mortality and morbidity data confirmed what our economic indicators suggested about the dismal state of the post soviet russian economy trump may be a good president for the top 1 per cent and especially for the top 0 1 per cent but he has not been good for everyone else if fully implemented the 2017 tax cut will result in tax increases for most households in the second third and fourth income quintiles given tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the ultrarich and corporations it should come as no surprise that there was no significant change in the median us household s disposable income between 2017 and 2018 again the most recent year with good data the lion s share of the increase in gdp is also going to those at the top real median weekly earnings are just 2 6 per cent above their level when trump took office and these increases have not offset long periods of wage stagnation for example the median wage of a full time male worker and those with full time jobs are the lucky ones is still more than 3 per cent below what it was 40 years ago nor has there been much progress on reducing racial disparities in the third quarter of 2019 median weekly earnings for black men working full time were less than three quarters the level for white men making matters worse the growth that has occurred is not environmentally sustainable and even less so thanks to the trump administration s gutting of regulations that have passed stringent cost benefit analyses the air will be less breathable the water less drinkable and the planet more subject to climate change in fact losses related to climate change have already reached new highs in the us which has suffered more property damage than any other country reaching some 1 5 per cent of gdp in 2017 the tax cuts were supposed to spur a new wave of investment instead they triggered an all time record binge of share buybacks some 800 billion in 2018 by some of america s most profitable companies and led to record peacetime deficits almost 1 trillion in fiscal 2019 in a country supposedly near full employment and even with weak investment the us had to borrow massively abroad the most recent data show foreign borrowing at nearly 500 billion a year with an increase of more than 10 per cent in america s net indebtedness position in one year alone likewise trump s trade wars for all their sound and fury have not reduced the us trade deficit which was one quarter higher in 2018 than it was in 2016 the 2018 goods deficit was the largest on record even the deficit in trade with china was up almost a quarter from 2016 the us did get a new north american trade agreement without the investment agreement provisions that the business roundtable wanted without the provisions raising drug prices that the pharmaceutical companies wanted and with better labour and environmental provisions trump a self proclaimed master deal maker lost on almost every front in his negotiations with congressional democrats resulting in a slightly improved trade arrangement and despite trump s vaunted promises to bring manufacturing jobs back to the us the increase in manufacturing employment is still lower than it was under his predecessor barack obama once the post 2008 recovery set in and is still markedly below its pre crisis level even the unemployment rate at a 50 year low masks economic fragility the employment rate for working age males and females while rising has increased less than during the obama recovery and is still significantly below that of other developed countries the pace of job creation is also markedly slower than it was under obama again the low employment rate is not a surprise not least because unhealthy people cannot work moreover those on disability benefits in prison the us incarceration rate has increased more than sixfold since 1970 with some two million people currently behind bars or so discouraged that they are not actively seeking jobs are not counted as unemployed but of course they are not employed nor is it a surprise that a country that doesn t provide affordable childcare or guarantee family leave would have lower female employment adjusted for population more than ten percentage points lower than other developed countries even judging by gdp the trump economy falls short last quarter s growth was just 2 1 per cent far less than the 4 per cent 5 per cent or even 6 per cent trump promised to deliver and even less than the 2 4 per cent average of obama s second term that is a remarkably poor performance considering the stimulus provided by the 1 trillion deficit and ultra low interest rates this is not an accident or just a matter of bad luck trump s brand is uncertainty volatility and prevarication whereas trust stability and confidence are essential for growth so is equality according to the international monetary fund so trump deserves failing grades not just on essential tasks

kristalina georgieva speaks on new research on the financial services sector and its impact on income inequality during an event at piie agence france presse the managing director of international monetary fund imf kristalina georgieva has warned against financial income inequalities within countries which according to her might lead to another financial crisis in her speech on friday during an event at the peterson institute for international economics piie she said it was important to maintain high lending standards and good supervision but work was needed to reverse widening gaps between rich and poor in her call to action she urged a shift to facilitate more lending to small and women led businesses which in turn would help bolster resilience in the event of a future crisis our new research shows that inequality tends to increase before a financial crisis signaling a strong link between inequality and financial stability she said citing parallels to 1920s boom years that led to the great depression a report by imf staff released on friday shows that expanding financial services to more low income households women and small businesses could serve as a powerful lever in creating a more inclusive society but the increasing complexity of the financial sector often wound up benefitting mainly the wealthy if we act and act together we can avoid repeating the mistakes of the 1920s in the 2020s georgieva told an event at the peterson institute for international economics the fund would apply the lessons of the new research to its assessment and surveillance of financial sector stability while focusing on bolstered financial literacy among less sophisticated populations she added georgieva who served as the world bank s chief executive officer before moving to the imf in october has made reversing inequalities one of her top priorities in her speech on friday she said it was important to maintain high lending standards and good supervision but work was needed to reverse widening gaps between rich and poor unlike the 1920s climate change was a huge factor exacerbating inequality today she said citing a world bank estimate that 100 million people could be living in extreme poverty by 2030 if current policies were not changed the fund in november called for central banks to develop stress tests for climate risks and georgieva said it would seek to incorporate them into its assessment instruments this calendar year devaluing climate related stranded assets could result in costs of 4 trillion to 20 trillion governments should continue using fiscal policies to address growing rates of inequality she said and avert the populism and political upheaval it could spawn but the financial sector also had a key role to play she said citing research by imf staff that showed a 2 to 3 percentage point difference in longer term gross domestic product gdp growth between financially inclusive countries and their less inclusive peers the signing of a phase 1 trade agreement between the united states and china will reduce but not eliminate uncertainty that has dampened global economic growth kristalina said georgieva declined to give an adjusted global economic forecast saying that would be released on monday at the world economic forum in davos switzerland but she said the imf expected the trade deal would ensure that china s gross domestic product expands by 6 per cent in 2020 and she had shared that forecast with chinese vice premier liu he during a meeting this week it brings china in the parameters of around 6 per cent growth for 2020 rather than below she said georgieva said the imf had previously estimated that global trade tensions would shave 0 8 per cent or 700 billion off international economic growth only about one third of that was due to tariffs with the larger share resulting from a slowdown in business investment since the us china trade deal was only an interim solution the impact on investment would not be eradicated she said what we are seeing now is we have some reduction of this uncertainty but it is not eliminated she said georgieva also said the imf generally favoured multilateral agreements and warned that bilateral agreements could have negative implications for world economic growth in the longer term kristalina georgieva also said that the lender has had very constructive exchanges with argentina s new peronist government and would do whatever possible to assist the indebted country argentina is grappling with a severe debt crisis since last year that has forced it to enter negotiations with creditors including the imf to restructure around 100 billion of sovereign debt to avoid a damaging default we have had very constructive interactions so far with the new leadership in argentina georgieva said at an event at the peterson institute for international economics in washington according to a recording shared by an imf spokesman we are looking at doing what we can to be helpful to argentina we see eye to eye on the need to restore the economy and to address the increase in poverty that has affected negatively many argentinians agencies
washington ap size matters to president donald trump so much that he exaggerates continually sometimes spectacularly the size of what he does just as his tax cuts are far from the biggest in history the economy isn t the best ever and his election victory in 2016 was no landslide of historic proportions trump s two trade deals don t stand atop the field of presidential endeavors one is a partial settlement of trade grievances with china the other is a refresh of what past presidents created for north america the opening of the senate impeachment trial stirred other fabrications from the president this past week while democratic presidential contenders engaged in their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 campaign in iowa a sampling from a week in political rhetoric trade trump on his trade agreement with china this is the biggest deal there is anywhere in the world by far remarks wednesday at the signing trump on the china deal and his updated north american trade agreement so we ve done two of the biggest trade deals they are the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done remarks at the white house on thursday the facts neither claim is true the china agreement is not nearly as big as the u s mexico canada agreement so it s not the largest ever much less by far the deal with canada and mexico was an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton advertising the north american agreement also is not the largest ever for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union was formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations ___ trump on china deal i did the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country yesterday in terms of trade and probably other things too if you think about it remarks thursday the facts trump is even more wildly off the mark in speculating that his china trade deal eclipses all other international agreements even outside trade the montreal protocol aimed at protecting earth s ozone layer was ratified by every member state of the united nations a variety of other agreements on the rights of children world health standards droughts achieved nearly universal ratification more than 190 countries signed the paris accord on climate change of which more than 180 have ratified it the u s is pulling out of it advertising ___ impeachment trump we demand fairness shouts pelosi and the do nothing democrats yet the dems in the house wouldn t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions tweet monday referring to house speaker nancy pelosi d calif the facts not true the house judiciary committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time is split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial ___ trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call advertising witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power ___ economy trump in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history milwaukee rally tuesday the facts he s citing outdated figures wisconsin did post a record low unemployment rate of 2 8 in april and may but it has since edged up and is now at 3 3 that s slightly lower than the u s average of 3 5 but suggests that the state hit a rough patch in the middle of last year ___ trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department figures these gains reflect the recovery from the great recession as well as population growth more than 4 8 million people have joined the labor force in three years of trump s presidency ___ trump under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest gains earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionally milwaukee rally advertising the facts actually the top 10 of earners saw the biggest raises of any income bracket over the past year their usual weekly earnings jumped 8 or 168 according to the labor department the bottom 10 saw weekly incomes grow 7 or 30 over a broader range the top and bottom 25 weekly earnings also grew at faster rate for the wealthier group ___ trump we ve created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs nobody thought that was possible milwaukee rally the facts his numbers are roughly right though they are less impressive than trump claims job gains under trump over the past three years were lower than during the final three years of obama s presidency more than 8 million jobs were added during that period under obama including 1 2 million combined in manufacturing and construction what these figures suggest is that much of the job growth under trump reflects the momentum from a recovery that officially began in the middle of 2009 ___ immigration trump we have loopholes like a visa lottery we put things in the lottery and they come in they become american citizens do you think these countries are giving us their finest oh let s give them our best citizens milwaukee rally advertising the facts this is a perpetual falsehood from the president countries don t nominate their citizens for the program they don t get to select people they d like to get rid of foreigners apply for the visas on their own under the program citizens of countries named by the u s can bid for visas if they have enough education or work experience in desired fields out of that pool of qualified applicants the state department randomly selects a much smaller pool of tentative winners not all winners will have visas approved because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks like other immigrants ___ trump mexico s paying for the wall you know that it s all worked out milwaukee rally the facts mexico isn t paying for trump s long promised border wall trump has argued that the updated trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico advertising ___ child care biden on his early days in washington i was making 42 000 a year i commuted every single solitary day to wilmington delaware over 500 miles a day excuse me 250 miles a day because i could not afford child care it was beyond my reach democratic presidential debate tuesday the facts that s a stretch biden s wife and daughter died in a car accident after he won a senate seat in 1972 as a single parent working far out of town biden might have faced steeper child care costs than people who work locally do but his senate salary actually 42 500 was worth more than 256 000 in today s dollars that s more than four times the median household income ___ health care trump i was the person who saved pre existing conditions in your healthcare you have it now tweet monday the facts that s false people with preexisting medical problems have health insurance protections because of obama s health care law which trump is trying to dismantle one of trump s major alternatives to obama s law short term health insurance already in place doesn t have to cover preexisting conditions another alternative is association health plans which are oriented to small businesses and sole proprietors and do cover preexisting conditions meanwhile trump s administration has been pressing in court for full repeal of the obama era law including provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination advertising with obamacare still in place insurers in the individual marketplace must take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who have poor health or past medical problems before obama s law any insurer could deny coverage or charge more to anyone with a preexisting condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy ___ bernie sanders medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo democratic debate the facts there s no guarantee of that the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last year that total spending under a single payer system like the vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate favors might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system those features have to do with the design of the system questions such as payment rates for hospitals and doctors and whether patients are required to pay part of the cost of their care sanders says his plan would require no cost sharing from patients no copays and no deductibles but completely free care could trigger a surge in demand for medical services raising costs other countries that provide coverage for all do use cost sharing to help keep spending in check a research report last year by the nonprofit rand think tank estimated that a medicare for all plan similar to what sanders wants would modestly raise total u s health spending ___ military trump on killing iran gen qassem soleimani the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy tweet monday advertising trump you know what bothers me when i see a nancy pelosi trying to defend this monster from iran when nancy pelosi and the democrats want to defend him i think that s a very bad thing for this country remarks on jan 9 at event on environmental regulations the facts that s a fabrication democrats did not praise or defend the iranian general they criticized the action trump took pelosi called the u s missile strike provocative and disproportionate while branding soleimani a terrible person similarly democratic presidential candidates criticized trump s strategy and the fact he didn t notify or consult congress in advance while making clear they considered soleimani anything but wonderful the iranian was a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands including hundreds of americans said massachusetts sen elizabeth warren even so republican rep doug collins of georgia asserted democrats were in love with terrorists then retracted the statement and apologized i left parts of my body in iraq fighting terrorists democratic sen tammy duckworth of ilinois a former army pilot who lost both her legs while serving in iraq told cnn after hearing collins initial remarks i don t need to justify myself to anyone advertising ___ trump our military has been totally rebuilt milwaukee rally the facts it hasn t the administration has accelerated a sharp buildup in defense spending but it will take years for freshly ordered tanks planes and other weapons to be built delivered and put to use the air force s minuteman 3 missiles for instance a key part of the u s nuclear force have been operating since the early 1970s and modernization started under the obama administration they are due to be replaced with a new version but not until later this decade ___ biden i was asked to bring 156 000 troops home from that war which i did i led that effort democratic debate the facts biden is roughly right about bringing troops home but he didn t mention that the u s had to send some back obama did designate biden his vice president to take the lead in pulling u s forces out of iraq and coordinating efforts to maintain stability in baghdad his results were mixed biden and obama failed to win agreement from the iraqi government to keep a limited number of u s troops there after december 2011 that was the deadline for a complete u s pullout under a deal negotiated by the bush administration biden was still vice president when obama was compelled to return american troops to iraq in 2014 after the rise of the islamic state group ___ electability trump on the 2016 election there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of the nowhere won the state of new hampshire won iowa won south carolina down the way won a state someplace but we won 32 states advertising the facts trump won 30 states not 32 it was no landslide he won with about 57 of electoral votes a comfortable margin but no better than average or below average obama and clinton each won bigger victories twice and many other presidents outperformed trump moreover republican trump lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton a rare occurrence for a winning candidate trump routinely inflates the number of electoral votes he won too ___ warren the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent republican any time in the past 30 years is me democratic debate sanders just to set the record straight i defeated a republican incumbent running for congress warren i said i was the only one who s beaten an incumbent republican in 30 years advertising the facts sanders wins this argument one of the stranger disputes of the night by a matter of months in november 1990 sanders beat republican incumbent peter smith to take vermont s only house seat that was 29 years and two months ago sanders win

cai meng china daily with president xi jinping paying a two day visit to myanmar which concluded on saturday the focus of china myanmar cooperation is on jointly building the china myanmar economic corridor under the belt and road framework as a relatively less developed country with per capita gdp of less than 1 500 myanmar s current priority is to find ways to boost its economy yet given the lack of proper stimulus it is not an easy task for countries such as myanmar to accelerate economic growth however myanmar can get the needed stimulus as well as create the strategic opportunities to expedite its economic growth by jointly building the cmec with china in fact myanmar s economy can register leapfrog growth if it can successfully co build the cmec better infrastructure for faster growth first to accelerate economic growth myanmar has to build more power plants and improve its transportation infrastructure especially the shortage of electricity in myanmar is seriously hindering its industrial development i once traveled by bus from mandalay to muse in myanmar and it took me about two days to cover the mountainous stretch of about 400 kilometers as roads were in very poor condition the first step toward building the cmec is to build the china myanmar expressway and railway a railway that extends from kunming to ruili in yunnan province across the border to mandalay and then west to kyaukpyu in rakhine state and southeast to yangon this will establish myanmar s fundamental railway structure which can later be extended to cover the entire country the china myanmar oil and gas pipeline project connecting western myanmar and yunnan which was built by china between 2013 and 2017 has not only become a source of new income and employment for myanmar people but also eased the demand for energy along the route as such the two countries are likely to deepen cooperation on energy under the cmec framework especially to strengthen myanmar s power generation sector need to improve transport facilities second the cmec will promote myanmar s trade myanmar s export to neighboring countries has been restricted due to poor transportation facilities which means the country needs to urgently improve its transport infrastructure in order to reduce transportation costs and increase the export of products such as rice and fruits to china third the cmec will help propel the development of myanmar s industry including the manufacturing sector especially in the mandalay industrial zone new yangon city and the kyaukpyu special economic zone and fourth the improvement of transport infrastructure and building of more power plants will help myanmar tap its full tourism potential which could play an increasingly important role in facilitating myanmar s economic takeoff more important as the cmec is likely to attract more foreign capital it will inject added vitality into myanmar s economy cmec will also benefit china china too will benefit from the cmec in particular the economic corridor will ensure energy security by opening a new energy transportation channel and help establish a new pattern of further opening up the chinese economy in the new era by facilitating the economic integration of china southeast asia and south asia thankfully a top level design for the cmec s construction is already in place president xi and myanmar state counselor aung san suu kyi reached a consensus on building the cmec under the belt and road framework at the end of 2017 and in september 2018 the two sides signed the memorandum of understanding on building the cmec and established the cmec joint committee which held its first meeting in the same year and the second in 2019 indicating that a working mechanism for the cmec too has been established also a number of institutional arrangements have been made for example the arrangements for the china myanmar border economic cooperation zone are basically in place with the central bank of myanmar approving the yuan as the official settlement currency which will facilitate investment in cmec projects work on cross border railway progressing well besides a number of major projects are progressing smoothly among them the upgrading of the domestic section of the china myanmar railway from kunming to dali has been completed and the new section from dali to ruili is under construction on the other side of the border work on the muse to mandalay section is on in full swing the first construction phase of the kyaukpyu deep sea port has begun and the new yangon city project is progressing well in addition the energy pipeline and substation expansion projects in yangon have been completed industrial links strengthened and cross border trade has gained momentum and there is enough reason to believe that on the conclusion of what appears to be a fruitful visit of president xi to myanmar the construction of the cmec will gather added pace yet three cmec development issues require special attention to begin with the two sides need to reach a deeper and wider consensus on actively propelling the cmec s development need to clear doubts of myanmar people i once organized a meeting in mandalay with key members of the myanmar chamber of commerce and found that they were generally ambivalent about certain issues for example they wished to attract more chinese investment but were worried that the chinese investors might grab a larger share of their market to address their concern the two countries should welcome investment from each other and take measures to strengthen their partnership with the goal of realizing mutual benefit and win win results also related projects have to be expeditiously implemented so they yield early gains the cmec is a huge project with a long development cycle requiring huge investments therefore both sides need to take steps to support long term projects so as to promote sustainable development furthermore there is a need to build cooperation in third party markets the united states and countries in europe especially the united kingdom and asia such as japan the republic of korea india and a number of asean member states have been investing in myanmar building the foundation for third party market cooperation china and myanmar should actively invite such countries to join the cmec development platform help build the corridor and reap mutual benefits through fair cooperation the author is a professor and executive dean of belt and road school beijing normal university the views don t necessarily

at the heart of the assessment likely to be announced on jan 23 is how price stability should be defined and targeted but ask citizens how they feel about inflation and they re likely to come up with wildly varying answers in fact as the federal reserve found in its own recent consultation many may be less convinced than central bankers that prices are rising too slowly while president christine lagarde says she wants to hear diverse views it s not yet clear how much that will involve people outside of economic and banking circles nor how seriously policymakers will take the opinions submitted if they did want consumers perceptions to influence how the review reshapes monetary policy that could conceivably put the institution on a different path from the ultra accommodative stance it has adopted for years it s definitely going to add to the knowledge the ecb has about the inflation process and the ways inflation affects different groups in society said florian hense an economist at berenberg in london how much that is actually going to affect the overhaul or the result of that overhaul is a bit difficult to say lagarde who wants to agree on the review at next week s policy meeting insisted last month that it will tap more than the usual suspects it will also include consulting with members of parliament and i ve committed to that with the european parliament it will reach out to the academic community of course it will reach out to civil society representatives and it will aim at not just preaching the gospel that we think we master but also listening one example she might follow is that of the fed which held community listening sessions last year in places including san francisco and atlanta the fed listens initiative heard how officials desire for higher prices wasn t shared by lower income workers who fret about their living costs such an exercise would appeal to bank of france governor francois villeroy de galhau who insisted last week that what consumers and businesses think particularly on inflation is crucial for the review s credibility they are the ones that ultimately set prices and wages he said the approach has its problems though a bundesbank study published in december found large differences between german households on inflation perceptions depending on factors such as earnings education home ownership job type and recent experience of price trends housing is a key area of contention it is significantly underweighted in the european union s official inflation measure because of the challenge of collecting data yet it s also a major expense for many individuals property values and rents have tended to outstrip inflation in recent years data on thursday showed annual prices of homes in the euro region rose 4 1 in the third quarter roughly four times the pace of consumer inflation at the time households not only tend to predict more inflation than investors they also overestimate it in july former ecb executive board member benoit coeure cited a survey of citizens who believed annual price increases were near 9 in the 14 years through 2018 when the figure was actually 1 6 coeure still noted that consumers are good at identifying shifts in inflation and that their expectations can be a better proxy of company pricing decisions than financial markets under former ecb president mario draghi policy makers tended to emphasize indicators of future inflation generated by investor bets such as five year five year forwards the mood has changed also because the policy space is reduced said marco valli an economist at unicredit in milan there s more inclination to look at different types of inflation expectations especially households lagarde s strategy rethink is also an opportunity to better explain what the ecb is trying to achieve villeroy argues that if people can t understand its goals the effectiveness of its policies is blunted they are less convinced than economists of the need to boost price growth from 1 to 2 he told an audience in paris i believe the economic analyses and theories but i also believe that they only have a real world impact if they are perceived accepted and assimilated by common sense and public opinion building a coherent view from a mass of public opinions is likely to be challenging but it might be worth a try at a time when many people in richer countries are furious at negative interest rates and quantitative easing increasing the emphasis on their views could ultimately push the ecb to find more palatable ways to support the economy in any case addressing erroneous perceptions of the ecb as villeroy suggests will likely require more outreach lagarde has acknowledged as much saying that bringing the central bank closer to citizens in an age of populism is a priority it is important to me that our focus on connecting with the people we serve continues and grows stronger she told lawmakers in december communication is a two way street
cai meng china daily with president xi jinping paying a two day visit to myanmar which concluded on saturday the focus of china myanmar cooperation is on jointly building the china myanmar economic corridor under the belt and road framework as a relatively less developed country with per capita gdp of less than 1 500 myanmar s current priority is to find ways to boost its economy yet given the lack of proper stimulus it is not an easy task for countries such as myanmar to accelerate economic growth however myanmar can get the needed stimulus as well as create the strategic opportunities to expedite its economic growth by jointly building the cmec with china in fact myanmar s economy can register leapfrog growth if it can successfully co build the cmec better infrastructure for faster growth first to accelerate economic growth myanmar has to build more power plants and improve its transportation infrastructure especially the shortage of electricity in myanmar is seriously hindering its industrial development i once traveled by bus from mandalay to muse in myanmar and it took me about two days to cover the mountainous stretch of about 400 kilometers as roads were in very poor condition the first step toward building the cmec is to build the china myanmar expressway and railway a railway that extends from kunming to ruili in yunnan province across the border to mandalay and then west to kyaukpyu in rakhine state and southeast to yangon this will establish myanmar s fundamental railway structure which can later be extended to cover the entire country the china myanmar oil and gas pipeline project connecting western myanmar and yunnan which was built by china between 2013 and 2017 has not only become a source of new income and employment for myanmar people but also eased the demand for energy along the route as such the two countries are likely to deepen cooperation on energy under the cmec framework especially to strengthen myanmar s power generation sector need to improve transport facilities second the cmec will promote myanmar s trade myanmar s export to neighboring countries has been restricted due to poor transportation facilities which means the country needs to urgently improve its transport infrastructure in order to reduce transportation costs and increase the export of products such as rice and fruits to china third the cmec will help propel the development of myanmar s industry including the manufacturing sector especially in the mandalay industrial zone new yangon city and the kyaukpyu special economic zone and fourth the improvement of transport infrastructure and building of more power plants will help myanmar tap its full tourism potential which could play an increasingly important role in facilitating myanmar s economic takeoff more important as the cmec is likely to attract more foreign capital it will inject added vitality into myanmar s economy cmec will also benefit china china too will benefit from the cmec in particular the economic corridor will ensure energy security by opening a new energy transportation channel and help establish a new pattern of further opening up the chinese economy in the new era by facilitating the economic integration of china southeast asia and south asia thankfully a top level design for the cmec s construction is already in place president xi and myanmar state counselor aung san suu kyi reached a consensus on building the cmec under the belt and road framework at the end of 2017 and in september 2018 the two sides signed the memorandum of understanding on building the cmec and established the cmec joint committee which held its first meeting in the same year and the second in 2019 indicating that a working mechanism for the cmec too has been established also a number of institutional arrangements have been made for example the arrangements for the china myanmar border economic cooperation zone are basically in place with the central bank of myanmar approving the yuan as the official settlement currency which will facilitate investment in cmec projects work on cross border railway progressing well besides a number of major projects are progressing smoothly among them the upgrading of the domestic section of the china myanmar railway from kunming to dali has been completed and the new section from dali to ruili is under construction on the other side of the border work on the muse to mandalay section is on in full swing the first construction phase of the kyaukpyu deep sea port has begun and the new yangon city project is progressing well in addition the energy pipeline and substation expansion projects in yangon have been completed industrial links strengthened and cross border trade has gained momentum and there is enough reason to believe that on the conclusion of what appears to be a fruitful visit of president xi to myanmar the construction of the cmec will gather added pace yet three cmec development issues require special attention to begin with the two sides need to reach a deeper and wider consensus on actively propelling the cmec s development need to clear doubts of myanmar people i once organized a meeting in mandalay with key members of the myanmar chamber of commerce and found that they were generally ambivalent about certain issues for example they wished to attract more chinese investment but were worried that the chinese investors might grab a larger share of their market to address their concern the two countries should welcome investment from each other and take measures to strengthen their partnership with the goal of realizing mutual benefit and win win results also related projects have to be expeditiously implemented so they yield early gains the cmec is a huge project with a long development cycle requiring huge investments therefore both sides need to take steps to support long term projects so as to promote sustainable development furthermore there is a need to build cooperation in third party markets the united states and countries in europe especially the united kingdom and asia such as japan the republic of korea india and a number of asean member states have been investing in myanmar building the foundation for third party market cooperation china and myanmar should actively invite such countries to join the cmec development platform help build the corridor and reap mutual benefits through fair cooperation the author is a professor and executive dean of belt and road school beijing normal university the views don t necessarily represent those of china daily

after nearly two years of a bruising trade war president donald trump finally signed a trade deal with china this week that provides the president with political bragging rights but allows both sides to put off the most difficult disputes until after the november election and despite the ceremonial pomp of a white house signing event and trump s tweets on the achievement the hard reality of the phase 1 agreement is that it only begins to address the potentially dangerous gulf between the united states and china on trade and economic policy credit evan vucci credit evan vucci what it means the two sides are expected to restart the kind of broad economic dialogue that was begun by president george w bush and then chinese president hu jintao in 2006 but analysts of all stripes doubt they ll see anything substantive beyond the first stage deal this may be as far as we re going to go said david bachman a china expert at the university of washington in seattle i think phase 1 was really an attempt to put the china dispute on the back burner until after the election with expectation that the chinese will step up their agricultural purchases significantly and that the trump campaign can claim that farmers got a good deal as for the future of the u s china relationship he said we re going to be sort of stuck in between some cooperation competition rivalry on the one hand and then out and out cold war on the other how we describe that and what that means in real practice is just going to have to be something we work out he predicted i read the phase one china trade deal so you don t have to sorry to be negative but reads to me like an under cooked nothing burger with repackaged goodies for offshoring corps shaky targets for exporters and no changes to the stuff that matters jared bernstein econjared january 16 2020 where gaps remain the signing signified a cease fire in the trade war but the two nations remain on the cusp of long term decisions that will have potentially harsh consequences for washington and beijing the united states already has moved to restrict chinese investments in america deny licenses for chinese telecom firms and blacklist others notably huawei research collaborations are coming under scrutiny and more chinese international students are being denied visas that means that the fundamental tensions between the u s and china will not subside even if the administration has achieved some incremental progress as well as met certain political goals that could calm the relationship for the short term said claire reade who served as the first chief counsel for china trade enforcement at the office of the u s trade representative the road ahead over time the relationship between the world s two economic superpowers seems all but certain to go in one of two directions in the best case scenario both governments would pull back from confrontation expanding not curbing their mutual dependency on trade and at least appeasing some of washington s most serious grievances those include industrial espionage and beijing s heavy subsidies for its many state owned enterprises that most economists say undercut foreign rivals and distort global markets turning toward a strategy of compromise and short term sacrifice instead of confrontation would be difficult for both sides under the best of circumstances and especially so for the chinese communist party and its elites who are deeply invested in the status quo what could go wrong an alternative scenario represents a darker and even more hazardous road ahead if the hard line nationalistic turn in both countries continues as seems highly possible in view of a rising tendency among americans to see china as an adversary the result could be a new cold war that would potentially lead to a more isolated and embattled beijing with reduced access to western markets that now support a chinese economy still dependent on trade and foreign technology eventually china might be able to shift more assuredly to domestic consumption and homegrown innovation but the transition even if ultimately successful would put enormous political pressure on a regime already becoming more and more authoritarian i m getting under realdonaldtrump s skin on china trade issues because he knows i m right i ve been consistent in public and in private that his new trade deal with china is unbelievably bad for american workers and businesses chuck schumer senschumer january 16 2020 the stakes for china the phase 1 agreement signed wednesday includes pledges by china to boost u s exports by about 200 billion over two years including farm goods energy and manufactured products whether china can meet these commitments the increased purchases will nonetheless be welcomed by important trump constituents in rural america and on wall street the phase one deal has been signed but us tariffs on imports from china remain six times higher than they were before the start of the trade war in 2018 here s how the tariffs evolved pic twitter com se6m3tjfny peterson institute piie january 16 2020 robert lighthizer trump s top trade official has said the 86 page agreement also includes chinese commitments on intellectual property financial services and technology transfer credit steve helber credit steve helber analysts however said there was little to indicate that china had gone beyond plans already in place and that the real question was whether beijing would carry them out in meaningful ways beijing for its part is getting a small rollback of tariffs and as a goodwill gesture washington withdrew its designation of china as a currency manipulator although the label had little basis or practical significance the decisions that shape the future of china are by no means entirely centered in washington xi jinping faces the trade off between does he want control or is he so concerned about prospects for economic growth that he takes a more hands off approach said david bachman a china expert at the university of washington in seattle now he said there s nothing to indicate that xi would back down the stakes for the united states analysts agree the united states would do well to partner with europe and japan in pressuring china to make structural reforms but trump has by and large pursued trade actions unilaterally and he has alienated once stalwart allies by slapping tariffs on them as well and lashing them with harsh rhetoric over their trade practices credit daniel acker credit daniel acker when we talk about decoupling or an economic iron curtain i will tell you i don t find any other countries that are looking to decouple from china s economy said hank paulson former treasury secretary in the bush administration and founder of the paulson institute which focuses on u s china issues we need a new framework that recognizes today s realities and we need to enlist our allies which are a huge strategic advantage robert atkinson president of the information technology and innovation foundation a washington based think tank that has been sharply critical of china s mercantilist behavior said european officials had essentially told him why would we work with the trump administration when they want to put tariffs on our cars tariff impact in china as a result of the tariff war china s economic growth sank to a new multi decade low in 2019 but forecasters said the phase 1 truce might help to revive consumer and business activity according to government data released friday china s economy grew by 6 1 down from 2018 s 6 6 which was already the lowest since 1990 growth in the three months ending in december held steady at the previous quarter s level of 6 over a year earlier the chinese downturn might not have bottomed out yet but improved activity in december suggested the cooling of tensions might be encouraging companies and consumers to spend and invest private sector economists said the agreement is a signal that the situation is unlikely to deteriorate said chaoping zhu of j p morgan asset management in a report corporate confidence keeps improving said zhu that might help to provide strong support to economic growth global impact what happens in china ripples across the globe an economic lull in china reverberates in the many countries from copper producing chile to iron ore producing australia that feed chinese factories with raw materials chinese exports ended 2019 up 0 5 despite the tariff war and weaker global demand manufacturers stepped up efforts to sell to other markets recording double digit gains in exports to france canada and other economies sluggish global growth will continue to challenge the external outlook but we expect the phase one deal with the u s to have a favorable impact on exports and support domestic sentiment and confidence said louis kuijs of oxford economics in a report other weaknesses chinese exporters have been battered by a bigger blow from weakness in consumption households spooked by the trade war and job losses put off big purchases auto sales fell for second year in 2019 tumbling 9 6 growth in retail spending decelerated to 8 over a year earlier down from 8 2 in the first nine months of the year the trade war added to pressure on chinese leaders who also are struggling to shore up growth and rein in surging food costs following a disease outbreak that slashed supplies of pork the country s staple meat and sent prices soaring the cost of pork spiked 42 5 in 2019 propelling food price inflation to 7 more than double the ruling party s 3 target farming american farmers remain uneasy about the prospects for exports farmers have seen china go from consistently being one of the top two export markets for u s crops over a decade to the fifth largest market for agricultural exports in 2018 as a result of the tariffs china s farm purchases plunged by about half in 2018 to 9 2 billion from the previous year s 19 6 billion after the country imposed retaliatory tariffs on 120 billion in u s exports including soybeans pork and other farm products despite the signing of the preliminary trade deal many farmers remain skeptical about how many american farm goods china will buy time will tell whether they are actually committed to buy more from the united states said minnesota farmer gary wertish who is president of the minnesota farmers union we want to get back to where we are taking every third row of soybeans to them in china and then at the same time keeping some of the new markets we ve developed said indiana farmer joe steinkamp hopefully in the long run we ll come out ahead where donald trump stands trump described the roller coaster negotiations including punishing tit for tat tariffs as tough honest open and respectful and said he would visit china in the not too distant future up to now trump s approach to china has been a hodgepodge of disparate and sometimes conflicting policies on trade technology and national security reflecting differences within the administration between china hardliners and those advocating a more cooperative tack in dealing with china one of the greatest trade deals ever made also good for china and our long term relationship 250 billion dollars will be coming back to our country and we are now in a great position for a phase two start there has never been anything like this in u s history usmca next donald j trump realdonaldtrump january 16 2020 trump has been consistent in demanding more chinese purchases of u s goods and reducing the large american trade deficit and he has had modest success less clear are his convictions and resolve in taking on china to make fundamental changes to its economic system my take on phase 1 is that it largely restores the status quo i m not optimistic that we ll get a phase 2 deal that s going to dramatically alter the landscape my take on phase 1 is that it largely restores the status quo said scott paul president of the alliance for american manufacturing a labor industry proponent for fair trade i m not optimistic that we ll get a phase 2 deal that s going to dramatically alter the landscape and in that way he said trump will have adopted the pattern of past administrations where they just kick the can down the road on these very tough issues the one difference paul noted is that trump has made extensive use of tariffs and has kept most of them in place as leverage for future talks that could push more u s multinationals with operations in china to look for new places for production and supplies mostly in other parts of asia at the same time trump s tariffs and chinese retaliatory duties on american goods have not only squeezed farmers but also caused a shrinking of business spending in the united states and volatility in stock markets it s going to take an all out strategy from the administration said paul and trump may not want to do anything to risk disrupting financial markets and the broader economy ahead of the november election previously for much of the last four decades since china s historic economic opening the u s approach had been mostly to engage and try to cooperate with beijing in part to encourage it to adopt a more liberal rules based economic system but the last few years have seen president xi jinping elevating the chinese communist party to a degree not seen since mao zedong and tightening its grip in all facets of chinese society credit andy wong credit andy wong that has hardened attitudes in the united states toward china and fueled skepticism that beijing will ever give up its industrial policies even if they aren t efficient and will invariably bring conflicts with the united states the practical outflow of xi s adoption of maoist ideology is china s doubling down on state owned enterprises and the party s top down intervention in the economy to build global influence and leadership in critical sectors such as robotics aerospace and artificial intelligence this is not the china we would like to have but it is the china we got we are stuck with each other and both sides have got to figure out a path forward which preserves global peace stability and sustained economic growth in a rules based system hank paulson former u s treasury secretary xi jinping made clear that their system is working very well and that they re not going to try to make their society or their economic system look like western capitalism said paulson who has been in regular contact with senior chinese officials this is not the china we would like to have but it is the china we got paulson said in an interview we are stuck with each other and both sides have got to figure out a path forward which preserves global peace stability and sustained economic growth in a rules based system what s next trump will highlight his policies on trade and domestic energy in a speech to u s farmers next week the white house announced trump is scheduled to address the american farm bureau federation s convention sunday in austin texas it will be his third appearance at the annual gathering the farmers are really happy with the new china trade deal and the soon to be signed deal with mexico and canada but i hope the thing they will most remember is the fact that i was able to take massive incoming

neither claim is true advertisement the china agreement is not nearly as big as the u s mexico canada agreement so it s not the largest ever much less by far the deal with canada and mexico was an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton the north american agreement also is not the largest ever for instance 123

economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization advertisement also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union was formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves

the house wouldn t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions tweet monday referring to house speaker nancy pelosi d calif advertisement the facts not true the house judiciary committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time is split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it advertisement his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial ___ trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday advertisement the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power ___ advertisement economy trump in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history milwaukee rally tuesday the facts he s citing outdated figures advertisement wisconsin did post a record low unemployment rate of 2 8 in april and may but it has since edged up and is now at 3 3 that s slightly lower than the u s average of 3 5 but suggests that the state hit a rough patch in the middle of last year ___ trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally advertisement the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department figures these gains reflect the recovery from the great recession as well as population growth more than 4 8 million people have joined the labor force in three years of trump s presidency ___ advertisement trump under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest gains earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionally milwaukee rally the facts actually the top 10 of earners saw the biggest raises of any income bracket over the past year their usual weekly earnings jumped 8 or 168 according to the labor department the bottom 10 saw weekly incomes grow 7 or 30 over a broader range the top and bottom 25 weekly earnings also grew at faster rate for the wealthier group advertisement ___ trump we ve created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs nobody thought that was possible milwaukee rally the facts his numbers are roughly right though they are less impressive than trump claims advertisement job gains under trump over the past three years were lower than during the final three years of obama s presidency more than 8 million jobs were added during that period under obama including 1 2 million combined in manufacturing and construction what these figures suggest is that much of the job growth under trump reflects the momentum from a recovery that officially began in the middle of 2009 ___ immigration advertisement trump we have loopholes like a visa lottery we put things in the lottery and they come in they become american citizens do you think these countries are giving us their finest oh let s give them our best citizens milwaukee rally the facts this is a perpetual falsehood from the president countries don t nominate their citizens for the program they don t get to select people they d like to get rid of foreigners apply for the visas on their own under the program citizens of countries named by the u s can bid for visas if they have enough education or work experience in desired fields out of that pool of qualified applicants the state department randomly selects a much smaller pool of tentative winners not all winners will have visas approved because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly advertisement those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks like other immigrants ___ trump mexico s paying for the wall you know that it s all worked out milwaukee rally advertisement the facts mexico isn t paying for trump s long promised border wall trump has argued that the updated trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico ___ advertisement child care biden on his early days in washington i was making 42 000 a year i commuted every single solitary day to wilmington delaware over 500 miles a day excuse me 250 miles a day because i could not afford child care it was beyond my reach democratic presidential debate tuesday the facts that s a stretch advertisement biden s wife and daughter died in a car accident after he won a senate seat in 1972 as a single parent working far out of town biden might have faced steeper child care costs than people who work locally do but his senate salary actually 42 500 was worth more than 256 000 in today s dollars that s more than four times the median household income ___ health care advertisement trump i was the person who saved pre existing conditions in your healthcare you have it now tweet monday the facts that s false people with preexisting medical problems have health insurance protections because of obama s health care law which trump is trying to dismantle one of trump s major alternatives to obama s law short term health insurance already in place doesn t have to cover preexisting conditions another alternative is association health plans which are oriented to small businesses and sole proprietors and do cover preexisting conditions advertisement meanwhile trump s administration has been pressing in court for full repeal of the obama era law including provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination with obamacare still in place insurers in the individual marketplace must take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who have poor health or past medical problems before obama s law any insurer could deny coverage or charge more to anyone with a preexisting condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy ___ advertisement bernie sanders medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo democratic debate the facts there s no guarantee of that the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last year that total spending under a single payer system like the vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate favors might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system advertisement those features have to do with the design of the system questions such as payment rates for hospitals and doctors and whether patients are required to pay part of the cost of their care sanders says his plan would require no cost sharing from patients no copays and no deductibles but completely free care could trigger a surge in demand for medical services raising costs other countries that provide coverage for all do use cost sharing to help keep spending in check a research report last year by the nonprofit rand think tank estimated that a medicare for all plan similar to what sanders wants would modestly raise total u s health spending ___ advertisement military trump on killing iran gen qassem soleimani the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy tweet monday trump you know what bothers me when i see a nancy pelosi trying to defend this monster from iran when nancy pelosi and the democrats want to defend him i think that s a very bad thing for this country remarks on jan 9 at event on environmental regulations advertisement the facts that s a fabrication democrats did not praise or defend the iranian general they criticized the action trump took pelosi called the u s missile strike provocative and disproportionate while branding soleimani a terrible person similarly democratic presidential candidates criticized trump s strategy and the fact he didn t notify or consult congress in advance while making clear they considered soleimani anything but wonderful the iranian was a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands including hundreds of americans said massachusetts sen elizabeth warren advertisement even so republican rep doug collins of georgia asserted democrats were in love with terrorists then retracted the statement and apologized i left parts of my body in iraq fighting terrorists democratic sen tammy duckworth of ilinois a former army pilot who lost both her legs while serving in iraq told cnn after hearing collins initial remarks i don t need to justify myself to anyone ___ advertisement trump our military has been totally rebuilt milwaukee rally the facts it hasn t the administration has accelerated a sharp buildup in defense spending but it will take years for freshly ordered tanks planes and other weapons to be built delivered and put to use advertisement the air force s minuteman 3 missiles for instance a key part of the u s nuclear force have been operating since the early 1970s and modernization started under the obama administration they are due to be replaced with a new version but not until later this decade ___ biden i was asked to bring 156 000 troops home from that war which i did i led that effort democratic debate advertisement the facts biden is roughly right about bringing troops home but he didn t mention that the u s had to send some back obama did designate biden his vice president to take the lead in pulling u s forces out of iraq and coordinating efforts to maintain stability in baghdad his results were mixed biden and obama failed to win agreement from the iraqi government to keep a limited number of u s troops there after december 2011 that was the deadline for a complete u s pullout under a deal negotiated by the bush administration biden was still vice president when obama was compelled to return american troops to iraq in 2014 after the rise of the islamic state group ___ advertisement electability trump on the 2016 election there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of the nowhere won the state of new hampshire won iowa won south carolina down the way won a state someplace but we won 32 states the facts trump won 30 states not 32 advertisement it was no landslide he won with about 57 of electoral votes a comfortable margin but no better than average or below average obama and clinton each won bigger victories twice and many other presidents outperformed trump moreover republican trump lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton a rare occurrence for a winning candidate trump routinely inflates the number of electoral votes he won too advertisement ___ warren the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent republican any time in the past 30 years is me democratic debate sanders just to set the record straight i defeated a republican incumbent running for congress advertisement warren i said i was the only one who s beaten an incumbent republican in 30 years the facts sanders wins this argument one of the stranger disputes of the night by a matter of months in november 1990 sanders beat republican incumbent peter smith to take

corporate executives and senate republicans refuse to do the right thing even if that means fueling americans despair and sending more workers to early graves this article was produced by the independent media institute maria fernandes was a good hearted american with a family ambitions and a rock solid work ethic she also juggled three part time jobs to make ends meet and grabbed much needed sleep in her suv between shifts she left the engine running during one of those naps and when a gas container she kept in the suv somehow overturned the fumes and carbon monoxide killed her while her death might appear to be an accident the poverty level wages that kept fernandes working all hours of the day and night are the deliberate choice of corporations that make billions of dollars exploiting the labor of average americans corporate greed turned america into a nation of haves and have nots and more and more often economic despair kills the have nots u s life expectancy dropped three years in a row america s suicide rate is at a record high millions struggle with opioid addictions and workers with multiple part time jobs battle hopelessness none of this occurred by chance diseases of despair soared as corporations sold out the american worker for higher profits ceo pay soared 940 percent over the past 40 years as middle class workers pay stagnated corporations shifted family sustaining manufacturing jobs to low wage mexico hollowing out entire communities they gutted retiree health care and shifted more health care costs to workers ceos and business groups schemed with their republican cronies in government to crush the labor unions that fight to get workers decent pay fair benefits and safe working conditions as union membership declined from more than 30 percent of american workers to about 11 percent the bottom fell out of the middle class income inequality skyrocketed fernandes held down minimum wage jobs at three different dunkin donuts shops in new jersey she napped in her car because she had no time to go home to sleep and traveled with a filled gas can so she d never be late because of an empty tank dunkin considered her a model employee but failed to offer her full time work in a single store something that would have been life changing fernandes never complained about her grueling workdays or dunkin s failure to reward her dedication she struggled to meet basic expenses on her wage of about 8 25 an hour and fell behind on the 550 a month rent for the apartment she rarely slept in even as dunkin s ceo pocketed millions poverty is what really killed fernandes the same is true of low wage workers who take their own lives new research blames thousands of suicides on low minimum wages it predicts that thousands more suicides could be prevented each year and the slide in u s life expectancy slowed if each state increased its minimum wage by just one dollar an hour researchers analyzed minimum wage and suicide data from all 50 states over a 25 year span they concluded a one dollar increase would cut suicides among adults without college degrees by as much as 6 percent the increase would be enough to give minimum wage workers financial breathing room and some hope new jersey s minimum is now 11 but about 21 states still use the federal minimum wage which congress set at 7 25 in 2009 a person making 7 25 an hour and working 40 hours a week earns just 15 080 a year below the poverty line for a household of two the democratic controlled house last year passed a bill to raise the federal minimum to 15 by october 2025 corporations opposed the increase and got their senate republican buddies to kill the legislation majority leader mitch mcconnell of kentucky refuses to hold a vote on the bill even though his state has one of the highest poverty rates in the nation the number of minimum wage and other part time jobs exploded with the demise of american manufacturing u s corporations exploited nafta and shifted one million manufacturing jobs to mexico during the agreement s first two decades alone corporations made a killing because of mexico s low wages and weak environmental regulation but in the process they stole u s workers livelihoods and gutted american communities the low wage limited hour positions in retail hospitality and other industries that proliferated in nafta s wake pay much less than those lost in unionized plants and mills when maytag closed a plant in galesburg illinois and moved the work to mexico about 2 000 unionized workers lost their jobs forklift driver george carney began working as a bartender factory worker tracy warner took jobs as a teacher s assistant and custodian years later they continued to struggle it was nearly impossible to bounce back corporations and their republican allies made sure workers couldn t get ahead besides holding down the minimum wage they conspired to deny workers overtime deliberately misclassify employees as contractors with fewer rights and prevent workers from organizing with the odds stacked against them low wage workers across america often live paycheck to paycheck and grow frustrated with their futures some vent their despair in internet chat rooms with posts like killing myself to avoid a life of dead end jobs and loneliness and is suicide acceptable in place of working a dead end job it s no wonder that opioid overdoses spiked dramatically in counties where auto plants closed or that towns hollowed out by nafta saw increases in poverty murders prostitution drug addiction alcohol abuse and domestic violence health care costs pile on even more pressure corporations shift more and more of the costs to workers through higher co pays premium contributions and deductibles they gutted the retiree health insurance programs that once were a major part of corporate america s compact with workers this has devastating consequences over the past year as many as 137 million americans struggled with health care debt bills prompted some to break into retirement plans or declare bankruptcy they pushed brian jones over the edge jones called 911 one august day and threatened to kill himself when police arrived they found the bodies of jones 77 and his wife patricia 76 jones killed her and then himself because of medical debt the joneses died of gunshot wounds but despair killed them rather than address the spiraling costs of health care senate republicans ignore it they continue to sit on bills the house passed last year to rein in drug prices and protect health care coverage for consumers with pre existing conditions reinvigorated unions are the antidote to corporate greed when they negotiate contracts for members unions set standards that produce better pay benefits and working conditions for unorganized workers too public support for organized labor is on the rise and workers in fields like technology and education now seek union representation but workers also need an administration and senate willing to stand up for them not slavishly cater to corporate interests although fernandes had very little she shared what she had she bought pizza for homeless people and candy for kids she bought suits for her boyfriend and her sons and they wore them to her funeral friends said they hoped her story would lead to a higher minimum wage nationwide but corporate executives and senate republicans refuse to do the right thing even if that means fueling americans despair and sending more workers to early graves
the economic confidence model has marked specific highs and lows in markets to the very day at times depending upon the shifts in capital flows why has the business cycle been masked in complexity that has prevented many from comprehending how it functions i believe this is the result of the average person always attempts to reduce everything to a single cause and effect what they fail to grasp is the level of complexity involved which incorporates weather war innovation population changes the migration of people and economies over the face of the earth many people who are against cycles fail to even comprehend that the rise and fall of civilizations have followed the business cycle itself for thousands of years we are not all powerful and cannot by our sheer will create a utopia and a perfect future the financial capital of the world has migrated which is why all empires nations and city states are buried in a common grave we all may believe that we are the exception to history but human nature ensures that corruption will always rise and defeat the best laid plans of any group even the 911 famous attack on the world trade center took place on the specific turning point in 2001 695 to the very day not all wars begin precisely on this model it may reflect when the combination of trends forms to create the decision to go to war which may predate the event by months or years it is difficult to determine that instant of a decision but clearly war unfolds as the result of some trend set in motion previously the very day that greece applied to the imf beginning the european debt crisis took place on a precise day in the ecm this was the very same position one which the 911 attack took place which resulted in not only the invasion of iraq but it altered our way of life forever having to be x rayed to get on a plane the turning point in 1934 05 marked the confiscation of gold whereas the 1985 turning point marked the birth of the g5 and the organized attempt to manipulate the dollar lower we have the last three waves of that 51 6 year sequences mark the new adoption of socialism following karl marx in the usa this was the beginning of the progressive movement which led to the birth of the income tax by 1913 for example the economic confidence model also marked the very day of the high on july 20th 1998 in the us share market from which the long term capital management crash began in september the 1987 turning point picked the very day of the crash and confirmed the low and the capital flow shift which resulted in selling us assets repatriating cash to japan creating the bubble on the peak of that wave in 1989 95 however sometimes these turning points have been the opposite whereas the geopolitical or economic event comes first and the markets respond secondly to those events in the aftermath there have been many events both economically and geopolitically which have aligned with the economic confidence model there are people who just hate it and try desperately to dismiss this model out of hand because it confirms that any attempt to manipulate the economy by socialists will always fail anyone who attempts to argue against the existence of any business cycle is typically someone who supports the government against the people in true marxist fashion even paul volcker s rare book from 1977 entitled the rediscovery of the business cycle bluntly confirmed that keynesian economics failed because it was supposed to eliminate recessions and depressions while the peak of the wave 2015 75 marked the peak in government and the start of big bang that was certainly reflected by the peak in bond markets and the start of negative interest rates it marked the very day of russia troops arriving in syria which began the refugee crisis into europe merkel s unilateral decision to allow in the refugees set in motion the rising separatist movements in europe the washington times wrote on september 10 2015 angela merkel welcomes refugees to germany despite rising anti immigrant movement her decision illustrated that a single leader could alter the course of europe denying everyone else the right to even vote on her policy then the following year 2016 brought brexit and the election of donald trump which most people still fail to understand why he was elected trump beat all career politicians fulfilling what our model projected back in 1985 that the 2016 election would be the first time a potential third party would take the white house we have witnessed the sovereign debt crisis infect states and set in motion the great migration from the highest taxed states to the states with no income taxes like texas and florida the pension crisis has undermined illinois and this has spread everywhere even in europe about 50 of municipalities are in need of bailouts from the federal government pensions for government employees have generally been just grants which never required them to contribute anything we have witnessed the healthcare costs rise astronomically with obamacare and clinton s handing student to the bankers excluding them from the bankruptcy laws that have devastated the long term economic prospects as this debt burdened generation are living with parents into their 30s and are unable to qualify to even buy a home now we head into the bottom of this ecm wave and incredible we see the trump impeachment trial begin on the turning point and a constitutional crisis in russia that will allow putin to stay in office indefinitely we have watched the us stock market rise as the euro has declined since its 2008 high and capital flows had turned to the dollar the questions we must now address are has the stock market reached a temporary high will we face the abolishment of money in favor of electronic to prevent bank runs will governments seize cryptocurrencies and force the money to be transferred to their own cryptocurrency will climate now turn bittering cold as the next solar cycle which also begins here in 2020 results in food shortages and a rise in commodities welcome to ecm wave 935 we should expect a very important turning point in 2022 which will market a serious monetary crisis from here on out the confrontation in government between left and right will intensify and the violence will rise with the rhetoric any hope of a responsible government is now extinguished the democrats are facing the collapse of their party they know they really cannot beat trump in a fair election so they have adopted the policy that if you cannot beat him impeach him yet there may be another conspiracy they are up to behind the curtain and that is to prolong the impeachment trial to force the competition against biden to remain in the senate for months there may be an even darker plot at work involving hillary
as the world s business elites trek to davos for their annual gathering people should be asking a simple question have they overcome their infatuation with us president donald trump two years ago a few rare corporate leaders were concerned about climate change or upset at trump s misogyny and bigotry most however were celebrating the president s tax cuts for billionaires and corporations and looking forward to his efforts to deregulate the economy that would allow businesses to pollute the air more get more americans hooked on opioids entice more children to eat their diabetes inducing foods and engage in the sort of financial shenanigans that brought on the 2008 crisis today many corporate bosses are still talking about the continued gdp growth and record stock prices but neither gdp nor the dow is a good measure of economic performance neither tells us what s happening to ordinary citizens living standards or anything about sustainability in fact us economic performance over the past four years is exhibit a in the indictment against relying on these indicators the lion s share of the increase in gdp is also going to those at the top to get a good reading on a country s economic health start by looking at the health of its citizens if they are happy and prosperous they will be healthy and live longer among developed countries america sits at the bottom in this regard us life expectancy already relatively low fell in each of the first two years of trump s presidency and in 2017 midlife mortality reached its highest rate since world war ii this is not a surprise because no president has worked harder to make sure that more americans lack health insurance millions have lost their coverage and the uninsured rate has risen in just two years from 10 9 to 13 7 one reason for declining life expectancy in america is what anne case and nobel laureate economist angus deaton call deaths of despair caused by alcohol drug overdoses and suicide in 2017 the most recent year for which good data are available such deaths stood at almost four times their 1999 level the only time i have seen anything like these declines in health outside of war or epidemics was when i was chief economist of the world bank and found out that mortality and morbidity data confirmed what our economic indicators suggested about the dismal state of the post soviet russian economy trump may be a good president for the top 1 and especially for the top 0 1 but he has not been good for everyone else if fully implemented the 2017 tax cut will result in tax increases for most households in the second third and fourth income quintiles given tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the ultrarich and corporations it should come as no surprise that there was no significant change in the median us household s disposable incomebetween 2017 and 2018 again the most recent year with good data the lion s share of the increase in gdp is also going to those at the top real median weekly earnings are just 2 6 above their level when trump took office and these increases have not offset long periods of wage stagnation for example the median wage of a full time male worker and those with full time jobs are the lucky ones is still more than 3 below what it was 40 years ago nor has there been much progress on reducing racial disparities in the third quarter of 2019 median weekly earnings for black men working full time were less than three quarters the level for white men making matters worse the growth that has occurred is not environmentally sustainable and even less so thanks to the trump administration s gutting of regulations that have passed stringent cost benefit analyses the air will be less breathable the water less drinkable and the planet more subject to climate change in fact losses related to climate change have already reached new highs in the us which has suffered more property damage than any other country reaching some 1 5 of gdp in 2017 the tax cuts were supposed to spur a new wave of investment instead they triggered an all time record binge of share buybacks some 800 billion in 2018 by some of america s most profitable companies and led to record peacetime deficits almost 1 trillion in fiscal 2019 in a country supposedly near full employment and even with weak investment the us had to borrow massively abroad the most recent data show foreign borrowing at nearly 500 billion a year with an increase of more than 10 in america s net indebtedness position in one year alone likewise trump s trade wars for all their sound and fury have not reduced the us trade deficit which was one quarter higher in 2018 than it was in 2016 the 2018 goods deficit was the largest on record even the deficit in trade with china was up almost a quarter from 2016 the us did get a new north american trade agreement without the investment agreement provisions that the business roundtable wanted without the provisions raising drug prices that the pharmaceutical companies wanted and with better labor and environmental provisions trump a self proclaimed master deal maker lost on almost every front in his negotiations with congressional democrats resulting in a slightly improved trade arrangement and despite trump s vaunted promises to bring manufacturing jobs back to the us the increase in manufacturing employment is still lower than it was under his predecessor barack obama once the post 2008 recovery set in and is still markedly below its pre crisis level even the unemployment rate at a 50 year low masks economic fragility the employment rate for working age males and females while rising has increased less than during the obama recovery and is still significantly below that of other developed countries the pace of job creation is also markedly slower than it was under obama again the low employment rate is not a surprise not least because unhealthy people can t work moreover those on disability benefits in prison the us incarceration rate has increased more than sixfold since 1970 with some two million people currently behind bars or so discouraged that they are not actively seeking jobs are not counted as unemployed but of course they are not employed nor is it a surprise that a country that doesn t provide affordable childcare or guarantee family leave would have lower female employment adjusted for population more than ten percentage points lower than other developed countries even judging by gdp the trump economy falls short last quarter s growth was just 2 1 far less than the 4 5 or even 6 trump promised to deliver and even less than the 2 4 average of obama s second term that is a remarkably poor performance considering the stimulus provided by the 1 trillion deficit and ultra low interest rates this is not an accident or just a matter of bad luck trump s brand is uncertainty volatility and prevarication whereas trust stability and confidence are essential for growth so is equality according to the international monetary fund so trump deserves failing grades not just on essential tasks like upholding democracy and preserving our planet he should not get a pass on the economy either

members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial ___ trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power ___ economy trump in wisconsin the unemployment rate has reached its lowest level in history milwaukee rally tuesday the facts he s citing outdated figures wisconsin did post a record low unemployment rate of 2 8 in april and may but it has since edged up and is now at 3 3 that s slightly lower than the u s average of 3 5 but suggests that the state hit a rough patch in the middle of last year ___ trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department figures these gains reflect the recovery from the great recession as well as population growth more than 4 8 million people have joined the labor force in three years of trump s presidency ___ trump under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest gains earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionally milwaukee rally the facts actually the top 10 of earners saw the biggest raises of any income bracket over the past year their usual weekly earnings jumped 8 or 168 according to the labor department the bottom 10 saw weekly incomes grow 7 or 30 over a broader range the top and bottom 25 weekly earnings also grew at faster rate for the wealthier group ___ trump we ve created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs nobody thought that was possible milwaukee rally the facts his numbers are roughly right though they are less impressive than trump claims job gains under trump over the past three years were lower than during the final three years of obama s presidency more than 8 million jobs were added during that period under obama including 1 2 million combined in manufacturing and construction what these figures suggest is that much of the job growth under trump reflects the momentum from a recovery that officially began in the middle of 2009 ___ immigration trump we have loopholes like a visa lottery we put things in the lottery and they come in they become american citizens do you think these countries are giving us their finest oh let s give them our best citizens milwaukee rally the facts this is a perpetual falsehood from the president countries don t nominate their citizens for the program they don t get to select people they d like to get rid of foreigners apply for the visas on their own under the program citizens of countries named by the u s can bid for visas if they have enough education or work experience in desired fields out of that pool of qualified applicants the state department randomly selects a much smaller pool of tentative winners not all winners will have visas approved because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks like other immigrants ___ trump mexico s paying for the wall you know that it s all worked out milwaukee rally the facts mexico isn t paying for trump s long promised border wall trump has argued that the updated trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico ___ child care biden on his early days in washington i was making 42 000 a year i commuted every single solitary day to wilmington delaware over 500 miles a day excuse me 250 miles a day because i could not afford child care it was beyond my reach democratic presidential debate tuesday the facts that s a stretch biden s wife and daughter died in a car accident after he won a senate seat in 1972 as a single parent working far out of town biden might have faced steeper child care costs than people who work locally do but his senate salary actually 42 500 was worth more than 256 000 in today s dollars that s more than four times the median household income ___ health care trump i was the person who saved pre existing conditions in your healthcare you have it now tweet monday the facts that s false people with preexisting medical problems have health insurance protections because of obama s health care law which trump is trying to dismantle one of trump s major alternatives to obama s law short term health insurance already in place doesn t have to cover preexisting conditions another alternative is association health plans which are oriented to small businesses and sole proprietors and do cover preexisting conditions meanwhile trump s administration has been pressing in court for full repeal of the obama era law including provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination with obamacare still in place insurers in the individual marketplace must take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who have poor health or past medical problems before obama s law any insurer could deny coverage or charge more to anyone with a preexisting condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy ___ bernie sanders medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo democratic debate the facts there s no guarantee of that the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last year that total spending under a single payer system like the vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate favors might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system those features have to do with the design of the system questions such as payment rates for hospitals and doctors and whether patients are required to pay part of the cost of their care sanders says his plan would require no cost sharing from patients no copays and no deductibles but completely free care could trigger a surge in demand for medical services raising costs other countries that provide coverage for all do use cost sharing to help keep spending in check a research report last year by the nonprofit rand think tank estimated that a medicare for all plan similar to what sanders wants would modestly raise total u s health spending ___ military trump on killing iran gen qassem soleimani the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy tweet monday trump you know what bothers me when i see a nancy pelosi trying to defend this monster from iran when nancy pelosi and the democrats want to defend him i think that s a very bad thing for this country remarks on jan 9 at event on environmental regulations the facts that s a fabrication democrats did not praise or defend the iranian general they criticized the action trump took pelosi called the u s missile strike provocative and disproportionate while branding soleimani a terrible person similarly democratic presidential candidates criticized trump s strategy and the fact he didn t notify or consult congress in advance while making clear they considered soleimani anything but wonderful the iranian was a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands including hundreds of americans said massachusetts sen elizabeth warren even so republican rep doug collins of georgia asserted democrats were in love with terrorists then retracted the statement and apologized i left parts of my body in iraq fighting terrorists democratic sen tammy duckworth of ilinois a former army pilot who lost both her legs while serving in iraq told cnn after hearing collins initial remarks i don t need to justify myself to anyone ___ trump our military has been totally rebuilt milwaukee rally the facts it hasn t the administration has accelerated a sharp buildup in defense spending but it will take years for freshly ordered tanks planes and other weapons to be built delivered and put to use the air force s minuteman 3 missiles for instance a key part of the u s nuclear force have been operating since the early 1970s and modernization started under the obama administration they are due to be replaced with a new version but not until later this decade ___ biden i was asked to bring 156 000 troops home from that war which i did i led that effort democratic debate the facts biden is roughly right about bringing troops home but he didn t mention that the u s had to send some back obama did designate biden his vice president to take the lead in pulling u s forces out of iraq and coordinating efforts to maintain stability in baghdad his results were mixed biden and obama failed to win agreement from the iraqi government to keep a limited number of u s troops there after december 2011 that was the deadline for a complete u s pullout under a deal negotiated by the bush administration biden was still vice president when obama was compelled to return american troops to iraq in 2014 after the rise of the islamic state group ___ electability trump on the 2016 election there have been some great movements where somebody came along and out of the nowhere won the state of new hampshire won iowa won south carolina down the way won a state someplace but we won 32 states the facts trump won 30 states not 32 it was no landslide he won with about 57 of electoral votes a comfortable margin but no better than average or below average obama and clinton each won bigger victories twice and many other presidents outperformed trump moreover republican trump lost the popular vote to democrat hillary clinton a rare occurrence for a winning candidate trump routinely inflates the number of electoral votes he won too ___ warren the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent republican any time in the past 30 years is me democratic debate sanders just to set the record straight i defeated a republican incumbent running for congress warren i said i was the only one who s beaten an incumbent republican in 30 years the facts sanders wins this argument one of the stranger disputes of the night by a matter of months in november 1990 sanders beat republican incumbent peter smith to take vermont s only house seat that was 29 years and two months ago sanders win technically slips in the 30 year window ___ associated press writers josh boak paul wiseman robert burns

chapter 20 supply and demand updated 4 13 20 elisha said hear the word of the lord this is what the lord says tomorrow about this time a measure of fine flour will be sold for a shekel and two measures of barley for a shekel in the gate of samaria then the captain on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of god and said see even if the lord should make windows in heaven can this thing happen elisha replied see you will watch it happen with your own eyes but you will not eat any of it ii kings 7 1 2 analysis ben hadad king of aram had besieged samaria in the northern kingdom the city was stricken with a famine the price of food had become too expensive for most people to buy so there was a great famine in samaria behold they besieged it until a donkey s head was sold for eighty pieces of silver and the fourth part of a kab of dove s dung for five pieces of silver ii kings 6 25 the prophet elisha was in the city he made a prediction regarding the price of food the next day there was no question in anyone s mind what this meant the siege would be lifted large quantities of food would be brought into the city under the new conditions of supply and demand the price of food would be reasonable he was not simply predicting a fall in the price of food he was predicting the defeat of the besieging army a military officer understood exactly what elisha was predicting he dismissed this prophecy as nonsense elisha promised him that what he had predicted would take place and the price of food would fall but the commander would not taste of any of it this is exactly what transpired during the night the besieging army heard what appeared to be marching troops approaching they fled in terror leaving all of their food behind four lepers went out to the now empty camp of the army they collected some gold and silver for themselves but then they felt guilty they decided to tell people in the city that the food was available people in the city went out to collect the food and bring it back in the rush to get the food the mob trampled the officer he did not have an opportunity to eat this passage makes it clear that the law of supply and demand was fully understood in ancient israel the commander could put two and two together there was only one scenario that would make possible this rapid decline in the price of food a lifting of the siege there would also have to be a vast increase in the supply of food because there was no visible way for israel to defeat the invading army and because there was also no large supply of food available in the immediate vicinity the captain dismissed the prophecy as nonsense he paid for this arrogance with his life ii kings 7 20 a a universally recognized law i believe that the law of supply and demand is the best understood law of free market economic theory it is understood around the world it has been understood throughout recorded history people understand that prices reflect the conditions of supply and demand so the phrase is widely recognized it is generally accepted when someone invokes the law of supply and demand in an argument the listener probably goes along with it unless he has an interest in opposing open competition the phrase supply and demand applies to the market s pricing process it is understandable if you understand an auction most people do not oppose the idea of an auction therefore most people do not resist the concept of supply and demand this is why economists who favor the free market have successfully used the phrase for over two centuries as we marketers like to say it is an easy sell there are four assumptions that undergird this famous law specialization marketplace money and negotiation first specialization there are sellers of scarce goods and services these sellers have specialized in production they have a high degree of expertise in the production and distribution of a particular item they have invested time and money in the production of this item they did not produce the item in order to consume it they produced it in order to exchange it for money which they could then use to buy something that they did not produce this description rests on the concept of the division of labor it rests on the concept of specialization in production the concept of specialization says that it pays producers to specialize in those areas of the marketplace in which they have unique advantages knowledge geography reputation styling and so forth the individual produces the item for exchange not for personal consumption second marketplace someone else has an item that he has produced he also wants to improve his circumstances he wishes to exchange his item for some other item that he desires more intensely this is an aspect of subjective imputation of economic value each of the participants in an exchange imputes greater value to what the other participant owns than to what he owns each of them believes that he can improve his circumstances by making an exchange to do this they need a marketplace it need not be physical it can be digital it must be paid for there are no free lunches the marketplace must be reliable contracts must be honored by participants and by outsiders third money most people understand that the law of supply and demand is most visible in today s markets these markets are based on exchanges for money in this situation the person who owns money is in a more competitive situation than the person who is selling a specialized good or service money is the most marketable commodity sellers want money they are willing to offer whatever they have for sale in exchange for a certain amount of money it does not take sales ability for a buyer to persuade a seller to provide what he wants if the buyer is willing to pay the seller s price this is why buyers who are sellers of money possess consumer s authority they possess greater authority in the marketplace than the seller does under most conditions this is not generally understood by the public the public generally assumes that the seller is in a stronger position most people think this the seller sets prices the seller does not set prices he announces prices if no one buys whatever he is selling at the prices he has announced then he has to lower the prices or in some way alter his marketing plan buyers confirm prices or fail to confirm prices by either buying or refusing to buy buyers can do almost anything with the money they are willing to spend they have lots of alternatives in contrast sellers can do almost nothing with their inventory of whatever they have to sell if buyers are unwilling to pay fourth negotiation the implicit assumption is that buyers and sellers are in a position to negotiate the seller wants more money the buyer wants to pay less money or receive better value for the money he spends there is ignorance on the part of both buyer and seller therefore there is an opportunity for negotiation the book of proverbs describes this process bad bad says the buyer but when he goes away he boasts 20 14 in a highly competitive market where there are lots of buyers and sellers negotiation is less likely prices are publicly available buyers know what sellers are willing to sell for sellers know what recent buyers have been willing to pay the more widespread the information regarding prices the less likely there will be negotiation negotiation is the market process that prevails when there is reduced knowledge of prices people understand that if the supply of an item unexpectedly goes up existing sellers will not be able to sell all of the items they have brought to market they may have to take some items back home more likely they will have to lower their prices in order to reduce their inventory to zero people also understand that if the demand for an item unexpectedly goes up existing buyers will not be able to buy all of the items they had wanted to buy when they brought their money to market they may not be able to take home the items they wanted to buy or they may have to pay more money to buy the items here is the law of the auction high bid wins if there are a lot of auctioneers selling similar items the bids will be lower if there are a lot of buyers wanting to buy the items bids will be higher most people understand this most people accept this this is the law of supply and demand in an imaginative setting that most people can understand b forecasting it is not true that supply creates its own demand it is also not true that demand creates its own supply here is what is true buyers make forecasts about what they will be willing to pay for an item in the future sellers make forecasts about what they will be willing and able to charge for an item in the future if members of either group make mistakes they will have to adjust their behavior when the day of market exchange arrives production is future oriented so are plans for future consumption nobody is certain what others will be willing to pay in the future it takes successful entrepreneurship meaning accurate forecasting and planning for a seller to make a profit it takes successful entrepreneurship meaning accurate forecasting and planning for a buyer to get the best possible deal for his money consumer surplus free market economists have traditionally argued that the market will clear itself of excess supply at some price their assumption is this sellers will adjust their prices in order to gain at least some money from buyers who refuse to pay the asking prices of the goods and services that sellers brought to market here is the secondary assumption something is better than nothing sellers would rather receive some money than no money some of them would rather sell at a price that they would have regarded as a loss when they first brought the goods to market the new conditions have redefined what constitutes a profit and a loss under the old conditions selling their inventory below the cost of production would have been understood as a loss that is no longer the case under the new conditions under the new conditions getting some money is better than getting no money and then being forced to carry home the unsold inventory the same attitude governs buyers if conditions have changed and prices have risen above what buyers had expected to pay some of them will pay a higher price they would have regarded this as a loss under the previous conditions but under the new conditions paying more money and taking home the product seems to be the best decision available to them the determining factor is price it is the determining factor for sellers and it is the determining factor for buyers i am not speaking of all sellers and all buyers i am speaking of what market economists call marginal sellers and marginal buyers these are the buyers and sellers who are willing to make a transaction at a price different from what they had expected these are the sellers who sell at prices lower than they had expected to receive these are the buyers who purchase at prices higher than they had expected to pay their transaction prices set the prices for comparable transactions the prices paid by marginal buyers and sellers are regarded as the best available prices in the market and other buyers and sellers will imitate the selling prices of the marginal buyers and sellers the transaction prices of the marginal buyers and sellers send signals to all other buyers and sellers in the marketplace who are aware of the transaction prices of the marginal buyers and sellers sellers do not want to accept less and buyers do not want to pay more c keynes vs say s supposed law the great transformation in economic theory began in 1936 with the publication of john maynard keynes book the general theory of employment interest and money the world had been in a depression for about six years while austrian economists had an answer for this as seen in the book by mises disciple lionel robbins the great depression 1934 the vast majority of free market economists seemed unable to explain why the depression did not end this made free market economists vulnerable to the accusation that their theories no longer worked robbins decades later disavowed the book there were valid reasons for the economic stagnation that these economists ignored governments had indulged in huge deficit spending campaigns as a way to put people back to work every government had gone off the gold standard by 1934 monetary policy of central banks was no longer predictable businessmen were wary for good reason regarding the next piece of legislation germany and italy had adopted central economic planning in the form of fascism property rights were no longer respected by these major governments in the united states the national government interfered in the economy as never before in peace time free market theory says that prices should have adjusted to clear the market of unsold goods but governments had passed legislation that made it difficult for retailers to sell their goods at a market price and also hire laborers at a market wage the depression dragged on it was then that keynes offered a criticism of the traditional free market approach regarding supply and demand his target was a french economist of the early nineteenth century j b say either keynes had no understanding of what say had written or else he was deliberately deceiving his readers he devoted only three sentences to say s writings here is what he wrote from the time of say and ricardo the classical economists have taught that supply creates its own demand meaning by this in some significant but not clearly defined sense that the whole of the costs of production must necessarily be spent in the aggregate directly or indirectly on purchasing the product p 18 thus say s law that the aggregate demand price of output as a whole is equal to its aggregate supply price for all volumes of output is equivalent to the proposition that there is no obstacle to full employment if however this is not the true law relating the aggregate demand and supply functions there is a vitally important chapter of economic theory which remains to be written and without which all discussions concerning the volume of aggregate employment are futile p 26 keynes phrase has been cited by keynesian economists ever since supply creates its own demand obviously in 1936 supply had not created its own demand so it looked as though say and ricardo were economic ignoramuses the problem is this say never said any such thing here is what he wrote regarding pricing this is from his treatise on political economy 1803 the passage is a defense of price flexibility in the marketplace it is a defense of economic negotiation as a way to clear the market of unsold inventories in short it is a defense of market clearing prices the prospect of an abundant vintage will lower the price of all the wine on hand even before a single pipe of the expected vintage has been brought to market for the supply is brisker and the sale duller in consequence of the anticipation the dealers are anxious to dispose of their stock in hand in fear of the competition of the new vintage while the consumers on the other hand retard their fresh purchases in the expectation of gaining in price by the delay a large arrival and immediate sale of foreign articles all at once lowers their price by the relative excess of supply above demand on the contrary the expectation of a bad vintage or the loss of many cargoes on the voyage will raise prices above the cost of production this is the meaning of the assertion that at a given time and place the price of a commodity rises in proportion to the increase of the demand and the decrease of the supply and vice versÃ¢ or in other words that the rise of price is in direct ratio to the demand and inverse ratio to the supply i ii p 290 in each country the wants of the consumer determine the quality of the product the product most wanted is most in demand and that which is most in demand yields the largest profit to industry capital and land which are therefore employed in raising this particular product in preference and vice versÃ¢ when a product becomes less in demand there is a less profit to be got by its production it is therefore no longer produced all the stock on hand falls in price the low price encourages the consumption which soon absorbs the stock on hand iii i p 390 say fully understood what adam smith had understood namely that sellers of goods that were not in high demand would then lower their prices in order to sell their inventory these low prices would encourage consumption the low price encourages the consumption which soon absorbs the stock on hand say did not teach that supply creates its own demand he taught what should have been obvious namely that if someone has not supplied something worth buying at the price he is asking he will not earn any money if he does not earn any money he will be unable to register demand in the market place but at some low price he will sell his inventory thus total aggregate production will create demand at some price so it is quite possible for a producer to bring to market an item for which there is no demand at the price he expected to receive and is asking in such circumstances he must lower his price if he wishes to make any money in other words is a matter of supply and demand say even used this phrase the relative excess of supply above demand anyone who understood the law of supply and demand in 1936 should have begun searching for causes of the inability of sellers to sell their inventories the world economy had not adjusted to the new conditions of supply and demand why not in july 1930 the united states government hiked tariffs other nations retaliated the international division of labor contracted in may 1931 a large austrian bank credit anstalt declared bankruptcy in september 1931 england went off the gold standard the united states followed in march 1933 governments ran massive deficits investors and businesses could no longer expect governments to cut taxes and spending in 1963 murray rothbard s book was published america s great depression he discussed in detail the economic policies of president hoover s administration 1929 33 policies that were greatly expanded by president franklin roosevelt s new deal 1933 41 these policies restricted the ability of producers to lower their prices they also restricted the right of employers to offer market clearing wages to workers thereby putting them back to work the new deal beginning in 1933 launched the government enforced trade union movement in the united states keynesian economics rests on this premise the law of supply and demand does not work predictably to solve the problems of recession and depression keynesian economists reject the suggestion that the law ever did work effectively they conclude that government intervention in the form of large government deficits and central bank expansion of money are necessary to restore economic growth they do not believe that reducing government taxation and intervention will lead to permanent economic expansion they also believe in the welfare state conclusion in a world of scarcity everyone would like to own more than he possesses there are limits to his resources everyone faces monetary limits on his ability to bid for goods and services on a free market the only way for someone to register demand in the free market is through the results of his production or the production of somebody who gave him his money this production must be marketable if someone does not wish to buy whatever a producer has produced the producer has wasted time money resources and dreams just because he worked hard to produce something does not mean that buyers will be willing to pay him the money he asks in exchange for his output he may have to ask less therefore supply and demand are not autonomous forces they are part of the market process supply and demand are meaningful only in the context of prices prices must be flexible upward and downward in order for supplies of goods and services to find buyers people must be allowed to negotiate with each other as a way to make exchanges civil law should allow owners to sell or rent their property they should be allowed to transfer to others the responsibilities associated with owning specific goods other people may want the benefits and the associated responsibilities of owning these goods price flexibility leads to the concept of the market clearing price this is not the same as an equilibrium price there is no such thing as equilibrium therefore there is no such thing as an equilibrium price the concept of equilibrium rests on a silly assumption the theoretical usefulness of the concept of human omniscience in contrast a market clearing price is the price at which everyone who has an item to sell can find a buyer for this item simultaneously everyone who wants to buy this item can find a seller lots of people might like to buy it lots of people might like to sell theirs but liking is not the same as doing the key phrase is this at some price at a market clearing price all of those people who want to buy at a particular price make exchanges with all of those who wish to sell at that price no one is left out in the cold with a desire either to buy or sell at that price the unified concept of supply and demand implicitly has as its presupposition the possibility of a market clearing price economic theory brings this to the forefront of the discussion what is usually only implicit this price is not known in advance by either buyers or sellers it is the product of negotiation guesswork and the providence of god humanists prefer to substitute the word luck for the phrase providence of god their worldview is governed by the concept of chance as i argued in chapter 6 of the student s edition chance is point one of their covenant model the doctrine of origins obviously i reject their attempted substitution _______________________________ for the complete manuscript go here
cai meng china daily with president xi jinping paying a two day visit to myanmar which concluded on saturday the focus of china myanmar cooperation is on jointly building the china myanmar economic corridor under the belt and road framework as a relatively less developed country with per capita gdp of less than 1 500 myanmar s current priority is to find ways to boost its economy yet given the lack of proper stimulus it is not an easy task for countries such as myanmar to accelerate economic growth however myanmar can get the needed stimulus as well as create the strategic opportunities to expedite its economic growth by jointly building the cmec with china in fact myanmar s economy can register leapfrog growth if it can successfully co build the cmec better infrastructure for faster growth first to accelerate economic growth myanmar has to build more power plants and improve its transportation infrastructure especially the shortage of electricity in myanmar is seriously hindering its industrial development i once traveled by bus from mandalay to muse in myanmar and it took me about two days to cover the mountainous stretch of about 400 kilometers as roads were in very poor condition the first step toward building the cmec is to build the china myanmar expressway and railway a railway that extends from kunming to ruili in yunnan province across the border to mandalay and then west to kyaukpyu in rakhine state and southeast to yangon this will establish myanmar s fundamental railway structure which can later be extended to cover the entire country the china myanmar oil and gas pipeline project connecting western myanmar and yunnan which was built by china between 2013 and 2017 has not only become a source of new income and employment for myanmar people but also eased the demand for energy along the route as such the two countries are likely to deepen cooperation on energy under the cmec framework especially to strengthen myanmar s power generation sector need to improve transport facilities second the cmec will promote myanmar s trade myanmar s export to neighboring countries has been restricted due to poor transportation facilities which means the country needs to urgently improve its transport infrastructure in order to reduce transportation costs and increase the export of products such as rice and fruits to china third the cmec will help propel the development of myanmar s industry including the manufacturing sector especially in the mandalay industrial zone new yangon city and the kyaukpyu special economic zone and fourth the improvement of transport infrastructure and building of more power plants will help myanmar tap its full tourism potential which could play an increasingly important role in facilitating myanmar s economic takeoff more important as the cmec is likely to attract more foreign capital it will inject added vitality into myanmar s economy cmec will also benefit china china too will benefit from the cmec in particular the economic corridor will ensure energy security by opening a new energy transportation channel and help establish a new pattern of further opening up the chinese economy in the new era by facilitating the economic integration of china southeast asia and south asia thankfully a top level design for the cmec s construction is already in place president xi and myanmar state counselor aung san suu kyi reached a consensus on building the cmec under the belt and road framework at the end of 2017 and in september 2018 the two sides signed the memorandum of understanding on building the cmec and established the cmec joint committee which held its first meeting in the same year and the second in 2019 indicating that a working mechanism for the cmec too has been established also a number of institutional arrangements have been made for example the arrangements for the china myanmar border economic cooperation zone are basically in place with the central bank of myanmar approving the yuan as the official settlement currency which will facilitate investment in cmec projects work on cross border railway progressing well besides a number of major projects are progressing smoothly among them the upgrading of the domestic section of the china myanmar railway from kunming to dali has been completed and the new section from dali to ruili is under construction on the other side of the border work on the muse to mandalay section is on in full swing the first construction phase of the kyaukpyu deep sea port has begun and the new yangon city project is progressing well in addition the energy pipeline and substation expansion projects in yangon have been completed industrial links strengthened and cross border trade has gained momentum and there is enough reason to believe that on the conclusion of what appears to be a fruitful visit of president xi to myanmar the construction of the cmec will gather added pace yet three cmec development issues require special attention to begin with the two sides need to reach a deeper and wider consensus on actively propelling the cmec s development need to clear doubts of myanmar people i once organized a meeting in mandalay with key members of the myanmar chamber of commerce and found that they were generally ambivalent about certain issues for example they wished to attract more chinese investment but were worried that the chinese investors might grab a larger share of their market to address their concern the two countries should welcome investment from each other and take measures to strengthen their partnership with the goal of realizing mutual benefit and win win results also related projects have to be expeditiously implemented so they yield early gains the cmec is a huge project with a long development cycle requiring huge investments therefore both sides need to take steps to support long term projects so as to promote sustainable development furthermore there is a need to build cooperation in third party markets the united states and countries in europe especially the united kingdom and asia such as japan the republic of korea india and a number of asean member states have been investing in myanmar building the foundation for third party market cooperation china and myanmar should actively invite such countries to join the cmec development platform help build the corridor and reap mutual benefits through fair cooperation the author is a professor and executive dean of belt and road school beijing normal university the views don t necessarily represent those of china daily
key point tokyo doesn t have enough babies and young workers to keep up its tax income and finances this means that over time japan will have less money and fewer soldiers to defend itself with in the last twenty years it has been customary to refer to japan s weak economic performance as a lost decade demographics tell us that we are moving well beyond that japan is looking at a lost century if you want to see the future of the advanced economies japan might be a good place to start despite full employment japan is showing muted wage pressures minimal gdp growth low interest rates and continued high government deficits how do these seemingly contradictory elements fit together are they unique to japan or symptoms of a more general malaise in japan demographics are largely responsible the country is facing an unprecedented meltdown in population after peaking in 2010 at 128 million the country s population has eased back to 126 million and will continue to decline its population is set to shrink by 0 4 percent annually with the decrease expected to accelerate to 1 0 percent annually by the 2040s by 2050 japan will have 23 percent fewer citizens not since the great plagues of the middle ages have we seen population collapse of this magnitude nor does it stop in mid century demographers see current trends persisting to the end of the century when japan s population falls to fifty million only 40 percent of its all time high in the medium term not all age cohorts are similarly affected japan s sixty five plus age group continues to increase but interestingly is already almost at steady state the seventy five plus age group continues to grow until the late 2020s most affected are the fourteen and under and the 15 65 age groups the latter here being treated as the potential labor force from 2017 to 2050 the fourteen and under age cohort is forecast to fall by nearly 40 percent the workforce 15 65 falls by 34 percent in the same period thus not only is japan s population declining its workforce is declining much faster than the population as a whole the loss of workers constrains gdp growth in essence the loss of workers offsets productivity gains such that japan s gdp in 2050 will be not materially higher than it is today importantly worker productivity gains are expected to continue at a reasonable pace about 1 4 percent per year the average japanese worker continues to improve his productivity that s not the problem nevertheless the number of workers declines by 1 2 percent on average during the forecast period with greater declines closer to 2050 working smarter is negated by fewer people working that s the problem thus we should expect gdp in japan in the coming decades to be stagnant with periods of gains alternating with periods of retrenchment and no visible trend in either direction much as we have seen for the last fifteen years or so importantly a decline in japan s gdp cannot be unambiguously interpreted as a cyclical downturn it is as likely to be a function of demographics the key number to watch will be gdp worker which will tell us more about the health of the japanese economy than will gdp in aggregate japan does have certain hidden reserves for example an increase in senior employment already high in japan would represent a modest hidden reserve of gdp growth the employment to population ratio could also move up a bit although this too is fairly high by oecd standards both these factors might make gdp growth a bit better than forecast but probably not by much demographics are also a key driver of the national budget japan has run hefty national budget deficits for the last quarter century the country s working age population peaked in the late 1990s and has been falling since with a decline in its workforce japan s gdp growth also declined and this appears in turn to have led to lower domestic interest rates at the same time japan s elderly population has been soaring given fewer workers more retirees and lower interest rates the japanese government decided to load up on debt as the path of least resistance this is no surprise given the politics of the advanced democracies japan started to run sizeable deficits in 1995 and does to this day these cumulated into a national debt exceeding 200 percent of gdp which will continue to grow until peaking at 225 percent of gdp around 2025 in most the scenarios we examined to put this in context the imf historically considered a debt gdp ratio of 60 percent to represent the maximum prudent level japan blew through this limit twenty years ago and continues to be able to operate but for how long without the prospect of meaningful gdp growth japan cannot count on continued expansion of the economy to fund a reduction in either absolute or relative debt levels our analysis suggests that japan may nevertheless be able to thread the needle if real spending per dependent can be held flat in real terms workers accept ongoing tax rate increases and no internal or external shocks hit the economy japan can muddle through this would stabilize debt gdp above 200 percent but not much less than that neither taxpayers nor spending beneficiaries may be happy with this outcome or almost any set of policies the japanese government could conjure in the scenario above real taxes per taxpayer would rise by 80 percent over the forecast horizon in an economy not growing at all in aggregate in addition the government would have to hold real spending per beneficiary effectively flat for thirty five years and longer if over the horizon projections were to be included will japanese taxpayers who are already heavily taxed accept another 15 percent rise in tax rates and will beneficiaries accept no real increase in benefits for decades will the internal stresses on japan s citizens prove manageable not only for a year or two but for generations to come moreover because the workforce is declining government debt per worker will continue to rise in constant dollars over the forecast horizon from the equivalent of 50 000 in 2000 to 128 000 this year and rising to 208 000 in 2050 all in a stagnant economy for purposes of comparison the equivalent in the united states today is about 75 000 federal government debt person of working age additionally the united states has higher per capita gdp than japan even in the best case scenario tokyo will require extraordinary and enduring forbearance from the population neither taxpayers nor spending beneficiaries can revolt if the government is to remain fiscally viable it is easier to foresee it all going bad any portion of society either the makers or the takers may find the necessary social compact unacceptable and may turn to a populist leadership offering easy solutions like debt default money printing or any variety of destructive policies which look appealing on the surface but are counterproductive in practice raising tariffs would be an example further japan s economy will be vulnerable to external shocks and global credit conditions japan may find it increasingly difficult to respond to global recessions major weather events earthquakes and any rise in global interest rates a one percentage point rise in interest rates would imply an increase in japan s government outlays of 2 percent of gdp if all debt were refinanced promptly without economic growth as a cushion the adjustment would have to come in short order from increased taxes or reduced spending japan could also prove vulnerable to international meddling even the cost of a small war could prove too much and domestic constituents could prove amenable to the blandishments of populists backed by foreign powers trying to destabilize japanese democracy on the other hand not all trends are negative unemployment should be minimal throughout the period and wage gains should be solid real estate should be falling in value year after year increasing the purchasing power of those with jobs moreover older societies and by 2050 the average japanese will be well over fifty years of age are less amenable to revolutionary promises the fervor of impressionable unemployed youth will be lacking and this may stabilize japan s society and protect it from various forms of domestic extremism and foreign meddling at a guess japan will go down in a chinese financial crash sometime before 2025 china s debt situation is hardly more enviable than japan s and a corrective meltdown is likely sooner or later japan could easily end up as collateral damage in such a crisis as banks and investors withdraw from asia more broadly much as they did in 1998 the implications for the united states are myriad over time japan s internal politics may become unstable and more populist in addition tokyo may find itself trying to maneuver through another fiscal crisis and in all certainty japan will have fewer resources both in men and money to devote to its defense in all these cases tokyo will be less willing or able to contribute to collective defense with washington and may as likely require active u s support to right its fiscal ship
in terms of its importance to world markets the u s election is far more important to follow than our own canadian elections in terms of its importance to world markets the u s election is far more important to follow than our own canadian elections the united states represents 57 per cent of the world s market capitalization while canada represents less than thee per cent our clients hold more u s and international investments than canadian investments it is crucial in terms of stock market analysis to be hypersensitive to the news south of our border as we approach the next election on nov 3 2020 leading up to the last election in november 2016 we fielded many phone calls and had many meetings about the direction of the stock market under both a republican and democratic election outcome most canadians i talked to felt that there was no way that the republican candidate would get elected at that time i remember telling people that it was a real possibility that the republicans would get elected i lived in the united states for many years and it became very apparent that americans support a political party first and foremost i have not felt that attachment to a political party is as strong here in canada many canadians may have a bias but they are open to hearing what each candidate says what was also very clear in the last u s election was that polls are not always right leading up to the last election polls were largely predicting a democratic victory when this was not the outcome the initial first couple of hours of trading on the morning of nov r 9 2016 was a

republican d democrat over the years many articles and theories have been put forward regarding the stock market in relationship to presidential four year terms certainly lots of historical data exists on how the stock market typically performs in the first second third or final year of a president s term generally the final two years are better than the first two years the above shows that in the past 24 election years the s p 500 was positive in 20 or 83 per cent we caution all investors not to rely on historical data such as this to make investment decisions although the odds may lean toward these patterns continuing it s not a sound way to make investment decisions the purpose of this article is to give a few statistics as an additional factor to consider when making investment decisions there are too many other factors to consider in putting all the emphasis on historical patterns as a portfolio manager i think it is important to have an opinion on different topics such as real estate and politics if clients ask most of our clients over the last three or four years have asked for my comments about president donald trump in answering this question i feel i need to wear two hats or have two answers one involves my opinion as a portfolio manager and the second my opinion as an individual and father of two children trump often measures his success against how well the stock market has performed in his initial campaign he focused on certain economic policies some of his decisions with respect to trade protectionism and immigration were not necessarily good for the stock market other decisions he made have been positive for the stock market at least in the short term below are a few examples trump held no previous political office before this appointment and he has a natural dislike for regulations one of his campaign promises was the repeal of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act this act was passed into legislation in 2010 under the previous democrat administration largely to prevent another financial crisis as occurred in late 2008 and early 2009 in 2018 a bill passed that largely rolled back the main components of the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act this has been replaced with the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act in our opinion greater care has to be taken by individual investors to monitor the situation and to always be in a position to react quickly the previous democrat administration introduced environmental policies and regulations to help reduce carbon emissions protecting the environment has not been a priority for trump s administration when compared to previous administrations in both his campaigning and immediately upon taking office the president began to implement his america first energy plan the plan was to expand the development of low cost fossil fuels within the u s the idea was to work on drilling and extraction jobs and to achieve energy independence his administration also wants to revive the coal industry this plan essentially reverses all the work of the previous administration s climate action plan trump announced that the united states would be exiting the paris climate agreement he also signed a bill reducing the disclosure rules on energy companies while investors today may make more profits by investing in companies with fewer environment policies and regulations unfortunately future generations will be affected even more than our generation by environment decisions or lack thereof made today government debt should also be an area of concern for investors approximately 10 years ago the public debt of the united states was about 11 9 trillion at the end of 2019 the public debt of the united states was about 22 7 trillion in less than a decade the debt has nearly doubled this is an astonishing increase that should be of concern the common measure of success of an administration is often unfortunately based on immediate satisfaction such as the stock market job numbers gross domestic product gdp and other measures that are often short sighted breaking down gdp it is normally calculated by adding items such as personal and public consumption public and private investment and government spending it seems a little misguided to look at gdp too closely and ignore government debt when i talk to clients about this the reality is that if a government is choosing to spend money and go into further debt this normally stimulates the economy which in turn is normally good for the stock market in the short term however in my opinion politicians who focus only on today by running large deficits are doing so to stay in power and ignoring the long term consequence of throwing future generations under the bus as a portfolio manager it typically makes sense to stay invested in the short term if governments are stimulating the economy and running large deficits at some point this can t continue for today the public debt keeps getting swept under the carpet the federal reserve chairman has several responsibilities including promoting the goals of maximum employment stable prices and moderate long term interest rates the current chairman jerome powell was appointed by trump and confirmed by the senate the chairman is supposed to be independent the chairman adjusts interest rates to smooth out economic cycles not to create one big boom cycle the challenge is that when rates are already near historic lows then monetary policy becomes less effective in the future if they have little room to move lower it is largely known that presidents who want to focus on getting re elected will pressure the chairman to lower interest rates ever since trump appointed powell he has been pressuring him to lower rates to stimulate the economy typically interest rate cuts make it easier for corporations to borrow money which also makes them more profitable investors who have historically invested in bonds or gics may have to move more into lower risk equities to get a return greater than inflation so when interest rates are pushed lower the stock market usually moves upward and it is a stimulant for the economy as a portfolio manager looking at the current situation it is normally recommended to stay invested if rates are going to be pressured lower still 2020 will be an interesting year with the next u s election one thing for sure is that you ll want to keep a close watch on the markets both before the election and after kevin greenard cpa ca fma cfp cim

ksu earnings call for the period ending december 31 2019 kansas city southern ksu q4 2019 earnings call 8 45 a m et contents prepared remarks questions and answers call participants prepared remarks operator good morning and welcome to the kansas city southern q4 2019 earnings conference call i would now like to turn the conference over to pat ottensmeyer president and ceo please go ahead sir patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay thank you and good morning everyone welcome to our fourth quarter earnings review i ll just point you to the safe harbor statement in the presentation that has been posted and then also just a quick reference to the lineup for today same as you have seen in the last several quarters so i ll move to slide 5 hopefully everyone now has seen the press release we posted earlier today revenue increase of 5 versus last year led by strength in chemicals and petroleum and industrial consumer segments and of course mike naatz will get into much more detail in a few minutes on the revenue side of the business fourth quarter operating ratio as reported was 67 6 but that includes a number of items including 38 million of restructuring charges that mike upchurch will get into in more detail so really when we look at the adjusted operating ratio of 62 4 an improvement of 190 basis points versus last year and that includes the negative impact of 90 basis points due to the loss of the mexican fuel excise tax credit fourth quarter earnings per share of 1 30 again adjusting for restructuring charge and other items 1 82 which was an increase of 17 versus last year i made a comment here at the bottom of this slide about our implementation of psr that s clearly the headline story for 2019 very very pleased with the progress that we have made and believe that there is more to come so i ll leave that for jeff sameh and mike to get into a little bit more and then come back to at the end for some additional color commentary on that if we look at the fourth quarter again on an adjusted basis we did have a number of record performance levels in revenue adjusted operating income adjusted operating ratio and adjusted earnings per share moving to slide 6 probably one of the more meaningful data points in the conversation today about our outlook and you can see that volume volume growth revenue growth up a bit better than what we had previously guided i think the headline for 2020 for our outlook for 2020 is that we expect it to be better than 2019 in terms of volume and revenue we are also accelerating our guidance on operating ratio i think our previous guidance as you know had been the low end of the range of 60 to 61 by 2021 we re now moving that up a year we expect our operating ratio this year to be between 60 and 61 and then below 60 for 2021 eps outlook is mid teen growth for the longer term period out through three years and then finally capital expenditures we are now guiding to about 17 of revenue this year and then on into the next couple of years i ll just mention one other topic here that s not on the slide and that s our capital allocation announcement from november we announced an increase in the dividend a 2 billion share repurchase program over the next three years again mike upchurch will have some more detail about that in a few minutes with that i will turn the presentation over to jeff songer jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer okay thank you pat and good morning starting with the review of key operating metrics for the quarter on slide 8 velocity of 15 2 miles per hour improved 36 year over year and 9 sequentially dwell of 19 9 hours improved 23 year over year and 2 sequentially operations in our border region remained strong with volume growth of 8 for the quarter in the segment to date we have operated over 3 000 trains with international crews and we will expand our international crew base in 2020 which should allow the majority of kcs trains to operate with international crews over the laredo gateway additional improvements with customs processing and joint us mexico customs efforts will continue into 2020 turning to slide 9 we are very pleased with the continued progress supported by our psr initiatives significant gains in all key metrics were achieved in 2019 notably a 22 improvement in velocity and a 16 improvement in dwell we have provided 2020 targets on this slide and as indicated we have opportunities for continued strong improvement in our key metrics notably we expect to see significant improvements again in velocity through our focus on tsp reduction in equipment failures and resource management car miles per day will be an area of increased focus as we enter year 2 of psr this metric is reflective of both velocity and dwell and is a critical indicator for tracking the effectiveness of tsp changes and initiatives in our terminals to reduce dwell and car handlings sameh will provide additional detail on the specific psr initiatives for 2020 as highlighted last quarter fuel efficiency was the largest single line item cost reduction through our 2019 psr initiatives for the year we improved 4 and are planning an additional 5 improvement for 2020 regarding the 2020 capex outlook on slide 10 capex as a percent of revenue will decrease from 20 in 2019 to approximately 17 in 2020 the largest year over year change is the elimination of new locomotive purchases as we have no locomotive or equipment purchases planned for 2020 this year we will allocate some additional capex to expand our locomotive overhaul program in support of locomotive failure reduction initiatives as we are operating now with about 16 fewer locomotives our focus will increase on reliability of our remaining fleet it spend in 2020 will provide for innovation initiatives with modernization of our operations management control and erm systems additionally we are installing our first automated railcar inspection portal in mexico utilizing machine vision technology to analyze equipment health track speed this technology will support improved inspection quality and increase productivity for mechanical forces who will spend less time walking cars performing visual inspection and more time making repairs i would like to recognize the operating team for their efforts to make 2019 a success and i m confident that our operating improvements will continue into 2020 i will now turn the presentation over to sameh sameh fahmy executive vice president of precision scheduled railroading yeah thank you jeff and good morning like jeff said we are very proud of what the team has accomplished in 2019 and we are looking forward to a lot more to do in 2020 i have two slides so i m going to go over them fast and then we ll open it for questions later if you want more details on any of the items the first slide is what we have done in 2019 and how we laid the foundation going forward for psr for the coming years and then the second slide will be on the new initiatives that we are trying to complete in 2020 so the way we approach psr at kcs in 2019 we started by looking at the key things velocity and dwell and as an example velocity was running at about 11 miles per hour in mexico it was like 8 miles per hour 9 miles per hour in us maybe 12 miles per hour which are considerably lower than where they can be and the first task was to try to understand what s causing that so the typical thing is to look at delays was our trains are held outside yards or whether we have locomotive failures or any other reasons congestion and also we looked at deviations from the plan the plan itself had a lot of cushions off time yet it was not executed properly and we saw that when we visited slp san luis potosi so we looked at these things we looked also at inefficiencies across the functions like mechanical shops as an example and we sold at monterrey shop that had maybe two locomotives in it and a lot of staff we also engaged with suppliers with customers because we found as an example 600 cars in monterrey and the yard that are ready to go but waiting for the customer to accept them so we did a lot of work in that area we also looked at partner railroads particularly union pacific was very close to us and we shared trackage rights with them in the houston area after we looked at all that we started a disciplined execution with a great sense of urgency we re going against the clock and if you look at 2019 we really got going in earnest around july it took time to get going and to build the momentum and to really understand the network and the yards and new opportunities and to see where we are going hopefully in 2020 we re hitting the ground running like we were on operating calls on january 2 and we got going right away so in 2019 including q4 we implemented waves of service design changes four waves to consolidate manifest in intermodal trains we restructured supplier relationships there were things that were outsourced like labor in shops which should never be outsourced so we insourced that on the other hand material was insourced warehouses we outsourced that as an example we also made changes to management in operation to put solid people in the key positions like running the operation in mexico as an example and then we analyzed and we drilled down on every delay every day and that took us down quite a bit and we improved delays from 139 000 hours on an annual basis to 86 000 hours that s a reduction of 40 it was all that scrutiny every train and why did it go in the yard and set for 10 hours as an example as a result of all this we took out a lot of assets we took out locomotives 16 we took out cars 12 fuel efficiency improved 5 because of the longer heavier trains and the tonnage on them we reduced the cars online by 17 particularly foreign cars and that affected things like car hire which went down by 12 million in 2019 we also improved the locomotive the locomotive failures reduced by about 54 i mean when we reduced the fleet we took out about 200 old locomotives when you take 200 old locomotives we took the worst ones and by definition we improved in a disproportionate manner the failures and reduced the workload on shops the velocity dwell on car miles improved jeff covered that we also put a lot of emphasis on crew efficiencies and reduced overtime recrews deadheads you have all the numbers on the slide they are staggering 24 43 16 we also improved train length in mexico where we have put a lot of focus by 6 and the crewstarts went down by 7 all this improved service when you improve service you got customer confidence we are seeing it our revenue is growing we re winning back customers and mike naatz will be covering more on that on the commercial side so what are we going to do now in 2020 while we will continue the momentum and actually will accelerate it because like i said we did not waste any time during the christmas period we then stopped trains two days before and start days after we are watching the staff and we started in january right away and we had actually our first psr update the first week of january to make sure that all the initiatives are going so that we can get the savings as fast as as we can so the first thing the white boarding exercise which was pretty much completed at the end of 2019 but there is a phase iii that will take place this month we expect 15 reduction in crew events examples are saltillo area and i give that before so that three trains working in the saltillo area setting up cars and picking up cars one train will have all the manifest and intermodal for that area and the others will go through we are seeing already one mile per hour actually we re seeing two mile per hour increase in velocity in mexico the velocity like i said used to be 8 9 miles per hour well yesterday we had 15 miles per hour in mexico and by the way in the us we had 18 miles per hour so we re really getting there but we still are aiming for higher velocity we are doing less classifications less switching for a car but also we re doing the switching in the large yards like sanchez where we have a very large yard and in mexico city and set of these yards that you see on the map escobedo san luis potosi where the yards are really small and it s a lot tougher to classify there is going to be more asset take outs and more crew reductions we also started making an effort in the us which we finally are getting there and actually when you make efforts in us and you start taking out trains and crewstarts the benefit is disproportionately higher because of the the labor cost is much higher in us so we are doing one where we had train from intermodal you see that wylie on the map dallas cars were coming from ns and jackson from cm going all the way to wylie so going west come back east to freeport that s what you call out of route we are reducing that and we are taking out some trains there is going to be significant reduction in crew costs with that we re putting a lot of focus on crew management in 2020 much higher than in 2019 and we re looking at the pool a crew pool base in a place called leon which is north of monterrey where we are going to really stopping trains we have about 24 trains that stop every day at leon we re not going to stop them anymore because when you think about that if train makes it in 14 hours now instead of 36 hours because of the velocity of the network but leon need to change crews because we re allowed to run 16 hours in mexico with the same crew so that s a pool of about 145 people ok that we re going to do something about we re putting again emphasis on fuel we are at 1 31 gallons per kgtm this is very very high we have improved it a lot but we still have a lot of room to grow some other railroads i was associated with they have 1 0 so we have a lot of work there and the idea is to reduce the horsepower that you have on the train to be as low as possible compared to the tonnage we are going also to put some effort on the engineering side the maintenance of way where we have a lot of contractors we have about 300 fte equivalents of contractors that are supporting the production gangs while instead of that we re going to use our maintenance people who are on the same sub divisions when they have capital programs to do we use them between repairs instead of getting contractors and last the mechanical facilities obviously with the reduction in the fleet we have to start looking more at reducing shops and reducing line repair points for cars the slp shop two days ago the san luis potosi shop which is one of our largest ones had one locomotive two days ago and had a staff of 50 in that shop so there is room here and the last point streamlining the border operation we can talk more about that maybe in the question and answer period so i ll turn it now to mike naatz michael j naatz executive vice president and chief marketing officer hey thank you sameh and good morning everybody i d like to start my comments on page 15 our fourth quarter revenue was up 5 year over year on a 1 decline in volume and for the full year 2019 our 6 revenue growth and 1 volume decline fell within previously provided guidance of 5 to 7 revenue growth and flat to slightly declining volumes our revenue per unit was 6 higher during the quarter with positive pricing mix and fuel revenue favorably affecting our results fuel surcharge revenue increased about 9 million driven primarily by the rate increases associated with the loss of the mexico fuel excise tax credit which was partially offset by lower fuel prices our key themes remain consistent all year long very nice cross border growth led by our mexico energy reform volumes favorable pricing and mix and outstanding service improvements resulted in strong revenue and margin gains we are pleased to report that our customers are seeing the benefits of the psr initiatives both internal and external surveys highlight the same results and those are customers like our version of psr they ve experienced improvements in service and they want to move more freight on kcs our ability to handle growth efficiently without compromising service is a key goal of our psr implementation and these surveys provide valuable feedback that s important indicator that we are indeed heading in the right direction and now i would like to move on to our q4 business unit results beginning with chemical petroleum the chemical petroleum business unit experienced a 13 revenue increase and a 7 volume increase our mexico energy reform related revenue was up 43 on a 37 increase in volume we did note that this business remained relatively flat sequentially and found that this was largely due to the seasonality of our lpg volumes in fact looking at our refined products we note that they grew year over year and sequentially as additional storage capacity came online that being said we are monitoring softer overall demand in this segment on a full year basis the business delivered 85 and 90 volume and revenue growth respectively and this remains a great long term growth opportunity for us our industrial consumer revenue grew by 11 on a 5 increase in volume we saw strong military shipments and continued favorability in our metal business which resulted primarily from shifting sourcing patterns our ag min volumes rose slightly in q4 we saw lower revenue due to mix impacts and tougher 2018 caps i would like to note however that we continue to see healthy cross border growth in this segment with service improvement supporting our key franchise customers our energy volumes were up slightly on lower revenues this segment is a mixed bag seeing strong utility coal performance being offset by lower frac sand and crude business looking forward we are monitoring some upticks in crude volumes and changes to the overall crude market our intermodal segment volumes were down 5 contributing to a 1 decline in revenue our cross border intermodal volumes remain positive delivering a very nice 12 year over year growth it s our us and domestic markets that remain challenged due to truck availability and pricing pressures as expected in our automotive segment our automotive volumes were down driven by lower plant production levels this was more than offset by positive pricing fuel and mix impacts which actually resulted in a 4 year over year increase in revenue moving on to page 16 we are providing our 2020 revenue outlook as pat mentioned we are expecting low single digit volume growth and mid single digit revenue growth and as you can see we have a positive outlook for approximately 70 of our revenue portfolio with the remaining 30 of the portfolio expected to be neutral our chemical petroleum segment will continue to see strong growth led by refined product exports to mexico in addition we do expect plastic volumes to benefit from new production out of sasol lake charles facility and growth in plastic exports into mexico we are keeping an eye on trends in the broader petrochemical market including potential saturation and shifts in global demand we see steady demand and cycle time improvements contributing to a positive outlook in our ag min business our industrial consumer business unit will benefit from changes in metal sourcing patterns as well as easy 2019 comps in forest products our intermodal revenue is expected to be neutral with continued growth in our cross border franchise segment being somewhat offset by us and mexico domestic volumes again pricing and truck availability pressures persist although we do believe that they ve bottomed out there are two key drivers of performance in our energy segment the first being utility coal which is expected to be flat year over year and we actually view this favorably considering the strong year over year growth we saw in 2019 secondly as i mentioned earlier we ve seen a recent uptick in canadian crude shipments and continuation of favorable spreads may provide an upside to our 2020 crude outlook we expect our automotive revenue to be neutral acknowledging some downward pressure on volumes our pricing mix and new plant volumes will have a favorable revenue impact we are monitoring estimates indicating lower automotive exports to the us from our kcsm served plants and lower auto imports into lazaro cardenas and finally as you know trade developments and economic conditions remain top of mind in 2020 it can be difficult to predict the developments in these areas and our revenue estimates of course may be positively or negatively impacted by changes in this area we are however optimistic we just think that given continued mixed economic signals we feel that an element of caution is prudent i for one i m happy to see that usmca is almost behind us and that should provide us some favorable benefits in the future and with that i ll turn things over to our cfo mike upchurch michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer thanks mike and good morning everyone i m going to start my comments on slide 18 the fourth quarter results highlighted on this slide have been previously covered in this presentation but i just simply want to highlight that once again the combination of record fourth quarter revenues and strong cost controls led outstanding financial performance 5 revenue growth and 11 growth in adjusted operating income grow 74 adjusted incremental margins our adjusted operating ratio of 62 4 was 190 basis points improvement despite a negative impact to ror of approximately 90 basis points resulting from the loss of the ieps tax credit reported eps was 1 30 while adjusted eps of 1 82 grew 17 i will also note that tax and other below operating income items are impacting our adjusted earnings per share this quarter we ve provided you a reconciliation on slide 25 in the appendix but let me talk about a couple of the key components here first equity in earnings from affiliates and other income and expense declined by 6 million or 0 04 per share primarily from a non recurring loss that our affiliate ftvm recorded from the cancellation of the mexico city airport project interest expense from the new notes that we issued in november drove a 0 03 year over year reduction to 4q eps we also realized a 0 06 year over year benefit from a reduction to share count as i will discuss in a moment increasing shareholder returns is a key focus for the company going forward and then finally a decrease in our fourth quarter adjusted effective tax rate to 24 9 resulted in an 0 08 benefit primarily from a 7 million tax benefit that we received as a result of the extension of the short line track maintenance credit which was enacted in late december was retroactively react enacted so that we saw benefit of 3 5 million for 2018 and 3 5 million for 2019 for a total of 7 million this credit will also be available to us in the future through 2022 along with this credit and favorable changes to gilti tax offset by the loss of the mexican fuel excise tax credit we expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 28 over the next few years and we ve provided a few more details on taxes back in the appendix on slide 32 turning to slide 19 you will see that improvements we are making to our operations are driving significant and structural improvements to our p l as sameh discussed we continue to make excellent progress on our psr initiatives and we are once again able to provide a positive update to our estimated psr savings in aggregate we are now expecting annualized psr savings by 2021 to be approximately 125 million comprised of 58 million of realized savings in 2019 an incremental 61 million of savings in 2020 and a 6 million carry forward impact into 2021 covering each one of these line items briefly comp and benefits we expect 15 million of reductions in 2020 primarily from labor efficiencies including changes to service design that we made during our white boarding effort fleet reductions and mexican labor negotiations depreciation is expected to benefit by 4 million as a result of the reduced locomotive and railcar fleet fuel expense as sameh commented lots of opportunity we expect that to decline by 21 million from gains and efficiency as we focus on hpt assignment compliance further investments in technology and cross border fueling strategies in the equipment area we expect to benefit by 17 million from improvement in car cycle times and we will continue to optimize our car portfolio to align with improved network performance finally purchased services and materials and other is expected to benefit by 4 million during the quarter we did incur a 38 3 million impairment charge related to psr that is comprised of 27 million related to locomotives 5 million related to freight cars 5 million related to parts inventory and the remainder resulting from contract restructuring and i might note that we would expect the fourth quarter of 2019 to be the end of our psr impairments turning to slide 20 our adjusted operating expenses increased 2 the largest driver of this increase was a loss of the mexican fuel excise tax credit which resulted in a 11 million year over year increase in opex without that increase we would have seen our expenses down 2 million despite higher fx and incentive comp the remaining drivers in the year over year variance are primarily comprised of fuel and comp and ben which i ll cover on the next slide i d also like to take this opportunity to provide just a couple of reference points on 2020 expenses we do expect depreciation expense to increase mid single digits driven by a larger asset base the full year impact of new locomotives purchased in 2019 and the purchase of leased locomotives which we just completed in early january and that will be partially offset by savings from psr impairments and then with respect to interest expense we did raise some money in the market in november and we would expect our interest expense to go up approximately 20 million year over year turning to slide 21 comp and benefits expense increased 7 driven by wage and benefit inflation incentive comp in sourcing and fx these increases were partially offset by a 6 million reduction driven by lower headcount and work hours our lower headcount and work hours are the result of train consolidations reducing crewstarts hours worked overtime recrews and deadheads along with mechanical reductions due to a smaller fleet and some optimization of certain g a functions our quarterly average headcount was down 2 which excludes the in sourcing of one fte contractors fuel expense declined 9 as reductions to fuel price and improvements to fuel efficiency more than offset an increase in the consumption from higher gross ton miles and foreign exchange and finally turning to slide 22 i want to cover capital allocation highlights free cash flow was up 504 in 2019 we also increased our shareholder returns a 118 driven primarily by higher share repurchases including the accelerated share repurchase program that we announced in november kcs also announced in november a new capital allocation policy meant to help shareholders understand how the company plans to allocate its cash generated from operations and our targeted leverage ratio going forward as jeff discussed earlier in the presentation we continue to believe that investing in our network particularly our cross border network is important as those investments drive returns well in excess of our cost of capital going forward we expect to allocate approximately 40 to 50 of our available cash to capital projects and strategic investments that will help support that growth we also expect to allocate 50 to 60 of our available cash to shareholder returns primarily in the form of share repurchases and a modest dividend we also expect to maintain our debt to ebitda ratio in the low two range by prudently using our balance sheet capacity to execute our share repurchase program and with that i ll turn the call back over to pat patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay thanks while hopefully we ve shared some really good information in detail a little bit more forthcoming with guidance information than perhaps you ve seen in the past i guess my summary comment might be something like what a difference a year makes i looked back at our transcript from the fourth quarter call one year ago on january 18 of 2019 and we talked about some of you will remember this we talked about our performance for 2018 which on a number of levels wasn t horrible but we talked in terms of a year that did not meet our own expectations a year that certainly didn t meet our customers and shareholders expectations and the need to do some things differently to get back into a position where we could take advantage of the growth opportunities that we we had a high degree of confidence was there in front of us and i ll go back to one of the points i had on my initial slide which is our implementation of psr initiatives has exceeded our expectations at this point and hopefully the message that you hear today is that there is more to come fahmy gave you some pretty good detail of the things we are doing the level of detail the level of intensity and focus that sameh has brought to the entire organization this is a cross functional effort that i feel is being done in a way that involves a large number of people across functions throughout the company us and mexico and it s being done with a high level of intensity a high level of learning that s going on institutionalizing into the company and i feel is the recipe that s going to allow us to sustain this performance further improve it in 2020 and sustain it well into the future certainly the resolution of usmca which mike touched on is a positive we ll probably get questions about the magnitude of that and what to expect and it s very difficult to quantify but it s certainly is a positive it removes a very significant cloud of uncertainty for us and there is fairly high expectations in mexico that resolving usmca is going to provide a boost to the economy in mexico which certainly would be a welcome occurrence for us as you know our mantra with psr was service begets growth we have seen a phenomenal a very extraordinary improvement in service and it is working out that we are winning customers back as sameh mentioned a year ago we said on a couple of earnings calls that there was more business for us to handle than we were able to handle because our service was not up to standard we have gotten a lot of that maybe most of that back we re gaining market share and we still have a high conviction in the new business opportunities that we see particularly cross border opportunities that we see in 2020 and beyond so we feel very good about where we are but by no means do i want to convey that we feel like we re ready to say mission accomplished there is more to come and as you saw from mike s slides the psr benefits will continue to grow and accelerate and we feel that again as for the reasons i had covered earlier that these will be sustainable in the future beyond 2020 with that i will open the call for questions questions and answers operator thank you we will now begin the question and answer session today s first question comes from allison landry of credit suisse please go ahead ms allison your line is open allison landry credit suisse analyst sorry thanks good morning thanks so i just wanted to start with the top line growth mid single digits sounds like about half of volume half come from yields so is there a way to think about the yield assumption and what s underlying in terms of your expectations for core price versus mix i guess sort of more focused on mix and you ve had some positive benefit in 2019 so just curious to think through that cadence michael j naatz executive vice president and chief marketing officer good morning allison this is mike naatz i guess i d look at it a couple of different ways the first is we continue to believe that we ll be able to generate inflation plus pricing which will certainly help us from the revenue perspective and then in terms of mix we expect our chemical petroleum business unit to continue to be our fastest growing segment and that tends to have a higher revenue per unit so that should also provide a benefit to us allison landry credit suisse analyst okay and then just turning to capex at 17 of the top line i think you mentioned some spending on locomotive overhaul this year is there is that the potential to scale that back further and what do you think is really the longer term sweet spots for capex without having to sacrifice growth jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer hey allison this is jeff yeah i think we re looking at this and as we mentioned operating with significant significantly fewer locomotives we are shifting a bit on reliability and some of that capex is probably a little bit of an increased level of spend and focusing on the reliability of our existing fleet which supports a continued velocity and service improvements we ll see so we re going to continue to do that there is opportunity to bring that in probably a little bit lower than 17 although we continue to look at some couple of business opportunities i didn t mentioned all the projects we re looking at this year and then the long term guidance as pat provided the 17 range just from a longer term at least from our the outlook that we provided here i think i think we feel pretty good with that which is a pretty significant reduction from where we ve been historically as you know operator our next question today comes from chris wetherbee of citi please go ahead chris wetherbee citigroup analyst hey thanks good morning over the last year or so you guys have given us sort of a nice walk to what we could potentially see in terms of operating ratio improvement relative to the psr progress or initiatives that you ve undertaken you ve now had a few quarters to kind of really dig in and sameh you ve been very instrumental and had helped to explain that quite well i guess when you think about sort of the bigger picture how would you rank the company relative to maybe some of the peers is there the potential to be more competitive with sort of mid 50s ors over the longer run outside of maybe the next year or two or should we just be thinking about this is sort of a sub 60 type of opportunity that may be a little bit smaller in nature just want to get a sense of maybe how you guys are thinking about the big picture opportunity to psr over a multi year period michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer yeah chris i ll take a stab at that let s take it a year or two at a time i don t know that we re in a position to declare victory on an operating ratio based on the guidance that we have for this year and next year we just continue to look for every opportunity we can to get better and more efficient and focus on cost and asset utilization and then as we ve talked in the past the volume growth the leverage in this business is phenomenal so we get back into a situation where we start to see some volume growth and we we re continuing to improve the way we run and efficiency of the operation of we certainly could see further improvement beyond the guidance that we provided today chris wetherbee citigroup analyst okay all right that s helpful and then maybe just a detailed point as we think about 2020 can you give us a sense of maybe how headcount could trend obviously it was down sequentially as we moved into the fourth quarter it sounds like there is some incremental initiatives happening particularly in mexico but maybe beginning in the us that could see maybe that reduced further just any cadence that we can think about for 2020 would be helpful patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer i think we ll see opportunities at some of the things that sameh talked about particularly in mexico as we we get into phase 2 of the tsp the whiteboarding exercise we start to realize the benefits that that that s going to produce and then it will really depend on our volume performance i mean that s i know that when you look at some of the headcount totals for us compared to the other particularly other recent psr railroads there is a gap but you also look at the volumes we have not had the the drop off in volumes that some of the other railroads have had and so we are on our toes and we will we will make adjustments based on the outlook but we don t want to short heat ourselves sameh has some color sameh fahmy executive vice president of precision scheduled railroading yeah i mean if i may add like pat said the revenue is growing the volume is actually are looking good too in which case in which case while not in the same situation as other psr implementations but also we are not looking at we re looking at the money at the end of the day not necessarily the headcounts and you know when you look at crews as an example if you don t call let me don t pay them okay so we have been doing a lot of that already in 2019 and we re going to do a lot more of that actually in 2020 now if we make a breakthrough agreement with labor then not only we don t call them then we can just get in net reduction like i talked about some pools crew pools crew basis where we don t need people period now we can reduce the headcount but in the interim we actually don t pay don t pay the money except for some benefits so that s that s something that to think about the brakeman issue that we talked about often we have four men crews we don t really need the extra two guys okay so that one if we do a labor agreement that would be significant that would be hundreds of people there are areas like i mentioned in engineering and the maintenance of way where we are going to take out contractors now when i take out contractors it s not going to show as a staff reduction at the same time it actually will take out a lot of money because i will be using the maintenance people in engineering in a far more productive and effective way to fill in the production gangs instead of the contractors so we ve also did some insourcing by the way last year significant insourcing like i said labor in locomotive shops now that increases the headcount but it it s really saved us like one move alone saved us 4 million a year so we at the end of the day we are not hung up on headcounts we are focused on the money and as a rule we don t want any area to increase in cost from 2019 to 2020 when we reviewed the budgets we are very strict on that everything has to be equal or lower in this way when the revenue goes up by whatever 5 to whatever the number is then it s all it all goes to the bottom line so i hope i answered i gave a bit more color to this michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer hey chris mike upchurch i m interested any real quick comment about your operating ratio if you look at 2018 we re 64 3 finished at 63 2 110 basis point improvement but when you consider the ieps headwind that we had in the year you re up 230 basis points improvement in operating ratio and that s in a down 1 volume environment just think when we get volume back and revenue grows better than it did in the fourth quarter there is a lot of leverage and we had a incremental margin of almost 75 operator our next question today comes from tom wadewitz of ubs please go ahead tom wadewitz ubs analyst yes good morning sameh or jeff i wanted to i think you talked a little bit about union impact and there is opportunity for headcount or costs reduction in mexico can you just give a little more perspective on how much of a constraint the current union agreement is or if you ve made any changes that give you greater flexibility i think all of you referred to that area you re taking people out north of monterrey is there any kind of union constraint there or are you pretty much free to make the changes as you re able to jeffrey m songer executive vice president and chief operating officer yeah this is jeff as sameh mentioned again our primary focus is cost and i think we ve done a good job with as we re reducing train starts and those things you re seeing the cost come out some of the larger opportunities we see with headcount are somewhat union and labor dependent in mexico and most of this talk is centered around mexico we continue to work on these things we have not yet achieved the large scale work rule reduction that we continue to work on such as eliminating third and fourth brakeman on a lot of these trains however i would point we re not wholly dependent on the union our engineering forces in mexico for 2019 we actually were able to reduce that by 5 solely through attrition and so we re continuing to work on those things we re continuing to look at attrition based reductions contractor based reductions as sameh said and continuing to work with the union on larger deals but also i would classify such as independent crew change locations if we can eliminate one you re going to reduce the amount of crews needed to run for example between sanchez and benjamin mendez by almost 50 so we think we re going to continue to get some quicker or smaller wins with the union while continuing to work on the larger work rule opportunities that we have tom wadewitz ubs analyst okay so it sounds like the right way to understand it also is that if you can t reduce the headcount you just pay less because you don t people have fewer trips so it s not you could get additional savings a three or four person crew is going lower but it doesn t sound like you re constrained in terms of some of the other things you re doing is that a fair way to understand it sameh fahmy executive vice president of precision scheduled railroading like jeff said a lot of what we are doing now is actually assuming that even if we don t make a breakthrough even if we don t make one agreement what can we do on our own ok and the example he gave a train with start instead of adding locomotives in leon and wasting time and changing crews and all that which is just north of monterrey to go all the way south to a place called benjamin mendez to over the grades while we re going to run these locomotives from sanchez in north ok and dp those distributed power and this way we are not going to stop and we re not going to add locomotives and we re not going to call crews and we re not going to pay crews so there are things that we can do on our own and we started doing them and we are reducing more and more our reliance on that base now at the same time we spent three hours yesterday trying to structure an agreement with the union and with detail like how can we move these people maybe to benjamin mendez and how we don t want to taxi them and stuff like that making arrangements win win if you like because that s the preferred way obviously and we feel good about that like we feel that the union is really wanting also to work with us so hopefully we ll also make agreements with the union operator and our next question today comes from justin long at stephens please go ahead justin long stephens analyst thanks and good morning so last year you provided the psr savings as you began implementation and the estimates just kept moving higher throughout the year as you were working through the financial impact at the same time you were making these operational changes are we to the point now where you re far enough along in the process that you feel pretty good that this 125 million run rate is an accurate reflection of the total psr opportunity or are there still incremental initiatives operationally that are going in 2020 and 2021 that aren t getting factored into that estimate that could drive upside michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer yeah justin this is mike good question and you re right we just continued throughout last year to find more and more opportunities and i would expect that we ll continue to be able to find new opportunities as we continue down this path we feel very good about the 125 million and at this point in time that s where we think we re going to end up but certainly there is not going to be a lack of trying here to do a lot better than that justin long stephens analyst okay michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer i might just say it s a snapshot of where we feel we re at at this point in time but one of the things that and you picked up some of this just with some of the examples that sameh gave we re just focused on everything we do and i don t think we ll ever say that we re finished with this we we ll just kind of keep as sameh likes to say peeling the onion and when we knock some of these things down and put the money in the bank we ll continue to look at them and just make this over the longer period of time sort of a continuous improvement exercise justin long stephens analyst okay that makes sense and secondly i wanted to ask about the volume outlook so you gave the guidance for mid single digit growth this year but is there any color you can provide on the quarterly cadence of that growth are you expecting mid single excuse me low single digit growth and kind of each quarter this year and as you answer that would love to get your take on how truckload conversions are progressing and if that s something that s factored into that guidance as well michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer well i think that we re likely to see some continued softness here certainly things with the my expectation is things would be more favorable in the second portion of the year with respect to your truckload question we do see plenty of capacity out there still we do see that rates continue to be depressed or suppressed on that front and so that makes it a little more challenging for us to do conversions however i did mention earlier that i think that pricing has hit bottom and as that recovers then we expect to see things moving back to the rail or being able to move share to the railroad operator our next question today comes from scott group of wolfe research please go ahead scott group wolfe research analyst hey thanks good morning guys so i just want to first clarify just a couple of things on the guidance pat in your opening comments you said that you thought revenue growth was better going to be better in 2020 than 2019 and then mike i know you said there were some one time things in other income other equity maybe if you can just give us some guidance on how you expect those to be in 2020 patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay i can take the guidance one you know the below the line items that we incurred in the fourth quarter i went through each one of those but equity in earnings we took a 0 04 hit in the quarter that was predominantly the loss associated with the mexico airport project cancellation of one of our affiliates we believe that we are done with that and we should have favorable comps going forward so we re not going to provide a specific number for you there because we have three or four entities that roll into that line item so it gets a little bit complex but i don t think you should see the pressure in that line item that you did in 2019 we also had 0 03 higher interest expense in the fourth quarter as a result of the borrowing that we did to buyback shares that s a net accretive transaction for us so you have to consider the share count reduction that we re getting there but i did also comment that we would expect to see a 20 million increase in interest expense in 2020 i think those cover the two primary below the line items michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer scott i guess maybe i misspoke a little bit but just when i look at revenue and volume outlook for 2020 in general we feel that 2020 is going to be stronger than 2019 but i wasn t intending to give specific guidance relative to what you see on that chart for our previous guidance provided in 2019 so i ll thank you for allowing me to clear that up operator and our next question today comes from amit malhotra of deutsche bank please go ahead amit malhotra deutsche bank analyst thanks congrats on all the success in 2019 mike i just wanted to follow up on the commentary around incremental margins that you mentioned earlier the implied if i just look at the revenue and or expectations for 2020 the implied incremental margin is closer to 100 that s obviously impressive it makes sense but if we back out the 61 million of productivity that you called out the organic incremental if i can if i can say it that way is around it s pretty much exactly 50 so is that the right way to think about the structural kind of structural leverage opportunity at the company once you guys are kind of at this 125 run rate or even greater i m just trying to understand like what s the right run rate beyond all the changes that you re making michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer yeah no good question incremental margins obviously were dependent not only on cost reductions but revenue growth where we get a 70 or so pull through on the incremental volume and then pricing so we kind of stayed away from giving any kind of specific incremental margin going forward but my comment earlier that we saw a pretty nice or improvement set aside the ieps for a second 230 basis points and a 1 down volume here if you start seeing low single digit growth we should be able to certainly achieve that and perhaps a bit better operator our next question today comes from allison poliniak of wells fargo please go ahead allison poliniak wells fargo analyst hi guys good morning so obviously well down the path of these psr opportunities i mean as you kind of look over sort of the past year and going forward as you peel back the onion as you spoke to before where do you see sort of the greatest benefit opportunity or surprised recently sameh fahmy executive vice president of precision scheduled railroading well i would say that the the largest opportunity is in crews crew management and it s not just the crew pools and but everything i see it it was crews like taxis something we call arbitraries in mexico like all these bonuses that we pay for extra hours and over time and length of train and stuff like that so crew is a big opportunity fuel is a big opportunity we spent 300 million on fuel and like i said you know we are at 1 31 in 2019 we are aiming at 1 24 gallons per kgtm in 2020 but that is still that is still a lot of opportunity and we are watching that now daily train by train the same way as we were watching delays we re watching the hpt the horsepower on trains and we also when i said we have signed we made some management changes we have put one of our best most promising young people nick klein we put him in charge of locomotive management and crews and he is delivering big time already and he is watching that horsepower or ton quite a bit we also move fuel under operation which is another move we made so we did some management and structure changes so fuel is important crews are important and cars are still we are still heavy on cars and you look at our car miles per day still a high number especially i mean a low number especially in mexico we went from 70 miles day to 100 miles per day which is a significant improvement 100 miles per day is very very inadequate and there is room to improve we have some car leases that we re going to return some significant ones in 2020 and that was part of the psr savings that mike talked about so to summarize the answer your question crews fuel and cars i would say these are still big opportunities we still have opportunities in locomotives we have big opportunities in engineering because we have not touched that last year that s the maintenance of way big big opportunities in engineering and actually brought one of the guys who are on my team a retired gentlemen who was chief track at one of the railroads i was associated with for a long time he was on my team for 10 years and he is now helping us here and actually this week is on a gang watching the work equipment on the productivity of the gang the engineering gang and there is huge potential there too operator so our next question today comes from ken hoexter of bank of america please go ahead ken hoexter bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning mike or pat maybe just some more thoughts on mexico growth you mentioned some slowing industrial economy out there i guess in contrast to the low single digit volume growth and mst revenue growth can you talk about energy reform and the decelerating cross border revenue growth and then on the trade agreement is there anything negative on auto production we should expect out of usmca patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer so i guess looking at the second part of your question from the automotive perspective no we re not necessarily seeing anything negative coming out of usmca that would affect the automotive segment with respect to the first portion of your question we ve been saying that refined products growth will slow over time just because of the comps get tougher year over year but the mexico economy has been a little bit soft to the extent that that has implications on fuel consumption that s really what we re monitoring operator our next question today comes from brian ossenbeck of jpmorgan please go ahead brian ossenbeck jpmorgan analyst hey good morning thanks for taking the question sameh one more for you on fuel you look at that being the biggest expense improvement bucket here this year and next do you think that could be the same thing when you look at getting to the sub 60 or in 2021 i just wanted to hear some of your thoughts versus the peers and the benchmarking you re doing there what is structural versus what do you think is just getting more focus from the management side that you mentioned or maybe even improving some of the equipment and efficiency there sameh fahmy executive vice president of precision scheduled railroading very good question from a structural point of view the grades in mexico are extremely steep very very steep and that obviously is not good for fuel efficiency so even though i use 1 0 as kind of a benchmark there is a limit as to how far we can go because of that the topography if you like of mexico so that is a structural limitation if you like i never accounted exactly how low we can go in that gallons per kgtm all i can say is that there is definitely room to go beyond the 1 24 which is a target for 2020 some of the stuff we ll do is like that i talked a lot about hpt the horsepower per ton but there are also technologies ok that are partially deployed on kcs they were deployed extensively on the railroad i was associated with before coming here and my second railroad if you like and we have we have those that software and hardware deployed on many of our locomotives will continue deploying you know like trip optimizer which does cruise control and avoids you know the acceleration and braking which is really bad for fuel but there is also something really important on top of trip optimizer which is called smart hpt which we used a lot in what i wasn t deployed it aggressively actually week by week on locomotives what i was and we are attempting the same thing here that not only will calibrate how many locomotives are on a train and you know if you shut down one of the three locomotives because you have empties heading back as an example but actually it will it will actually allow you to even fluctuate the horsepower based on the traffic you pick up so the tonnage increases or we set out traffic the tonnage decreases so during a trip it will actually allow you to go up and down and i that kind of technology also is going to help us a lot so there are lot of things happening obviously the service design helps a lot these long trains mix with manifest and intermodal and automotive make it also very very efficient for fuel efficiency so i can t answer your question with precision as to exactly what is my theoretical best is it is it 1 1 is it 1 07 i don t know the exact number but all i can say is that it should be better than the 1 24 which we are aiming for this year which is quite an improvement compared to the 1 31 operator and our next question today comes from brandon oglenski of barclays please go ahead brandon oglenski barclays analyst okay good morning everyone so can you guys expand a little bit more in the new capital allocation policy because i feel that could be pretty significant looking forward and maybe just in the context of historically you guys have call out maybe incremental volume opportunity that the industry didn t see so you guys would spend a little bit more does that mean that maybe growth could be able to bit less or is this just more of being more efficient with what you have still leveraging those opportunities looking forward michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer well brandon this is mike i don t know that there s much more that we would expand on on the capital allocation policy i know there might be a desire for us to give you exactly what the three year cash flow numbers look like but i assume your models allow you to do some projections there given the guidance that we ve given around revenue this year and longer term or and eps guidance but i think the point that you should take away is that our focus has shifted from more capex relative to shareholder distributions to more shareholder distributions than capex and that should be viewed as favorable in light of the kind of increase that you saw in free cash flow here we ll probably just stick with the guidance that we ve given here and the other question if i understand the other question the other part of your question i wouldn t read anything into our capital allocation targets or strategy that would suggest we re de emphasizing core capex that will drive growth we think the efficiencies that we are realizing and we ll continue to improve with psr in terms of asset track capacity yard capacity we factored that into our capex targets but if we have extraordinary growth opportunities in the future that require investment we are perfectly happy and willing to make those invest operator and our next question today comes from jordan alliger of goldman sachs please go ahead jordan alliger goldman sachs analyst yeah hi good morning just a quick question your psr initiatives they re obviously going very well i m just sort of curious are there any areas of the psr rollout that may be more of a challenge than you thought and then are all phases not the dollar amount but the actual phases of the rollout generally on track from a timing standpoint i think if i remember reading you might be up to phase 3 or something in january but anyway just curious your thoughts thanks sameh fahmy executive vice president of precision scheduled railroading alli the whiteboarding has gone very very well you know there is always adjustments obviously like we had a train which is a long haul for us from lazaro in mexico on the pacific all the way to laredo in us and it had a lot of traffic on it we re making a lot of stops in many yards and initially were a bit concerned about it but that s part of watching that we do every morning and we noticed where the delays are and there have been some tuning some adjustments some stuff from the look at san luis potosi and so it s it never really finishes the exercise i mean you do the big portion of it and then you keep tuning it and tuning it but the whiteboarding has been going extremely well and we see it we see it in the velocity of the network in mexico we would have drinked in february or january 15 miles per hour have never dreamed in february or march like i said the network was running at 59 mph so the results are good so the whitebording is going well the car hire and reducing the car fleet is going well the fuel efficiency is ok the service and revenue and pat always mentioned that and keep that always in mind that our model is adjusted for the reality of kcs and that means mexico it means some tight yards means potential for good revenue that has been going very well to the area that is challenging very frankly is the labor agreements on crews and like i said we have we have our way of getting the most of the savings even if we don t get labor agreements we are just going to adjust so the current rules if we have to and maximize operator and today s final question comes from bascome majors of susquehanna financial group please go ahead bascome majors susquehanna financial group analyst thanks and good morning guys you mike if you look back 5 to 10 years ago you were dropping 8 to 10 of revenues to free cash flow if i look at your guidance today it looks like that s probably going to be closer to 20 going forward based on your expectations so just dramatic improvement there i know it s kind of been addressed but i was hoping you could expand on this a little more i mean part of that improvement in the coming years is that the rolling stock holiday both locomotives and railcars can you talk about where you are based on your growth trends looking at up to three years perhaps further and where do you think you might start to get tight for speed on railcars or locomotives thanks michael w upchurch executive vice president chief financial officer that s a great question we don t have any plans right now for incremental locomotive purchases i d love to see us get out of this industrial recession that i think we ve seen here in the us and start growing volumes again then we ll begin to think about that we ve part net i think 169 locomotives all of that s old technology i don t know that there would be a lot of retirements that would be immediate in our next couple of years but i d probably say locomotives may be the place that we would look to before freight cars but it s hard to predict what s going to happen over the next three years operator thank you this concludes the question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to pat ottensmeyer for any closing remarks patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer okay thank you thanks everyone for joining us just a couple of things that as you may pick up on on that final question and something that sameh said just a couple of minutes ago about the way we are approaching this and i would say that we have been intentionally going about some of these changes whether it s asset impairments locomotives freight cars and i think many of you have probably heard the example of our green fleet where we saw significant just extraordinary improvement in cycle times freed up a lot of cars and we made a decision to hold on to those cars rather than scrap them as quickly as might have been otherwise possible because we felt that there was an opportunity for us to grow that business and to gain market share and lo and behold that did happen and it takes a while for those customers particularly customers that are under contracts for some period of time to come back but we re very very conscious very careful as we go about these changes to make sure that it doesn t have the effect of limiting our growth down the road and as i said a few minutes ago yes our capex targets and capex numbers are coming down but please don t read that as in anyway being unwilling or unable to ramp up and make capital investments core capex investments if there are growth opportunities that we think are really attractive to us so i again i just reiterate where we started we feel very very good about where we are and believe that there is more to come we also continue to be confident and optimistic about some of the growth opportunities particularly cross border growth opportunities are in front of us the removal of the dark cloud of uncertainty with usmca i think will be helpful over the long term certainly the way we are going about our psr transformation with sameh working broadly cross functional cross border with a very large number of people within the company there s a lot of excitement lot of enthusiasm as we go about this and i think there are very very high expectations that there are more good results ahead of us so thanks for your time and attention here final comment go chiefs the new americas team 2 o clock on sunday and we ll talk to you in about three months thank you everyone operator duration 77 minutes call participants patrick j ottensmeyer president and chief executive officer jeffrey m songer executive

the first quarter started off in the wrong direction and then picked up speed global stock markets lost an incredible 2 trillion in just four days immediately buffeted by serious geopolitical events as well as the plunge in oil prices the u s stock market dropped 11 percent in just six weeks only to recover that loss in the next six weeks it was the sharpest snapback since 1933 simply stomach churning as always economic data produces a mixed picture on the positive side consumer confidence is up and gdp growth in q4 was revised upward the homes sector is mostly good with prices up 5 4 percent nationally with pending home sales up 5 1 percent housing starts up 5 2 percent with only 4 4 months supply of homes in inventory and housing permits down 3 1 percent inventory looks constrained which should be good for home prices on the negative side while personal income was up wages were down the other components of personal income rental income interest income and transfer payments were up but not wages wages did increase 0 3 percent last month in addition orders for durable goods and inventory investment are both down while the leading indicator index was up mildly last month it has been trending down since mid 2015 on the double edge side inflation is up within reason this is good both the core cpi and the core pce deflator are around 2 percent this increases the probability the fed will increase interest rates however capacity utilization has decreased to 76 7 percent the lowest in 30 months since 80 percent is the traditional point where inflation increases this reading decreases the probability the fed will increase rates in addition americans have increased their savings rate to 5 4 percent the highest in three years it is good their household balance sheets are improving but bad that they re not buying things as consumer consumption is roughly 70 percent of gdp at a course on economic data in d c a few years ago one speaker said when in doubt just look at the employment data the american worker we have produced an average of 209 000 jobs each month during q1 the unemployment rate edged up to 5 percent the labor force participation rate edged up to 63 percent as 400 000 more workers returned to the improving job market the u 6 unemployment rate of the unemployed under employed and marginally attached workers part timers also edged up to 9 8 percent digging deeper the manufacturing sector has lost 1 5 million jobs since 2009 and continues to lose another 29 000 last month despite a rise in the ism manufacturing report the service sector is now over 70 percent of gdp the american labor market is definitely strong and getting stronger the question becomes if the labor market is so strong why is gdp growth so low the american stock market with the dow up 1 5 percent during q1 the s p was up 0 8 percent while the nasdaq was down 2 7 percent that sounds so unremarkable but it was really quite amazing two months ago analysts were predicting the dollar would rise and gold would fall due to the fed raising interest rates instead the opposite happened with the dollar falling 3 98 percent while gold rose 16 percent the most in 30 years oil was predicted to continue to fall probably into the 20 per barrel range and drag the stock market down with it when oil went down the stock market went down despite overwhelming evidence of an oversupply oil prices actually increased 3 51 percent during q1 while the pundits were perfectly logical they were also perfectly wrong global markets argentina is arguably the sickest economy in the americas yet its stock market was up 15 5 percent shanghai is arguably the most tightly managed stock market in the world yet its stock market was down 15 1 percent go figure how we re managing it with the odds of recession at 25 percent or less we will remain fully invested with the relatively sound economy continuing consumer discretionary stocks should continue to benefit with the increased terrorist threat the increased misery of flying reduces the attractiveness of airline stocks which have already had a good run while the carnage in the oil patch is not over the relatively insulated master limited partnerships have been overly beaten up and have attractive yields for income investors with tax deferred accounts hopefully the stock market will snap back to its record high which was during q2 of last year jim flinchum is a napfa registered financial adviser in virginia beach and a member of the national association of business economics he is also the author of paybacks and can be contacted at baycapitaladvice com jim flinchum is a napfa registered financial adviser in virginia beach and a member of the national association of business economics he is also the author of paybacks and can be contacted at baycapitaladvice com
ndubuisi francis and james emejo in abuja total public debt comprising the federal government s those of the 36 states and that of the federal capital territory fct stood at n26 215 trillion as at september 2019 the debt management office dmo has stated also yesterday it emerged that the consumer price index cpi which measures inflation increased to 11 98 per cent year on year in december 2019 compared to 11 85 per cent in the preceeding month the latest public debt figures released yesterday indicated a 2 per cent growth when compared with the n25 701 trillion recorded as at june 30 2019 the dmo director general ms patience oniha who unveiled the figures during an interactive session with journalists in abuja said the total debt stock implied that in the 3rd quarter july to september 2019 a 2 per cent growth was recorded adding that the debt included promissory notes of n821 651 billion which had been issued to settle federal government s arrears to oil marketers and state governments under the promissory programme approved by the federal executive council and the national assembly a breakdown of the n26 215 trillion debt shows that the domestic component accounted for n17 943 94 trillion while external debt stood at n8 271 15 trillion when compared with the n22 428 80 trillion in the corresponding period of 2018 it shows a 16 88 per cent growth in public debt oniha explained that the ratio of domestic debt to external debt at 69 31 as at september 30 2019 was an improvement over the ratio of 71 29 as at september 2018 when juxtaposed with the target of 60 40 in the medium term debt management strategy the ratio of long term to short term debt in the domestic debt as at september 2019 was 80 20 which shows that the target of 75 25 had been outperformed by september 2019 furthermore it was an improvement over the ratio of 73 23 recorded in september 2018 similarly total debt as a percentage of gdp of 18 47 as at september 2019 was well within the limit of 25 and fares better in comparison with the debt gdp ratios of countries such as the united states of america united kingdom and canada with ratios of 105 85 and 90 respectively for the same period however because they generate adequate revenues their debt service revenue ratios for the same period were much lower at 12 5 7 5 and 7 5 respectively when compared to nigeria s 51 in 2017 she explained on criticisms of the nation s increasing borrowing oniha said public borrowing is not done by one person it is not approved by one man it is a collective decision so when we take on this administration as having borrowed let us bear in mind that borrowing is cumulative and there are rules and regulations about borrowing there are laws and procedures that must be complied with in fact that the document must be presented to the national assembly is in compliance with the fiscal responsibility act and the dmo act so we are complying with the laws on public borrowing according to oniha the relatively high level of new borrowing in recent years was triggered by the economic downturn which required increased government spending stressing that a higher level of borrowing was included in the economic recovery and growth plan ergp as a strategic tool for stimulating growth job creation and increasing external reserve the dmo dg stressed that the low revenue base of nigeria relative to its gdp was clearly reflected in the high debt service to revenue ratio adding that this clearly brings to fore the need for revenues to grow the efforts towards increasing and diversifying revenue such as the passage of the finance act and strategic revenue growth initiative of the federal ministry of finance budget and national planning should thus be supported she said on the 2020 fiscal year oniha said the new borrowings are n850 billion and n744 billion external and domestic respectively external borrowings she disclosed would be sourced from concessionary and semi concessionary loans due to the lower interest rate and longer tenors while domestic borrowings will come from federal government bonds sukuk fgn savings bonds and possibly green bonds according to her any shortfall thereafter may be raised from commercial sources oniha who explained that the third sukuk which is being planned as a source of financing for the 2020 budget would be in the region of n150 billion and that it would be used to fund 44 road projects as against 25 in 2017 and 28 in 2018 she also expressed satisfaction with the introduction of the fgn 30 year bond in april which she noted has been a success with well over n500 billion invested by various sectors particularly insurers the introduction of the 30 year bond was to meet the investment needs of long term investors such as insurance companies and support the development of domestic financial markets in areas such as mortgages she said the 30 year bond she added also contributed to reducing the refinancing risks of the public debt stock oniha noted that the outcome of the implementation of dmo s debt management strategy had resulted in many of the targets been achieved meanwhile the national bureau of statistics nbc has said the consumer price index cpi which measures inflation increased to 11 98 per cent year on year in december 2019 compared to 11 85 per cent in the preceding month food inflation rose to 14 67 per cent in december compared to 14 48 per cent in november 2019 according to the cpi figures for december 2019 which was released yesterday by the statistical agency core inflation which excludes the prices of volatile agricultural produce also increased to 9 33 per cent compared to 8 99 per cent in the preceding month the nbs stated that the rise in the food index was caused by increases in prices of bread and cereals meat fish oils and fats potatoes yam and other tubers also highest price increases were recorded in hospital services hairdressing saloons and personal grooming establishments garments repair and hire of footwear vehicle spare parts passengers transport by air shoes and other footwear others include appliances articles and products for personal care clothing materials other articles of clothing and clothing accessories and cleaning repair and hire of clothing on month on month basis the food sub index increased by 0 97 per cent in december down by 0 28 per cent from 1 25 per cent recorded in november 2019 the urban inflation rate increased further to 12 62 per cent year on year in the period under review compared to 12 47 percent in november in the he same vein the rural index increased to 11 41 per cent in december from 11 30 per cent in november on a month on month basis the urban index rose by 0 90 per cent in december down by 0 17 from 1 07 per cent recorded in november while the rural index also rose by 0 82 per cent in december down by 0 16 from the 0 98 per cent recorded in november the headline index has continued to defy monetary policy measures to limit it to single digit the uptick is a setback for both monetary and fiscal authorities which had only managed to curtail its rise for a few consecutive months before a rebound that had seen inflation again on an upward trajectory lately the central bank of nigeria cbn which has the mandate to stabilise prices had set an inflation target of about 6 per cent to 9 per cent in its current five year roadmap inflation had assumed a downward direction in recent consecutive months when it dropped in january 2019 to 11 37 per cent from 11 44 per cent in december in 2018 the headline index further reduced to 11 31 per cent in february and 11 25 per cent in march but resorted to the upward trajectory in april when it climbed to 11 37 per cent and further to 11 40 per cent in may before falling to 11 22 per cent in june 11 08 per cent in july 11 02 per cent in august before returning to 11 24 per cent in september 11 61 per cent in october and 11 85 per cent in november and now 11 98 per cent in december the rise further dampens the prospects for lower interest rate regime as well as reduction in the cost of borrowing the mpr the rate at which the apex bank lends to commercial banks is currently at 13 5 per cent
u s president donald trump signed a trade deal with china on jan 15 intended as a first phase toward a more comprehensive agreement between the two countries in exchange for some tariff relief china promised to buy an additional us 200 billion in american goods and services over the next two years and make structural reforms that would provide more protection for u s intellectual property it still leaves about 360 billion in punitive tariffs on chinese imports in place and more sanctions would be triggered if china fails to meet the terms of the deal good news right the end of the trade war is nigh don t get your hopes up while business leaders in both countries will be temporarily relieved the underlying tensions between them will not end easily as an economist who closely studies the u s relationship with china i believe there are fundamental issues that won t be resolved anytime soon doing it in phases tariffs and other trade issues have received most of the attention during the trade war but the more fundamental and difficult challenges are with lax intellectual property protection and china s industrial policy the u s is unhappy with china s use of these tools to develop its economy and to help its companies compete unfairly from the u s perspective and many of the trump administration s demands challenge china s normal business and policy practices china s leaders can t be seen by chinese citizens as giving into the u s while trump wants to show that he is tough on china as part his campaign for reelection this makes the negotiations very sensitive on both sides that s why american and chinese negotiators who have been engaged in talks for almost two years decided to try to get to an agreement in phases phase one has focused on the trade balance and tariffs with some provisions relating to technology transfer intellectual property and opening china s economy to foreign business phase two is expected to then deal more deeply with intellectual property enforcement and economic reform in china given the negotiations went on for so long it s fair to ask why are these issues so difficult to resolve i believe there are basically three factors that have made finding much common ground difficult and phase one won t change that government subsidies first china s successful growth has combined market competition with government led industrial policy for example when china s leaders decided the economy needed more innovation it created incentives and targets for companies and research institutes to create patents the number of patents filed has soared as a result a wide range of government subsidies is used to direct and assist private as well as state investment in similar ways the u s does this as well but not on the same scale and therefore views it as unfair from china s perspective however it is not reasonable for the u s to require china to change its development model in exchange for removing tariffs protecting intellectual property getting china to do more to protect the intellectual property of advanced technologies is another especially thorny issue both countries are facing economic challenges that can be aided by improved technology but since in many areas chinese capabilities have caught up with those of the u s or are being rapidly developed there is much more pressure from the u s for china to accept global norms on intellectual property rights even while china s own ip protections have improved at home there is ample evidence that chinese companies have copied foreign technology without permission or payment despite china s acceptance of ip protection as part of world trade organization membership foreign companies also report being compelled to share advanced technology in order to do business in china while technically the companies can decide to pull out of china s market the u s argues that this hurts the competitiveness of u s businesses it either means they must lose their technological advantage or not have access to the business opportunities that china s large market offers there is no reciprocal requirement of chinese companies doing business in the u s the phase one agreement begins to deal with the ip issues and includes a complaint process which is a step in the right direction it remains to be seen however how extensive it will be and how quickly it ll be implemented given that chinese companies will still face intense pressure from the government to advance china s domestic capabilities military concerns finally technology capabilities are related to growing military concerns many of the advanced technologies that china is racing to obtain have military as well as civilian uses u s policy under the current administration has indicated a wariness about china s military intentions and is considering options this wariness has been bolstered by china s military buildup especially naval capabilities in asia some advisers to the trump administration argue that china s ultimate long term goal is to replace the u s as the dominant global power china s rise conflicting differences in the u s and china s economic systems were less of a problem so long as chinese companies lagged far behind their american counterparts in terms of technology and competitiveness as china has grown more technologically advanced its relationship with the u s has become increasingly strained this will only get worse as china s economy develops and its companies compete more with the u s and others the phase one agreement represents an important step in re setting the dialogue between the two countries in a positive direction whether we see a phase two will depend on open discussion and trust good relations with the u s have been one of the foundations of china s successful development and entry into global markets chinese leaders are now weighing how much these good relations with the u s matter to their future
january 19 2020 12 02 am updated december 04 2021 10 36 pm ist the story so far the rise in retail price inflation to a nearly six year high of 7 35 in december has led to increasing worries that the indian economy may be headed towards stagflation the current rise in retail inflation has been attributed mainly to the rise in the prices of vegetables such as onions still the steady rise in wider inflation figures over the last few months amidst falling economic growth has led to fears of stagflation notably former prime minister manmohan singh writing in the hindu in november had warned about the imminent risk of stagflation facing the economy what is stagflation stagflation is an economic scenario where an economy faces both high inflation and low growth and high unemployment at the same time the indian economy has now faced six consecutive quarters of slowing growth since 2018 economic growth in the second quarter ending september the most recent quarter for which data is available was just 4 5 for the whole year growth is expected to be around 5 most economists have blamed the slowdown on the lack of sufficient consumer demand for goods and services in fact insufficient demand was cited as the primary reason behind the low price inflation that was prevalent in the economy until recently subsequently the government and many analysts prodded the reserve bank of india rbi to cut interest rates in order to boost demand this led to significant friction between the government and the rbi that led to the exit of several top ranking officials including the rbi s former governor from the central bank eventually the rbi under governor shaktikanta das obliged by cutting its benchmark interest rate the repo rate five times in 2019 also read economic slowdown explained in 4 charts the expectation among analysts was that these interest rate cuts would spur demand and boost the economy in the second half of 2019 prices of goods began to rise at a faster pace on the back of the rbi s rate cuts but the growth rate of the economy continued to fall significantly this combination of rising prices and falling growth has led many to believe that india may be sliding into stagflation perhaps the only thing right now that stops many from concluding that the economy is in full fledged stagflation is the fact that core inflation which excludes items such as vegetables whose prices are too volatile remains within the rbi s targeted range can economists explain stagflation the conventional view among economists is that there is an inverse relationship between economic growth and inflation the idea was first proposed by new zealand economist william phillips after whom the phillips curve is named based on statistical studies of inflation and unemployment it later gained widespread acceptance among mainstream economists the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment was seen as a confirmation of the hypothesis that inflation helps the economy function at its full potential the logic behind the belief is that at least in the short term inflation by boosting nominal wages but not real wages can trick workers in an economy to accept lower real wages without inflation it is argued workers would be unwilling to accept these lower real wages which in turn would lead to higher unemployment and decreased output in the economy at the same time economists argue that an inflation rate beyond a certain level at which point labour and other resources in the economy are fully employed will have no employment or growth benefits accordingly policymakers are often advised to maintain a certain inflation rate to ensure that unemployment is kept to a minimum and the economy is operating at full capacity the simultaneous presence of high inflation and low economic growth under stagflation however challenges the conventional view that inflation helps an economy operate at full capacity it was the stagflation in the united states in the 1970s caused by rising oil prices after the organization of the petroleum exporting countries cut supplies abruptly which first led many to question the validity of the phillips curve why is stagflation a problem economists who believe that the current slowdown is due to the lack of sufficient consumer demand prescribe greater spending by the government and the central bank to resuscitate the economy but stagflation essentially ties the hands of the government and the central bank from taking such countercyclical policy steps with retail inflation now well above the rbi s targeted range of 2 6 the central bank is unlikely to assist the economy any time soon by cutting its benchmark interest rate if the central bank decides to inject fresh money into the economy either by cutting its benchmark interest rate or other unconventional means it could lead to a further rise in prices and make things worse a similar rise in inflation could result if the government engages in deficit spending that is funded by the rbi all this is considered to be bad news at a time when the economy with significant unemployed resources is not functioning at its full capacity stagflation can also be politically costly to the ruling government on the one hand the slowdown in growth could affect peoples incomes on the other higher inflation could cause a reduction in people s standard of living as they can afford fewer things what is the way out economists are divided along ideological lines on what needs to be done for an economy to recover from stagflation some economists suggest that policymakers should stop worrying about inflation and instead focus exclusively on boosting aggregate demand in the economy india s nominal gdp growth a measure of the overall level of spending in the economy is expected to hit a 42 year low of 7 5 this year they consider the rbi s target of keeping inflation from rising above 6 as an arbitrary one and believe that the central bank should further ease its policy stance and the government should spend more on infrastructure and other sectors to boost the economy also read what can india do to overcome the global slowdown another point raised by these economists is that inflation on the broader level as measured by the core inflation figures remains within the rbi s target range core inflation in december was at 3 7 so greater spending by the government and the rbi will not cause inflation levels to run out of control they argue others however are more cautious about advocating a big spending approach to rescue the economy from stagflation they point to the fact that monetary easing in the last one year has only raised prices without leading to higher growth rates so injecting further liquidity into the economy may only stoke higher inflation without boosting economic growth some economists even see the severe drop in consumer demand simply as a symptom rather than as the primary cause behind the current slowdown according to this view it is natural for spending to drop after the end of a credit fuelled boom india s growth rate it is worth noting was boosted by the availability of easy credit over the last decade or even longer further credit expansion by the central bank and debt fuelled government spending these economists argue will not lead to genuine and sustainable economic growth but only to another unsustainable boom followed by a bust so they instead advocate supply side reforms to bring about genuine economic growth
some four million people of caribbean descent live outside of the region according to data from the united nations population division persons of caribbean descent can be found across the world but their main hubs are in the united states us the united kingdom uk canada and parts of continental europe such as france and the netherlands with regard to emigrant stock as a percentage of their national populations the percentage for caribbean countries in 2013 varied from as low as 11 per cent in the dominican republic to as high as 103 per cent for the commonwealth of dominica in their policy discourse caribbean governments increasingly recognise the potential of the region s sizable diaspora for catalysing trade and development efforts a constant challenge however is how to translate this potential into a reality by strategically mobilizing the diaspora into sustainable development actors this first src trading thoughts for the year explores how the caribbean can leverage its diaspora to improve its trading prospects and boost opportunities for sustainable development the contribution of the caribbean diaspora the international organization for migration iom defines a diaspora as emigrants and their descendants who live outside the country of their birth or ancestry either on a temporary or permanent basis yet still maintain effective and material ties to their countries of origin a world bank study of 2013 on the business and investment interests of the caribbean diaspora described it in general as a well educated and affluent group of individuals who have great potential to make valuable contributions to the caribbean s economic development many caribbean people in the diaspora maintain links back home and already contribute in some form or fashion to development in the region for example the same world bank 2013 study found that 70 per cent of the caribbean diaspora belongs to a formal or informal organization in their resident country or back in the caribbean several caribbean diplomatic missions particularly in major cities with caribbean diasporas host events and other activities for their nationals living there at the household level the barrels and other remittances caribbean migrants send home to loved ones sustain households and abate poverty at the macro level remittances to gdp ratios for some caribbean countries are quite high such as haiti 39 per cent jamaica 16 per cent and the dominican republic 8 per cent on the macro level pioneering research by wood watson 2015 on the use of migrant remittances in barbados found that over the three decades from 1990 to 2010 remittance flows proved to be valuable to barbados and that between 1980 1990s they were the leading capital flow similar results were found by a 2010 survey conducted by the bank of jamaica which showed that remittance flows to jamaica became an important source of foreign exchange and balance of payments support in the last two decades however the contribution of the diaspora goes beyond remittances caribbean migrants often return to the region as tourists to visit family and friends for holidays and festivals contributing to tourist arrivals and spend they also often encourage their friends to visit their homeland demand by caribbean migrants for nostalgic goods from their homeland such as rum agricultural produce condiments and seasonings help facilitate trade between their homeland and host countries caribbean migrants also invest in the regional credit union movements real estate some financial instruments and establish and invest in start up businesses back home they also engage in philanthropic endeavours by making donations to their alma maters and charities and establishing scholarships in their home countries further persons in the diaspora also bring invaluable skills know how and networks one of the challenges developing countries face in seeking to achieve the sustainable development goals sdgs is the large financing gap estimated to be us 2 5 3 trillion per year according to the unctad world investment report 2014 research conducted by the commonwealth secretariat 2017 on how investment by commonwealth countries diasporas could help finance the achievement of the sdgs in those countries estimated the baseline diaspora investment potential for commonwealth countries to be approximately us 73 2 billion per annum diaspora investment therefore could be a critical contributor to sdg achievement how can caribbean governments engage their diasporas more meaningfully traditionally caribbean government s engagement with their diasporas has been largely ad hoc and informal however this is changing as policymakers increasingly recognize the development value of their national diasporas jamaica for instance has a long history of diaspora engagement including its regular biennial diaspora conferences since 2004 to encourage persons to invest governments and other actors must establish a relationship of trust with the diaspora as well as formalize and sustain engagement efforts below are some ways in which the region has been doing this diaspora engagement policies and action plans a broad based diaspora engagement strategy and action plan linked to the country s national development plan or strategy is needed jamaica dominica suriname and guyana for example have drafted national diaspora engagement strategies trinidad tobago specifically includes the diaspora as part of its vision 2030 national development strategy suriname has created a diaspora portal diaspora sr as part of the suriname diaspora project institutionalisation of diaspora relations iom 2013 found over 400 institutions in 56 countries globally which have policies and programs for directly engaging their diasporas and divide them into six types those which function at a ministry sub ministry national or local level are part of a consular network or are a quasi governmental institution dominica and haiti for example have ministries with a diaspora affairs portfolio jamaica has the global jamaica diaspora council the principal organ of its national diaspora strategy institutions for diaspora relations help to change engagement from being ad hoc into a more formal process special programmes targeting the diaspora several caribbean countries have held diaspora conferences as well as special programmes targeting the diaspora the barbados government has for example launched a year long homecoming initiative in 2020 to invite all barbadians living in the diaspora to visit their homeland this year with the aim of mobilising the diaspora for contributing to barbados economic recovery and transformation a similar initiative was held by scotland in 2009 homecoming scotland 2009 and again in 2014 the year of homecoming an independent study commissioned by visitscotland found that scotland s year of homecoming in 2014 attracted 326 000 visitors and generated 136m for the scottish economy political and legal rights caribbean countries generally extend some political and legal rights to their diasporas by providing for dual citizenship and citizenship via descent if born to a parent who is a national barbados has further indicated it will amend its immigration legislation to allow for persons with a barbadian grandparent or great grandparent to qualify for barbadian citizenship suriname has created the status of persons of surinamese origin psa in 2014 for persons in the surinamese diaspora with parents or grandparents born in suriname better statistics and skills mapping evidence based diaspora policy making and targeting will require better statistics on the caribbean diaspora including a thorough mapping of its geographical distribution as well as a skills database a few caribbean countries like haiti and suriname have launched diaspora mapping exercises removing barriers to diaspora engagement and making the fundamentals right similarly a diaspora engagement strategy will fail to yield the desired results if the fundamentals in the home country are not in order macroeconomic and social instability weak legal framework and poor enforcement difficulties of vetting potential partners and conducting due diligence were among the concerns identified as barriers to diaspora investment in a 2016 world bank study on the potential economic role of the caribbean diaspora despite some reforms ease of doing business remains a problem in many caribbean countries evidenced by our low scorings overall in the world banks ease of doing business rankings and the world economic forum s global competitiveness index where included a functioning legal system efficient and responsive institutions and a conducive business climate are indispensable for fomenting trust and encouraging members of the diaspora to invest and do business in their home country greater mobilization of the diaspora for development will require therefore removing obstacles to diaspora involvement in national development unnecessary bureaucratic red tape can quickly turn a desire to give back into a frustrating exercise governments can also try to make remittance flows easier by investing in fintech options it would also be useful to ascertain from the diaspora what barriers they are encountering when seeking to invest and do business in the home country and use this information to craft diaspora friendly strategies alicia nicholls b sc m sc ll b is a trade researcher with the shridath ramphal

jpmorgan chase the most valuable private bank in the world made 36 4 billion in 2019 the biggest annual profit of any bank in american history the news reported tuesday sent the company s stock up by 2 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 the company took in 8 5 billion also a record making it the tenth largest publicly traded company in the world with a market cap of 437 billion jpmorgan chase s record profits were joined by morgan stanley which also reported both record profits and record revenues for 2019 sending its stock price surging 6 6 percent on thursday news of these record gains came as the six largest us banks revealed that they saved a combined 32 billion last year from president donald trump s 2017 corporate tax cut the tax windfall was up from 2018 for all but one of the banks jpmorgan s tax cut went from 3 7 billion in 2018 to 5 billion last year at wednesday s signing ceremony for the phase one trade deal with china attended by an array of corporate executives trump turned to mary erdoes a top executive at jpmorgan chase calling the bank s earnings report incredible he joked will you say thank you mr president at least the tax cuts for the corporations and the rich enacted with only token opposition from the democrats are only one factor in the surge in profits over the past year when stocks plunged at the end of 2018 trump stepped up his demand that the federal reserve reverse its policy of gradually raising interest rates to more normal levels following years of near zero rates in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis acting as the mouthpiece of wall street he demanded that the fed begin cutting rates once again in order to pump more cash into the financial markets fed chairman jerome powell dutifully complied cutting interest rates three times in 2018 and assuring the markets that he had no intention of raising them again any time soon then beginning in the late fall the fed began pumping tens of billions of dollars a week into the so called repo overnight loan market resuming the money printing operation known as quantitative easing this de facto guarantee of unlimited public funds to backstop stock prices has produced record highs on all of the major us indexes sending billions more into the private coffers of the rich and the super rich these measures are a continuation and intensification of policies carried out on a bipartisan basis for four decades to redistribute wealth from the working class to the corporations and the financial elite they have effected a fundamental restructuring of class relations in america drastically lowering the social position of the working class decent paying secure jobs have been wiped out and largely replaced by poverty wage part time temporary and contingent employment the so called gig economy exemplified by corporations such as amazon and uber this decades long ruling class offensive was accelerated in response to the 2008 financial crisis president barack obama oversaw the channeling of trillions of dollars to the banks and financial markets in order to pay off the debts of the bankers and speculators whose reckless and criminal activities had led to the crisis and make them richer than ever at the same time he imposed a restructuring of the auto industry based on a 50 percent across the board pay cut for new hires and an expansion of temporary and part time labor the united auto workers uaw has actively participated in this process enshrining the new flexible labor system in sellout contracts in 2015 and 2019 this template of expendable benefits free labor has become the new norm for labor relations across the country and throughout the world meanwhile state local and federal government programs have been dramatically slashed education housing medicaid and food stamps have been particularly hard hit this process has been accelerated under trump along with the removal of occupational safety and environmental regulations with no opposition from the democrats who represent sections of the financial elite and wealthy upper middle class the devastating human cost of the plundering of society by the corporate financial oligarchy is registered in declining life expectancy rising mortality and record suicide and drug addiction rates a recent study by the brookings institution found that 53 million people in the us 44 percent of all workers earn barely enough to live on the study found that the median pay of this group was 10 22 per hour around 18 000 a year thirty seven percent of those making 10 an hour have children more than half are the primary earners or contribute substantially to family income similarly a reuters report from 2018 found that the average income of the bottom 40 percent of workers in the united states was 11 600 a recent study by trust for america s health found that in 2017 more than 152 000 americans died from alcohol and drug induced fatalities and suicide this was highest number ever recorded and more than double the figure for 1999 among those in their 20s and early 30s the prime working life age drug deaths have increased more than 400 percent in the last 20 years at the other pole of society the dow jones industrial index is now double what it was at its peak in 2007 prior to the implosion of the financial system between march 2009 and today the dow has risen from 6 500 to over 29 000 the stock market buttressed by central bank and government policy has become the central instrument for funneling wealth from the bottom of society to the top as a result the top 10 percent of society now owns about 70 percent of all wealth whereas the bottom 50 percent has effectively nothing in the midst of this orgy of wealth accumulation at the very top of society every demand of workers for jobs decent pay education housing health care and pensions is met with the universal response there is no money hundreds of thousands of teachers have struck over the past two years to demand the restoration of funds cut from the public schools and substantial increases in pay and benefits none of their demands have been met the same applies to auto workers who struck for 40 days last fall to demand an end to two tier pay systems and the defense of jobs jpmorgan s 36 4 billion profit in 2019 is more than half the education budget of the us federal government meanwhile americans are deeper in debt to jpmorgan and the other banks than at any time in history collective consumer debt in the united states approached 14 trillion last year credit card debt has surpassed 1 trillion for the first time auto debt is at 1 3 trillion and mortgage debt is now 9 4 trillion student loan debt has increased the fastest surging from 500 billion in 2006 to 1 6 trillion today these are the conditions rooted in the historical bankruptcy and crisis of the capitalist system that have sparked a global upsurge in the class struggle and the growth of anti capitalist and pro socialist sentiment the past year has seen a dramatic expansion of working class struggle that is only a glimpse of what is to come india hong kong mexico the united states puerto rico lebanon iraq france chile and brazil are only some of the places where mass struggles have erupted what is becoming increasingly clear to hundreds of millions of people around the world is that the social problems confronting humanity in the 21st century poverty debt disease global warming war fascism the assault on democratic rights cannot be solved so long as this parasitic and oligarchical financial elite continues to rule the turn is to the american and international working class to unite take power and seize control of the wealth which it produces to ensure peace prosperity and equality for all people
who are you going to believe democrats badmouthing the economy or your own eyes former vice president joe biden says the american people are getting clobbered but middle class incomes are up 5 000 since president trump was elected wages for the average worker are rising at the fastest rate in a decade and more good news is surfacing that makes biden s claims look foolish here s what the booming stock market is telling us the u s economy will accelerate as we head to the 2020 election that s great news for president trump and a terrible prospect for democrats and it sure doesn t please the liberal media one little bit on january 4 the new york times reported u s manufacturing has slumped to a decade low it s a shocking headline now taken down and utterly misleading the piece says that the institute of supply management index fell in december to the lowest level since 2009 but that index measures sentiment not output the reality is that december industrial production was up 21 percent versus a decade ago according to the fed the bigger reality is that u s consumer confidence advanced last week to the highest level in more than 19 years and that optimism is key to continued expansion that s from bloomberg s report on its consumer comfort survey which climbed recently to a level last seen in october 2000 in addition the survey showed americans view of the economy was rosier than at any time since 2001 of course bloomberg which is owned by democratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg followed this cheering news with another report sub headlined economists expect slower u s growth in 2020 election year and quotes a pimco economist projecting growth of only 1 percent in the first half of this year the story acknowledges that joachim fels projection is one of the more pessimistic forecasters out there but of course that s the one highlighted there are three reasons that growth in 2020 could come in higher than expected the signings of usmca and phase one of a trade agreement with china relieve considerable uncertainty for manufacturers and retailers usmca the updated nafta is helpful to various industries the china pact is more comprehensive than expected and includes meaningful enforcement mechanisms including the possibility of tariff snap backs which will help prompt chinese compliance homebuilding is beginning to surge the u s consumer remains upbeat and completely indifferent to the impeachment drama which seems to be occupying the minds mainly of pundits and politicians the liberal news media is in despair knowing that president trump s reelection prospects are bolstered by the strong economy they are for instance quick to disparage the china trade deal after warning for two years that trump s tariff spat with china would smack american consumers with higher costs which never happened and would derail businesses those same analysts now suggest that resolution of the dispute counts for nothing in fact the china agreement should provide businesses with greater clarity going forward it also requires that china step up its u s imports by roughly 77 billion this year and 123 billion in 2021 white house economic adviser larry kudlow has predicted the deal will boost u s gdp by one half of one percent critics complain that substantial u s tariffs on chinese goods remain in place it should be noted that at the outset of our battle with china secretary of commerce wilbur ross wrote a compelling op ed showing that china s tariffs were substantially higher than ours on 20 of 22 major categories of goods some of the levies placed on chinese imports were meant to level the playing field and may well remain in place the president is to be congratulated for forcing beijing to the table and exposing to the world the thievery that has propelled china s ascent confronting china as trump has said should have happened a decade ago meanwhile the homebuilding industry appears set for an upturn encouraged by low mortgage rates and robust household formations housing starts popped nearly 17 percent in december to 1 608 million units the highest since 2006 that starts figure which was up nearly 41 percent compared to the year before may have been juiced by warm weather but the surge vastly outperformed economists expectations of 1 375 million units homebuilder sentiment is the highest it has been since 1999 they see what s ahead housing is not the only sector boosted by optimistic u s consumers retail sales for december mark the mood up 0 3 percent over november s strong level which was revised higher and up nearly 6 percent year over year consumer sentiment remains near record highs since the financial crisis in spite of the sad and somber impeachment driven by the prayerful nancy pelosi in fact the university of michigan reporting on its latest survey noted that only 1 percent of respondents mentioned impeachment these are just a few of the positive trends boosting our markets and our prospects it s also important that new business formations are picking up the latest read from the census bureau shows applications jumped 3 4 percent in the further quarter over the prior three months that s what optimism will do our economy is growing faster than that of any other developed country spurred by a pro business administration in the white house lower taxes and reduced regulations the successes have led the stock market to new highs and created trillions of dollars in new wealth for americans which helps everyone jp morgan recently surveyed ceos and found 76 percent were optimistic about their businesses in 2020 even as they were concerned about finding good hires and managing labor costs any minute the liberal media will start warning about rising inflation as wages move up don t be fooled that will be good news and it is coming liz peek is a former partner of major bracket wall street firm wertheim company follow her on twitter lizpeek
karachi pakistan received a record foreign investment of 2 225 billion in treasury bills during the current fiscal year the latest t bills auction held on jan 15 yielded 537 9 million the highest amount for a single auction which was also confirmed by the state bank of pakistan while the speedy foreign investment helped the government improve its reserves it set off a debate among economists and analysts with some believing the hot money could leave the country in one go spelling disaster for the economy however others supported the idea of increasing the reserves by accepting foreign investment in the local papers the government had during the jan 15 auction received rs1 1 trillion but raised rs274bn in t bills the data issued by the state bank on friday showed that over 95 per cent investment in t bills came from the united kingdom and united states out of the total investment of 537 9m 456 7m came from the uk and 80 2m from the us during the current fiscal year investment from the uk stood at 1 392bn and that from the us at 758 3m the inflows through t bills helped the government build its reserves which pushed the state bank reserves to 11 568bn and the country s total reserves to 18 123bn 537 9 million of hot money raised in last auction alone bankers dealing in the currency market said the inflows of dollars through t bills had stabilised the exchange rate which was visible during the short spell of a war like situation between iran and the us neither the demand was high nor had its rate increased it is much better to borrow through t bills rather than issue eurobonds to raise foreign exchange we saw that the government paid 1bn to retire the eurobonds debt in december 2019 without issuing another eurobonds said samiullah tariq director research at arif habib limited the government used to issue another eurobonds to pay the previous one mr tariq said the only risk involved in the t bills investment which is described as hot money was that it might leave the country in one go without any restriction but it is only possible if something happens extraordinary against the country or the economy he added a senior banker said the hot money was currently a requirement as it reduced government worries about borrowing from other sources to meet the current account deficit another positive point he added was that the government would pay back interest in rupees against these foreign investments and investors would buy dollar from the market to take it out of the country however he said the interest rate would remain high to attract and retain the hot money the high interest rate has dangerous impact on the local trade and industry as borrowing by the private sector has already reduced drastically to rs138bn during the current fiscal up to jan 10 compared to rs495bn during the same period last fiscal year bankers and analysts said the high foreign exchange liquidity was an added attraction for foreign direct investment as the investors judged the ability of the economy and its risks while they found it possible to take out their investments i believe interest rate will come down gradually with the increased foreign exchange liquidity said samiullah tariq published in dawn january 18th 2020

recently the levy institute the think tank centre for post keynesian economics and in particular the theories of hyman minsky the radical keynesian economist of the 1980s published a short video that that shows minsky explaining his theory of crises under capitalism in his own words at an event in colombia november 1987 it is a very clear account of his theory of crises based on financial fragility when the great recession hit the world capitalist economy many radical and marxist economists and even some mainstream economists called the gr a minsky moment in other words the cause of the great recession was a financial crash resulting from excessive debt that eventually could not be serviced minsky s key contention that financial instability is endogenously generated implies that not only financial but also real crises arise as a result of the inner workings of the financial system history shows that every deep and long depression in the united states has been associated with a financial crisis although especially in recent history we have had financial crises that have not led to a deep and long depression minsky in my view this is an accurate statement a financial crash occurs in every capitalist slump but financial crashes can occur without a slump but this suggests that what is going on in the real economy is what decides a financial crash not vice versa indeed as g carchedi has shown see graph below when both financial profits and profits in the productive sector start to fall an economic slump ensues that s the evidence from the post war slumps in the us but a financial crisis on its own as measured by falling financial profits does not lead to a slump if productive sector profits are still rising indeed if you listen closely to minsky s account above of his crisis theory he recognises that excessive debt in the form of ponzi finance only leads to a crash when the profits engendered in business and in banking are no longer sufficient to sustain debt expansion as minsky puts it borrowers are myopic to the past and blind to the future at the recent assa 2020 conference the annual meeting of mainstream economists organised by the american economic association there were also sessions by the more radical wings of economics post keynesians and marxists riccardo bellofiore the erudite scholar of marxist sraffian and keynesian economic theory presented two papers that offered interesting insights on minsky s theories in his first paper bellofiore argues that the current crisis is the outcome of money manager capitalism stage of capitalism the real subsumption of labour to finance in marxian terms the most promising starting points are the structural dimensions of minsky s analysis and the monetary circuit approach minsky ssocializationofinvestment__preview 6 in his second paper he argues that minsky s contributions are major necessary ingredients to a rethinking of marxian theory of capitalist dynamics and crises marxbetweenschumpeterandkeynes_augu_preview 2 i beg to differ i do not think that minsky s theories dovetail with marx s theory of crises or that they provide a better explanation of booms and slumps than that of marx marx not minsky as maria ivanova from goldsmiths university london has argued effectively in a paper of a few years ago comparing minsky and marx s theories of crises marx was firmly opposed to blaming crises on financial speculation or on the recklessness of single individuals marx and engels collected works 1975 p 401 speculation and panic may trigger crises but to trigger something does not mean to cause it for marx the ultimate origins of all crises lie in the real economy of production and exchange ivanova conf_2011_maria_ivanova on marx minsky and the gr ivanova argues that marx s concept of money could not be more different from minsky s marx saw money as the social expression of value the amount of socially necessary labour time embodied in a commodity money thus expresses the deepest contradiction of the capitalist production relations in a palpable form the minskyan perspective prides itself on its keynesian origins in contradistinction to marx keynes accorded primary importance to interest bearing capital where capital appears as property and not as function and since capital in that form does not function i e does not engage in immediate production it does not directly exploit labour class conflict appears obliterated since the rate of profit now forms an antithesis not with wage labor but with the rate of interest ivanova reckons that implicit in the keynesian minskyan perspective is the insight that finance can repress production overpower it and decouple from it at least temporarily to the detriment of the wider economy this is what bellofiore argues is its major insight but it follows from this that minsky reckons that if finance were controlled regulated restrained some of the worst ills of capitalism could be kept at bay this view is in sharp contrast to marx who reckoned that the inherent contradictions of capitalism were beyond human control minsky believed in line with the keynesian tradition that the crises arising from the permanent disequilibrium of the capitalist system could be contained by the concerted effort of big government and big finance monetary authorities as ivanova puts it the popular tale of the purely financial origins of the recent crisis dovetails nicely with the belief that financial instability and crises albeit tragically unavoidable and potentially devastating can be managed by means of money artistry no wonder many mainstream economists in the depths of the global financial crash like paul krugman reckoned that we are all minskyans now but the belief that social problems have monetary financial origins and could be resolved by tinkering with money and financial institutions is fundamentally flawed for the very recurrence of crises attests to the limits of fiscal and monetary policies as means to ensure balanced accumulation ivanova minsky considered the dependence of non financial businesses on external funds to finance the long term capital development of the economy a key source of instability this provided an important rationale for government intervention in his famous book minsky stabilizing an unstable economy 1986 he wrote once big government stabilizes aggregate profits the banker s reason for market power loses its force so the job of the radical economist was to restore the profitability of capital by the intervention of the monetary and fiscal authorities according to minsky this was more important than shifting the burden of any financial crisis off the backs of the many as minsky said in the 1980s it may also be maintained that capitalist societies are inequitable and inefficient but the flaws of poverty corruption uneven distribution of amenities and private power and monopoly induced inefficiency which can be summarized in the assertion that capitalism is unfair are not inconsistent with the survival of a capitalist economic system distasteful as inequality and inefficiency may be there is no scientific law or historical evidence that says that to survive an economic order must meet some standard of efficiency and equity fairness riccardo bellofiore in his assa paper is keen to tell us that in his book on keynes 1975 minsky adopted a more radical position than keynes on the need for the socialization of investment as the solution to crises riccardo reckons that minsky s socialization of investment thanks to his reference to the new deal is not far from a socialization in the use of productive capacity it is a command over the utilization of resources its output very much looks like marx s immediately social use values it is complementary to a socialization of banking and finance and to a socialization of employment minsky goes further that a keynesian welfare state and argues for a full employment policy led by the government as direct employer through extra market extra private enterprise and employment schemes but this was in 1975 mike beggs a lecturer in political economy at the university of sydney in a recent article shows that while that minsky started off as a socialist at least in following the ideas of market socialism by oscar lange he eventually retreated from seeing the need to replace capitalism with a new social organisation or socialised investment to trying to resolve the contradictions of finance capital within capitalism as his eventual financial fragility theory of crises shows as bellofiore says in the 1970s minsky contrasted his position from keynes keynes had called for the somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment but went onto to modify that with the statement that it is not the ownership of the instruments of production which it is important for the state to assume it was enough to determine the aggregate amount of resources devoted to augmenting the instruments and the basic rate of reward to those who own them but minsky went further and called for the taking over of the towering heights of industry and in this way keynesianism could be integrated with the market socialism of lange and abba lerner but by the 1980s minsky s aim was not to expose the failings of capitalism but to explain how an unstable capitalism could be stabilised biggs his proposals are aimed then at the stability problem the expansion of collective consumption is dropped entirely minsky supports what he calls big government mainly as a stabilizing macroeconomic force the federal budget should be at least of the same order of magnitude as private investment so that it can pick up the slack when the latter recedes but it need be no bigger indeed minsky s policy approach is not dissimilar from that of today s modern monetary theory supporters minsky even proposed a sort of mmt job guarantee policy the government would maintain an employment safety net promising jobs to anyone who would otherwise be unemployed but these must be sufficiently low paid to restrain market wages at the bottom end the low pay is regrettably necessary said minsky because constraints upon money wages and labor costs are corollaries of the commitment to maintain full employment the discipline of the labour market must remain working people may not fear unemployment but would surely still fear a reduction to the minimum wage beggs thus by the 1980s minsky saw government policy as aiming to establish financial stability in order to support profitability and sustain private expenditure once we achieve an institutional structure in which upward explosions from full employment are constrained even as profits are stabilised then the details of the economy can be left to market processes minsky minsky s journey from socialism to stability for capitalist profitability comes about because he and the post keynesians deny and or ignore marx s law of value just as the market socialists lange and lerner did the post keynesians and mmters deny ignore that profit comes from surplus value extracted by exploitation in the capitalist production process and it is this that is the driving force for investment and employment they ignore the origin and role of profit except as a residual of investment and consumer spending instead they all have a money fetish with the money fetish money replaces value rather than representing it they all see money finance as both causing crises and also as solving them by creating value in my view far from minsky providing the necessary ingredients to a rethinking of marxian theory of capitalist dynamics and crises as bellofiore argues minsky s theory of crises like all those emanating from the post keynesian think tank of the levy institute falls well short of delivering a comprehensive causal explanation of regular and recurring booms and slumps in capitalist production by limiting the searchlight of analysis to money finance and debt minsky and the p ks ignore the exploitation of labour by capital terms not even used they fail to recognise that financial fragility and collapse are triggered by the recurring insufficiency of value creation in capitalist accumulation and production moreover by claiming that capitalism s problem lies in the finance sector the policy solutions offered are the regulation and control of that sector rather than the replacement of the capitalist mode of production indeed that is the very path that minsky took from his socialism

karachi foreigners snapped up a record 536 1 million largest single day inflow ever on january 16 in pakistan s short term government securities in an auction the central bank data showed on friday as government bonds drew strong investor interest because of high interest rate the state bank of pakistan sbp data showed that foreign investment in the debt securities t bills and pakistan investment bonds reached 2 26 billion so far during the current fiscal year of 2020 the main story is foreigners are lapping up government short term securities because of the wider interest rate spreads that are offered compared with global rates an analyst said that trend should continue given that the central bank is expected to keep rate stable at least in the current quarter a bulk of investments in the t bills and pibs came from investors in the united kingdom and the united states investment from the united kingdom in t bills clocked in at 1 38 billion followed by the us with 805 million analysts said the tightened monetary policy sustainability of a market based exchange rate system continued improvement in the country s reserves buffers and implementation of the imf programme have resulted in the strong recovery in appetite from foreign investors in debt securities we see these flows continuing in the near future as we see interest rates holding at current levels due to inflationary pressures that persist and while exchange expected to remain firm analyst shahab farooq at next capital said pakistan s short term securities offer yields of approximately 13 percent while interest rates are negative globally the sbp kept its policy rate unchanged at 13 25 percent in november analysts expect the hot money inflows to reach 3 billion in the current fiscal year of 2019 20 concerns about significant outflow of this money are overplayed as interest rates are not expected to soften in 2020 an analyst said the sbp wants to lure foreign investors by offering high interest rates to build up its foreign currency reserves the central bank in its last few statements however clarified that the investment in the debt securities accounts for less than one fifth of the increase in sbp s net reserve buffers at current levels and the bulk of the increase in the net reserve buffers is accounted for by the continued current account improvement the bank also said interest rates have been higher in the past for example interest rates were around 13 75 percent on average in fy11 but our debt markets did not attract interest from international investors the government has amended income tax ordinance 2001 to simply the tax structure and process for non resident investing in debt instruments and government securities which would help deepen the capital market generate greater interest in the longer dated government securities and reduce the cost of debt for the government
the phase 1 trade deal between the united states and china signed with much fanfare at the white house on wednesday is being met with qualified praise by most trade experts who see good news in any reduction of tensions between the world s two largest economies the deal also leaves many major challenges to be addressed in a phase 2 negotiation that experts believe will be far more difficult to complete successfully the phase 1 agreement gives the u s some assurances that china will reform some of its practices related to the treatment of intellectual property open its markets to u s financial services firms and purchase more u s made goods and services particularly in the area of agriculture however it leaves tariffs in place on a large majority of goods traded between the two countries and doesn t address major points of concern including chinese industrial policy that subsidizes domestic companies to make them more competitive internationally it also doesn t specifically touch on theft of proprietary business information that the u s claims is abetted by beijing the two countries have been engaged in a trade war for nearly two years with tariffs in place that have grown to cover hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods both sides have experienced considerable economic pain as a result making any move to reduce the tension welcome to most trade experts and representatives of the business community we commend both governments for staying the course and taking this important step to rebuild trust and restore some stability in the world s most important commercial relationship thomas j donohue ceo of the u s chamber of commerce said in a statement this deal provides much needed certainty to american businesses as they begin the new year i think this is actually very good news for the u s economy said economist ed lazear a senior fellow at the hoover institution in an interview with cnbc it s important that we finally got this thing going we ve been talking about it for a long time the tariffs were supposed to be a vehicle that would get us to a trade deal lazear who served as chairman of former president george w bush s council of economic advisers from 2006 to 2009 cautioned that it would be a mistake to expect too much from the agreement it s not going to be transformational in terms of how it affects our economy he said if we take the administration s numbers as given and assume that they re accurate and then no reason to assume that they won t be accurate we re talking about something like a half a percentage point of gdp key elements of the agreement intellectual property protections the u s has for years protested the chinese government s failure to enforce international agreements meant to protect infringement of copyrights and theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information the deal signed wednesday commits beijing to criminal prosecution of individuals caught stealing trade secrets and to a crackdown on the sale of pirated goods forced technology transfer for years a condition of doing business in china for many foreign firms has been the requirement that sensitive technology be transferred to a chinese partner company as a condition of market access the agreement commits china to ending that practice and allowing any transfer that does take place to be on market terms market access for financial services firms u s banks insurers securities firms and other financial services providers have until now faced significant barriers to entry in the chinese markets the phase one deal will allow them to compete on a more level playing field inside china by removing restrictions on foreign ownership of financial services companies and other restrictions currency manipulation china s historic use of currency manipulation to give its exporters a competitive advantage over foreign competitors has long been a concern for the trump administration although in recent years the chinese government has refrained from many of the practices that used to infuriate u s businesses the deal contains a set of provisions meant to block china from reverting to its old practices opening markets to u s agriculture the agreement removes many structural barriers that have made it difficult or impossible for u s agricultural products to be sold in china the deal addresses a wide range of goods from meat and produce to infant formula and pet food increased purchases of u s goods by china trump s longtime concern about the trade deficit between the u s and china will be partially addressed by a commitment from beijing to increase its purchases of u s goods and services by 200 billion over two years and to continue on this same trajectory for several years after 2021 experts have warned that it seems unlikely that china will be able to meet that requirement especially in the years following 2021 enforcement mechanisms the agreement creates an unusual dispute resolution process that bypasses any third party involvement relying on bilateral consultations that leave both sides the option of imposing punitive tariffs if they believe the other side is not conforming to the deal what the deal leaves out industrial subsidies the deal does not address china s practice of creating substantial financial subsidies for its domestic industries which it does through a complex web of low interest loans directed government spending favorable regulatory treatment and more u s officials have indicated that the issue of industrial subsidies is a key element of the proposed phase two talks cybertheft over the past several years the u s and other countries have identified multiple instances in which hackers some clearly tied to and supported by the chinese government have been caught attempting to penetrate the computer systems of foreign businesses in order to steal intellectual property the intellectual property provisions of phase one commit both countries to combating the misappropriation of trade secrets however some experts have advocated for a more specific promise by china to refrain from supporting or benefiting from hostile computer hacking future use of tariffs trade experts are largely in agreement that tariffs create undesirable distortions in international trade and ought to be used only when absolutely necessary however the agreement leaves in place tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of annual trade and creates a mechanism for the unilateral imposition of new tariffs if either party to the agreement feels the other has not lived up to expectations this has led experts such as chad bown of the peterson institute for international economics to speculate that permanent tariffs might become the new normal for u s china trade relations whether and when negotiations on a phase two agreement will begin is unclear trump has signaled that he plans to wait until after the 2020 elections to relaunch trade talks china however had signaled that beijing would prefer an earlier start credit voice of america voa
forex is a combination of foreign currency and exchange foreign exchange is the process of changing one currency into another currency mainly for commerce trading or tourism due to these three reasons this market has a worldwide reach and is considered one of the most liquid asset markets in the world the average trading volume last year was more than 5 1 trillion in daily forex trading volume the values of individual currencies vary which has given rise to the need for foreign exchange services and trading unlike stock markets where we can trace their roots back centuries forex is a truly new market of course in its most basic sense forex has been around since nations began minting currencies however the modern forex market is a modern invention after the accord at bretton woods in 1971 more major currencies were allowed to float freely against one another the bretton woods agreement was negotiated in july 1944 to establish a new international monetary system known as the bretton woods system the agreement was developed by delegates from 44 countries at the united nations monetary and financial conference held in bretton woods new hampshire forex market fluctuations depend on a number of factors one major factor is the political scenario the political landscape of a nation plays a major role in the economic outlook for the country which will consequently affect the value of its currency forex traders are constantly monitoring political news and events to gauge what actions policymakers may take for investors to understand better this article will mention some examples which had an impact on forex trading in 2019 these include measures from increasing government spending to tightening restrictions on a particular sector or industry an upcoming election is always a major event for currency markets exchange rates will often react more favourably to parties with fiscally responsible platforms and governments willing to pursue economic growth a good example is the brexit vote which had a major impact on the british pound when the uk voted to leave the eu the election result depreciated the sterling currency which reached its lowest levels since 1985 as this led highly uncertain economic prospects for the uk for most investors this outcome was seen as a positive which in fact was seen in the performance of the ftse 100 and ftse 250 another uplift was recorded when the conservative party won the election the pound gained two per cent against the us dollar forex traders are constantly monitoring political news and events to gauge what actions policymakers may take currency strategists are expecting the surge to be contained as the uk enters the new and equally challenging phase of negotiating its future trading relationship with the bloc before the end of 2020 expectations are that the country s economic fundamentals could work in parallel with the trade discussions hence increasing the demand for the pound in the new year sterling was higher ahead of the december interest rate decision of the bank of england however in my opinion the value of the sterling pound will then be contingent on progress in the uk s trade talks with the eu and other trading partners this may temporarily lead to the currency being reattached to traditional economic data rather than brexit headlines in the media the fiscal and monetary policies of any government are the most important factors in its economic decision making central bank decisions that impact interest rates are keenly watched by the forex market for any changes in key rates or future outlooks this can be clearly illustrated by an example from december 2019 another altercation that weakened the dollar was when us president donald trump was impeached for alleged abuse of power and obstruction of congress by the democratic party however analysts stated that this scenario had little effect on the dollar strength and sustained the fact that trump s economic policies have lifted the dollar moving closer to this year s us presidential elections various analysts are predicting that the forex market will become more sensitive to the us political development theoretically monetary policy is how a central bank influences demand and supply of money hence when the fed decided to cut rates the value of dollar decreased the value of the dollar also declined when trump introduced new tariffs to be imposed on imports from china perception and uncertainty are also two factors that have a toll on the currency value when there was doubt that the us and china were not going to finalise phase one of the trade deal the dollar fell by around two per cent last year brought about a number of scenarios that had an impact on two major currencies the dollar and the sterling investors who hold foreign investments should keep in mind that a change in the value of a currency pair may have an impact on the value of their investments investors who want to reduce currency risk should opt for hedged strategies alternatively investors can take currency risk if they are bullish on a particular currency all in all investors should consult their financial adviser

dear reader with the united states china trade deal along with the usual histrionics from the us president out of the way markets are asking what now story continues below advertisement remove ad commentary by economists has been ambivalent but most say it s underwhelming the signing of the deal removes one excuse the markets used for moving up since any phase 2 deal if at all it happens is likely only after the us elections interestingly while the rally in anticipation of the trade deal looked like a classic buy the rumour sell the news set up stocks have continued to move up the reason as we have said ad nauseam is there s a close correlation between central bank balance sheet expansion and the rally in equities story continues below advertisement remove ad the rally also takes heart from upbeat us economic news the latest readings of the oecd composite lead indicator which are supposed to anticipate turning points in economic activity six to nine months ahead point to growth stabilising in most economies albeit at below trend levels the one exception unfortunately is india where the oecd lead indicators point to easing growth momentum most forecasts though believe growth in india will be a bit higher next fiscal year market consensus estimates are as usual bullish forecasting earnings growth of 26 percent in fy21 and 15 percent in fy22 for the nifty nomura research says there s a downside risk of around 4 percent to these estimates but take a look at the accompanying chart it shows how corporate earnings have invariably disappointed street forecasts at the beginning of the financial year story continues below advertisement remove ad will the disappointment this time be a mere 4 percent in fy21 and fy22 as nomura expects what the chart says is that analysts are a cheery lot they start off with high expectations and then slowly reduce them over the course of the year why else have their forecasts never been below the final growth number as the chart shows what about valuations nomura says the nifty is trading at a year forward price to earnings multiple of 18 1 more than one standard deviation above the long term average they think 17 is a more appropriate multiple we see no reason why valuations won t remain high as long as the influx of hot money continues financials and telecom are expected to contribute the most to earnings growth but will telecom companies and banks deliver with the supreme court ruling that telecom companies will have to pay up their dues to the government telecom companies will be hard pressed to find the resources and if vodafone idea collapses banks could be left holding the can as the december quarter results show not all the rosy projections about banks may come true and new fault lines are being exposed the markets are hoping the rally will now spill over into mid caps which have started outperforming the blue chip indices we took a look at whether 2020 will be the year of the mid caps and what investors should keep in mind our independent research team pulled out some promising mid and small cap stocks here and here the results season is now on in full swing we considered the main expectations of the december quarter corporate results our analysts looked at the performance of it companies from the possibility of a re rating in infosys to l t infotech firing on all cylinders we checked out what d mart s results say about its business model and in our quest for value we took a close look at the pharma sector high food inflation has led to rate cuts being taken off the table but that need not be cause for alarm the food inflation is probably temporary and in any case monetary policy was proving to be pretty ineffective no wonder then that all eyes are now upon what rabbits nirmala sitharaman will pull out of her hat in the union budget 2020 and arguments for and against expanding the fiscal deficit are all the rage counter cyclical measures are hardly enough though the world bank underlined recently that labour productivity in india is a mere 27 percent of the average in emerging economies which in turn is less than one fifth of the average in developed economies in these bullish times the positive spin on that is that it leaves all the more room for improvement after all didn t jeff bezos just say the 21st century is going to be the indian century cheers manas chakravarty

the nation s immigration policies are built on a back room corporatist bargain between democrats and cheap labor businesses says an op ed published in the new york times the op ed is headlined i m a liberal who thinks immigration must be restricted the january 16 article was authored by jerry kammer a former journalist who now works with the center for immigration studies in 2001 when i was the new washington correspondent for the arizona republic i attended the annual awards dinner of the national immigration forum the forum is a left right coalition that lobbies for unauthorized immigrants and expansive immigration policies its board has included officials of the national council of la raza the american civil liberties union and the american immigration lawyers association as well as the united states chamber of commerce the national restaurant association and the american nursery and landscape association after dinner the group s executive director frank sharry made a pitch to business allies who wanted congress to allow them unfettered access to foreign workers you guys in business get all the workers you want whenever you want them he proposed no bureaucracy sold yelled john gay a lobbyist for the american hotel and lodging association mr sharry quickly added that the deal must include advocacy for three little tiny pieces of paper a green card a union card and a voter registration card for unauthorized immigrants the hotel industry is eager to use much imported cheap labor partly because wages and salaries add up to roughly 50 percent of the sector s annual costs any increase in labor supply and any reduction in workers wages helps the shareholders boost their stock values sharry is now the head of america s voice a pro immigration group that works with the democratic party in 2013 and 2014 he worked closely with business groups as well as ethnic and racial lobbies in a failed effort to pass the wage cutting amnesty and cheap labor bill the gang of eight bill was strongly backed by the new york times which repeatedly described it as comprehensive immigration reform business groups are denouncing the new york time s decision to publish kammer s op ed david bier a pro migration advocate at the business funded cato institute chimed in by tweet we must restrict immigration because it s causing social division but no immigration isn t causing social division it s you sir mr jerry kramer of the org that thinks v dare is the same as the ny times who is causing social division the op ed was also denounced by todd schulte the director of the fwd us advocacy group created by billionaire investors including mark zuckerberg he used twitter to stigmatize americans who are worried about the impact of imported labor on their wages housing and children tweeting coming off bret stephens race science column the new york times opinion section gives a massive amount of real estate too the center for immigration studies funded and founded by john tanton john tanton who wrote the case for passive eugenics coming off bret stephens race science column the new york times opinion section gives a massive amount of real estate too the center for immigration studies funded and founded by john tanton john tanton who wrote the case for passive eugenics todd schulte thetoddschulte january 17 2020 the elite effort to stigmatize criticism works it works like a charm says kevin lynn the founder of progressives for immigration reform he continued it is thrown out as a red herring when they really don t want to discuss the pros and cons of immigration as a way to shut down the debate is self evident when you look at california if unbridled immigration is somehow a plus for the productive class is a boon to the environment then california should be paradise right now but california has the highest level of inequality the jobs that once paid a good middle class living now don t you re scraping by in your construction job the impact of the racism charge may even reach the editorial board at the new york times which has interviewed most of the democrats 2020 competitors in interviews with sen bernie sanders i vt tom steyer and sen elizabeth warren d ma the board members denied a connection between labor supply and wages in a back and forth conversation about exploitation and immigration with sanders for example board member binyamin applebaum said you said that the exploitation of undocumented workers results in lower wages for domestic workers i think that there s a lot of research suggesting that that s not actually the case that claim that supply does not affect wages is often made by investors lobbyists and business tied consultants but the vast majority of people who deal with the issue plainly say that worker shortages spur wage raises that responses come from independent academics the national academies of science the congressional budget office executives more academics new york times reporters state officials unions more business executives lobbyists employees the wall street journal federal economists goldman sachs oil drillers wall street analysts fired professionals legislators construction workers nyt subscribers plus robert rubin the bank of ireland and 2015 bernie sanders but the nyt s board trusts that immigration does not affect wages in the interview with warren board member kathleen kingsbury asked throughout america many jobs that were once held by american union members have been replaced and are now held by undocumented immigrants does that drive down wages in the united states but do you know of any specific evidence that immigrants drive down wages the nyt posted kingsbury s question with an italicized note denouncing the supply effects wage connection over several decades it s become increasingly clear that how immigration debates are framed is important one of the more subtle anti immigration tactics employed by the trump kennedy and johnson administrations as well as some on the political left is to suggest that reducing immigration could preserve more jobs for american workers and lead to higher wages but economic research has consistently disputed the notion that limiting immigration would increase domestic employment or raise average wages the prevailing view of economists is that immigration increases economic growth while some workers might benefit from immigration restrictions more would suffer the nyt s links go to a 2017 article that tries to contradict the 2016 national academy of sciences report on immigration kingsbury seems to support the claim that immigration does not affect wages even though she won a prize for writing about low wages in a sector flooded by migrant workers she was awarded the 2015 pulitzer prize for distinguished editorial writing for a series on low wages and the mistreatment of workers in the restaurant industry she wrote in february 2014 meet hope shaw the 38 year old single mother of three who is assistant manager at dunkin donuts on boston street she too likes to serve but her life is one of unrequited toil she lives paycheck to paycheck her heating gas was shut off last winter for failure to pay the electric bill for her dorchester apartment is consistently three months overdue she s gone without health insurance for more than a year my rent is 1 100 a month she says every month i feel like i m choosing between paying that or putting food on the table yet six days a week shaw leaves her home before 4 a m to work a nine hour shift overseeing the sale of donuts bagels and flat bread sandwiches while coping with customers who expect their coffee to be prepared exactly as they please and only sometimes drop a penny in the tip can she s been promoted twice in the five years she s worked at the store and her hourly pay has gone from 8 to 10 she made slightly less than 24 000 last year in trump s economy where ceos cannot easily import extra workers dunkin donuts now pays its assistant managers almost 14 00 in salisbury ma admittedly the crush of low skill migrants and high tech money moving into major cities has pushed up housing costs for assistant managers so the rent for two bedroom apartments in dorchester now exceeds 2 000 per month but elites have always been reluctant to admit the economic and civic distortions caused by government imported labor said lynn they never will he said citing a quote by union leader samuel gompers in 1924 every effort to enact immigration legislation must expect to meet a number of hostile forces and in particular two hostile forces of considerable strength one of these is composed of corporation employers who desire to employ physical strength at the lowest possible wage and who prefer a rapidly revolving labor supply at low wages to a regular supply of american wage earners at fair wages the other is composed of racial groups in the united states who oppose all restrictive legislation because they want the doors left open for an influx of their countrymen that year gompers won his battle when congress drastically cut the inflow of immigrants into the united states by 1950 american wage earners earned roughly 65 percent of each year s economy but that share declined after 1980 in an increasingly high immigration high tech economy in the great recession wage earners share of new wealth fell below 57 percent as cheap labor and spreading technology flushed americans money towards the stock market and the coastal cities the new york times editorial board denies immigration s role in that incoming tide of wealth
for trade and sustainable development by alicia nicholls some four million people of caribbean descent live outside of the region according to data from the united nation s population division persons of caribbean descent can be found across the world but their main hubs are in the united states us the united kingdom uk canada and parts of continental europe such as france and the netherlands with regard to emigrant stock as a percentage of their national populations the percentage for caribbean countries in 2013 varied from as low as 11 per cent in the dominican republic to as high as 103 per cent for the commonwealth of dominica in their policy discourse caribbean governments increasingly recognise the potential of the region s sizable diaspora for catalysing trade and development efforts a constant challenge however is how to translate this potential into a reality by strategically mobilising the diaspora into sustainable development actors this first src trading thoughts for the year explores how the caribbean can leverage its diaspora to improve its trading prospects and boost opportunities for sustainable development the contribution of the caribbean diaspora the international organisation for migration iom defines a diaspora as emigrants and their descendants who live outside the country of their birth or ancestry either on a temporary or permanent basis yet still maintain effective and material ties to their countries of origin a world bank study of 2013 on the business and investment interests of the caribbean diaspora described the caribbean diaspora in general as a well educated and affluent group of individuals who have great potential to make valuable contributions to the caribbean s economic development many caribbean people in the diaspora maintain links back home and already contribute in some form or fashion to development in the region for example the same world bank 2013 study found that 70 per cent of the caribbean diaspora belongs to a formal or informal organisation in their resident country or back in the caribbean several caribbean diplomatic missions particularly in major cities with caribbean diasporas host events and other activities for their nationals living there at the household level the barrels and other remittances caribbean migrants send home to loved ones sustain households and abate poverty at the macro level remittances to gdp ratios for some caribbean countries are quite high such as haiti 39 per cent jamaica 16 per cent and the dominican republic eight per cent on the macro level pioneering research by wood watson 2015 on the use of migrant remittances in barbados found that over the three decades from 1990 to 2010 remittance flows proved to be a valuable resource flow to barbados and that between 1980 1990s they were the leading capital flow similar results were found by a 2010 survey conducted by the bank of jamaica which showed that remittance flows to jamaica became an important source of foreign exchange and balance of payments support in the last two decades however the contribution of the diaspora goes beyond remittances caribbean migrants often return to the region as tourists to visit family and friends for holidays and festivals contributing to tourist arrivals and spend they also often encourage their friends to visit their homeland demand by caribbean migrants for nostalgic goods from their homeland such as rum agricultural produce condiments and seasonings help to facilitate trade between their homeland and host countries caribbean migrants also invest in the regional credit union movements real estate some financial instruments and establish and invest in start up businesses back home they also engage in philanthropic endeavours by making donations to their alma maters and charities and establishing scholarships in their home countries further persons in the diaspora also bring invaluable skills know how and networks one of the challenges developing countries face in seeking to achieve the sustainable development goals sdgs is the large financing gap estimated to be us 2 5 3 trillion per year according to the unctad world investment report 2014 research conducted by the commonwealth secretariat 2017 on how investment by commonwealth countries diasporas could help finance the achievement of the sdgs in those countries estimated the baseline diaspora investment potential for commonwealth countries to be approximately us 73 2 billion per annum diaspora investment therefore could be a critical contributor to sdg achievement how can caribbean governments engage their diasporas more meaningfully traditionally caribbean government s engagement with their diasporas has been largely ad hoc and informal however this is changing as policymakers increasingly recognise the development value of their national diasporas jamaica for instance has a long history of diaspora engagement including its regular biennial diaspora conferences since 2004 to encourage persons to invest governments and other actors must establish a relationship of trust with the diaspora as well as formalise and sustain engagement efforts below are some ways in which the region has been doing this diaspora engagement policies and action plans a broad based diaspora engagement strategy and action plan linked to the country s national development plan or strategy is needed jamaica dominica suriname and guyana for example have drafted national diaspora engagement strategies trinidad tobago specifically includes the diaspora as part of its vision 2030 national development strategy suriname has created a diaspora portal diaspora sr as part of the suriname diaspora project institutionalisation of diaspora relations iom 2013 found over 400 institutions in 56 countries globally which have policies and programs for directly engaging their diasporas and divide them into six types those which function at a ministry sub ministry national or local level are part of a consular network or are a quasi governmental institution dominica and haiti for example have ministries with a diaspora affairs portfolio jamaica has the global jamaica diaspora council the principal organ of its national diaspora strategy institutions for diaspora relations help to change engagement from being ad hoc into a more formal process special programmes targeting the diaspora several caribbean countries have held diaspora conferences as well as special programmes targeting the diaspora the barbados government has for example launched a year long homecoming initiative in 2020 to invite all barbadians living in the diaspora to visit their homeland this year with the aim of mobilising the diaspora for contributing to barbados economic recovery and transformation a similar initiative was held by scotland in 2009 homecoming scotland 2009 and again in 2014 the year of homecoming an independent study commissioned by visitscotland found that scotland s year of homecoming in 2014 attracted 326 000 visitors and generated 136m for the scottish economy political and legal rights caribbean countries generally extend some political and legal rights to their diasporas by providing for dual citizenship and citizenship via descent if born to a parent who is a national barbados has further indicated it will amend its immigration legislation to allow for persons with a barbadian grandparent or great grandparent to qualify for barbadian citizenship suriname has created the status of persons of surinamese origin psa in 2014 for persons in the surinamese diaspora with parents or grandparents born in suriname better statistics and skills mapping evidence based diaspora policy making and targeting will require better statistics on the caribbean diaspora including a thorough mapping of its geographical distribution as well as a skills database a few caribbean countries like haiti and suriname have launched diaspora mapping exercises removing barriers to diaspora engagement and making the fundamentals right similarly a diaspora engagement strategy will fail to yield the desired results if the fundamentals in the home country are not in order macroeconomic and social instability weak legal framework and poor enforcement difficulties of vetting potential partners and conducting due diligence were among the concerns identified as barriers to diaspora investment in a 2016 world bank study on the potential economic role of the caribbean diaspora despite some reforms ease of doing business remains a problem in many caribbean countries evidenced by our low scorings overall in the world bank s ease of doing business rankings and the world economic forum s global competitiveness index where included a functioning legal system efficient and responsive institutions and a conducive business climate are indispensable for fomenting trust and encouraging members of the diaspora to invest and do business in their home country greater mobilisation of the diaspora for development will require therefore removing obstacles to diaspora involvement in national development unnecessary bureaucratic red tape can quickly turn a desire to give back into a frustrating exercise governments can also try to make remittance flows easier by investing in fintech options it would also be useful to ascertain from the diaspora what

so why did jesus weep over lazarus it s odd is it not i mean considering what came next here is the passage again just for reference john 11 32 44 32 when mary reached the place where jesus was and saw him she fell at his feet and said lord if you had been here my brother would not have died 33 when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who had come along with her also weeping he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled where have you laid him he asked come and see lord they replied 35 jesus wept 36 then the jews said see how he loved him 37 but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying 38 jesus once more deeply moved came to the tomb it was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance 39 take away the stone he said but lord said martha the sister of the dead man by this time there is a bad odor for he has been there four days 40 then jesus said did i not tell you that if you believe you will see the glory of god 41 so they took away the stone then jesus looked up and said father i thank you that you have heard me 42 i knew that you always hear me but i said this for the benefit of the people standing here that they may believe that you sent me 43 when he had said this jesus called in a loud voice lazarus come out 44 the dead man came out his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen and a cloth around his face jesus said to them take off the grave clothes and let him go i never caught this before but it makes you wonder he wept right before he gave him life again and didn t he know he was going to do that it s almost like being upset about not having x on your way to get x or is it maybe it was the humanity of it all the way a friend can hurt for a friend or a parent cries with their child in empathy and love why the tears why the heartache he knew he was going to raise lazarus from the grave i suspect like the mother clutching her child jesus must have wondered how do i explain to them that when they reach their destination the pain will be gone ravi zacharias and vince vitale why suffering

t he financial crisis of 2008 10 illustrated the immense dangers of a mismanaged housing market in america during the early to mid 2000s irresponsible sometimes illegal mortgage lending led many households to accumulate more debt than they could sustain between 2000 and 2007 america s household debt rose from 104 of household income to 144 house prices rose by 50 in real terms the ensuing wave of defaults led to a global recession and nearly brought down the financial system listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element from the 1960s to the 2000s a quarter of recessions in the rich world were associated with steep declines in house prices recessions associated with credit crunches and house price busts were deeper and lasted longer than other recessions did yet the damage caused by poorly managed housing markets goes much deeper than financial crises and recessions as harmful as they are in rich countries and especially in the english speaking world housing is too expensive damaging the economy and poisoning politics and it is becoming ever more so from their post crisis low global real house prices have since risen by 15 taking them well past their pre crisis peak traditionally politicians like it when house prices rise people feel richer and therefore borrow and spend more giving the economy a nice boost they think when everyone is feeling good about their financial situation incumbent politicians have a higher chance of re election but there is another side costly housing is unambiguously bad for the rich world s growing population of renters forcing them to trim spending on other goods and services and an economic policy which relies on homebuyers taking on large debts is not sustainable in the short term finds a study by the imf rising household debt boosts economic growth and employment but households then need to rein in spending to repay their loans so in three to five years those effects are reversed growth becomes slower than it would have been otherwise and the odds of a financial crisis increase malfunctioning housing markets also hit the supply side of the economy the rich world s most productive cities do not build enough new houses constraining their growth and making them more expensive than they would otherwise be people who would like to move to london san francisco or sydney cannot afford to do so since productivity and wages are much higher in cities than outside that reduces overall gdp so it is bad news that in recent decades the rich world has got worse at building new homes a recent paper by kyle herkenhoff lee ohanian and edward prescott argues that in america this process has slowed interstate migration reduced factor reallocation and depressed output and productivity relative to historical trends constraints on urban growth also make it harder to reduce carbon dioxide emissions since big cities are the most efficient built forms in america there are more building restrictions in places which have lower emissions per household housing is also a big reason why many people across the rich world feel that the economy does not work for them whereas baby boomers tend to own big expensive houses youngsters must increasingly rent somewhere cramped with their friends fomenting millennials resentment of their elders thomas piketty an economist has claimed that in recent decades the return to capital has exceeded what is paid to labour in the form of wages raising inequality but others have critiqued mr piketty s findings pointing out that what truly explains the rise in the capital share is growing returns on housing other research meanwhile has found that housing is behind some of the biggest political shocks of recent years housing markets and populism are closely linked britons living in areas where house prices are stagnant were more likely to vote for brexit in 2016 and french people for the far right national front in the presidential elections of 2017 according to research from ben ansell of oxford university and david adler of the european university institute political disputes sparked the protests in hong kong but the outrageous cost of accommodation in the city state has added economic fuel to the political flames this special report will argue that since the second world war governments across the rich world have made three big mistakes they have made it too difficult to build the accommodation that their populations require they have created unwise economic incentives for households to funnel more money into the housing market and they have failed to design a regulatory infrastructure to constrain housing bubbles happily they are at last starting to recognise the damage caused by these policies in britain the government now openly says that the housing market is broken scott morrison australia s prime minister has pledged to make housing more affordable canada s recent election was fought partly on who would do more to rein in the country s spiralling housing costs carrie lam hong kong s chief executive has put housing front and centre in her response to the protesters they need to learn from places where the housing market broadly works and those places do exist as this report shows flexible planning systems appropriate taxation and financial regulation can turn housing into a force for social and economic stability singapore s public housing system helps improve social inclusion mortgage finance in germany helped the country avoid the worst of the 2008 10 crisis switzerland s planning system goes a long way to explaining why populism has so far not taken off there governments across the world need to act decisively and without delay nothing less than the world s economic and political stability is at stake

he exaggerates continually sometimes spectacularly the size of what he does just as his tax cuts are far from the biggest in history the economy isn t the best ever and his election victory in 2016 was no landslide of historic proportions trump s two trade deals don t stand atop the field of presidential endeavors one is a partial settlement of trade grievances with china the other is a refresh of what past presidents created for north america the opening of the senate impeachment trial stirred other fabrications from the president this past week while democratic presidential contenders engaged in their final debate before the first votes of the 2020 campaign in iowa a sampling from a week in political rhetoric trade trump on his trade agreement with china this is the biggest deal there is anywhere in the world by far remarks wednesday at the signing trump on the china deal and his updated north american trade agreement so we ve done two of the biggest trade deals they are the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done remarks at the white house on thursday the facts neither claim is true the china agreement is not nearly as big as the u s mexico canada agreement so it s not the largest ever much less by far the deal with canada and mexico was an update of the long standing north american free trade agreement worked out by presidents george h w bush and bill clinton the north american agreement also is not the largest ever for instance 123 countries signed the uruguay round agreement that liberalized trade and produced the world trade organization in 1994 the organization s initial membership accounted for more than 90 of global economic output the federal reserve bank of boston found and that was before china joined the organization also bigger the trans pacific partnership which would have joined north america with pacific rim countries in freer trade trump took the u s out after the deal was negotiated and before the u s ratified it the european union was formed from a giant deal the china deal leaves tariffs in place on about 360 billion in imports from china and pushes substantial remaining disputes ahead to a second phase of negotiations impeachment trump we demand fairness shouts pelosi and the do nothing democrats yet the dems in the house wouldn t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions tweet monday referring to house speaker nancy pelosi d calif the facts not true the house judiciary committee which produced the articles of impeachment invited trump or his legal team to come he declined absent white house representation the hearings proceeded as things in congress routinely do time is split between democratic and republican lawmakers to ask questions and engage in the debate lawyers for democrats and republicans on the committee presented the case for and against the impeachment articles and members questioned witnesses among them an academic called forward by republicans the first round of hearings was by the house intelligence committee and resembled the investigative phase of criminal cases conducted without the participation of the subject of the investigation trump cried foul then at the lack of representation then rejected representation when the next committee offered it his lawyers will participate in the senate s impeachment trial the whistleblower trump you had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said everything was false remarks thursday the facts trump s statement is false the whistleblower s account of a phone call between trump and ukraine s leader in july closely resembled what was said judging by the rough transcript released later by the white house itself and by the testimony of officials who listened in on the call witnesses in the impeachment hearings and other sources also verified the whistleblower s description of events before and after the call as trump and his aides pressed ukraine to investigate one of trump s political rivals democrat joe biden the senate impeachment trial will explore whether trump abused his power economy trump more than 300 000 people under obama 300 000 people left the workforce under just three years of my administration 3 5 million people have joined the workforce milwaukee rally the facts trump is wrong about barack obama s record more than 5 million people joined the u s labor force during obama s presidency according to labor department figures these gains reflect the recovery from the great recession as well as population growth more than 4 8 million people have joined the labor force in three years of trump s presidency trump under the trump economy the lowest paid earners are reaping the biggest fastest and largest gains earnings for the bottom 10 are rising faster than earnings for the top 10 proportionally milwaukee rally the facts actually the top 10 of earners saw the biggest raises of any income bracket over the past year their usual weekly earnings jumped 8 or 168 according to the labor department the bottom 10 saw weekly incomes grow 7 or 30 over a broader range the top and bottom 25 weekly earnings also grew at faster rate for the wealthier group trump we ve created 7 million jobs since the election including more than 1 million manufacturing and construction jobs nobody thought that was possible milwaukee rally the facts his numbers are roughly right though they are less impressive than trump claims job gains under trump over the past three years were lower than during the final three years of obama s presidency more than 8 million jobs were added during that period under obama including 1 2 million combined in manufacturing and construction what these figures suggest is that much of the job growth under trump reflects the momentum from a recovery that officially began in the middle of 2009 immigration trump we have loopholes like a visa lottery we put things in the lottery and they come in they become american citizens do you think these countries are giving us their finest oh let s give them our best citizens milwaukee rally the facts this is a perpetual falsehood from the president countries don t nominate their citizens for the program they don t get to select people they d like to get rid of foreigners apply for the visas on their own under the program citizens of countries named by the u s can bid for visas if they have enough education or work experience in desired fields out of that pool of qualified applicants the state department randomly selects a much smaller pool of tentative winners not all winners will have visas approved because they still must compete for a smaller number of slots by getting their applications in quickly those who are ultimately offered visas still need to go through background checks like other immigrants who s paying for the wall not mexico trump mexico s paying for the wall you know that it s all worked out milwaukee rally the facts mexico isn t paying for trump s long promised border wall trump has argued that the updated trade agreement with canada and mexico will pay for the wall because of economic benefits he predicts will come from the deal nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost or require a payment from mexico health care reform trump i was the person who saved pre existing conditions in your healthcare you have it now tweet monday the facts that s false people with preexisting medical problems have health insurance protections because of obama s health care law which trump is trying to dismantle one of trump s major alternatives to obama s law short term health insurance already in place doesn t have to cover preexisting conditions another alternative is association health plans which are oriented to small businesses and sole proprietors and do cover preexisting conditions meanwhile trump s administration has been pressing in court for full repeal of the obama era law including provisions that protect people with preexisting conditions from health insurance discrimination with obamacare still in place insurers in the individual marketplace must take all applicants regardless of medical history and charge the same standard premiums to healthy people and those who have poor health or past medical problems before obama s law any insurer could deny coverage or charge more to anyone with a preexisting condition who was seeking to buy an individual policy ___ bernie sanders medicare for all will cost substantially less than the status quo democratic debate the facts there s no guarantee of that the nonpartisan congressional budget office said in a report last year that total spending under a single payer system like the vermont senator and democratic presidential candidate favors might be higher or lower than under the current system depending on the key features of the new system those features have to do with the design of the system questions such as payment rates for hospitals and doctors and whether patients are required to pay part of the cost of their care sanders says his plan would require no cost sharing from patients no copays and no deductibles but completely free care could trigger a surge in demand for medical services raising costs other countries that provide coverage for all do use cost sharing to help keep spending in check a research report last year by the nonprofit rand think tank estimated that a medicare for all plan similar to what sanders wants would modestly raise total u s health spending soleimani killing trump on killing iran gen qassem soleimani the democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy tweet monday trump you know what bothers me when i see a nancy pelosi trying to defend this monster from iran when nancy pelosi and the democrats want to defend him i think that s a very bad thing for this country remarks on jan 9 at event on environmental regulations the facts that s a fabrication democrats did not praise or defend the iranian general they criticized the action trump took pelosi called the u s missile strike provocative and disproportionate while branding soleimani a terrible person similarly democratic presidential candidates criticized trump s strategy and the fact he didn t notify or consult congress in advance while making clear they considered soleimani anything but wonderful the iranian was a murderer responsible for the deaths of thousands including hundreds of americans said massachusetts sen elizabeth warren even so republican rep doug collins of georgia asserted democrats were in love with terrorists then retracted the statement and apologized i left parts of my body in iraq fighting terrorists democratic sen tammy duckworth of ilinois a former army pilot who lost both her legs while serving in iraq told cnn after hearing collins initial remarks i don t need to justify myself to anyone

the newest reading on consumer sentiment from the university of michigan s surveys of consumers shows that americans are feeling pretty upbeat these days two new metrics on consumer holiday season spending published this week found that consumer spending held up through the all important holiday season the national retail federation said that retail sales in november and december excluding restaurants gasoline and cars totaled just over 730 billion a year over year increase of 4 1 percent the commerce department said retail sales rose by 0 3 percent in december when cars and gasoline two volatile components were excluded retail sales grew by 0 5 percent for the month these figures were buoyed by steady consumer sentiment which remained roughly flat in december the baseline sentiment index ticked down a tiny bit from 99 3 to 99 1 and the outlook of current conditions rose by 0 3 points although the index of consumer expectations slipped by 0 7 points this still represents a year over year increase of 10 5 all three metrics consumer sentiment current economic conditions and consumer expectations have risen year over year reflecting a recovery from worries about the federal reserve and the government shutdown that started 2019 consumers will continue to sustain the expansion due to their favorable judgements about their current and prospective financial situation surveys of consumers chief economist richard curtin wrote in the accompanying analysis consumer spending is the pillar on which the economic expansion rests said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com there are a few good reasons for this optimism he added we ve got unemployment at a 50 year low growth in household income and growth in real spending power for most households the sharp downturn in growth apparently promised by the weakening of business surveys from the spring through the early fall has not materialized ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics wrote in a client note pantheon revised its 2020 gdp average quarterly growth forecasts upward from 1 5 percent to 2 percent as a result shepherdson added mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics said the meteoric rise in the stock market also contributes a potent wealth effect that can stimulate spending the wealth effect the rising stock market should be adding about half a point of gdp growth in 2019 and are on track to do about the same in 2020 he said that supports consumer confidence that helps in terms of cash stockholders can realize those gains it makes it easier for them to borrow zandi said the increase in borrowing rates also is helped along by a combination of low interest rates and economic optimism a forecast from credit bureau transunion predicted that americans will take on more debt this year including mortgages credit cars car and personal loans some households are in fact relying on debt to meet necessities but that s not the base case the majority of it is optimism with regard to employability income and the ability to repay that debt mcbride said according to a new bankrate survey 84 percent of people expect their finances to either improve or stay the same in 2020 only 1 in 6 americans expect their financial situation to get worse this year that ties back to that willingness to spend and comfort with taking on debt in moderation mcbride said 68 percent of economic output comes from consumer spending as long as that virtuous cycle retains intact we can keep recession at bay some market observers though argued that comparative sales should have been even higher given the economic fundamentals at play it s really an easier year over year comparison said camilla yanushevsky equity analyst at cfra research the partial government shutdown that stretched on for weeks worry about rising interest rate and waning tax cut stimulus all combined to put a damper on consumer activity towards the end of 2018 yanushevsky said nrf data found that holiday spending in 2018 grew at a rate of just over 2 percent i m surprised sales weren t stronger zandi said last december was a disaster i expected christmas sales because of the easy comparison to be closer to 5 percent many suspect trade could be putting a drag on recent results shepherdson flagged tariffs as a risk factor to continued economic growth both the direct effects of the tariffs a tax on consumers and businesses and the accompanying uncertainty will continue to constrain economic growth indefinitely he said yanushevsky pointed out that in spite of this week s china trade deal the majority of tariffs remain in place which constrains the rate of expansion we think that s going to stifle economic growth she said predicting that the impact to consumers will be magnified as more companies pass along their higher costs it s still chipping into people s wallets she said the trade war hurt manufacturing really hurt business investment in 2019 yanushevsky said predicting retail sales growth of 3 percent for this year we think there s going to be a more material spillover in 2020

pakistan struggling with balance of payments crisis and burden of high public debt high inflation and security concerns have hurt domestic demand and private investment govt s ability to address slowdown has been severely curtailed by fiscal tightening sbp efforts to address inflation complicated by increases in energy tariffs more than 30pc pakistani youths are not in education employment or training global economic slumber to derail anti poverty climate change fight china has a higher growth rate than india among the world s large economies with a 6 per cent forecast for the current calendar year the report says pakistan meanwhile has been struggling with a balance of payments crisis and the burden of high public debt which have led to an arrangement with the imf and corresponding fiscal tightening high inflation and security concerns have hurt domestic demand and private investment and the government s ability to address the slowdown has been severely curtailed by the fiscal tightening export growth has fallen to 0 4 per cent owing to disappointing sales of textiles which constitute 60 per cent of the country s goods exports gdp growth has remained weak at 3 3 per cent in both 2018 and 2019 well below the 4 6 per cent range of previous years nevertheless the economy of pakistan is expected to recover slightly from 2021 onward as increased government revenues from a tax hike allow expanded public investment and as other government reforms required by the imf begin to bear fruit in 2021 the economy is projected to grow by 3 3pc continued commitment to reform combined with productive investment in infrastructure and strategic capacity development will be critical for the country to find its way back to its previous growth path meanwhile the state bank of pakistan is balancing a stronger commitment to inflation targeting with a managed depreciation of the currency but this is complicated by increases in energy tariffs that have been imposed as part of the fiscal reform package while the tightened monetary policy in pakistan is expected to help move inflation towards target levels in the years to come the country s inflation remains extremely vulnerable to fuel price fluctuations and weather conditions as is the case for most countries in the region a good harvest and resulting moderate food price inflation will be of critical importance for the region s poor whose household budgets are strongly linked to food prices in afghanistan bangladesh pakistan and sri lanka for example more than 30 per cent of youth are not in education employment or training in india this figure is over 40 per cent briefing the media about the report un s chief economist elliott harris presented a dire picture of the global economy last year when the world s gross product growth rate dropped to 2 3 per cent the lowest in a decade elliott harris said that rising tariffs and rapid shift in trade policies were responsible for the lower growth rate with the united states china trade disputes playing a significant part associate economics affairs officer julian slotman the un s pointperson for indian and south asia said in an interview to foreign media that globally we have seen a large impact of trade tensions particularly between the us and china but also other major economies that have affected growth rates across the globe and also of course india which is a very open economy that has a lot to gain from international trade julian slotman said the world economy risks suffering a slowdown in 2020 that would derail efforts to tackle the mounting climate emergency and heightened poverty around the world the un warned impacted by prolonged trade disputes the global economy suffered its lowest growth in a decade slipping to 2 3 percent in 2019 however the world could see a slight uptick in economic activity in 2020 if risks are kept at bay united nations said in its flagship world economic situation and prospects wesp 2020 report the report states that growth of 2 5 percent in 2020 is possible but a flareup of trade tensions financial turmoil or an escalation of geopolitical tensions could derail a recovery in a downside scenario global growth would slow to just 1 8 percent this year it said a prolonged weakness in global economic activity may cause significant setbacks for sustainable development including the goals to eradicate poverty and create decent jobs for all at the same time pervasive inequalities and the deepening climate crisis are fueling growing discontent in many parts of the world un secretary general antÃ³nio guterres warned that these risks could inflict severe and long lasting damage on development prospects they also threaten to encourage a further rise in inward looking policies at a point when global cooperation is paramount

by medicine hat news opinion on january 18 2020 austerity measures and service cuts have clearly just begun with another ambitious legislative agenda set to begin feb 25 as if albertans needed more proof of what the ucp s plan is to deal with so called financial problems we could contemplate the true intent behind it all a move to sabotage the public sector and promote privatization or a calculated disdain for jobs occupied by mostly women being just two speculations already circulating but we know that whatever the motive the ucp claim behind it is the same alberta is broke because spending is out of control everyone is being asked to take a hit in the name of the province s bottom line this week alone included blows for under 65 spouses nurses again edmonton public schools universities again and parents of a 25 day childcare pilot project oh and the funding application deadline for early childhood development programs is set for monday at this point if you haven t personally felt the pinch of ucp policy you re in a shrinking quickly minority and congratulations on all that cash except have you ever noticed that the terms broke and out of control only apply when it comes to a service for albertans but whenever when we feel the need for say a billions dollar corporate tax cut or a business subsidy or an umpteenth panel or a war room that is now the butt of the world s least funny joke our pockets are as exactly as deep as we need them to be mount royal university professor and historian roberta lexier said it best in an interview with cbc s sunday edition austerity minded governments have been insisting that we can t afford the rising costs of social programs without more deficits or higher tax burdens on ordinary canadians but the argument does not apply apparently to tax breaks or subsidies or grants for corporations i think the general public probably doesn t even know how much money corporations are receiving from the public purse and i think it s in the interest of many people to keep that conversation very quiet exactly even if we all agreed that deficits and debt are inherently bad i very much disagree how we tackle these so called problems is simply a matter of priority i think we all agree the ucp s top priority is the economy as is any government s these days and at this point it s pretty clear they re going with the give money to people that already have all the money and then hope that maybe for the first time ever people with all the money will decide they don t like having all the money and kick down a few nickels for the rest of us approach Ã¢ it s the job creators that drive society they claim and if we don t ensure a welcoming environment of subsidization low taxes and the right to extract resources for pennies on the dollar then they might not come here or stay here to provide albertans with that job they so desperately need we ve let governments from all sides fall into this trap of economy first people second and are now decades removed from any semblance of a north american society that values the citizen over the corporation obviously a majority of us need to be employed or the system doesn t work anyway but thanks to this fear of corporate abandonment by way of another jurisdiction we have become so enslaved by big business that we re willing to give up our own wellbeing to keep it happy and yet even as we offer up whatever money breaks or undervalued resources these corporations require they still treat us like a high school fling they re prepared to dump at any moment should they discover any profitable reason to do so if we can understand that people are necessary to drive our economy but also understand the economy is desperately trying to rid itself of that necessity through layoffs automation or anything else that might boost profits why don t we just end 50 years of trickle down failure skip this made up economic boogeyman and start focusing our investments on actual people we re so scared corporations will abandon us that we ve seemingly voted to abandon each other starting with the most vulnerable we ve decided a corporate giveaway that hasn t and won t create jobs is more important than simply funding the services that educate our children or care for elders or provide for the disabled or keep our neighbours healthy and for what shareholder giveaways the dream of an industry that will never be what it once was the idea that the world is out to get us all signs point to life getting even tougher in alberta as the science of oil and climate prepare to officially fact bomb the hell out of our feelings and whether we re ready to admit it the provincial bank account will be the least of our problems as those coming realities take further hold we have to decide what we truly want from our government do we want one that feeds us lines about all the six figure jobs they re going to get us while it gives away the farm or do we want one that ensures your essentials are in place once that six figure job moves to denver we ve spent far too long believing the government is here to prop up the economy it s time we realize that what they re supposed to do is protect us from it scott schmidt is the layout editor at the medicine hat news contact him at sschmidt medicinehatnews com all opinions are his own and do not

liu he left and us president donald trump display the signed trade agreement between the us and china pic afp beijing china s gdp grew by 6 1 per cent last year the lowest in 29 years the government said on friday as sluggish domestic demand and the bruising 18 month trade war with the us seriously impacted the world s second largest economy the new gdp data released by the national bureau of statistics nbs comes a day after china and the us signed a long awaited phase one deal marking a ceasefire in the 18 month trade war which saw the world s two largest economies slap 25 per cent tariffs on about half a trillion dollar worth of each other s exports china s economy grew by 6 1 per cent last year its worst performance since 1990 but it remained above the psychologically important six per cent mark the gdp growth remained well within the 6 to 6 5 target set by the government the nbs said however significant from the chinese government s perspective the gdp expanded to usd 14 38 trillion from last year s usd 13 1 trillion in 2018 china s economy sank to a 28 year low slowing down to 6 6 per cent year on year lower than the 6 8 per cent growth registered in 2017 as

stable the quality of development has been improving with major targets being met laying a solid foundation for completing the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects ning jizhe director of the nbs said at a press conference there is a sense of relief among the officials here as the official growth rate remained above the psychologically important 6 per cent as mandated by chinese president xi jinping who in the past directed that gdp should not go down below six per cent which could cause serious disruption to the world s second largest economy although the 6 1 per cent growth rate is china s weakest expansion in almost three decades it is much higher than other leading economies the us central bank for example has forecast that the american economy will grow by around 2 2 per cent this year chinese economy was hit hard by the us tariffs as a result of the trade war between the two countries after signing the phase one deal on wednesday us president donald trump said 25 per cent tariff hike on usd 360 billion worth of chinese products would continue until the phase 2 deal is worked out advertisement the phase one deal is only an interim agreement between china and the us in fact to push for negotiation in the next stage the us will keep existing tariffs on imports from china unless the two countries manage to reach a phase two deal said alicia garcia herrero chief asia pacific economist at natixis in the bilateral evaluation and dispute resolution chapter the agreement also makes it clear that if the concerns cannot be resolved the two parties hold the right to suspend an obligation adopt a remedial measure or in the worst case withdraw from the agreement he told the south china morning post despite falling to a new low since 1990 when political turmoil drove economic growth down to 3 9 per cent the 6 1 per cent rate met the target range of between 6 0 per cent and 6 5 per cent set by the central government at the beginning of
