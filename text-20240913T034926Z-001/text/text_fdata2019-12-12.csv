by andrew pease signs point to a mini cycle recovery in 2020 with central bank easing in particular helping to stave off short term recession fears hold the epitaphs this aging cycle seems likely to last beyond 2020 this time last year it appeared that u s federal reserve fed tightening the china u s trade war and diminishing economic slack1 could push the u s dangerously close to recession by the end of 2019 at times during the year recession seemed possible as global manufacturing contracted and the u s yield curve inverted however central bank easing the de escalation in the trade war and tentative green shoots in global manufacturing suggest we might be on the cusp of another mini cycle recovery through the first half of 2020 the chart below shows the percentage of central banks from a sample of 32 that have lowered interest rates over the past three months 2019 has seen the largest amount of central bank easing since the 2008 financial crisis the interrupted cycle has the following asset class implications for 2020 equities should outperform bonds higher long term bond yields though the rise should be limited by muted inflation pressures and central banks remaining on hold steeper yield curves a weaker u s dollar given its countercyclical nature non u s to outperform u s equities given the more cyclical nature of non u s stocks and their relative valuation advantage pro cyclical value stocks should beat both growth and low volatility stocks main risks a step back in china u s trade relations and the outcome of the u s presidential election are among the key risks that could accelerate the timing of the next recession the main risks to our 2020 outlook in order of importance are a re escalation in the trade war that delivers a fatal blow to global business confidence investment spending and global supply chains central banks resume hiking if they believe the growth risks have passed and inflation pressures are building the u s presidential election where the victory of a progressive democrat such as either u s senator elizabeth warren or bernie sanders could trigger a policy shift that is negative for corporate profits other geopolitical risks such as an escalation of hong kong unrest which triggers an aggressive china response and subsequent global sanctions on china or actions by iran that threaten global oil supply regarding the trade war our view is that both china and the u s have incentives to reach a phase 1 deal soon u s president donald trump would like to declare victory in the trade war ahead of his 2020 re election bid he also needs to lift the economic threat that the trade war poses to the near term outlook president xi jinping of china is balancing the short term requirement for economic stimulus against the medium term need to reduce debt levels in the chinese economy he would like to limit the risk of a further trade shock he will probably take a devil you know approach to the u s election and not want to undermine trump s reelection through trade war escalation the alternative would be to possibly face a progressive democrat who could bring a much sharper focus on human rights and the environment to trade negotiations the last innings of this cycle central banks will probably need to tighten monetary policy by 2021 to combat inflation which should bring about an end to the long running economic expansion the central bank easing of 2019 may prolong the aged cycle but this could be the final mini cycle before the turning point of the major cycle potentially in 2021 the main reason for the longevity of this cycle has been the persistence of economic slack this has allowed the u s and other developed economies to grow without generating significant inflation pressure this has deterred the fed from lifting interest rates by enough to cause a recession the trade war has been a cycle extending global deflationary shock in that it forced the fed and other central banks to reverse previous tightening before monetary policy became restrictive economic slack however is limited at this advanced stage of the cycle nowhere is this more apparent than in the united states where the 3 5 unemployment rate for november 2019 is at levels last seen in the 1960s and wage pressures are building it s likely that central bankers worried about secular stagnation and japanification2 will take a cautious approach to the next tightening phase and wait until inflation is clearly lifting before acting tighter monetary policy will eventually be required either by late 2020 or early 2021 which we believe should ultimately push the global economy into recession bull bear scenarios our baseline scenario calls for a thaw in the trade war as well as a recharged economy but an escalation in trade tensions could easily send things into a downward spiral our subjective probabilities on the following three scenarios for the next 12 months suggest some caution is warranted bull 35 a trade deal sets the scene for a deeper agreement on intellectual property rights and market openness uncertainty clears purchasing managers index pmi surveys rebound as monetary

into a mild recession pmis decrease corporate earnings suffer a double digit decline we re giving the bear scenario a significant 25 probability despite our bias toward a glass half full 2020 outlook there are several factors that suggest an elevated risk of a recession and bear market this year s inversion of the u s yield curve the damage already sustained to business confidence and global supply chains from the trade war high corporate debt levels that create vulnerability to rising interest rates or declining profits the signal that concerns us most is flashing from the business cycle indicator bci model this model estimates u s recession probabilities based on the yield curve credit spreads bank credit risk consumption growth and employment the bci forecasts a 33 probability of recession in one year which extends slightly above the model s warning threshold the rising recession probability looks similar to the model s predictions in mid 2006 prior to the 2008 financial crisis we suspect the model is overestimating recession risk given the lack of consistent yield curve inversion the 10 year 3 month curve has spent most of 2019 inverted but the 10 year 2 year curve was only very briefly inverted in september we also suspect that the three insurance rate cuts by the fed and the easing in trade tensions have reduced recession risks there are similarities to 1998 when the yield curve inverted but recession was avoided the fed quickly cut rates three times and the issues that triggered recession fears in 1998 the asian economic crisis the russian bond crisis and the long term capital management collapse turned out to be less damaging than feared the challenge of investing late in the cycle is that the upside for equity markets is likely smaller than the downside the last five bear markets saw the s p 500Ã¢ index fall by an average of 43 an optimistic assessment would give global equities at most low double digit upside this asymmetry adds a degree of caution to the outlook regional snapshots we expect a rebound in growth across the eurozone and the uk as political uncertainty fades while economic growth in china is likely to remain unchanged united states fed rate cuts and the easing of the business sentiment drag from the china u s trade war should support the u s economy over 2020 there will be headwinds from the fading of the 2017 trump tax cuts and lingering uncertainty over future tariff policy low inflation should keep the fed on hold during 2020 although it may move to a tightening bias by year end if bond market inflation expectations rise toward 2 2 from their current 1 7 we expect non farm payrolls growth to remain above 100 000 per month which should lower the unemployment rate to levels not seen since the korean war in the early 1950s a fed on hold and improving economy should lead to higher treasury yields and a steeper yield curve the 10 year treasury yield could rise to around 2 25 the november presidential election is likely to be a major source of uncertainty low unemployment and trend economic growth favor trump s reelection the democrat frontrunners in the primary race all favor at least a partial repeal of the 2017 corporate tax cuts which would have negative implications for corporate earnings growth in 2021 eurozone europe s exposure to trade and reliance on manufacturing made it a casualty of the trade war and the global downturn in automobile production 2019 saw the european central bank ecb take policy rates further negative and re start quantitative easing the eurozone should benefit in 2020 from easier monetary conditions the recovery in global manufacturing the lifting of trade war uncertainty and chinese policy stimulus that increases import demand from emerging markets the easing of political risk is also a boost to the outlook this time last year italian 10 year government bond btp yields were heading toward 4 and creating concerns about the solvency of italian banks btp yields are under 1 2 in late 2019 mirroring declines across southern europe and supporting financial conditions this is being reflected in declining non performing bank loans across spain and italy the potential lifting of brexit uncertainty is also a positive overall we look for a gradual pick up in growth across the eurozone during 2020 the absence of inflation pressure means the ecb is unlikely to consider lifting interest rates united kingdom the lifting of brexit uncertainty and increased fiscal stimulus should support the u k economy in 2020 both major parties in the december 12 general election are proposing pathways to brexit resolution and the end of fiscal austerity the conservatives are offering a relatively quick and clear path to brexit albeit with uncertainty about the future trading relationship with europe a labour administration most likely in a minority government opens the possibility of a second referendum and a potential remain outcome a significant boost from fiscal policy is likely regardless of the election outcome which would reverse a decade of deficit reducing austerity labour is proposing a radical program of public investment while the conservatives more modest plans would still represent an economic boost a post election economic revival combined with low unemployment and relatively high inflation could have the bank of england considering policy tightening by the end of 2020 japan japan s economy is suffering the after effects of the consumption tax hike on october 1 and its exposure to the global manufacturing downturn the uncertainty around the china u s trade negotiations as well as japan s own tensions with south korea have weighed on economic sentiment easing trade tensions and an improvement in global manufacturing should support japan s economy as will a boost to spending and tourism from hosting the 2020 olympics there is also speculation that prime minister shinzÃ¥ abe s administration will launch a sizeable fiscal stimulus japan however is likely to remain an economic laggard relative to other developed economies and we expect persistent disinflationary pressures will keep the bank of japan in ultra accommodative mode china chinese policy makers are balancing the short term requirement for stimulus against the medium term necessity to reduce leverage in the economy the net result is that stimulus will likely be modest enough to stabilize or provide a small boost to the chinese economy but smaller than the previous stimulus episodes in 2016 and 2012 credit growth is unlikely to accelerate sharply but the authorities have already reduced bank reserve requirements and cut policy rates they are also likely to increase local government bond issuance to boost infrastructure spending gross domestic product gdp growth however is unlikely to rebound and should remain near 6 australia new zealand the outlook for the australian economy remains soft we expect consumers will remain cautious given high debt levels and slow wage growth potential income tax cuts could provide a boost but a sluggish economy will have the reserve bank of australia considering another interest rate cut business confidence in new zealand is at the lowest levels since the 2018 financial crisis and we expect further rate cuts from the reserve bank of new zealand canada the bank of canada boc has been an outlier it has the highest policy rate among the group of seven3 countries and has resisted cutting rates despite softening global and domestic economic conditions the hesitation is in part due to fears of stoking increased household debt although the housing market has reaccelerated lackluster consumer and investment trends should eventually force the boc to consider rate cuts asset class preferences we expect global equities to fare better than government bonds in 2020 our cycle value and sentiment investment decision making process in late 2019 has become more optimistic on global equities and is shifting toward a negative view on government bonds our equity sentiment measures are becoming over bought but the signals are not yet strong enough to offset positive price momentum we have a small underweight preference for u s equities in a global portfolio driven mostly by relatively expensive valuation but also because the cycle conditions appear firmer outside of

a first national presentation of this book took place in rabat on saturday 26 october 2019 this publication is the result of an action oriented research study carried out in five major agricultural regions of morocco namely loukkos in the north gharb on the ouest tadla in the middle atlas souss and draa in the south the results of this study are presented in the context of the increasing food dependency due to neoliberal choices advocated by the international financial institutions such as imf imf international monetary fund along with the world bank the imf was founded on the day the bretton woods agreements were signed its first mission was to support the new system of standard exchange rates when the bretton wood fixed rates system came to an end in 1971 the main function of the imf became that of being both policeman and fireman for global capital it acts as policeman when it enforces its structural adjustment policies and as fireman when it steps in to help out governments in risk of defaulting on debt repayments as for the world bank a weighted voting system operates depending on the amount paid as contribution by each member state 85 of the votes is required to modify the imf charter which means that the usa with 17 68 of the votes has a de facto veto on any change the institution is dominated by five countries the united states 16 74 japan 6 23 germany 5 81 france 4 29 and the uk 4 29 the other 183 member countries are divided into groups led by one country the most important one 6 57 of the votes is led by belgium the least important group of countries 1 55 of the votes is led by gabon and brings together african countries and wb world bank wb the world bank was founded as part of the new international monetary system set up at bretton woods in 1944 its capital is provided by member states contributions and loans on the international money markets it financed public and private projects in third world and east european countries it consists of several closely associated institutions among which 1 the international bank for reconstruction and development ibrd 189 members in 2017 which provides loans in productive sectors such as farming or energy 2 the international development association ida 159 members in 1997 which provides less advanced countries with long term loans 35 40 years at very low interest 1 3 the international finance corporation ifc which provides both loan and equity finance for business ventures in developing countries as third world debt gets worse the world bank along with the imf tends to adopt a macro economic perspective for instance it enforces adjustment policies that are intended to balance heavily indebted countries payments the world bank advises those countries that have to undergo the imf s therapy on such matters as how to reduce budget deficits round up savings enduce foreign investors to settle within their borders or free prices and exchange rates as well as the wto wto world trade organisation the wto founded on 1st january 1995 replaced the general agreement on trade and tariffs gatt the main innovation is that the wto enjoys the status of an international organization its role is to ensure that no member states adopt any kind of protectionism whatsoever in order to accelerate the liberalization global trading and to facilitate the strategies of the multinationals it has an international court the dispute settlement body which judges any alleged violations of its founding text drawn up in marrakesh indeed the green morocco plan aims to support the exporting agribusiness sector and pays little attention to ensuring food supply for our population subsidies and tax incentives are designed to maximize the profits of large agro capital the impoverishment of small farmers is accelerating they are losing their land water resources and the environment is worsening the trade food balance balance end of year statement of a company s assets what the company possesses and liabilities what it owes in other words the assets provide information about how the funds collected by the company have been used and the liabilities about the origins of those funds is increasingly in deficit and contributes to an alarming public debt austerity policies have a serious impact on the working classes and employees attac cadtm morocco presents this study to the general public interested in the agricultural issue and agrarian reform in our country trade unions associations women s organizations youth organizations political organizations small farmers fishermen agricultural workers agronomists researchers its aim is to initiate a broad debate on possible alternatives including the control of producers over their production tools and the establishment of another agricultural policy based on meeting basic food needs and an equitable redistribution of land and resources and respect for the environment food sovereignty as alternative is therefore an urgent priority in our country pending the complete translation of this study we present hereby the introduction of our book the book cover introduction the attac cadtm morocco has carried out on the field this study to assess the impacts of liberal agricultural policy a policy that established conditions to put land water and other natural resources under the control of the major capitalists this policy aims to provide them with public subsidies and tax incentives to produce intensive export crops very depleting for the soil their revenues cover only about 47 of food imports on average over a ten year period from 2008 to 2017 a period known as the implementation of the green morocco plan cereals account for more than a third of these imports the main pillar of this plan is the creation of large integrated farms the aggregators of the green morocco plan agricultural commercial industrial and export to which the majority of small and medium farmers are subjected intensifying the process of their impoverishment although they still resist to produce subsistence foodstuffs completely marginalized by the plan these aggregators also exploit agricultural workers within the most severe conditions some of them legally endorsed by the current labour code this study comes in a specific context mainly characterized by the state s offensive through its legal arsenal which aims to facilitate the appropriation by the large capitalists of land belonging to ethnic communities mobilization of one million hectares of this land to implement agricultural investment projects including the registration of 5 million hectares by 2020 to facilitate private appropriation continue the grabbing of forest lands through administrative plan called the delimitation of the forest domain plan develop capitalist export investment projects concerning argan trees in the regions of the southwest particularly the regions of souss and essaouira and the destruction of the traditions of its collective exploitation project to plant 10 000 hectares of agricultural argan trees develop pastoral areas for the benefit of the large nomads who own camel and cattle herds promulgation of law n 13 113 on pastoral transhumance the development and management of pastoral and sylvopastoral areas the state has also consolidated its repressive and judicial measures to repress demonstrations by small farmers and the affected population arrests and trials of activists organized in response to this capitalist attack in the regions of souss south east west sidi slimane midelt tadla bÃ©ni mellal and khÃ©nifra and rif in the cities of casablanca on 25 november 2018 rabat on 17 february 2019 and tiznit on 24 march 2019 national marches were organized to denounce the various violations by the state concerning collective rights to land forests rangelands mining and other resources on the initiative of the akal land coordination to defend populations right to land and wealth the scale of the demonstrations showed the popular will to continue the struggle and as a result several local coordinations were set up in the souss regions and even among moroccans living abroad this study is based on a field survey covering five major agricultural regions draa souss tadla el gharb and loukkos and on discussions resulting from broader regional meetings held within these regions with small farmers and agricultural workers as well as other stakeholders on the effects of this agricultural mode based mainly on profits generation for capitalist minority at the expense of the majority of the popular classes the study also sets out the elements of a possible alternative based on the notion of food sovereignty the first chapter contains summaries of the field survey conducted with small farmers and a comparison between results obtained in five agro regions the first outcome that emerged clearly was the extent suffering of small farmers due to the high illiteracy rate and the lack of basic health and social security services pensions and medical coverage and the necessary infrastructure roads etc which as a result led to the deterioration of their economic and social situation this reveals the fallacy of the official propaganda that the green morocco plan in agriculture contributes to the promotion of the rural population despite their low annual income and intense poverty we feel an overwhelming sense of pride and dignity in them indeed they struggle on a daily basis to meet the needs of their families despite difficult circumstances they always resist to preserve their status of producers attach importance to their food crops food crops crops destined to feed local populations millet manioc etc as opposed to cash crops destined for export coffee cocoa tea groundnuts sugar etc and demonstrate their efficiency in guaranteeing a healthy diet that exploits small areas with a large water saving preserves the fertility of the soil plant and animal diversity and is able to adapt to and respect the environment we have witnessed among these small farmers their ability to acquire collective knowledge experiences and cultures that they share share a unit of ownership interest in a corporation or financial asset representing one part of the total capital stock its owner a shareholder is entitled to receive an equal distribution of any profits distributed a dividend and to attend shareholder meetings in solidarity and in perfect balance with their environment and wealth for centuries however they express deep concern about the ongoing destruction of all these gains and accumulations as well as the robbing of their territories resources by outsiders owning capital and power and driven by the greed of rapid gain in addition these small farmers are facing increasing difficulty in selling their food products in markets dominated by low priced imported products and controlled by intermediaries they bitterly talk about their lack of self organization and most of them have expressed their willingness to join any initiative that can help them organize themselves since they have nothing more to lose to better illustrate this general situation the second chapter focuses on the problems experienced by small farmers and their claims in each of the five regions covered by the field study draa souss tadla el gharb and loukkos we have also added the results of regional meetings we have organized in these same regions indeed once the field study was completed attac cadtm morocco organized regional meetings on food sovereignty two meetings in december 2018 in skoura and agadir and two others in february 2019 in beni mellal and sidi slimane to share the results of the field study and deepen the discussion with the concerned parties during the investigation small farmers described a multitude of problems they suffer from and expressed fears about this global destruction that affects them as producers and rural citizens because of official agricultural policies that support and marginalize the big capitalists but most of them however through their demands only vaguely question agricultural policy it seems that a certain individualism is beginning to win their ranks and the values of collective work and mutual assistance among community members to defend their rights have declined similarly the negative effects of the lack of accumulation of militant experience and the weakness of union and association work are apparent indeed only a minority of them expressed the need to adopt an agricultural policy alternative to the export oriented capitalist model namely one that is based on the production of basic consumption needs and encourages local food crops it should be noted that the alternative of food sovereignty and agrarian reform still require collective efforts and discussions so that they can be assimilated by farmers and agricultural workers however the regional meetings on food sovereignty revealed ideas put forward in relation to those expressed in the individual interviews in the field surveys in addition they revealed concrete potential militant capacities through spaces and workshops that allowed the real opinions of the different participants to be freely expressed the third chapter discusses the results of the field study on agricultural workers working on farms and packing stations belonging to export companies mainly based in the souss region where the agricultural commercial industrial and export model is concentrated in fact the survey reveals the over exploitation of agricultural workers particularly women who are victims of all types of oppression and harassment there is also a large layer that works in conditions similar to slavery they are daily agricultural workers offering their naked arms daily at dawn in the mawkef which is a kind of job exchange at well known labour concentration points in the region and we found that most of the workers came from other agricultural regions of morocco where the process of impoverishment of small farmers has accelerated pushing them to abandon their land and migrate in search of work we have also observed a general tendency to settle in the souss region where they are forced to accept conditions of over exploitation in order to be able to start families and incur debt to supplement living and housing costs which their low wages do not cover they live among poor douars lacking the least essential infrastructure such as roads sanitation health services etc as modern air conditioned trucks leave farms and packing stations loaded with vegetables and fruit for foreign markets on a daily basis thousands of farm workers are crammed into trucks or death tractors frequent fatal traffic accidents that transport them to production units that do not meet basic health and safety work regulations wages and social security the few social achievements come from the struggles of agricultural workers and the extension of trade union work in the region including the experience of the national federation of the agricultural sector under the moroccan labour union mainly to defend trade union rights employers are supported by the state through the promulgation of a labour code based on flexibility mediation temporary work and the facilitation of dismissal procedures agricultural workers suffer legal discrimination in minimum wages and working hours the labour inspectorate has no binding power and the courts turn a blind eye to abuses by employers the state imposed agricultural model resembles a mill used to crush human beings for capitalist purposes from which only a minority will benefit the fourth chapter presents the manifestations of this model of impoverishment of small farmers and the control of agricultural land and water resources by big capitalists this capitalist penetration is part of the state s plan to mobilize land for investment and regularize the legal situation of land belonging to ethnic communities and the forest sector this will then make it possible to grant them to major projects in agriculture tourism real estate mining and quarrying it is also part of the national water plan which has implemented huge projects to support the land grabbing process this plan provides for the creation of irrigation water transfer channels from water rich regions to arid regions the continuation of the policy of dams for export crops desalination of seawater and the development of an institutional framework to cover this control over water resources as a result the demands protests of small farmers and the rural population have increased as a result of these expansionist plans in several regions of morocco and the state has responded with repression arrests and trials the agricultural financial commercial industrial and export oriented model is being introduced under the sponsorship of the state services and the ministry of agriculture through the imposition of production and consumption patterns similar to the model applied in the major capitalist countries hybrid seeds certified seedlings and livestock breeds and large nurseries are then imposed and generalized this leads therefore to the destruction of the rest of the indigenous genetic heritage accumulated by small farmers multinational corporations have monopolized seed production in the name of intellectual property and patents and the moroccan government has ensured that a whole legal arsenal is in place to protect the rights of investors it has also promulgated a law on distinctive signs of origin and quality sdoq for foodstuffs agricultural and fisheries products this has facilitated the capture of the local wealth of small farmers such as argan dates and saffron this type of seed and trees promoted by multinationals is based on agricultural techniques that promote the destruction of the earth and the depletion of water and on the massive use of chemical fertilizers and toxic pesticides as well as livestock and poultry breeds which consume large quantities of fodder antibiotics and hormones it is also based on high consumption of fossil energy oil gas and butane which in turn contributes to the increase in the greenhouse effect and climate change this leads to natural disasters such as drought and floods this is in addition to polluted wastes from packaging storage and cooling stations food industry plants plastic waste as well as all kinds of packaging pesticide drums and bottles etc in short the logic of profit profit the positive gain yielded from a company s activity net profit is profit after tax distributable profit is the part of the net profit which can be distributed to the shareholders goes against the requirements of energy saving and environmental protection the state has put in place an integrated system of financial subsidies for the agricultural sector at both production and marketing levels to encourage export crops in irrigated areas which represent only 17 per cent of the total agricultural area while it has marginalized rain fed fed federal reserve officially federal reserve system is the united states central bank created in 1913 by the federal reserve act also called the owen glass act after a series of banking crises particularly the bank panic of 1907 fed decentralized central bank areas where the production of basic food products such as cereals and pulses is concentrated about 60 per cent indeed the system of subsidies is a system of looting public funds by big capitalists and commercial agricultural companies as a result small farmers are trapped by the expansion of a capitalistic agrarian mode of production that destroys them as producers marginalizes them as rural inhabitants and violates their dignity as citizens this mode has its foundations in french colonization and continued after formal independence by the political regime in place in order to create an agricultural bourgeoisie by granting it the majority of reclaimed agricultural land more than 1 million hectares and allowing it to take advantage of the dam policy the law on agricultural investments subsidies and tax exemptions etc this is what the fifth chapter attempts to analyse given that major agricultural investments required colossal public funding even though the country was exhausted by the colonial period and its budget was largely in deficit this was when the international financial institutions intervened through a series of preferential credits that led to the outbreak of the public debt crisis in the late 1970s several factors contributed to the outbreak of this crisis namely the increase in the interest interest an amount paid in remuneration of an investment or received by a lender interest is calculated on the amount of the capital invested or borrowed the duration of the operation and the rate that has been set rate by the us treasury and the fall in the prices of raw materials and agricultural products on the world market morocco has been unable to pay off its external debt service debt service the sum of the interests and the amortization of the capital borrowed to governments and foreign banks on this basis the international monetary fund intervened to set up the structural adjustment structural adjustment economic policies imposed by the imf in exchange of new loans or the rescheduling of old loans structural adjustments policies were enforced in the early 1980 to qualify countries for new loans or for debt rescheduling by the imf and the world bank the requested kind of adjustment aims at ensuring that the country can again service its external debt structural adjustment usually combines the following elements devaluation of the national currency in order to bring down the prices of exported goods and attract strong currencies rise in interest rates in order to attract international capital reduction of public expenditure streamlining of public services staff reduction of budgets devoted to education and the health sector etc massive privatisations reduction of public subsidies to some companies or products freezing of salaries to avoid inflation as a consequence of deflation these saps have not only substantially contributed to higher and higher levels of indebtedness in the affected countries they have simultaneously led to higher prices because of a high vat rate and of the free market prices and to a dramatic fall in the income of local populations as a consequence of rising unemployment and of the dismantling of public services among other factors imf plan sap which was spread over the period 1983 1993 this has led to a new liberal phase characterized by privatization reduction of social budgets and support for the prices of basic consumer products wage freezes etc these austerity measures led to three popular revolts during this decade in 1981 1984 and 1990 the agricultural sector sap contained the same measures namely the privatization of public agricultural enterprises the liberalization of production and selling prices reductions in state subsidies etc the essence of this policy was to provide highly selective support to the private sector to promote major agricultural investments and export crops the liberal opening process deepened with morocco s accession to the world trade organization in 1995 as well as the ratification of a series of free trade agreements with the world s imperialist poles the european union entered into force in 2000 the united states 2006 and several other countries these agreements cover not only trade issues but also political and security issues as well as relocations the service sector privatization and the free movement of capital these colonial agreements opened morocco s borders to commodities commodities the goods exchanged on the commodities market traditionally raw materials such as metals and fuels and cereals and speculative capital on the one hand and the expatriation of profits on the other this has further intensified the trade deficit and deepened the looting and food dependence of our country the recurrent global food crisis over the period 2007 2011 which is one of the main dimensions of the 2007 2008 global capitalist crisis has led to rising prices for basic consumer products and popular demonstrations defending purchasing power in several cities and countryside in morocco this is a balance sheet of the liberal formulas imposed on us by the current regime the world trade organization and the world bank these liberal principles are confirmed in the bank s 2008 report on development in agriculture and it is precisely in this context that the green morocco plan in agriculture in 2008 based on the development of large capitalist export groups aggregations that will benefit from a large part of the financing while the mass of small farmers will be marginalized and will only benefit from a minimal part within the framework of what is called solidarity agriculture this will make them dependent on large groups through their crop and livestock production chains the green morocco plan required a total investment of 104 billion dirhams throughout the ten years 2008 2018 from which solidarity agriculture benefited only 15 billion dirhams while the food deficit increased during this period indeed the average annual values of food imports reached 42 billion dirhams including cereals representing 34 5 while those of food exports reached 19 7 billion dirhams including fresh tomatoes and citrus fruits representing 32 morocco s increasing food dependence reveals the nature of the agricultural financial commercial industrial and export led model which tends only to generate profits on behalf of a minority of exporters who benefit from subsidies and fund their overseas bank accounts through capital flight they are the same people who speculate on imports of cereals and other food products this has contributed specifically to the increase in public debt which has reached 83 of gdp gdp gross domestic product gross domestic product is an aggregate measure of total production within a given territory equal to the sum of the gross values added the measure is notoriously incomplete for example it does not take into account any activity that does not enter into a commercial exchange the gdp takes into account both the production of goods and the production of services economic growth is defined as the variation of the gdp from one period to another and whose service absorbs the equivalent of 10 times the health budget and about 3 times the education budget and if these neoliberal choices have been imposed on us by international financial institutions and other imperialist decision making centers they are legitimized by representative institutions that do not reflect popular aspirations under the aegis of a despotic political regime the latter facilitates the control of a small number of families attached to power over wealth in partnership with speculative foreign capitalists who benefit from portfolio investments and facilities to export their profits small farmers and agricultural workers have expressed to us their aspirations for a democratic horizon that guarantees guarantees acts that provide a creditor with security in complement to the debtor s commitment a distinction is made between real guarantees lien pledge mortgage prior charge and personal guarantees surety aval letter of intent independent guarantee them dignity freedom justice and the desire to snatch their rights they are beginning to have confidence in their unity and organization to stop the process of their destruction and satisfy their demands in the context of protests and struggles in morocco there is therefore an urgent need to intensify collective discussions in wide spaces on possible alternatives to the dominant agricultural and food model and in order to enrich the reflection it seems useful to familiarize oneself with the international experiences reported in the sixth chapter and mainly those of la via campesina an international peasant movement and the lessons that can be drawn from them taking into consideration the particularities of our country to identify the main axes of our demands and the means of building from below a movement of peasants fishermen and agricultural workers la via campesina lvc was founded in 1993 as part of the mobilization against the negotiating rounds of the general agreement on tariffs and trade 1986 1994 lvc which organizes more than 200 million small farmers in 81 countries around the world has accumulated a long experience of struggle study and field work on the popular agricultural alternative of food sovereignty food sovereignty is the right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced with sustainable methods and the right of peoples to define their own agricultural and food systems while placing the aspirations and needs of those who produce distribute and consume food at the heart of food policies rather than the demands of markets and multinationals food sovereignty is based on a comprehensive and holistic agrarian reform that guarantees farmers the full right to land water and natural resources it is also based on the adoption of policies that stimulate food agriculture as well as technological models that increase agricultural production without damaging the health of farmers and the population while preserving natural resources this means the intensification of ecological agriculture agro ecology as a form of production that respects natural cycles and can slow climate change conserve biodiversity and reduce pollution this agrarian reform will only be achieved if it is based on social organizations built from below while including it in the most inclusive demands for an alternative society demands that bring together large popular sectors within the framework of a global grassroots mobilization thus food sovereignty is not limited to meeting the needs of consumption of local and healthy products and does not only concern farmers in fact it provides on the basis of agricultural and food issues the necessary foundations for the construction of an emancipatory project for a democratic society indeed the general conclusions of the regional meetings showed that collective discussions in our country at their current phase are not far from the alternative of food sovereignty they also revealed concrete opportunities to build alliances on the basis of joint action involving small farmers fishermen pastoralists livestock breeders farm workers women youth as well as trade union and community activists in villages and cities to fight against the agricultural financial commercial industrial and export model against the dominant destructive consumption model and for a healthy and ecological food model it is in this sense that our contribution as attac cadtm morocco is made via this field study to support the debate on the possible agricultural alternative and to promote people s camp alliance s for food sovereignty in our country this study attempted to convey the concrete effects of the agro exporting model on small farmers and agricultural workers in order to reflect their main problems as they presented them their views on the agricultural policies adopted and how they perceive solutions to their suffering it also tried to place this set in an analytical context of the overall liberal choices adopted by the state in conjunction with the international financial institutions it does not claim to identify all the issues raised by the acceleration of the penetration of large national and foreign capital into the agricultural sector at this stage of our country s economic and social development in the light of its integration into the world capitalist system and its impact by its crises this study represents a modest first effort and should be developed in various areas such as land water forest and sea as for the latter attac cadtm morocco organization will undertake a related field study on coastal fishing and deep sea fishing as far as possible to get closer to the situation of this social layer being a major element of food sovereignty governed by the same capitalist logic as the green morocco plan through the halieutis plan relating to the fishing sector the alternative of food sovereignty must be further examined in the light of the particularities of our reality and the concrete extension of the components of popular agrarian reform and agro ecology it is also necessary to deepen reflection and debate on appropriate organizational forms in order to build a strong movement from below away from the traditions of supervision from above and to develop these forms of organization by linking them to international activist networks and experiences and in particular la via compesina and also at regional level by supporting the efforts to build the north african network for food sovereignty
overview with the fomc meeting delivering no surprises attention turns to the ecb meeting as the uk goes to the polls lagarde will hold her first press conference as ecb president today and it will naturally command attention equities are advancing today and tech appears to be leading the way in asia pacific taiwan and south korea rallied more than 1 while the hang seng gapped higher to almost its best level in three weeks europe s dow jones stoxx 600 is up for the second consecutive session and it is being led by information technology us shares are trading firmer after the s p gained about 0 3 yesterday bond yields are mostly lower though some in the european periphery are sticky and the us 10 year yield has edged back above 1 80 the dollar is soft but mostly consolidating the post fed drop emerging market currencies are mostly firmer and if the jp morgan emerging market currency index holds on to its minor gains it would be the eighth advancing session in the past ten gold s three day rally is at risk as the upper end of the 1450 1475 holds oil prices are little changed and the january wti contract continues to straddle the 59 a barrel level asia pacific president trump is to meet with his team today to discuss the tariffs threatened for december 15 the conflicting signals from the officials may be designed to keep pressure on beijing however the market appears to assume for the most part that new levies will be delayed this means that the implementation would likely elicit a more dramatic response than the suspension it is also not clear when the announcement will be made some expect it as early as today but the risk is that the official word is not made until after the markets close tomorrow japan s october core machinery orders plunged 6 it is the fourth consecutive monthly decline and shocked economists the median forecast in the bloomberg survey called for a 0 5 gain the year over year contraction deepened to 6 1 from a 5 1 gain in september this underscores the weakness in capex which also will likely be reflected in tomorrow s tankan survey the world s third largest economy appears to be contracting by around 2 7 3 0 this quarter at an annualized pace india s inflation is due shortly it is expected to have accelerated to 5 3 in november a three month high from 4 6 in october over the last seven sessions the 10 year benchmark yield

to jpy108 85 there are two expiring options to note one is at jpy108 70 for around 450 mln and the other is at jpy109 for almost 390 mln the australian dollar is building on yesterday s nearly 1 gain the largest in two months it tested 0 6800 on tuesday and is nearing 0 6900 today there is an option stuck at 0 6875 for about a 575 that will be cut today the 200 day moving average that has turned back counter trend rallies this year is found near 0 6910 china s yuan continues to move sideways in narrow ranges for the fourth session the net change is less than 0 1 europe there is a sense of great continuity between draghi and lagarde the obvious comparison is bernanke and yellen however that continuity puts even more emphasis on management and communication style and here we are likely to see a marked difference lagarde is comfortable in english and arguably more at ease with the press collaboration also seems to be a strong suit and seemingly in contrast to draghi or so his critics argue this is not to play down the real differences between the creditor and debtor nations or between the small and large countries instead many central banks have divisions but have found ways to overcome divisions insofar as there are dissenting opinions that are formally incorporated in the decision making record the ecb like the federal reserve is engaged in a comprehensive review of the monetary policy framework the results will likely be a highlight in next year the staff forecasts will be updated and these will draw some interest as well in the uk 650 seats of the house of commons are at stake today but not really in 2015 17 of the seats actually changed hands and in the 2017 election about 10 did although some polls have shown the race tightening as the election drew near the market is still expecting a sufficient tory majority to push through brexit sterling has reached nine month highs as the voting begins there seem to be two risks one is obvious the polls are wrong and it is a much tighter contest and the tories are denied a majority sterling would come off hard the second is that the tories do win but the news has mostly been anticipated and after what may be a quick flurry it comes off amid buy the rumor sell the fact type of activity two other central banks at opposite ends of the risk spectrum also draw attention today first the swiss national bank met and as widely expected remained on hold it threatened to continue to intervene as necessary and sees global risks tilted to the downside the euro made highs for the year against the swiss franc in april near chf1 1470 it trended lower to reach the year s low in august around chf1 08 for the last two months the euro has traded mostly between chf1 0860 and chf1 1050 the swiss franc would likely a safe haven of choice if the us china tariff truce ends the other central bank is turkey inflation continues to trend lower every month beginning with april turkey s monthly cpi was less than the same month in 2018 the central bank has slashed rates since the first cut in july the one week repo rate peaked at 24 and after four consecutive moves counting today s larger than expected 200 bp cut it now stands at 12 0 most were expecting a 150 bp cut cumulative monthly cpi prints show cpi running near 10 5 this year and this leaves the real rate around 1 5 which does not appear to compensate for the risks and may leave the lira vulnerable the lira softened in the immediate aftermath of the larger than expected cut the euro reached almost 1 1145 today as it tries to extend its rally into a fourth session last month s high was near 1 1175 but ahead of it the 200 day moving average 1 1155 is found and the euro has not traded above in six months there is an option for almost 720 mln euros at 1 1125 that is expiring today and that area offers initial support there is also an option for about 675 mln euros at 1 12 that will be cut sterling is straddling 1 32 today there is a nearly billion sterling option struck there gbp930 mln expiring today initial support near 1 3180 was successfully tested in the european and the market demand for sterling does not appear satiated there is a smaller option at 1 3250 for about gbp240 mln that suggests the next upside target america the federal reserve did not surprise but the dollar and bonds rallied as some saw a dovish leaning powell suggested that while policy is on hold the bar to a cut is lower than a bar to a hike the fed is interested in ensuring the expansion continues and that price pressures increase powell also seemed to emphasize scope for lower unemployment without spurring inflation minor tweaks were made to economic forecasts and it dropped the reference to uncertainties in the outlook the long run unemployment rate was shaved to 4 1 from 4 2 the economy is expected to expand by 2 in 2020 and 1 9 in 2021 thirteen fed officials think that no change in fed policy is appropriate next year four think a hike will be required the median forecast is consistent with no hike in 2020 and a hike in 2021 and 2022 while powell has drawn parallels to the midcourse correction in 1998 he drew back from extending that analogy to what followed the three cuts delivered then were unwound over the following 18 months or so the takeaway for investors is that it was a dovish hold the yield curve 2 10 year flattened as the two year yield slipped three basis points and the 10 year yield fell by five basis points the implied yield of the december 2020 fed funds futures contract fell 3 bp to 1 305 this seems to fully discount a 25 bp rate the dollar index fell to four month lows 97 00 the us ppi and weekly jobless claims are not the stuff to move the markets and this seems doubly true given that investors attention at the time will be on the ecb meeting that said both are expected to edge higher mexico reports october industrial output figures and the first back to back monthly decline is expected since february march the first fed official post meeting will be the ny fed s williams tomorrow as widely expected brazil s central bank delivered a 50 bp cut in the selic rate yesterday bringing it to a new record low of 4 5 it did not shut the door on future cuts but said it would act cautiously it was the fourth consecutive rate cut and the market expected pause even if not the end of the cycle the us dollar returned toward the cad1 3150 area from where it had rallied in response to last week s diverging employment reports whether the level holds depends on the greenback s general direction which may be in the hands of the ecb now it has approached the lower bollinger band set two standard deviations below the 20 day moving average and this may induce some caution and reinforce the importance of the cad1 3150 support which is also a 61 8 retracement area of the us dollar rally last month a break would initially target something close to cad1 3100 the us dollar recorded a bearish outside down day against the mexican peso and tested the mxn19 10 level one month lows follow through selling could see the dollar test support near mxn19 00 it has not been below there since the very end of july the dollar has slipped about 0 65 before the central bank s as expected rate cut slipping below brl4 12 it also set one month lows the next level of support is seen around brl4 08

seoul south korea is heading into the 2020s with an emerging market currency even after casting off most of the other trappings of a developing economy over the past decade analysts say the export powerhouse is a global leader in technology and home to consumer brands that are world famous its per capita income has eclipsed us 30 000 s 40 700 and the government recently gave up developing country privileges at the world trade organisation even its problems from low inflation to a falling birth rate have more in common with europe and north america than emerging nations in asia yet the korean won can only be directly exchanged with the us dollar and the chinese yuan and trading overseas is limited to the chinese currency in shanghai what is more the country s us 50 billion foreign exchange market opens for just 61 2 hours a day from 9am authorities are reluctant to let the won trade offshore said mr lee jang young a former deputy governor of the financial supervisory service they re scared that any vulnerabilities will be exploited by foreign investors to launch speculative attacks on our markets said mr lee now a senior adviser at law firm kim chang any change to the currency regime would also come as south korea confronts the rise of china as a rival for technical innovation and as the country struggles to adjust to slower growth rates that come with a mature economy yet change is exactly what south korea needs according to advocates of internationalising the won like mr lee he argues that reducing dependence on the united states dollar would also lessen the risk of external shocks having to exchange won for greenback before swopping into other currencies like the euro and the yen raises costs for south korean companies and complicates doing business allowing the currency to trade 24 hours a day in global markets would likely see the cost of exchanging money come down while also bringing fiercer competition for local financial firms while offshore trading may bring benefits the government has to weigh the risk of side effects according to the finance ministry south korea s wariness is also reflected in its formidable hoard of international currency reserves at more than us 400 billion they are among the 10 biggest in the world despite the tight grip on currency trading the international monetary fund describes south korea as an advanced economy and the world bank classifies it as a high income economy the won s near 7 per cent slump this year the biggest of any asian currency by a wide margin is a reminder to officials of its vulnerability it is probably too early to talk about the won as no longer an emerging currency said economist an young jin at sk securities in seoul but clearly korean markets have become much more stable bloomberg
12 12 2019 fixing the plumbing you will get nowhere if you do not understand the capitalist mode of production says michael roberts recently benoÃ®t cÅurÃ© a leading french member of the european central bank s executive board delivered an address to economics students at the job forum of the paris school of economics he wanted to explain to the gathered students that becoming an economist was a great thing to do and paid well for many a master s degree is a natural step towards a phd and a phd is essentially a promise of employment in the united states for example the unemployment rate for phd economists is about 0 8 the lowest among all sciences not a bad place to start from but the money was less important because your phd should be fuelled by your passion and your love for research rather than by hopes of earning more money that was the reason he studied economics and worked his way up as an economics bureaucrat in the public sector in ministries of economy and finance statistical institutes in international organisations such as the international monetary fund world bank and other development banks and the organisation for economic cooperation and development and central banks such as the us federal reserve and the ecb working in these agencies cÅurÃ© reckoned is probably as close as it gets to applied economics cÅurÃ© s experience in the public sector may be different from those of us who worked in the private sector having done that in banks and other financial institutions in my career i know that economic policy advice is not the target but instead how to make money economics is geared to either corporate strategy for profits in production and trade or to investment strategy for profits in financial speculation models for cÅurÃ© economics is literally about taking the models tools and methods that you learn at class to help design public policies and as a considerable fraction of that work then ends up being published as new research there is a virtuous feedback loop between academia and public sector institutions macroeconomic models underpin almost all of our work at the ecb says cÅurÃ© that raises the question of the utility of models in economics marxist economist ben fine has attacked mathematical models in economics because they have replaced theory the goal of modelling the economy is fundamentally misconceived a model of the economy is not the economy itself for fine mainstream mathematical theory is unfit for purpose models have a place but their extreme limitations need to be recognised as such macroeconomics remains divorced from what is going on in the real economy for example the famous accelerator multiplier keynesian model may show the instability in capitalism but it does not show why on the other hand dani rodrick reckons models are the strength of economics they are what makes economics a science rodrik rejects the view that economics can provide universal explanations or prescriptions all mainstream economics can do is map bits of economic reality in other words economics is not political economy in the sense of the classical economists and marx cÅurÃ© recognises that models have their limitations that s when art or rather artisanat craftsmanship comes in we need to interconnect these models and fit them into a general equilibrium view of how the euro area economy evolves dynamically preferably in a tractable way unfortunately the track record of general equilibrium models leaves much to be desired with the collapse of keynesian economics in the 1970s the mainstream concentrated on explaining business cycles or fluctuations in an economy using modern techniques of modelling from what it called microfoundations econometric analyses like the phillips curve were ditched because such correlations between employment and inflation had been proved wrong the job now was not to look at macro or aggregate data but to work out some model that started with some premises of agent consumer behaviour or preferences and then incorporated some possible shocks to the general equilibrium of the market and then consider the number and probability of possible outcomes thus were born the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium dsge models they were based on equilibrium assumptions because they started from the premise that supply would tend to equal demand they were dynamic because the models incorporated changing behaviour by individuals or firms agents and they were stochastic since shocks to the system trade union wage push government spending action were considered as random with a range of outcomes unless confirmed otherwise this is now what most macroeconomists spend their time doing forget empirical evidence forget macro data find a micro foundation model that may help to at least offer a guide to what possibly might happen but dsge models have proved to be worthless in explaining anything they failed to predict the great recession or explain it afterwards and are unable to explain the subsequent weak recovery or long depression and it is not hard to see why there is a total absence of investment or profit as shocks in these models everything starts with consumer preferences the arch consumer is king as in the neoclassical world and keynesian aggregate demand is reduced to just consumption since the great recession general equilibrium models have lost their glamour to some extent cÅurÃ© quotes our recent nobel prizewinners abhijit banerjee and esther duflo we the economists are often wrapped up in our models and our methods and sometimes forget where science ends and ideology begins we answer policy questions based on assumptions that have become second nature to us because they are the building blocks of our models but it doesn t mean that they are always correct this is somewhat ironic these nobel prizewinners do not use dsge models instead they use randomised control trials rct you see good economics is much less strident and quite different it is less like the hard sciences and more like engineering or plumbing it breaks big problems into manageable chunks and tries to solve them with a pragmatic approach a combination of intuition and theory trial and acknowledged errors the plumbing analogy follows closely keynes s view that economists are really like dentists sorting out the aches and pains of capitalism unfortunately as sanjay reddy and others have pointed out there are just as many faultlines in rct as in dsge models the nobel prizewinners economics of poverty actually shows the poverty of economics that does not mean it is impossible to use mathematical models as long as they are based on realistic assumptions and tested empirically marxist economics is based on scientific method you start with a hypothesis based on realistic assumptions that have been abstracted from reality and then construct a model or set of laws that can be tested against the evidence the model can use mathematics to refine its precision but eventually the evidence decides moreover macro economics is the world of the aggregate not individual behaviour that delivers measurable data to test a theory political economy the mainstream economics that cÅurÃ© promoted to the paris students as the basis for public policy has hardly proved successful in practice just consider the ecb s own attempt to deal with the banking crash of 2008 10 the euro debt crisis of 2011 13 and the subsequent attempt to revive the euro zone economy cÅurÃ© claims that the forward looking nature of monetary policy makes the use of models indispensable but it seems that these models have proved to be too simple and so monetary policy operations have become much more complex with forward guidance in central bank speak and unconventional monetary policy like quantitative easing cÅurÃ© says when we started purchasing securities we had no guidance but over time ecb staff have successfully filled this void we now have state of the art term structure models that help translate changes in the amount of bonds into changes in long term interest rates well maybe but the ecb s economic forward guidance on inflation and growth has been proved pretty much wrong the ecb has failed to achieve its 2 inflation target and real gdp growth has persistently fallen below ecb forecasts the long depression has defeated mainstream economics forget forecasting cÅurÃ© recognises that uncertainty is a pervasive feature of our profession so he dismisses the claim that economists failed to predict the outbreak of the financial crisis this criticism is nonsense do we expect physicians to predict illnesses we don t of course but we expect them to help us cure illnesses economists should do the same they should be judged by the quality of the advice they give again we get the view that economists are like dentists doctors or plumbers who clear up messes once they have happened but are doctors all that matter in human health actually improved doctoral skills in treating patients once they have become ill comes from scientific discovery about diseases biology and the environment successful drugs and medical practices are the result of learning what the cause of the illness is in medieval times doctors applied all sorts of useless and dangerous treatments leeches etc because they did not know about germs bacteria or viruses cholera was eventually abated by a geographical study in london showing it was prevalent near bad drinking wells malaria and smallpox were resolved by discovering the carriers of the bacteria in various animals treatments by doctors then followed there is no substitute for the big picture economists should not be doctors but social scientists or more accurately they should develop an economics that recognises the wider social forces that drive economic models in particular the social mode of production that is capitalism that is political economy which is mostly not taught in universities and certainly not practised in international agencies in his address cÅurÃ© recognised that central banks had failed before the great recession this was because their models expressed an absence of a meaningful financial sector which left models at a loss to explain the origins of the crisis and its consequences for the economy and prevailing models were built on a standard linear gaussian set up and hence proved inadequate to examine shocks on the scale of the global financial crisis in other words they assumed a normal steadily growing capitalist economy where there were no underlying contradictions that could erupt violently remember the words of the then fed chair ben bernanke back in 2004 just before the great recession he was proclaiming the great moderation that capitalism had become the substantial decline in macroeconomic volatility over the past 20 years is a striking economic development whether the dominant cause of the great moderation is structural change improved monetary policy or simply good luck is an important question about which no consensus has yet formed this conclusion on my part makes me optimistic for the future because i am confident that monetary policymakers will not forget the lessons of the 1970s mainstream economics underestimated the depth and length of the long depression that followed where even negative interest rates have no effect on the real economy and where attempting to reduce public debt as in the greek crisis made things so much worse in the aftermath of the crisis with tragic social consequences but don t worry cÅurÃ© told the students our general equilibrium models now feature a fully fledged banking sector that accounts for the presence of financial frictions and that also allows us to analyse the effects of macroprudential policies and we are getting much more data that can help economists solve problems big data and richer and timelier datasets will help improve the input to our models cÅurÃ© cited climate change as perhaps the most far reaching of the challenges ahead for economists but he was delighted to tell the students that economics was making great strides in helping in that area william nordhaus was awarded the nobel prize in economic sciences last year for integrating climate change into macroeconomic analysis again there is a certain irony here for heterodox economist steve keen among others has done an effective debunking job on the nobel laureate s assumptions and forecasts actually mainstream economics is doing little or nothing to come up with a social scientific analysis and solutions on this literally burning issue having expressed confidence in monetary policy as the tool to revive demand despite evidence to the contrary cÅurÃ© finished by reminding his audience that economics is a social science models will not take away the burden and responsibility of making judgements economics involves much trial and error you have to take decisions in the fog when you can barely see your hand in front of your face this makes our profession exciting maybe exciting but also fraught with failure in that fog with

because central banks blow many bubbles and the u s imports a large quantity of cocaine bubbles are fun but they extract a price there is no free lunch examples 2019 the everything bubble it hasn t crashed yet but there are many bubble piercing objects on the horizon prepare for the implosion it s coming 2008 the housing bubble real estate mortgages collateralized debt and other derivatives nearly crashed the global financial system the official story claims emergency central banking measures saved it but 8 7 million americans lost their jobs bankers foreclosed on 10 million american homes and the doj prosecuted no bankers for fraud congress and the fed saved wall street banks and bonuses the fed showered 16 trillion per the limited audit in secret bailouts loans swaps and giveaways onto wall street and foreign banks another report wall street on parade claims the total was 29 trillion regardless a huge bailout worked once so we could see a larger bailout when the everything bubble crashes debt leverage is larger than in 2008 and more sectors of the economy are dangerously inflated the debt and credit monsters have grown 2000 internet stocks bubble the high flying nasdaq 100 soared from under 400 in 1994 to over 4 800 in 2000 then it collapsed more than 80 how many retirements and portfolios were devastated by investors arriving late to the casino most people failed to exit before the crash blowing bubbles is profitable for wall street and the stock market which is primarily owned by the upper few percent of the financial and political elite the lower 90 have benefited little wages are higher but the cost of living has increased even more flawed understated government inflation statistics show the average wage earner lost ground in the last several decades real statistics would show larger losses however wealth increased for the upper 1 blowing bubbles is fun for the participants and profitable for a few until the bubble crashes from wall street on parade wall street on parade is not buying the narrative that the 3 trillion that the new york fed has pumped out to the trading houses on wall street since september 17 is part of routine open market operations that the fed is legally allowed to do the united states should have allowed banks to fail in 2008 perhaps the u s should allow banks to fail in 2019 instead of creating 3 trillion or 30 trillion qe plus not qe and devaluing existing dollars so what bail out several banks print 10 or 50 trillion so what consider moral hazard wall street takes risks increases profits boosts bonuses and lets the taxpayers suffer if the bets in the wall street casino go bad more debt history shows that excessive debt leads to disaster it will not be different this time more dollars in circulation push consumer prices higher larger bubbles the 2008 bubble was larger and more destructive than the 2000 bubble expect the 2020 2024 bubble implosion to create more damage than the 2008 crash poor and middle class americans are hurt worse than the political and financial elite imploding bubbles diminished savings lost jobs and foreclosed homes devastate many fudged statistics and payoffs to wall street reduce trust in government privatize profits but socialize losses wall street might have said let the taxpayers pay for wall street bonuses and failed gambles from alasdair macleod with annual debt payments already accounting for most of the us budget deficit and that deficit getting larger any rise in dollar interest rates would be ruinous for federal government finances eurozone governments are in a similarly precarious financial position governments are ensnared in a classic debt trap a credit excess inflates bubbles debt increases the leverage makes a few wealthy and crushes many the assets disappear but debt remains someone pays interest on the debt the bubble seldom increases productivity or real wealth a good example of a current bubble is sovereign debt why loan currency units to a government that must borrow to repay past debt plus interest they roll over the original debt and never extinguish it this nonsense can t continue forever so many will suffer when the defaults occur speculation and front running partially explain the craziness from alasdair macleod an estimated 17 trillion of global bonds are negative yielding which is unprecedented this is a market distortion so extreme that it cannot be normalized without widespread financial disruption and debtor destruction there is no exit from this condition repeat there is no exit from this condition from sven henrich tweet central banks are the enablers of the largest debt expansion in human history and insist on perpetuating what jay powell has called an unsustainable path from mish talk 250 trillion in global debt how can that be paid back the answer is of course it won t be paid back and since every debt is someone else s asset you can imagine what that ultimately means a great many people are a lot less wealthy than they think it is all phantom wealth that can disappear in an eyeblink repeat it is all phantom wealth that can disappear in an eyeblink that explains the fed s need to create trillions in printed currency units they must delay imploding the bubble you can run but you can t hide you can delay the inevitable but you can t prevent it bubbles will implode from martin armstrong custodial risk in new york city suffice to say that the negative yielding bonds are going to crash like something not witnessed since 1931 while a complete default is not likely prior to 2025 2026 we are going to witness the start of the collapse in 2020 the plan is inflate or die then speculating extend and pretend for another eleven months drop interest rates to near zero reelect president trump and let stocks and sovereign debt implode after the 2020 election fiat currencies will crash in purchasing power and congress will seek someone to blame as a distraction suggestions for blame china russia the other political party high frequency trading the latest war european banks impeachment proceedings climate change not on the blame list but should be the fed congress excessive spending the administration keynesian economic nonsense from daniel lacalle the next wave of debt monetization will also be a disaster if this monetary experiment has proven anything it is that lower rates and higher liquidity are not tools to help deleverage but to incentivize debt from christoph gisiger when it comes to science and technology man learns but when it comes to love war and finance he makes the same mistakes over and over again at the end of the day central banks are not all powerful they are not immune to the laws of economics my thesis is that when this bubble bursts gold should rally while bonds and stocks should crash a thought experiment in round numbers global debt has expanded by 82 trillion from 173 trillion to 255 trillion in the past 11 years in that time global gold reserves have increased by 30 000 to 35 000 tons or by about one billion ounces if that new debt had been backed by gold it would have required a gold price of 80 000 the price of gold is about 1 500 less than 2 of what would be necessary to back the global debt increase since 2008 the world has a global debt problem this suggests the banking cartel created too much debt a bubble and the price of gold is too low in our debt driven economy the crash of the everything bubble will reset stock and bond prices lower and gold prices higher perhaps to 5 000 to 10 000 during the next decade a western central banker might see it differently gold is useless and no amount of debt is excessive time will show this viewpoint is nonsense from bob moriarty on the daily sentiment index as of november 18th sentiment for the s p futures and the nasdaq index is approaching nosebleed territory the dsi at 90 for the s p and 91 for the nasdaq index suggests a top is coming soon not today but soon conclusions global debt exceeds 250 trillion much of it will not be repaid bubbles are fun while they last but they always implode and leave many in tears inflate or die the reset will be near when the mainstream media screams accusations at obvious scapegoats sentiment suggests a stock market top is close watch out below negative interest rates are a central bank created trap black hole expect massive losses in sovereign bonds someday soon gold prices compared to new debt since the 2008 crash are far too low expect a significant price

with brent d griffiths the ticker federal reserve chair jerome powell isn t heeding president trump s demands to slash interest rates but the central bank chief still delivered unequivocal good news for trump s reelection hopes he doesn t see the fed raising interest rates anytime soon leaving in place the cushion it put under the economy earlier this year powell addressing reporters after the fed s final meeting of a turbulent decade predicted smoother sailing next year as trump gears up to face voters he said monetary policymakers expect moderate growth to continue at a slowed but still healthy 2 percent pace and he took some credit for helping navigate head winds from trump s trade war and choppiness abroad saying the fed s three interest rate cuts over the summer and into the fall for which he forged consensus among fed officials kept the economy on track advertisement indeed the fed s official statement accompanying the announcement it is holding the benchmark interest rate steady between 1 5 and 1 75 percent dropped its mention of uncertainties facing the economic outlook per my colleague heather long powell left the door open to changing interest rates in 2020 but he stressed there is a high bar for moving rates up or down we re going to do what we think is the right thing for the economy powell said if there is a material reassessment of our outlook we would respond accordingly powell s presentation marked a heel turn from earlier this year stocks tanked in july after powell described the fed s first interest rate cut in a decade as a mid cycle adjustment because investors interpreted the remark as a signal the relief monetary policymakers were providing was only temporary now however the cuts look much more permanent grant thornton chief economist diane swonk writes in a note the vote to hold rates unchanged was unanimous the first time that all agreed on what the fed should be doing since may 2019 advertisement and 13 of the 17 members of the fed officials setting policy indicated they expect the borrowing rate to remain untouched next year while four projected one hike as recently as september nine of the policymakers projected at least one rate hike next year investors had largely priced in the fed s decision to hold rates steady but stocks rallied modestly on powell s post meeting comments major indexes snapped a two day losing streak with the s p 500 closing up 0 29 percent and the dow jones industrial average climbing 0 11 percent on the day markets liked mr powell s assertion that he would want to see a significant and persistent increase in inflation before he would want to raise rates and he again drew attention to the undershoot to the target in recent years pantheon macroeconomics chief economist ian sheperdson wrote in a note mr powell s view is not shared by all his colleagues given that most of them expect rates to rise slightly over the next three years while core inflation is expected to be little changed but markets put much more weight on the views of the chair that s probably the right approach advertisement but if powell is landing on a position that benefits trump it s no indication the president and his handpicked fed chair are simpatico trump has treated powell like a punching bag attacking him relentlessly for leading the fed to raise rates last year and not cutting them as far or as fast as the president would have liked in 2019 now as heather writes the pressure is largely off the stock market is back at record highs unemployment is at a 50 year low inflation remains tame and the economy continues to grow at a healthy pace around 2 percent with little chance of a recession while trade war continues to inflict harm the fed s actions are widely credited with offsetting most of it at least for the united states trump hasn t extended an olive branch but his top economic adviser larry kudlow said at a recent conferencethe fed s role in the economy has been overstated his comments suggest that for all the bashing and political drama powell may be less of a central figure in the political battles of 2020 having delivered rate cuts the economy needed without seeming to bend to the will of a volatile president something that could have undermined investor confidence in an independent central bank politico s ben white and victoria guida write and powell has garnered improved marks from fed watchers including former central bank officials who criticized his communications strategy and execution as uneven at his most recent news conference powell projected more confidence than at any presser before former dallas fed president richard fisher told the wall street journal s nick timiraos he is visibly in command of the ship advertisement market movers inflation stays muted wsj s sarah chaney inflation isn t likely to take off anytime soon recent readings on prices and labor costs show consumer prices rose at a 2 1 annual pace in november from 1 8 in october mainly due to higher energy and shelter costs the labor department said wednesday the readings suggest that companies have less pricing power because of factors including globalization and consumers growing tendency toward comparison shopping say economists who expect these trends to continue even though u s unemployment is at historic lows and companies face higher prices for some products tied

on its own advertisement trump tracker trade fly around trump to huddle top advisors as tariff hike looms reuters trump is expected to meet with top trade advisors on thursday to discuss planned dec 15 tariffs on some 160 billion in chinese goods three sources familiar with the plans said as markets braced for potential negative impacts officials circulated talking points downplaying the repercussions such a tariff hike would have on the u s economy ahead of trump s meeting with trade representative robert lighthizer treasury secretary steven mnuchin and white house advisers larry kudlow and peter navarro the senior trade advisors are expected to present divergent views during the high stakes meeting but the final decision will be up to trump the sources said advertisement ron

force china to change its behavior he s not the only one making that point to illustrate those concerns harnessed his literary muse ron vara in a memo that is circulating in washington sent from an email address purportedly belonging to ron vara the memo highlights public commentary in favor of keeping the pressure on china with more tariffs the email the memo does not show formally endorsing any views but it lives up to his reputation for seeking to force deep structural changes to china s economy through tariffs it outlines the keep tariffs argument which accuses china of stepping up american farm purchases of pork and soybeans only because of its domestic swine fever outbreak and he claims that recent changes to chinese law run counter to promises by the country s officials to protect american intellectual property there s also a line about the markets and in a twist on market certainty it suggests that could calm jittery investors by publicly backing away from a deal get

former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan called paul volcker the most effective chairman in the history of the federal reserve but while volcker who passed away dec 8 at age 92 probably did have the greatest historical impact of any fed chairman his legacy is at best controversial he restored credibility to the federal reserve at a time it had been greatly diminished wrote his biographer william silber volcker s policies led to what was called the new keynesian revolution putting the fed in charge of controlling the amount of money available to consumers and businesses by manipulating the federal funds rate the interest rate at which banks borrow from each other all this was because volcker s shock therapy of the early 1980s raising the federal funds rate to an unheard of 20 was credited with reversing the stagflation of the 1970s but did it or was something else going on less discussed was volcker s role at the behest of president richard nixon in taking the dollar off the gold standard which he called the single most important event of his career he evidently intended for another form of stable exchange system to replace the bretton woods system it destroyed but that did not happen instead freeing the dollar from gold unleashed an unaccountable central banking system that went wild printing money for the benefit of private wall street and london financial interests the power to create money can be a good and necessary tool in the hands of benevolent leaders working on behalf of the people and the economy but like with the sorcerer s apprentice in disney s fantasia if it falls in the wrong hands it can wreak havoc on the world unfortunately for volcker s legacy and the well being of the rest of us his signature policies led to the devastation of the american working class in the 1980s and ultimately set the stage for the 2008 global financial crisis the official story and where it breaks down according to a dec 9 obituary in the washington post mr volcker s greatest historical mark was in eight years as fed chairman when he took the reins of the central bank the nation was mired in a decade long period of rapidly rising prices and weak economic growth mr volcker overcoming the objections of many of his colleagues raised interest rates to an unprecedented 20 drastically reducing the supply of money and credit the post acknowledges that the effect on the economy was devastating triggering what was then the deepest economic downturn since the depression of the 1930s driving thousands of businesses and farms to bankruptcy and propelling the unemployment rate past 10 mr volcker was pilloried by industry labor unions and lawmakers of all ideological stripes he took the abuse convinced that this shock therapy would finally break americans expectations that prices would forever rise rapidly and that the result would be a stronger economy over the longer run on this he was right contends the author soon after mr volcker took his foot off the brake of the u s economy in 1981 and the fed began lowering interest rates the nation began a quarter century of low inflation steady growth and rare and mild recessions economists attribute that period one of the sunniest in economic history at least in part to the newfound credibility as an inflation fighter that mr volcker earned for the fed that is the conventional version but the stagflation of the 1970s and its sharp reversal in the early 1980s appears more likely to have been due to a correspondingly sharp rise and fall in the price of oil there is evidence this oil shortage was intentionally engineered for the purpose of restoring the global dominance of the u s dollar which had dropped precipitously in international markets after it was taken off the gold standard in 1971 the other side of the story how the inflation rate directly followed the price of oil was tracked by benjamin studebaker in a 2012 article titled stagflation what really happened in the 70 s we see that the problem begins in 1973 with the 73 75 recession that s when growth first dives in october of 1973 the organisation of petroleum exporting countries declared an oil embargo upon the supporters of israel western nations the 73 75 recession begins in november of 1973 immediately after during normal recessions inflation does not rise it shrinks as people spend less and prices fall so why does inflation rise from 73 75 because this recession is not a normal recession it is sparked by an oil shortage the price of oil more than doubles in the space of a mere few months from 73 74 oil is involved in the manufacturing of plastics in gasoline in sneakers it s everywhere when the price of oil goes up the price of most things go up the spike in the oil price is so large that it drives up the costs of consumer goods throughout the rest of the economy so fast that wages fail to keep up with it as a result you get both inflation and a recession at once terrified by the double digit inflation rate in 1974 the federal reserve switches gears and jacks the interest rate up to near 14 the economy slips back into the throws of the recession for another year or so and the unemployment rate takes off rising to around 9 by 1975 then in 1979 the economy gets another oil price shock this time caused by the revolution in iran in january of that year in which the price of oil again more than doubles the result is a fall in growth and inflation knocked all the way up into the teens the federal reserve tries to fight the oil driven inflation by raising interest rates high into the teens peaking out at 20 in 1980 y 1983 the unemployment rate has peaked at nearly 11 to fight this the federal reserve knocks the interest rate back below 10 and meanwhile alongside all of this ronald reagan spends lots of money and expands the state in 82 83 why does inflation not respond by returning because oil prices are falling throughout this period and by 1985 have collapsed utterly the federal funds rate was just below 10 in 1975 at the height of the early stagflation crisis how could the same rate that was responsible for inflation in the 1970s drop the consumer price index to acceptable levels after 1983 and if the federal funds rate has that much effect on inflation why is the extremely low 1 55 rate today not causing hyperinflation what fed chairman jerome powell is now fighting instead is deflation a lack of consumer demand causing stagnant growth in the real producing economy thus it looks as if oil not the federal funds rate was the critical factor in the rise and fall of consumer prices in the 1970s and 1980s stagflation was just a predictable result of the shortage of this essential commodity at a time when the country was not energy independent the following chart from business insider australia shows the historical correlations the plot thickens but there s more the subplot is detailed by william engdahl in the gods of money 2009 to counter the falling dollar after it was taken off the gold standard u s secretary of state henry kissinger and president nixon held a clandestine meeting in 1972 with the shah of iran then in 1973 a group of powerful financiers and politicians met secretly in sweden to discuss how the dollar might effectively be backed by oil an arrangement was finalized in which the oil producing countries of opec would sell their oil only in u s dollars and the dollars would wind up in wall street and london banks where they would fund the burgeoning u s debt for the opec countries the quid pro quo was military protection along with windfall profits from a dramatic boost in oil prices in 1974 according to plan an oil embargo caused the price of oil to quadruple forcing countries without sufficient dollar reserves to borrow from wall street and london banks to buy the oil they needed increased costs then drove up prices worldwide the story is continued by matthieu auzanneau in oil power and war a dark history the panic caused by the iranian revolution raised a new tsunami of inflation that was violently unleashed on the world economy whose consequences were even greater than what took place in 1973 once again the sharp unexpected increase in the price of crude oil instantly affected transportation construction and agriculture confirming oil s ubiquity the time of draconian monetarist policies advocated by economist milton friedman david rockefeller s protÃ©gÃ© had arrived the bank of england s interest rate was around 16 in 1980 the impact on the economy was brutal appointed by president carter in august 1979 paul volcker the new chief of the federal reserve administered the same shock treatment to the american economy carter had initially offered the position to david rockefeller chase manhattan s president politely declined the offer and strongly recommended that carter appeal to volcker who had been a chase vice president in the 1960s to stop the spiral of inflation that endangered the profitability and stability of all banks the federal reserve increased its benchmark rate to 20 in 1980 and 1981 the following year 1982 the american economy experienced a 2 recession much more severe than the recession of 1974 in an article in american opinion in 19179 gary allen author of none dare call it conspiracy the rockefeller files 1971 observed that both volcker and henry kissinger were david rockefeller protÃ©gÃ©s volcker had worked for rockefeller at chase manhattan bank and was a member of the trilateral commission and the council on foreign relations in 1971 when he was treasury undersecretary for monetary affairs volcker played an instrumental role in the top secret camp david meeting at which the president approved taking the dollar off the gold standard allen wrote that it was volcker who led the effort to demonetize gold in favor of bookkeeping entries as part of another international banking grab his appointment now threatens an economic bust volcker s real legacy allen went on how important is the post to which paul volcker has been appointed the new york times tells us as the nation s central bank the federal reserve system which by law is independent of the administration and congress has exclusive authority to control the amount of money available to consumers and businesses this means that the federal reserve board has life and death power over the economy and that is paul volcker s true legacy at a time when the fed s credibility was greatly diminished he restored to it the life and death power over the economy that it continues to exercise today his shock therapy of the early 1980s broke the backs of labor and the unions bankrupted the savings and loans and laid the groundwork for the liberalization of the banking laws that allowed securitization derivatives and the repo market to take center stage as noted by jeff spross in the week volcker s chosen strategy essentially loaded all the pain onto the working class an approach to monetary policy that has shaped fed policy ever since in 2008 09 the fed was an opaque accessory to the bank heist in which massive fraud was covered up and the banks were made whole despite their criminality taking the dollar off the gold standard allowed the fed to engage in the quantitative easing that underwrote this heist bolstered by opec oil backing uncoupling the dollar from gold also allowed it to maintain and expand its status as global reserve currency what was volcker s role in all this he is described by those who knew him as a personable man who lived modestly and didn t capitalize on his powerful position to accumulate personal wealth he held a lifelong skepticism of financial elites and financial innovation he proposed a key restriction on speculative activity by banks that would become known as the volcker rule in the late 1960s he opposed allowing global exchange rates to float freely which he said would allow speculators to pounce on a depreciating currency pushing it even lower and he evidently regretted the calamity caused by his 1980s shock treatment saying if he could do it over again he would do it differently it could be said that volcker was a good man who spent his life trying to rectify that defining moment when he helped free the dollar from gold ultimately eliminating the gold standard was a necessary step in allowing the money supply to expand to meet the needs of trade the power to create money can be a useful tool in the right hands it just needs to be recaptured and wielded in the public interest following the lead of the american colonial governments that first demonstrated its very productive potential
rttnews the major u s index futures are pointing to a modestly lower opening on thursday following the uptick seen in the previous session lingering uncertainty about a u s china trade deal may weigh on the markets after a report from reuters said president donald trump is expected to meet with top trade advisers today to discuss current plans to raise tariffs on 160 billion worth of chinese goods on december 15th reuters said officials circulated talking points ahead of the meeting downplaying the repercussions the new tariffs would have on the u s economy three sources familiar with the plans told reuters the senior trade advisers are expected to present divergent views during the high stakes meeting with the final decision up to trump reports earlier this week suggested the u s would likely delay imposing the new tariffs to avoid agitating china amid an ongoing negotiations toward a phase one trade deal negative sentiment may also be generated in reaction to a report from the

cuts the decision was widely anticipated although the fed s economic projections provided along with the announcement also showed a majority of meeting participants now expect interest rates to remain on hold throughout 2020 fed chairman jerome powell suggested during his post meeting press conference that he would not consider raising rates until inflation picks up significantly in order to move rates up i would want to see inflation that s persistent and that s significant powell said a significant move up in inflation that s also persistent before raising rates to address inflation concerns that s my view however powell noted his comments do reflect official forward guidance adding it happens to be my view that that s what it would take to want to move interest rates up in order to deal with inflation the fed downwardly revised its forecast for core consumer price growth in 2019 to 1 6 percent from 1 8 percent while the inflation estimates for the next three years were unchanged in

on the verge of man made starvation with close to 60 percent of its 14 million population being food insecure juliet gumbo is trying to plant her own food as she can no longer afford to buy maize after an 11 day visit last month to areas hit by the el nino induced drought elver said the crisis affected a staggering 5 5 million people in rural areas and a further 2 2 million in cities these are shocking figures she said adding that notwithstanding the devastating effect of recurrent droughts and powerful cyclones the crisis was partly due to chronic economic mismanagement high unemployment widespread poverty and rampant corruption in her statement elver also suggested economic sanctions by the united states and the european union against officials and entities linked with the ruling

agro based economy began to collapse following the state s violent seizure in the 2000s of an estimated 10 million hectares 25 million acres for redistribution from white commercial farmers to resettle the landless black majority mugabe s government over the years resorted to price controls and money printing to tackle skyrocketing inflation and food shortages but the measures impoverished

re engagement with the west the country is battling to stabilise its economy as it transitions from a decade of using the us dollar as part of its multiple currency system but the reintroduction of a

bulawayo zimbabwe every morning just before the daily power cut kicks in juliet gumbo enters her kitchen to start preparing her meal it will be her only food for the day but she will have it hours later when she returns to her electricity lacking home after a day spent farming or hawking goods on the streets of bulawayo zimbabwe s second largest city gumbo a 52 year old widow lacking a steady job is just one of many zimbabweans struggling to cope with a scorching drought and economic instability that have pushed millions to the brink of famine i eat what i can get gumbo said more nearly half of zimbabweans face hunger starvationcyclone idai thousands still struggling to copezimbabwe s food crisis food security is national security zimbabwe is in the grip of its worst economic crisis in 10 years with inflation soaring to 300 percent and the population suffering fuel shortages power rationing and currency woes emmerson mnangagwa who succeeded robert mugabe after a military intervention forced the longtime president to resign has struggled to revive the economy while the long standing financial troubles have been worsened by extreme weather shocks and now zimbabwe is facing major food insecurity as many people do not have enough food to eat or they cannot afford it according to hilal elver the united nations special rapporteur on the right to food the country is on the verge of man made starvation with close to 60 percent of its 14 million population being food insecure juliet gumbo is trying to plant her own food as she can no longer afford to buy maize after an 11 day visit last month to areas hit by the el nino induced drought elver said the crisis affected a staggering 5 5 million people in rural areas and a further 2 2 million in cities these are shocking figures she said adding that notwithstanding the devastating effect of recurrent droughts and powerful cyclones the crisis was partly due to chronic economic mismanagement high unemployment widespread poverty and rampant corruption in her statement elver also suggested economic sanctions by the united states and the european union against officials and entities linked with the ruling zanu pf party over alleged abuses are contributing to zimbabwe s current malaise the government in harare also says sanctions are impeding economic growth and hurting ordinary zimbabweans but the us embassy refutes the claim the government of zimbabwe s failed economic policies not sanctions hinder zimbabwe s economic growth the embassy s press office said in a statement to al jazeera billions of dollars have been lost due to decades of corruption and harmful economic policies which have culminated in the current economic crisis implementation of economic and political reforms are the key to improving zimbabwe s trajectory analysts say years of shifting policies on land reform and food subsidies under mugabe and mnangagwa are also partly to blame for zimbabwe s food scarcity the country s agro based economy began to collapse following the state s violent seizure in the 2000s of an estimated 10 million hectares 25 million acres for redistribution from white commercial farmers to resettle the landless black majority mugabe s government over the years resorted to price controls and money printing to tackle skyrocketing inflation and food shortages but the measures impoverished local state owned agricultural companies and contributed to the collapse of the local currency in 2009 191201110911512 although the removal of sanctions is a key demand of the post mugabe government s re engagement with the west the country is battling to stabilise its economy as it transitions from a decade of using the us dollar as part of its multiple currency system but the reintroduction of a local currency at the end of february and more recently the reversal of a decision to remove a government subsidy on maize have failed to ease the situation last week finance minister mthuli ncube said the government is making perfect efforts to reform the economy and attribute the larger part of the crisis to natural disasters and bad luck who gets a cyclone and then another then drought then power outages ncube told reporters on wednesday referring to this year s farmland ravaging cyclone idai and cyclone kenneth that followed it that is a classic example of being unlucky on thursday the government announced that the price of a 10kg 22 pounds bag of maize meal selling for at least 105 zimbabwean dollars 6 32 would drop to 50 zimbabwean dollars 3 32 but some consumers are doubtful if price controls will have any effect on escalating costs for gumbo her monthly state grant of 45 zimbabwean dollars 2 71 of her late husband s benefits is inadequate to meet her living needs with the price of mealie meal a staple food made from milled corn beyond her reach she opts to plant maize hoping that she will be able to yield a harvest in march that could help her to survive a further six months i still can t afford it today they will say it s 50 zimbabwean dollars but the price will still go up in the shops said gumbo a sometimes seasonal farmer i d rather plant and hope the rains will improve so i can have something to eat farmer sikhumbuzo mlilo says he has been threatened with eviction by the government zimbabwe s food scarcity problems however are not recent once a regional breadbasket the country over the past 10 years has been hit by rising food insecurity partly due to the fast track land reform programme that saw a drop in agricultural production mainly of dairy beef and wheat 191128194417897 while those who took over the white owned farms have contributed significantly to the domestic consumption of corn production remains insufficient to build up a store of grain reserves and now even some of the resettled face eviction in the southern district of umguza an area 500km 311 miles south of the capital where some of the earliest resettlements took place sikhumbuzo mlilo and his partner buyiswa moyo live on a plot apportioned from a white owned commercial farm the pair who have been farming the land since 2000 allege that in october they were issued with an eviction notice we need to eat so we can survive but if they tell us to leave this land after being here for so long how do we plant our crops where are supposed to go and find new land he told al jazeera the 44 year old said the order made an already tough situation even worse for his farming dependent family last season we did not reap much from the harvest because the rains came late so we ve had to buy maize meal in town but now it s so expensive it s hard for us he added we just can t afford it following the toppling of mugabe after 37 years in power mnangagwa pledged to end eviction of white commercial farmers while maintaining there was no going back on land reform though seldom eviction of white farmers still occurs while resettled black farmers who are not productive on their land have been warned of expulsion mlilo denies underutilisation and suggests the plots of those threatened with expulsion could be earmarked for a larger farming project for those with money and good government connections a fear also echoed by other resettled farmers since the land seizures zimbabwe depends on production by subsistence farmers to provide the bulk of its maize needs but local wheat production is inadequate as a result the country suffers from a cereal deficit with current production falling short of 761 000 metric tonnes needed for 2019 20 according to regional statistics from the un office for humanitarian affairs cereals and pulses such as wheat and soya beans are largely imported but due to chronic shortages of foreign currency the government has struggled to pay for importation which has resulted in periodic shortages of bread and cooking oil government approved prices for basic goods often do not match those in supermarkets meanwhile over the past year the price of bread has increased more than four times as bakers and millers struggle to keep pace with the quickly eroding value of the local currency against the us dollar 191114143045516 mangaliso ndlovu the former minister of trade and industry and current environment and tourism minister acknowledged that inflation has drastically reduced the purchasing power of many zimbabweans despite regular adjustments of civil servants salaries the wages have not been aligned to the exchange rate and that has been the major challenge which we are gradually addressing he said there is a challenge when it comes to food security and that is why we have put a flash appeal to the united nations when we talk of people going hungry we are literally talking about food on the table and this is a direct impact from the drought and this has stretched government s social protection programme nokusila ndlovu goes without food to make sure her children have enough to eat making a regional version of doughnuts when bread becomes too expensive in an effort to combat escalating prices the government has launched the national bakeries programme a series of community initiatives around the country where entrepreneurs use wood fired ovens to make a cheaper version of bread the lower standard of homemade bread has not caught on however as the small bakeries struggle to produce enough to compete with bigger competitors 190902192154717 instead of buying bread nokusila ndlovu 27 an unemployed mother of four who lives on the outskirts of bulawayo has resorted to making vetkoeks a regional version of doughnuts on an open fire to feed her children i can go without food the whole day sometimes i eat one meal but my children can t so i have to find cheaper alternatives to bread the price is just too much for me so whenever i have money i buy flour to make vetkoeks to keep them full she said in an attempt to plug the nutritional gap faced by low income households the world food programme hopes to deliver more than 240 000 metric tonnes of essentials during the first half of 2020 but the un food agency faces a colossal task the wfp has appealed for nearly 300m to meet zimbabwe s emergency needs but less than 30 percent of funding has so far been guaranteed funds are required immediately for wfp to meet the growing needs of the hardest hit zimbabweans it said in a statement

among the prime economic factors vaulting donald trump to power was the extreme concentration of wealth and influence in a handful of large and growing metros chiefly on the coasts the 2016 electoral map forced a geographic reckoning not unlike that which gave rise to the new deal programs of the 1930s while the great depression compelled the roosevelt administration to rush federal resources throughout the country to put the unemployed to work the new deal also targeted specific regions that cried out for greater investment the depression era south was in need of electrical modernization the dust bowl ridden lower plains were in need of stronger wind and soil erosion controls and the west was in need of new water and forest management infrastructure tending to these regional deficits primed the economy for roughly balanced participation in war mobilization and postwar prosperity likewise the climate crisis has given rise to various proposals for a green new deal that in its final form should also tackle regional disparities one region in particular stands out the industrial and agricultural midwest and northern mid atlantic the industrial heartland not only is this region rich in water and land resources that will be essential to battling climate change but much of the area has endured staggering levels of policy neglect and private sector disinvestment as its people have struggled to compete in the re engineered global economy over the past 40 years in spite of the howls of resentment that have long rung from flyover country stagnating wages overseas outsourcing and the cultural elevation of smart digital knowledge work over that of manual labor proceeded obliviously apace fueling the conviction that neither political party supported the interests of working people not surprisingly a rhetoric of ethno racial grievance never entirely dormant filled the political vacuum it didn t help either that just as cities came back into favor with the new millennium our most influential urban economists doubled down arguing that public investment policy should be people based not place based providing individuals with the resources to follow the wiles of the market wherever it might lead rather than to restore their home communities university of california berkeley economist enrico moretti put it most bluntly in his widely hailed 2012 book the new geography of jobs a great divergence has been under way in the u s economy with no signs of letup he argues dividing the country into three americas with geographic markers at one extreme are the brain hubs cities with a well educated labor force and a strong innovation sector he observes where there is also plenty of work in service industries at the other extreme are cities once dominated by traditional manufacturing which are declining rapidly losing jobs and residents a number of other cities could go either way to heaven or to hell equipped with this passive economistic analysis thought leaders from the groves of academe to tedx conferences from the political pundit and donor classes could content themselves with propping up the margins until the denizens of hell as it were finally felt heard by donald trump who vowed they would be forgotten no longer paired with this reckoning was another it became ever more clear that climate change is under way and given the trumpian view that climate change is a hoax the two were poised for collision the case for regional rebalancing it has been said that regions which lack clear jurisdictional boundaries and institutional accountability are poor substitutes for states yet there are some challenges that elude the limitations of formal state and local governance what regions lack in jurisdictional authority they possess in reflecting social economic and ecosystem relationships that amount to shared interests and contributions to the broader commonweal students of large scale regional planning speak of its importance in establishing regional balance in underdeveloped places or where natural or man made disasters or overuse of natural resources threatens localities without the means to restore their equilibrium on the national scale regional governance can play an as needed temporary role in meeting historical exigencies of which climate change surely counts as among the most extreme ever faced consider the tennessee valley authority tva the most ambitious multilevel regional economic development project of the new deal where all the above conditions prevailed recognizing that the still impoverished post civil war south a lingering man made regional disaster didn t have the resources to take advantage of technological advances in electricity flood management inland water navigation crop yields and car worthy road building new dealers called for the large area s regional integration into the modern economy ushered through congress by populist republican senator george norris of nebraska and eventually led by midwestern public utility advocate david lilienthal the tva built 16 hydroelectric dams with flood control capacity and a transmission line network that extended through most of tennessee and parts of alabama kentucky georgia mississippi north carolina and virginia during its first 11 years alone between 1933 and 1943 it also introduced soil and forest conservation practices in this largely agricultural area that had been over timbered and poorly farmed and took public health measures to combat a vicious malaria outbreak that afflicted 30 percent of the population tva public works projects employed union labor and all together put tens of thousands of people to work during the depths of the depression by its own rebalancing standards the tva was a success it not only provided desperately needed employment but in providing a comparatively cheap public utility electricity it also attracted private business to the region notably in textiles wood processing chemicals and armaments manufacturing it was hardly without critics from contemporary local communities displaced through eminent domain and private utility interests opposed to public power to environmentalist opponents of the tva s later embrace of coal fired and nuclear plants and like virtually all new deal programs it was saturated with jim crow and racial discrimination but as intended the tva stabilized a critical subregion of the south and paved the way for what came to be known as the sun belt the tva also marked a historic pivot influenced in its earliest years by the ecological regionalism of lewis mumford benton mackaye and other critics of metropolitan monopoly including the southern agrarians its focus had been on river basin development and the enhancement of rural communities by 1943 when the affiliated national resources planning board was shut down by a congress resentful of its executive powers the federal government s pursuit of regional balancing had given way to a model of urban industrial expansion favoring large metropolitan regions including the regions covered by the tva itself population in its metropolitan counties grew by almost two thirds between 1930 and1950 the tva continued to serve as a model for balancing underdeveloped regions worldwide supported by the international finance infrastructure hatched at bretton woods the imf the world bank and the general agreement on tariffs and trade but by the early 1970s these institutions shifted course calling for wage restraint and an open door for transnational corporate and nonprofit enterprise they promoted a new international division of labor in which developing countries would exercise their comparative labor market advantage in manufacturing and extraction while developed nations in the west would assume control over staple food production high tech innovation and finance to their great enrichment all three conditions that call for regional balancing lack of integration with modern technologies proneness to natural and man made disaster and environmental degradation justify bringing the industrial heartland into parity with regions rich with so called brain hubs not only has the region s economy been systematically weakened for many decades but its resources are crucial to combating climate change repaired and upgraded after decades of neglect it can contribute a disproportionate share of water land energy capacity and productive know how to decarbonization and adaptation to the perils ahead expand haraz n ghanbari ap photo algae bloom covers lake erie near toledo ohio water taken together the great lakes comprise the largest body of fresh water in the world and man have they taken a beating the rapid 19th century anglo american settlement of their shores coincided with the rise of manufacturing modern plumbing and later industrial agriculture a triumvirate of toxic sources that threatens the basin s drinking water and contributes to flooding hazards lake erie has been particularly hard hit by algae blooms affecting all five of the lakes caused by phosphorous and nitrogen nutrient runoff produced by agricultural and residential fertilizer human and animal waste and pesticides this cocktail of contaminants flows into waterways feeding into the great lakes during heavy rainfall which is increasing with climate change an especially severe algae bloom in the western basin of lake erie in 2014 forced the city of toledo to impose a nearly three day ban on its lake drawn tap water with an estimated economic impact cost of 65 million the blooms appear each summer a particularly large one in 2019 and threaten to grow worse across the world with warming waters expand prospect illustration one of the major conduits for contaminated runoff are the combined sewer systems csss that are concentrated in cities throughout the midwest and northeast with industrialization came modern plumbing along with this then state of the art wastewater and sewer infrastructure which cleared stormwater industrial waste and untreated sewage through one outflow piping system although a big improvement over the cesspool ditches that once lined city streets ccss were not designed to handle massive population growth the spread of flush toilets or the impervious asphalt road surfaces later used to accommodate automotive travel constructed as long as 150 years ago their metal sewer pipes are also corroding and clogging leading to leakage into the groundwater and reduced carrying capacity another grave threat to the region s water infrastructure was thrown into high relief five years ago with the flint michigan water crisis poisoning conveyed through lead pipes which is still far from resolved again aging lead service pipes and soldering predominate in the midwest and somewhat less so in the northeast since 2014 lead has been found to be contaminating drinking water in detroit chicago milwaukee pittsburgh baltimore and newark among other cities media outlets such as cbs news call this a national problem but it is most acute and widespread in the industrial heartland the estimated cost of addressing these health menacing troubles is high but appropriate to the green new deal s mission and scale of public investment in 2004 the epa put a price tag of 88 8 billion on upgrading ccs systems nationwide noting that some progress has already been made in reducing lead exposure from tap water the american water works association estimated in 2016 that it will cost some 1 3 billion to repair utility owned lead based drinking water mains and to replace lead service pipes over the following 25 years digital sensoring systems now under development could also monitor lead and nutrient levels signaling priority investment over time utilities homeowners businesses and state and local governments could share these expenses with federal subsidies provided by a wisely structured regionally focused green new deal expand prospect illustration some have called for renaming the rust belt the water belt it s a good idea one that elevates the region s importance in a green new deal such reframing avoids sweeping the region into the dustbin of globalization and lays stress on safeguarding its distinctive hydrological gifts for future generations land the industrial heartland has an abundance of poorly used farmland and underused urban land according to the american farmland trust 10 percent of the world s arable acres lie in the united states most of the best of this land suitable for intensive agriculture and crop production is located in the american midwest the region s prime farmland is afflicted in two senses for one it is particularly susceptible to suburban development pressure or what a brookings institution study called sprawl without growth in which development pushes outward without metro population growth to support it this resource waste and fiscal recklessness stems from a legacy of racial discrimination decades of urban disinvestment and depopulation and the flight of manufacturing from cities first to the suburbs then to the south and eventually overseas the abuse of farmland is also self inflicted with environmental consequences that extend beyond the midwest excessive drainage and poor soil cultivation with heavy reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides leads to greater flooding and drought impacts along the tributary rivers feeding into the mississippi river the catastrophic rolling floods of 2019 demonstrated that without altering our agricultural practices the country s interior river system cannot handle the more intensive frequent precipitation induced by climate change and the cost is high not only to individual farmers but in the form of taxpayer funded crop insurance higher food prices and water contamination that culminates in the deoxygenated dead zone unfit for marine habitat that plagues the gulf of mexico at the mouth of the mississippi each summer most of this is of course in the service of subsidized big industrial commodity agriculture which also drives up land prices and inhibits food production by smaller farmers and ranchers a green new deal should target this region for farmland protection from both sprawl and agricultural practices that endanger the country s even the world s food supply and water integrity this is not the place to lay out comprehensive policy proposals but a powerful first step would be to dramatically increase funding for the federal agricultural conservation easement program which enables farmers to put their land into permanent agricultural use without sacrificing their plans to retire on the proceeds of sale to developers more controversially programs such as british columbia s agricultural land reserve which puts aside approximately 18 000 square miles of public and private land throughout the province for agricultural and forestry uses should also receive serious consideration forests and well tended soils it should be added have the additional advantage of acting as carbon sinks a form of mitigation that will be indispensable in the years ahead and for those who question where future development would go without access to so called open land zoning reform could actually take advantage of the region s sprawl without growth pattern which has created plenty of potential for infill housing and commercial development on vacant and distressed lots in heartland cities and inner ring suburbs and on large single family properties sprawl without growth has also devastated urban land values in our legacy cities even in the more successful ones where poor neighborhoods have actually grown poorer even as gentrification seized hold of others as a result of downward property values their predominately black residents are more deeply entrenched in intergenerational poverty landlords and even homeowners have little incentive to invest in their properties and those with middle class incomes are compelled to move to the suburbs in these neighborhoods vacant or distressed properties are the norm and roads sidewalks street lighting and parks are in disrepair this is what disinvestment looks like expand prospect illustration as alan mallach has argued in his prudent deeply learned 2018 book the divided city these neighborhoods may not be poised for dramatic turnaround but they can be made more safe healthy and investment worthy for their resident communities as the sweeping mid 20th century urban renewal gambits demonstrated in this arena federal planning should defer to local leadership pursuing as needed incremental change but a green new deal could do much to supplement cash strapped municipalities in funding home repairs and public works improvements these are not big ticket items mallach estimates that 10 million could turn 1 000 borderline homes safe and livable keeping residents in their neighborhoods it could also assist in strengthening rental regulations to curb slumlords who take advantage of generous federally funded section 8 vouchers these equity measures and many others like them also position legacy cities for a low carbon future by keeping urban communities intact patrons of public transit city businesses and local services rather than suburb bound renewable energy and technology the industrial heartland s energy system is as outworn as its once storied manufacturing base according to pv magazine the midwest s contribution to the nation s renewable energy mix is just 4 percent and half of that comes from one state minnesota the explanation is twofold the region is disproportionately dependent on coal fired power generation and state regulations particularly renewable portfolio standards rps have been neither as consistent nor as robust as elsewhere the largely rural region is also wedded to fossil fueled automotive travel culturally and for lack of viable transportation alternatives that said wind and solar are making some headway in the region in part because of its plentiful open and working lands five of its states are among the top ten in u s installed wind generation capacity and in spite of technical difficulties the cleveland area is poised to install a 20 7 megawatt pilot wind farm long under development on lake erie the newest entering wedge however lies in solar even in this notoriously cloudy region at par competitive pricing in the solar sector is putting utility scale solar in the pipeline most surprisingly in coal dependent low rps ohio also home to the western hemisphere s largest solar manufacturing company metro toledo s first solar and none of this takes into account community and rooftop solar and the extent to which farmers are supplementing their incomes with wind and increasingly solar installations expand doral chenoweth iii the columbus dispatch the timber road ii wind farm in the northwestern corner of ohio although markets with minor regulatory intervention are beginning to advance renewable energy in the region the transition faces another obstacle the limitations of the region s privately owned grid in the midcontinent iso a federally approved nonprofit that manages electricity in 15 states 14 have vertically integrated utilities meaning that private utilities own everything from power generators to transmission and distribution lines the arrangements vary significantly but the point is that some states want greater influence over generation sources mainly to bolster nuclear or renewables even if it requires subsidies that distort market pricing and that accommodating intermittent renewables and two way smart energy flow will require major investment in transmission line upgrades development of the two way smart grid will be especially important to developing the economically competitive charging infrastructure essential to transitioning to electric vehicles where the midwest hasn t even made a dent the industrial heartland is hardly alone in facing these regulatory technical and market pricing issues but it also has the largest share of coal fired power and the greatest need to make strides in renewable energy again a green new deal can provide targeted support here subsidizing coal off lining transmission upgrades and energy innovation and returning at least parts of the grid to public ownership taking shareholder pressure out of the system finally support for a low carbon economy in this region will require substituting good jobs for those lost in fossil fuel production and manufacturing even if some of the latter are recaptured most current and prospective jobs however require access to high speed internet services whether through cable based broadband or state of the art wireless the trouble is that the market economics require high density use to support the expensive infrastructure buildout which means that rural areas are grossly underserved this leaves farmers without the digital access needed to engage in precision agriculture and off farm work it deprives rural populations of distance learning and small business opportunities as well as integration with high tech industries silicon valley has shown interest in teaching coding to displaced and underemployed workers in america s backwaters as arlie hochschild recently reported in the new york times with a focus on former appalachian coal miners their early programs have met with some success such initiatives can move this work out of high priced cities where the cost of living is prohibitive for middle income earners or back to the united states from say bangladesh while geographically distributing high tech earnings across the country but without high speed digital access those potential rural gains are likely to be minimal arousing further resentment and deepening the region s large pockets of rural isolation the obstacles are entirely economic and they are expensive and the industrial heartland along with the lower south is the most deprived of these services here again green new deal policy should work with the states and the private sector to prioritize rural broadband in the industrial heartland as did the new deal in bringing rural electrification to the south through the tva regional development the case of syracuse imagine what an infusion of green new deal funding could accomplish within the metros that ground the smaller regional economies dotting the industrial heartland with a population of approximately 145 000 syracuse new york is the eastern gateway to the rust belt like its sister legacy cities syracuse was once a manufacturing powerhouse home to the likes of general electric carrier chrysler gm and crouse hinds and blessed with prime farmland that has long supported dairy fruit and vegetable cultivation and commodity crops also similarly the city has lost more than a third of its population since 1950 while its metro footprint has sprawled outward with virtually no equivalent population growth unlike many of its peers syracuse is rich in medical and university research centers syracuse university has been an unusually effective partner in stabilizing a nearby neighborhood of concentrated poverty increasing access to jobs and homeownership when the 2013 brookings study featured the syracuse metro region as a particularly egregious example of sprawl without growth throughout upstate new york and the industrial heartland in general state and local government took stronger action on urban land use the cuomo administration put in place regional economic development packages that incentivized smart growth and in 2018 the country s most generous state level farmland protection subsidies the second greatest share 7 7 million going to central new york most substantially the cny regional economic development council won a then new 2015 upstate revitalization initiative competitive state grant of 500 million to be distributed over five years among its winning strategies are the creation of a global manufacturing and logistics hub a commission on government modernization to reduce fiscal inefficiencies caused by fragmented local services and a program to improve food and beverage processing for global export on its eventual to do list with further capital and funding support are programs to develop geothermal hvac systems and improve regional water infrastructure expand mike groll ap photo workers from the syracuse water department repair a broken main in 2014 mike groll ap photo these efforts represent a start but green new deal funding could achieve full buildout chris carrick energy program manager at the central new york regional planning and development board whom i spoke with by phone put together a wish list of energy and water related projects he d like to see funded by a green new deal using the 500 million revitalization grant as a benchmark with a 90 percent federal match similar to that used for highway funding he traces out what a 900 million pot might accomplish in syracuse he begins with the basics obvious and easy projects that have been long neglected with approximately 25 percent of syracuse households or 14 500 below the poverty line the city has already begun using state funds to make these homes energy efficient at full scale however a 100 million low income home energy retrofit fund would not only reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions and improve the value of these homes while bringing cost savings to household budgets it would attract job supporting insulation manufacturers and installation companies to the city after all remarks carrick in these energy inefficient homes the federal low income heating assistance program is just another fossil fuel industry subsidy energy conservation measures in 35 city buildings would cost another 3 million the largest source of ghg emissions in new york state has moved in recent years however from buildings to transportation here carrick proposes replacing the regional 250 bus centro fleet with hybrid or battery electric buses at a cost of 50 70 million and replacing the two most heavily traveled lines with bus rapid transit with amenity and shelter upgrades for another 35 million and in spite of its reduced population syracuse remains the region s predominant employment center with a disproportionately large share of commuters to reduce automotive use carrick calls for establishing several intermodal last mile transit hubs for a price tag of 30 40 million and to prepare for electric vehicle use installing charging stations would cost another 10 million upgrades to rail and port facilities to displace polluting truck transport would come in at 25 million next up grid and clean energy upgrades with funding from the new york state energy research and development authority the central new york planning board conducted a successful two year feasibility study of microgrid development in a city neighborhood microgrids offer resilient decentralized power and are equipped to handle solar and other sources of renewable energy carrick estimates that bringing microgrids to other highly serviced neighborhoods would cost 10 million other projects including a downtown district energy system using either lake source geothermal or onondaga lake wastewater treatment plant waste heat recovery and geothermal would ring up at another 60 110 million the us epa and the new york state department of environmental conservation are also pressing for installation of solar photovoltaic on brownfields and closed municipal landfills which would amount to 50 megawatts of electricity generation at a cost of 100 million further as elsewhere in the industrial heartland the syracuse metro region s stormwater and sewer infrastructure is hopelessly decrepit says carrick due to deferred maintenance not only does the city itself have a combined sewer overflow system to which its save the rain green infrastructure initiative is alone unequal but the 120 year old system is ravaged with leaky pipes that waste water and weakens their capacity to capture water flow and waste heat energy and serve water pumping needs carrick suggests that addressing these water management issues including extensive development of green infrastructure would cost around 100 million in syracuse and a handful of metro communities others put the figure much higher much depends on what parts of this extensive infrastructure projected budgets cover all together the price tag adds up to some 600 million as we have seen new york state has already teed up its farmland conservation water infrastructure and clean energy programs the state also established a green bank in 2014 the country s largest offering low interest loans for private sector investment in renewable energy development and just this summer the state passed an aggressive climate leadership and community protection act calling for complete zero carbon electricity including 15 percent offsets by 2050 with a 40 percent reduction from 1990 ghg levels by 2030 with these state mandates and financing mechanisms in place and local groundwork long established regional green new deal funding could push syracuse and other kindred cities across the finish line recapturing the value of its many natural assets in a decarbonized future reviving regional planning national regional planning fell out of favor long ago replaced by an urban industrial growth model that with later assists from the international finance system led to the global division of labor that so gutted the industrial heartland in the era of climate change a green new deal should claw back these losses incorporating some version of the tva s original river basin based ecological regionalism into its policy framework just as the south received targeted attention through the tva in an effort to establish regional balance the industrial heartland today has a special claim to regional policy priorities among all u s regions it lost out the most to the neoliberal global economy in manufacturing jobs urban population loss and vacant properties state and local fiscal distress and agricultural degradation it also has disproportionately more to contribute to a low carbon economy with its prime farmland plentiful water supply and land assets suited to wind solar and other forms of renewable energy today the region s states and localities lack the capacity to address its challenges and build on its strengths it is fair to say that it is owed federal support to retool for the low carbon economy and to prepare for climate migrants who will soon be moving away from the coasts and from warmer climes getting there politically would be a tall order of course the emergency conditions of the great depression inclined the electorate to hand fdr executive powers unimaginable today when the issue is not one of massive unemployment but of low paid underemployment as a result the original new deal distributed spending for programs such as the civilian conservation corps the soil conservation service and the works progress and public works administrations throughout the country which overlapped with more targeted programs including the tva likewise and perhaps more germane today military spending during and after world war ii effectively rebalanced the economy by moving large shares of defense contracts out of large industrialized coastal cities and into the more economically needy and lower cost south and west suburbanizing districts and rural areas today s seemingly permanent and more evenly distributed defense spending ensures that military appropriations however bloated get through congress with bipartisan support congressional earmarking banned in 2011 also helped even the field strange as it is to suggest a green new deal might model the political workings of the american warfare state and restore the practice of earmarking to provide geographical balance to climate funding while also targeting resources to the industrial heartland at present in the industrial heartland as elsewhere some collaborative regional governance is already poised to put federal climate funding to use these networks now limited in number and scope need to be expanded significantly if the region is to be revived and retooled to meet the disproportionate demands climate change will place on it the council of state governments itself a product of the new deal is hardly the robust vehicle for national regional planning it was when established in 1933 but its four regional subsections including one for the midwest offer a skeletal framework for debating inter regional climate priorities the great lakes restoration initiative established in 2010 brought together federal agencies state provincial and tribal governments mayoral compacts universities and the private sector to promote the ecosystem health of these critical waters just recently its federal funding received bipartisan support the midwestern greenhouse gas reduction accord signed by six regional governors in 2007 and gutted three years later with the tea party revolt is showing signs of life again these are just a few of the coordinated state and local organizations positioned to mount a national regional approach to climate change there was a time when the industrial heartland grounded the u s manufacturing economy due to its bountiful resources it is primed to ground the productive green economy too if only our politics can find ways of bringing it about

default rates on rise the trend may be relatively modest but defaults on non mortgage debt in canada is now at its highest for a third quarter since 2012 the rate of delinquencies of more than 90 days

challenged with their current financial situation equifax vice president of data analytics bill johnston said in releasing the numbers still while the uptrend in delinquencies has been relatively

bangkok is one of the most expensive cities in the world largely because of the strong baht according a survey by eca international bangkok post photo bangkok has leapt 43 places and entered the top 50 most expensive locations in the world for the first time largely because of the strong baht according a survey by eca international which advises on management and compensation for employees being assigned around the world bangkok long seen as a cheap destination for holidaymakers and expatriates alike has seen a huge jump in its rankings moving the most out of all asian cities surveyed this is largely the result of the strong baht said lee quane regional director for asia with eca international bangkok has moved up 75 places in the last two years and now ranks 47th in the annual eca cost of living survey while chiang mai moved up 56 places in the same period he said eca international has been researching the cost of living for more than 45 years it carries out two main surveys per year to help companies calculate cost of living allowances so their employees spending power is protected while on international assignment the surveys compare a basket of like for like consumer goods and services commonly purchased by assignees in over 480 locations worldwide certain living costs such as accommodation rental utilities car purchases and school fees are usually covered by separate allowances data for these costs are collected separately and are not included in eca s cost of living basket asia highlights although it fell to third place in asia behind ashgabat and tokyo hong kong s place in the rankings has remained stable this year as the sixth most expensive location in the world for expatriates despite the ongoing socio political upheavals and the economy being in recession we have yet to see a real impact on the cost of living in the city said mr quane inflation remains high relative to many other locations that occupy the upper reaches of our rankings hong kong has only been overtaken by tokyo because of the strong performance of the japanese yen throughout 2019 which moved many japanese cities up the rankings furthermore we expect prices in japan to increase further because of the recent increase in consumption tax while next year s olympics in tokyo are likely to have further inflationary effects singapore is the seventh most expensive location in asia for expat workers to live and 13th most expensive in the world despite relatively low inflation and weakening global trade growth singapore has risen five places thanks to the continued strength of the singapore dollar singapore is now more expensive for expatriates than seoul and shanghai he said in spite of recent price rises in many chinese cities which can be partly attributed to the impact of asian swine flu on meat prices many chinese cities surveyed by eca have fallen slightly in the rankings this is mainly because of the weakness of the yuan against major currencies in the past 12 months while pork prices have increased significantly in the past 12 months the impact on the cost of living for expatriates in chinese cities versus their peers elsewhere has been muted by the weakness of the currency said mr quane global highlights ashgabat the capital of turkmenistan remains the most expensive city in the world for expats for a second year running the city rocketed up from 146th place in 2017 and has remained in the top spot ever since thanks to a combination of high inflation and a black market currency rate far weaker than the official exchange rate this makes purchases particularly expensive for expatriates in their home currency unless they can access the illegal black market exchange rate future living costs in turkmenistan could potentially follow the same trajectory that we are currently seeing in angola said mr quane the once booming oil based economy of the angolan capital luanda which topped the rankings in the 2017 survey has continued to fall dropping 50 places to 92nd place middle eastern countries have generally continued to see an increase in the cost of living because of the strength of their currencies many of which are tied to the us dollar tel aviv entered the top 10 for the first time in ninth place and jerusalem was 12th apart from swiss cities that continue to dominate the top 10 worldwide most european cities have fallen in the rankings since last year continued uncertainty over brexit has seen london drop to 140th place the lowest position it has occupied since eca began producing its cost of living rankings in 2005 many european cities have dropped out of the top 100 since last year with the euro zone s largest economy in the dumps most euro zone countries have seen a slight drop in the cost of living for expatriates because of the relative weakness of the euro he said us cities have risen across the board for the second year as the dollar continues its strong run new york re entered the top 20 for the first time since 2015 moving up to 15th from 24th last year honolulu also entered the top 20 in 20th place overtaking cities previously in the top 20 including copenhagen and shanghai

u s dollar left wounded by federal reserve but finds support amid uk election china tariff threat image european central bank usd finds support in wake of overnight post fed losses fed has scrapped 2020 rate hike forecast from dot plot but indicated strongly that it s done cutting interest rates growth pulse jobs market and inflation key to rate outlook requires material reassessment of outlook to alter stance uk general election risk china tariff threat offer usd support the dollar came limping into the morning session thursday after being wounded by the federal reserve fed overnight although some analysts see it finding support ahead as british voters head to the polls and markets wait to hear if fresh tariffs will land on china s exports this weekend the federal reserve left its interest rate unchanged at 1 5 to 1 75 wednesday in line with expectations but dropped from its dot plot an earlier forecast that suggested a solitary rate hike could come at some point next year it continues to project one rate increase in 2021 and 2022 dollar exchange rates sold off after the decision other currencies advanced u s bond yields fell and stock markets pushed higher above dollar index shown at daily intervals markets liked mr powell s assertion that he would want to see a significant and persistent increase in inflation before he would want to raise rates and he again drew attention to the undershoot to the target says ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics markets put much more weight on the views of the chair that s probably the right approach fed chair jerome powell s subsequent press conference has left analysts and economists with the impression the bank has no intention of cutting interest rates again in the near future powell said that so long as u s growth is sustained the jobs market remains strong and inflation is near the symmetric 2 percent objective the current level of interest rates would remain appropriate once again it would take a material reassessment of our outlook in order to change that stance on the federal open market committee powell reiterated wednesday above u s two year government bond yield shown at hourly intervals the fed won t be hiking anytime soon but it s easy to see how the inflation data could make further easing much less likely yesterday though markets focussed on the removal of the 2020 rate hike forecast and mr powell s relaxed assessment of the current inflation picture shepherdson says the fed had little obvious reason for dovishness this week given friday s november jobs report was a blowout that suggested 266k new jobs were created last month the highest since december 2018 and third quarter growth was revised higher the previous week revealing the economy gained momentum last quarter rather than slowing like many thought meanwhile inflation rose from 1 7 to 1 8 in october and hit 2 1 in november taking it above the fed s 2 target core inflation held steady at 2 3 such gains in prices jobs and the economy which come amid a lull in the trade war were never very likely to have stoked caution or panic at the fed the bank has already cut rates three times this year to protect the u s from an ongoing global economic slowdown that had bitten the american manufacturing sector but it could take renewal of hostilities in the u s china tariff fight or a turn in the jobs market to prompt a material reassessment at the fed above euro to dollar rate shown at 4 hour intervals concludes that while the fed thinks it has everything under control the same forecasting framework that helped us pinpoint the end of the fed s hiking cycle in 2019 is also indicating that the fomc will have to cut rates all the way back to zero before the end of 2020 in short enjoy that xmas break because you will need it says michael every a strategist at rabobank pricing in the overnight index swap market had implied on wednesday that the midpoint of the fed funds range would sit at 1 50 on march 18 2020 that s the day of the second 2020 fed meeting and many would say it suggested something close to a 50 probability of a rate cut before then so powell s wednesday hint that rates could remain where they are now for a protracted period was not necessarily a negative for the dollar given that pricing in the interest rate markets the fact that investors sold dollars and bought other currencies in response to wednesday s statement has taken some analysts by surprise although some also say the fed inspired weakness is unlikely to last for long we are more inclined to think that the post fed reaction is a head fake at the end of the day eur remains a long way removed from challenging the usd anytime soon and we do not think investors have much capacity to rattle the ranges at this time year particularly ahead of some key near term event risks like the uk election says mazen issa a strategist at td securities above pound to dollar rate shown at daily intervals there may be more relief for the dollar bloc currencies however a sidelined fed and bottoming global growth should be particularly supportive for risk especially with other central banks likely pinned to the sidelines we are particularly focused on aud and cad shorts in the former are looking stale but the 200dma at 0 6912 will be the major litmus test as for cad a comfortable fed just reinforces that the boc can remain sidelined for some time and hence still bodes well for a relatively higher yielding cad issa says thursday s fed induced price action comes as british voters head to the polls in an election that will itself be the deciding vote on the direction of travel for pound sterling and to a lesser extent the euro in the weeks ahead markets favour a conservative party victory over the increasingly radical opposition labour party and the pollsters have led them believe that s exactly what they re going to get this thursday exit polls are out from 22 00 and the result will be known in the early hours of friday morning sterling won t be fully priced in until the result is all but guaranteed roughly 3am friday morning if you plan on being up with me the wider market has been stung by political outcomes in the last few years and will be wary of jumping the gun too early a hung parliament at this stage does seem very unlikely but that only means that the fall in the value of the pound will be more concerted from current levels if that outcome were to materialise says john goldie an fx dealer at argentex a london stock exchange listed payments specialist it also comes ahead of a sunday deadline on which the rest of china s annual exports to the u s are due to be clobbered by a 15 tariff although this time the levies will hit consumer goods and so could be felt by american households those tariffs would deliver a blow to the global economy but could support the dollar because of the adverse impact on other currencies china s commerce ministry said thursday the country is in communication with the u s but would not provide further comment although trump said via his twitter account in the noon hours the u s is getting very close to a big deal with china
trump is in the catbird seat with a phase one trade deal lanhee chen says u s stocks rose to records on optimism that the trump administration will clinch a deal with china on trade and avert fresh tariffs the pound fell ahead of the first exit polls in the u k general election the s p 500 rallied following a bloomberg report that american officials had reached a deal in principle that only needed trump s approval shortly after u s markets closed news broke that the president had signed off on the agreement to avert tariffs set for dec 15 a breakthrough on trade would remove a major overhang for equity investors just a day after the federal reserve signaled it is no rush to raise interest rates as the economy shows steady improvement trade headlines whipsawed stocks all day as investor optimism rose and fell with the latest negotiation by tweet thursday s gain in american stocks pushed the msci all country index to its first record since january 2018 the spike in treasury yields boosted financial stocks lifting the s p 500 financial index past its closing high from may 2007 in europe the central bank said it would maintain bond buying and keep rates low until it gets near its inflation goal the swiss franc nudged higher after the central bank left rates unchanged the pound fell as u k voters went to the polls elsewhere saudi aramco shares jumped for a second day pushing the oil giant s value beyond the us 2 trillion mark oil futures rose the lira gained as the turkish central bank delivered another interest rate cut that exceeded forecasts these are the main moves in markets stocks the s p 500 index rose 0 9 per cent at 4 p m new york time the dow jones industrial average jumped 0 8 per cent the stoxx europe 600 index rose 0 3 per cent the msci all world index rose 0 8 per cent to a record the msci asia pacific index rose 0 6 per cent currencies the bloomberg dollar spot index was flat the euro was flat at us 1 113 the british pound lost 0 2 per cent to us 1 3166 the japanese yen fell 0 7 per cent to 109 35 per dollar bonds the yield on 10 year treasuries rose 11 basis points to 1 897 per cent the two year treasury rate added five basis points to 1 66 per cent germany s 10 year yield spiked to 0 27 per cent commodities west texas intermediate crude climbed 0 9 per cent to us 59 31 a barrel gold futures fell 0 1 per cent to us 1 474 20 an ounce
chinese president xi jinping is expected to announce policies for macau including the setting up of a stock exchange china s casino city is being primed by president xi jinping to become a financial centre a move seen by macau s officials and executives as a reward for having avoided the anti government protests that have gripped nearby hong kong over the past six months xi will visit macau next week to announce a series of new policies aimed at diversifying macau s casino dependent economy into a financial centre according to more than a dozen interviews with officials and corporate executives the policies include the establishment of a yuan denominated stock exchange and the acceleration of a renminbi settlement centre already in the works as well as the allocation of land for macau to develop in neighbouring mainland china they said while there has been speculation about the proposals in recent months the fact they have been officially approved has not previously been reported the financial industry used to be an idea that we reserved for hong kong said one chinese official who requested anonymity we used to give all the favourable policies to hong kong but now we want to diversify it xi s trip to mark the 20th anniversary of macau s return to china from portuguese rule comes as the central government has praised the city for upholding the one country two systems framework that governs hong kong and macau in contrast china has condemned anti government protests in hong kong and accused demonstrators in the financial centre of undermining national stability china s hong kong and macau affairs office did not respond to requests for comment diversified economy beijing has instructed state owned banks and enterprises to help set up infrastructure in macau to aid financial diversification four sources familiar with the matter told reuters two officials who helped develop the shanghai stock exchange moved to the territory this year to help establish its yuan based stock exchange one of the sources said chinese officials and bankers in hong kong say the push to develop financial infrastructure in macau is part of a plan to avoid any significant market disruption in hong kong that could affect chinese businesses the idea is not for macau to replace or undermine hong kong but for china to have a contingency plan in case the situation in hong kong worsens they said xi jinping has made very clear that he wants a diversified macau economy said another chinese official who declined to be identified the future focus will be on tourism and finance to make it a centre to host international meetings like singapore macau s new exchange will initially be focused on bond trading to encourage local and chinese companies to issue debt in the city according to a chinese official familiar with the matter the exchange will also focus on start ups and target companies from portuguese speaking countries ensuring it does not directly compete with bourses in hong kong or in the southern chinese city of shenzhen according to six macau executives and chinese officials macau was a portuguese colony until it was handed to china in 1999 an announcement that macau will join the beijing backed asian infrastructure investment bank is also expected during xi s visit two chinese officials said deeper integration xi is expected to announce policies to further integrate macau with mainland cities in the greater bay area the region around the pearl river delta that also includes hong kong according to chinese officials and macau executives as part of that effort macau will be allocated more land on the chinese island of hengqin to develop in areas such as education and healthcare they said macau s casino operators who have been hit by slowing economic growth the trade war between the united states and china and a weakening chinese yuan are also looking at development opportunities in hengqin casino executives said the economic slowdown in china has added to pressure on macau to diversify its economy from the casino industry which accounts for more than 80 percent of government revenues we plan to work with the macau government to launch programmes that encourage next generation entrepreneurs to start businesses in hengqin said lawrence ho chief executive of melco resorts which runs three casino resorts in macau sands china another casino operator said it was looking at setting up a training academy in hengqin beijing has previously allocated macau portions of land on the former oyster farming island which lies just across the water from its casinos including land for macau university s campus which opened in 2013 while the new initiatives were not explicitly linked to toeing the official line chinese officials have repeatedly praised macau for setting an example in maintaining national security and adhering to the central government s requirements this is the candy that hong kong did not want said larry so a political commentator and retired macau university professor it is a gift for macau for macau being a good boy macau model in recent weeks xi has said at several gatherings of senior government officials that it is crucial to find ways to implement the macau model in hong kong two people familiar with the discussions said on condition of anonymity president xi jinping spoke highly of the practice of one country two systems with macau characteristics this is an encouragement and a spur macau s chief executive fernando chui said at a meeting with chinese officials in beijing on december 3 according to an official transcript more than half of macau s population of 600 000 immigrated from china in recent decades which has helped the territory foster a stronger affinity for the mainland than in hong kong where most of the population was locally born millions of dollars also have been ploughed into creating youth associations in macau linked to the chinese government many of macau s associations are traditional pro establishment groups that dole out generous subsidies to residents macau will be an example of china s reunification ho iat seng who is set to become macau s next chief executive on december 20 told state broadcaster china central television last month the city was well placed to better develop the one country two systems principle he added

denver dec 12 2019 globe newswire the u s rural economy will continue to face headwinds in 2020 and is expected to underperform relative to the economy of urban america since 2014 gdp growth in rural counties has averaged almost 1 less than in urban counties that trend is likely to continue without a significant upswing in agricultural commodity prices energy exploration rural manufacturing and other industries upon which rural economic growth depend despite that bearish prognosis there is room for optimism according to a comprehensive 2020 outlook report from cobank s knowledge exchange division the u s farm economy has demonstrated its resiliency in the face of trade wars extreme weather and other disruptive events while the downside impact of trade disputes and tariffs will remain severe for many some agriculture sectors will see stronger exports and higher prices rising animal protein and dairy exports will be a bright spot for producers in 2020 most current signals indicate the overall domestic economy is on firm footing thanks almost exclusively to the consumer said dan kowalski vice president of cobank s knowledge exchange division however without a meaningful u s china trade deal the u s agricultural economy will continue to struggle with uncertainty in 2020 the cobank 2020 outlook report examines 10 key factors that will shape agriculture and market sectors that serve and impact rural communities throughout the u s global economy less trade slower growth after a year of trade tensions declining gdp and the slowest global economic growth since the depths of the financial crisis the world s leading economies hope to turn the page in 2020 the prognosis however offers little to support such optimism consumer strength the world over has prevented further slowing in the global economy the direction and severity of the u s china trade dispute will continue to have the most significant influence on the world economy in 2020 a leveling off of trade tensions would allow global economic growth to bottom out in early 2020 before showing signs of life later in the year however the vulnerable state of the global economy makes it susceptible to contraction if trade conditions worsen u s economy expansion for those left behind the u s economy will enter 2020 decisively split powered by a resilient and confident consumer but hamstrung by a risk averse business sector that has stopped investing now that stimulus effects from the 2017 tax reform and the 2018 spending bill have faded the economic expansion will show its age losing steam in the coming year there is evidence that since 2017 more people including those in rural communities have broadly shared the benefits of economic growth despite the continual rise in wealth inequality monetary policy sustain and prepare all eyes will be on the central banks as the world inches closer to the end of the longest period of economic growth in history japan and europe are still stimulating their economies with negative interest rates and quantitative easing after three rate cuts in 2019 the u s federal reserve is holding a more conservative stance with its target rate near 1 5 china has the most room to maneuver with its short term rate just under 3 all these accommodative stances are made possible because inflation remains inexplicably low despite tightening labor markets federal reserve chair powell s role in 2020 is to keep the late stage expansion going while simultaneously preparing for the recession that will arrive sooner or later u s government policy and trade up in the air agricultural policy at the federal level has been wrought with uncertainty and volatility the trade environment for 2020 remains hazy as well beyond a possible u s china phase one deal more progress with china will be a challenge as a result it is difficult to see trade as a bright spot in 2020 the atmosphere in washington today has given way to progress on agricultural labor legislation and the usmca but a protracted partisan fight over impeachment is on tap in the senate this rancor makes it difficult to advance legislation that helps agriculture which would give either side a win for the hotly contested 2020 election market facilitation program payments to farmers helped make up for persistently low commodity prices in the last year u s farm economy trade uncertainty lingers without a substantive u s china trade deal the u s agricultural economy will continue to struggle with trade uncertainty in 2020 as questions linger as to whether usda will continue to soften the blow of the trade war for farmers and ranchers with government payments amid persistently low commodity prices and rising costs u s farmers and ranchers continue to struggle with low and declining working capital farm debt already at record levels is expected to continue climbing as credit quality in farm loans declines particularly for grain and dairy producers however stable farm real estate values have helped farmers the resiliency of farmland values despite the steep drop in net farm income over the years has allowed farmers to restructure debt and address tight cash flow and liquidity crunches specialty crops labor and water in the spotlight fruit nut and vegetable markets will continue to face rising production costs in 2020 due to mounting regulations particularly as they relate to controls over groundwater in california regulations under the state s sustainable groundwater management act sgma are about to go into effect and could potentially cause acreage shifts between crops of varying water needs other government action in 2020 could have a favorable impact on specialty crop growers the farm workforce modernization act currently being debated in congress is a hopeful sign for an improved regulatory environment for agricultural labor if passed it would help ease the tight labor supply plaguing agriculture grain farm supply and biofuels time to transform challenges for the grain sector will persist in 2020 fueled by commodity price pressure policy uncertainty and export weakness amid growing global supply abundance especially for corn and soybeans u s wheat producers and exporters though may benefit from an improved export pace in 2020 with the russian wheat crop struggling biofuels also face challenges in 2020 u s ethanol production according to the u s energy information administration is expected to fall by 1 9 in 2019 to 15 8 billion gallons and remain flat in 2020 the outlook for farm supply companies is mixed and continues to be heavily influenced by weather to improve its value proposition this sector is actively pursuing vertical and horizontal consolidation dairy and animal protein exporting your way to success with dairy and animal protein production looking toward another year of increased production in 2020 a rebound in exports will be critical to profitability in both sectors per capita consumption of animal protein in the u s will likely set a new record in 2019 overall dairy consumption in the u s will remain strong in 2020 as americans continue eating more cheese and butter but fluid milk will likely continue its long term decline strong demand and rising exports though will not erase financial stress at the farm level producers of beef pork poultry and dairy will likely experience stress from higher feed costs due to lower crop yields this fall rural electricity demand grows for cleaner lower cost power companies throughout the electricity supply chain are likely to face heightened simultaneous demands for cleaner and less expensive power generation in 2020 these pressures reflect the intense popular concern about climate change wealth and income inequality and slowing economic growth three issues which americans rank as equally important in recent polling in many rural communities these concerns are likely to manifest in more numerous and more vehement calls for greater renewable power generation for utilities the task of justifying multi million dollar expenditures on new renewable resources will be easier in 2020 as the unsubsidized costs of solar wind battery energy storage and flexible natural gas fired resources continue to decline rural communications investors have come to buy rural and regional telecommunications operators will become targets in 2020

gilbert achcar is a professor of development studies and international relations at soas university of london he is the author of numerous books on the middle east including the people want a radical exploration of the arab uprising and morbid symptoms relapse in the arab uprising he was interviewed for the marxist left review by darren roso let s start by returning to what now seems to be a distant memory the revolutionary shockwave that swept the arab world in 2011 you argued in your book the people want a radical exploration of the arab uprising that these events were only the beginning of a protracted revolutionary process owing to the specific nature of capitalism in the middle east could you explain these dynamics of political economy in the arab world and their relationship to forms of authoritarian rule to begin with a general consideration it is obvious now that we are witnessing a severe global crisis of the neoliberal stage of capitalism neoliberalism developed as a full fledged capitalist stage since the enforcement of its economic paradigm in the 1980s this stage has gone into crisis since the great recession a decade ago the crisis is unfolding under our eyes resulting in ever increasing social upheavals if you look today at what is occurring in chile ecuador lebanon iraq iran hong kong and several other countries it looks like the boiling point is reached by more and more countries the events in the arab region fit into that general global crisis to be sure but there is something specific about that regional upheaval there the neoliberal reforms were carried out in a context dominated by a specific type of capitalism a type determined by the specific nature of the regional state system that is characterised by a combination in various proportions of rentierism and patrimonialism or neopatrimonialism what is mostly specific to the region is the high concentration of fully patrimonial states a concentration unequalled in any other part of the world patrimonialism means that ruling families own the state whether they own it by law under absolutist conditions or just in fact these families regard the state as their private property and the armed forces especially the elite armed apparatuses as their private guard these features explain why the neoliberal reforms got their worst economic results in the arab region of all parts of the world neoliberal inspired changes achieved in the region resulted in the slowest rates of economic growth of any part of the developing world and consequently the highest rates of unemployment in the world specifically youth unemployment the reason for this is not difficult to understand the neoliberal dogma is based on the primacy of the private sector the idea that the private sector should be the driving force of development while the state s social and economic functions must be curtailed the dogma says in a nutshell introduce austerity measures trim the state down cut social expenditure privatise state enterprises and leave the door wide open to private enterprise and free trade and miracles will happen now in a context lacking the prerequisites of ideal typical capitalism starting with the rule of law and predictability without which long term developmental private investment cannot happen what you end up getting is most of private investment going into quick profit and speculation especially in real estate along with construction but not in manufacturing or agriculture not in the key productive sectors this created a structural blockage of development thus the general crisis of the global neoliberal order goes in the arab region beyond a crisis of neoliberalism into a structural crisis of the type of capitalism prevailing there there is therefore no way out of the crisis in the region by a mere change of economic policies within the continued framework of the existing kind of states a radical mutation of the whole social and political structure is indispensable short of which there will be no end in sight to the acute social economic crisis and destabilisation that affects the whole region that s why such an impressive revolutionary shockwave rocked the whole region in 2011 rather than just mass protests the prospect was truly insurrectionary with people chanting the people want to overthrow the regime the slogan that has become ubiquitous in the region since 2011 the first revolutionary shockwave of that year forcefully shook the regional system of states revealing that it had entered a terminal crisis the old system is irreversibly dying but the new cannot be born yet i m referring here of course to gramsci s famous sentence and that s when morbid symptoms start appearing i used that phrase in the title of the 2016 sequel to my 2013 the people want is it true to say that neoliberal measures in the arab world have accelerated despite the revolutionary surge egypt s food prices are rising along with electricity and fuel prices and the conservative estimates of the world bank say about 60 percent of egyptians were either poor or vulnerable all this while the regime has renewed its crackdown on street protesters can you talk about the relationship between counter revolution and accelerated neoliberalism egypt provides a very good example of this indeed when the great recession hit in 2008 many believed that it heralded the end of neoliberalism and that the pendulum would swing back towards the keynesian paradigm that was a huge illusion however for the simple reason that economic policies are not determined by intellectual and empirical considerations they are determined instead and above all by the balance of class forces the neoliberal turn has been steered since the 1980s by fractions of the capitalist class those with a vested interest in financialisation in order to bring a new shift away from that there needs to be a change in the social balance of forces impacting the balance between fractions of the capitalist class itself a change equivalent at least to that which took place in the 1970s and 1980s this did not happen yet and the progressive forces opposed to neoliberalism have not yet proved strong enough to impose change the neoliberals are still running the show they claim that the reason of the global crisis is not neoliberalism but the lack of a thorough implementation of its recipes although they resorted massively in 2008 9 to measures contradicting their own dogma such as the huge bailout of the financial sector by means of state funds they quickly reverted to more and more of the same neoliberal policies pushed further and further that s exactly what we ve got in the arab region despite the gigantic revolutionary shockwave that shook the whole region in 2011 almost every single arabic speaking country saw a massive rise of social protest in 2011 six of the region s countries that is more than a quarter of them witnessed massive uprisings and yet the lesson according to the imf the world bank those guardians of the neoliberal order is that all this happened because their neoliberal recipes hadn t been implemented thoroughly enough the crisis they claimed was due to insufficient dismantling of remnants of yesterday s state capitalist economies they asserted that the solution is to end all forms of social subsidies even more radically than what had already occurred however the reason that governments of the region did not do more of that indeed was because they were afraid to do so this isn t eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall when people swallowed the very bitter pill of massive neoliberal changes in the hope that it would bring them capitalist prosperity in the arab world people are not willing to pay the price for that because they have no illusions that their countries will turn out like western europe as the eastern europeans were brought to believe therefore in order to impose further neoliberal measures on the people brutal force is required egypt is hence a very clear illustration of the fact that the implementation of neoliberalism does not go hand in hand with democracy as fukuyama s end of history fantasy claimed thirty years ago egypt clearly shows that in order to implement thoroughly the neoliberal program in the global south dictatorships are needed the first such implementation was in pinochet s chile of course in egypt it is now the post 2013 dictatorship led by field marshal sisi the most brutally repressive regime that the egyptians have endured in many decades it has gone the furthest in implementing the full neoliberal program advocated by the imf at a huge cost to the population with a steep rise in the cost of living food prices transport prices everything people have been completely devastated the reason why their anger did not explode in the streets on a massive scale is that they are deterred by state terror but the full implementation of the imf s neoliberal recipes has not and will not produce an economic miracle tensions are thus building up and sooner or later the country will erupt again there was already some limited explosion of popular anger last september sooner or later there will be a much bigger one though contexts differ and specificity is always important why did barbarism maintain its head start over the workers and democratic movements throughout the arab world what and why were the turning points of defeat in the region since 2011 what is the state of the egyptian left and the workers movement in the face of sisi s ultra neoliberalism and his authoritarian brutality unfortunately both the left and the workers movement in egypt are in bad shape they have suffered a painful defeat not only due to the brutal comeback of the repressive state but also because of their own contradictions and illusions the major part of the egyptian left has pursued a politically erratic trajectory switching from one misconceived alliance to another from the muslim brotherhood to the military in 2013 most of the left and the independent workers movement supported sisi s coup very short sightedly subscribing to the illusion that the army would put the democratic process back on track they thought that getting rid of morsi and the muslim brotherhood after their year in power would reopen the way to furthering the revolutionary process even though it was brought about by the military it sounds rather silly but they did genuinely hold this illusion which the military fostered in the initial post coup phase the military even co opted the head of the independent workers movement into their first post coup government this terrible blunder discredited the left as well as the independent workers movement as a result the left wing opposition is much weakened and marginalised in today s egypt i m not speaking here of the marxist radical left which has always been marginal although it played a disproportionate role at times during the revolutionary upheaval of 2011 13 i m speaking of the broader left the one that used to appeal to large masses this broader left has lost much of its credibility after 2013 this is actually one crucial reason why people have not mobilised massively against the new neoliberal onslaught when there is no credible alternative people tend to assimilate the regime s discourse that says it s us or chaos us or a syria like tragedy you must accept our iron heel it will be tough but at the end of the day you will find prosperity the egyptians do not really buy the last promise prosperity but they are still paralysed by the fear of falling into a situation much worse still than what they are enduring linked to all that is another specificity of the regional revolutionary process of which syria is the most tragic illustration we already discussed a first specificity the structural crisis that is peculiar to the arab world in the context of the general crisis of neoliberalism the other specificity is that this region has experienced the development over several decades of a reactionary oppositional current which was promoted for many years by the united states alongside its oldest ally in the region the saudi kingdom i mean islamic fundamentalism of course the whole spectrum of this current whose most prominent component is the muslim brotherhood and whose most radical fringe includes al qaeda and the so called islamic state aka isis islamic fundamentalism was sponsored by washington as a main antidote to communism and left wing nationalism in the muslim world during the cold war during the 1970s islamic fundamentalists were green lighted by almost all arab governments as a counterweight to left wing youth radicalisation with the subsequent ebb of the left wing wave they became the most prominent opposition forces tolerated in some countries such as egypt or jordan and crushed in others such as syria or tunisia they were however present everywhere when the 2011 uprisings started muslim brotherhood s branches jumped on the revolutionary bandwagon and tried to hijack it to serve their own political purposes they were much stronger than whatever left wing forces remained in the region very much weakened by the collapse of the ussr while the fundamentalists enjoyed financial and media backing from gulf oil monarchies as a result what evolved in the region was not the classical binary opposition of revolution and counter revolution it was a triangular situation in which you had on the one hand a progressive pole those groups parties and networks who initiated the uprisings and represented their dominant aspirations this pole was organisationally weak except for tunisia where a powerful workers movement compensated for the weakness of the political left and allowed the uprising in this country to score the first victory in bringing down a president thus setting off the regional shockwave on the other hand there were two counter revolutionary deeply reactionary poles the old regimes classically representing the main counter revolutionary force but also islamic fundamentalist forces competing with the old regimes and striving to seize power in this triangular contest the progressive pole the revolutionary current was soon marginalised not or not only due to organisational and material weakness but also and primarily because of political weakness of the lack of strategic vision the situation became dominated therefore by the clash between the two counter revolutionary poles which escalated into a clash of barbarisms as i call it of which syria is the most tragic illustration with a most barbaric syrian regime confronting barbaric islamic fundamentalist forces the huge progressive potential that was represented by the young people who initiated the uprising in syria in march 2011 got completely crushed many of these young people left the country because they couldn t survive either in regime held territories or in territories held by islamic fundamentalist forces much of the syrian progressive potential was thus scattered in europe turkey lebanon and jordan some of it survives inside the country but as long as the war situation lingers on it will be difficult for it to re emerge the kurdish situation in syria is a different story the kurdish pyd ypg in north east syria is undoubtedly the most progressive of all the armed forces active on the ground in syria if not the only progressive force they managed to develop and extend the territory under their control with us backing because washington under obama saw them as efficient foot soldiers in the fight against isis they had their own stake in fighting isis of course since it is a deadly enemy for them their first direct cooperation with the us was indeed in the battle of kobane in 2014 when us air support including airdrops of weapons was decisive in allowing the kurdish fighters to roll back isis s offensive there was thus a convergence of interests between the us providing air support as well as other means and resources and the ypg providing troops on the ground that is what donald trump has let down stabbing the kurds in the back and opening the way to turkey s colonial nationalist and racist onslaught against them their situation has become extremely precarious as they are now caught between turkey s hammer and the syrian regime s anvil between turkish chauvinism and arab chauvinism two projects of ethnic cleansing converging on the project to replace kurds with arabs in syria s border areas with turkey moscow is helping both in this endeavour but the pyd ypg failed to join up consistently with the rest of the struggle against assad s murderous regime i wouldn t put the main blame on them none of the syrian armed opposition forces was open to a true recognition of the kurds democratic and national rights to be sure the pyd ypg are not some reiteration of the paris commune as some tend to portray them quite naively and yet with all their limitations and without fostering illusions about them they represent the most progressive significant organised force on the ground in syria if we take the status of women as our main criterion and it should always be a crucial criterion for progressives there is no match for the pyd ypg add to this that their co thinkers in turkey lead the peoples democratic party hpd the only progressive and feminist major political force in that country what were the most significant theoretical and political lessons to draw out of the previous cycle of revolutionary struggle for marxists we often hear the argument that marxism is orientalist and is thus unsuited to non western societies michel foucault s attitude towards the iranian revolution 1979 was an example of the attempt to find salvation in a non western religious otherness declaring an end to universal visions of human emancipation class politics and marxian theoretical instruments to understand the world so why do you believe that marxist theory is better equipped to make sense of the revolutions and counter revolutions throughout the middle east and north africa what are the prospects for a new generation of arabic speaking marxist activists to develop since 2011 and to what extent has this started taking place the orientalist vision of the region is that it is doomed to be eternally stuck in religion as part of its cultural essence and that religion explains everything and has always been the key motivation of the region s populations that is a completely flawed vision of course which is also very impressionistic in that it ignores the past and believes that the present is going to last forever looking at the middle east and north africa in recent years one may get indeed the impression that islamic fundamentalist forces are prominent everywhere however that wasn t the case a few decades ago especially in the 1950s and 1960s when these forces were marginalised by much stronger left wing forces i was asked to write a preface to the re edition of maxime rodinson s marxism and the muslim world a few years ago this collection of articles most of which were written in the 1960s discusses a part of the world where left wing currents were dominant i had therefore to inform or remind the readers of this historical fact lest they be bewildered in reading the book few realise today that in the 1950s and 1960s it was widely assumed that the arab region was under communist ideological hegemony a moroccan author published in 1967 in french a book entitled contemporary arab ideology where he discussed what he called objective marxism as an ideology that was diffuse in the region by this phrase he meant that people used marxist categories and ideas most of them without even being aware of their origin or take a country like iraq a good example today clerics and mullahs dominate the political scene especially among the shiites but if you fast backward to the late 1950s you ll find that the major struggle in the country opposed communists to baathists the latter subscribing to a nationalist ideology that described itself as socialist the communists were particularly influential among the shiites and were able to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people in demonstrations so think of that iraq and of today s iraq a wide gulf is separating them but it proves that there is nothing in the genes of the region s populations that dooms them to abide by the political guidance of religious forces the most popular political leader in modern arab history was indisputably gamal abdel nasser egypt s president between 1956 and his untimely death in 1970 he went as far to the left as possible within the boundaries of bourgeois nationalism implementing a sweeping nationalisation of the economy along with successive agrarian reforms promoting state led industrial development and bringing a substantial improvement in labour conditions all this on an anti imperialist and anti zionist backdrop although it occurred under harsh dictatorial conditions this was a very progressive phase in egypt s history and it was emulated in several arab countries when you contemplate that history you realise that the role of islamic fundamentalism in recent decades is not rooted in some cultural essence as the orientalist view would have it it is rather the product of specific historical developments as we discussed already it is partly the product of washington s protracted and intensive use of islamic fundamentalism in cahoots with the most reactionary state on earth the saudi kingdom in fighting nasser and the ussr s influence in the arab region and the muslim world when the arab spring as the uprisings were called in 2011 blossomed a new generation entered the struggle on a mass scale the bulk of this new generation aspires to a radical progressive transformation they aspire to better social conditions freedom democracy social justice equality including gender emancipation they reject neoliberal policies and dream of a society in sharp contrast with the programmatic views of those islamic fundamentalist forces that hijacked or tried to hijack the uprisings and lead them towards their own goals there is a huge progressive potential in the region and we have seen it coming back to the fore in the second revolutionary shockwave that is presently unfolding it started in december 2018 with the sudanese uprising followed since last february by the algerian uprising and since october by massive social and political protests in iraq and in lebanon sudan algeria iraq and lebanon are boiling and all other countries of the region are on the brink of explosion what about the role of stalinism in the arab world the soviet union and the communist parties under its leadership have represented the dominant form of marxism in the region for decades there have been several important communist parties in the region all narrowly linked to moscow this meant that the self described marxist literature was heavily dominated by stalinism in the region in the 1950s and 1960s with the global emergence of the new left in the late 1960s and the 1970s new translations allowed access to critical marxist and anti stalinist marxist authors in arabic the rise of a new left in the arab region was boosted by the june 1967 defeat of the arab armies in the so called six day war which dealt a major blow to nasser and his regime a large section of the youth got radicalised beyond both nasserism and stalinism into what often was radical nationalism in a marxist garb rather than plain marxism the arab new left grew significantly in the late 1960s and early 1970s but it failed in building an alternative to the old left let alone an alternative to the powers that be that is the period when the regimes used islamic fundamentalism to nip the new left in the bud most if not all arab governments unleashed and helped islamic fundamentalist groups in the 1970s especially in the universities as an antidote to the new left wing radicalisation they thus contributed significantly to the failure of the radical left of course the latter bears the main responsibility for its own defeat it lacked political maturity and strategic acumen the new radicalisation did not go far beyond previously dominant superficial and dogmatic marxism heavily influenced by stalinism marxism was generally reduced to a few clichÃ©s there were exceptions of course but overall original marxist intellectual production in arabic remained very limited leaving aside contributions by marxist thinkers from the region who lived abroad and wrote in european languages such as the late samir amin the most prominent exception was hassan hamdan know under the pen name of mahdi amel he was the most sophisticated intellectual of the lebanese communist party and was assassinated by hezbollah in 1987 an anthology of his writings will come out soon in english translation let s return to the present the algerian uprising and sudan s revolution reignited hope as have the courageous protests in egyptian streets and lebanon s assemblies in riad al solh square calling to topple the current regime at the risk of asking an impossible question to what extent have ordinary people in the region learnt political lessons from the earlier wave of struggle what kind of mass dynamic is involved here how have the oppressed and exploited learnt through the experience of mass struggle have they learnt they have definitely learnt protracted revolutionary processes are cumulative in terms of experience and know how they are learning curves the peoples learn the mass movements learn the revolutionaries learn and the reactionaries learn as well of course everybody learns a long term revolutionary process is a succession of waves of upsurges and counter revolutionary backlashes but they are not mere repetitions of similar patterns the process is not circular it has to move forward or else it degenerates people grasp the lessons of previous experiences and do their best not to repeat the same errors or fall into the same traps this is very clear in the case of sudan but also for algeria and now for iraq and lebanon too sudan and algeria along with egypt are the three countries of the region where the armed forces constitute the central institution of political rule of course armed apparatuses are the backbones of states in general but it is direct military rule that is peculiar to these three countries in the arab region their regimes are not patrimonial no family owns the state to the point of making whatever they wish of it the state is rather dominated collegially by the armed forces command these are neo patrimonial regimes this means that they are characterised by nepotism cronyism and corruption but no single family is in full control of the state which remains institutionally separate from the persons of the rulers that explains why in the three countries the military ended up getting rid of the president and his entourage in order to safeguard the military regime that s what happened in egypt in 2011 with the dismissal of mubarak and this year in algeria with the termination of bouteflika s presidency followed by the overthrow of bashir in sudan all three carried out by the military however when it happened in egypt there were huge popular illusions in the military which were renewed in 2013 when the military deposed muslim brotherhood president morsi these illusions were not reiterated in sudan or algeria in 2019 on the contrary the popular movement in the two countries has been acutely aware that the military constitute the central pillar of the regime that they wish to get rid of the movement in both countries understands very well that when they chant the people want to overthrow the regime they mean military rule as a whole not the presidential tip of the iceberg alone they grasp this very clearly in both algeria and sudan unlike what happened in egypt previously but in sudan there is more than that difference there is a leadership that embodies the awareness of the lessons drawn from all previous regional experiences this is mainly due to the foundation of the sudanese professionals association spa which started in 2016 with teachers journalists doctors and other professionals organising an underground network as the uprising that started in december 2018 unfolded the association developed into a much larger network involving workers unions of all key sectors of the working class it has been playing the central role in the events on the side of the popular movement the spa was also instrumental in the constitution of a broad political coalition involving several parties and groups they are presently engaged in a political tug of war with the military they agreed temporarily on a compromise that instituted what can be described as a situation of dual power the country is ruled by a council in which the leadership of the people s movement is represented alongside the military command this is an uneasy transitional period that can t last very long sooner or later one of the two powers will have to prevail over the other but the key point here is that the sudanese experience represents a massive step forward compared with everything we have seen since 2011 and this is thanks to the existence of a politically astute leadership the spa didn t foster any illusions about the military they are as radically opposed to military rule as they are to islamic fundamentalism especially that both were represented in the regime under omar al bashir they uphold a very progressive program including a remarkable feminist dimension this is a very important experience which is very closely observed all over the region the popular movement in algeria is amazing for having been staging huge mass demonstrations every week for several months now but it has no recognised and legitimate leadership nobody can claim to speak in its name this is an obvious weakness in stark contrast with sudan the forms of leadership naturally change over time but we haven t entered some postmodern age of leaderless revolutions as some want us to believe the lack of leadership is a crucial impediment a recognised leadership is crucial in order to channel the strength of the mass movement towards a political goal this they have in sudan but not in algeria and not yet in iraq or lebanon in both iraq and lebanon however people inspired by the sudanese example are trying to set up something like the spa there are beginnings in that direction involving university teachers along with various professionals in lebanon they created an association of professional women and men clearly inspired by the sudanese model that clearly shows how learning from experience functions at the regional level could you further elaborate about the most significant aspects of the mass movements in iraq and lebanon both movements share a remarkable particularity in that both countries iraq and lebanon are characterised by a sectarian political system in lebanon it has been institutionalised by french colonialism after world war i in a form close to the country s present political system in iraq it was established by the us occupation much more recently such sectarian political regimes thrive off sectarian divisions naturally in their context religious sectarian divisions become the defining feature of political life and government sectarianism is a very pernicious and effective tool in diverting class struggle into religious strife it s an old recipe a version of divide and rule thwart any horizontal solidarity of class versus class by turning it into a vertical clash between sects bourgeois sectarian nepotistic leaderships secure the allegiance of members of the popular classes belonging to their sectarian community by stoking sectarian divisions and rivalries in both iraq and lebanon the accumulation of social grievances resulting from a very wild form of capitalism that crushes ordinary people and deteriorates their standard of living has created a huge resentment the social explosion was triggered by a political measure in iraq the dismissal of a popular military figure and an economic one in lebanon a projected tax on voip communications these measures provoked a formidable outburst of popular anger in lebanon to everybody s surprise the outburst covered the whole country and involved people belonging to all sects in iraq it has been mostly confined to the arab shiite majority but this is equally significant since the ruling clique itself is shiite the movement in both countries has thus strongly repudiated sectarianism in favour of a renewed sense of popular national belonging in lebanon sectarianism was so entrenched historically that it appeared as a very difficult barrier to break it was therefore very amazing to see people belonging to all religious communities participate in an uprising whose key slogan has become the arabic equivalent of the spanish language que se vayan todos all of them must go which was the key slogan of the december 2001 popular revolt in argentina the lebanese version says all of them means all of them a way of insisting on the repudiation of all ruling class members with no exceptions us vs them shifted from sect vs sect to a revolt of the people from below against all members of the ruling caste at the top whichever religious political sect they belong to whether shiite sunni christian or druze hezbollah was not spared and that is even more striking since a sort of taboo regarding the party and particularly its leader had been enforced until then it was astounding to see that people went into the streets in the regions under hezbollah s control despite the party s clear stance against the popular movement since then there have been successive attempts to intimidate the popular movement by thugs belonging to hezbollah and its close ally amal the two shiite sectarian groups in iraq parties and militias linked to the iranian regime engaged in repressing the popular revolt at a much higher scale with much killing that is because tehran s tutelage over iraq s government is a major target of the popular revolt the recent explosion of anger within iran itself was likewise met with brutal repression iran s theocratic regime thus confirms that it is one of the main reactionary forces in the region on a par with its regional rival the saudi kingdom this was already clear from its brutal repression of the democratic popular movement within iran in 2009 as well as from its massive contribution to the syrian regime s counter revolutionary drive starting in 2013 and from its heavy handed repression of the social protests that flared up again in iran at the end of 2017 and early 2018 the role of women in the second wave of the revolutionary process in the arab region is another very important feature and a further indication of the higher degree of maturity achieved by the popular movements in sudan algeria and lebanon women have participated massively and very visibly in the demonstrations and mass rallies as well as in heading them in the three countries feminists have been a crucial component of the groups involved in the uprisings even in iraq where women were hardly visible in the initial stage of the protests they are getting increasingly involved especially since the students joined the mobilisation the big question now is will the popular movements in algeria iraq and lebanon succeed in finding ways to organise like their sudanese brothers and sisters did in order to amplify their struggles impact and achieve major steps towards the fulfilment of their goals or will the ruling classes manage to quell each of these three uprisings and defuse it without being optimistic due the very vicious nature of the regimes that govern this part of the world i have a lot of hope my hope however is based on the knowledge that a huge progressive potential exists while i am perfectly aware that in order to be realised a lot of struggle organisation and political acumen are needed this interview

analysts at the university of pennsylvania found that the wealth tax proposed by sen elizabeth warren d mass would raise at least 1 trillion less than what her campaign claims calling into question a key source of funding for her generous spending plans such as government run health care in addition to the shortfall which warren s campaign argues could be narrowed through tougher enforcement the penn wharton budget model pwbm also projected a gdp contraction of between 1 and 2 percent depending on how the money is spent richard prisinzano pwbm s director of policy analysis explained that the model first established the taxable wealth base and then applied the tax code to account for various tax avoidance measures the team then estimated that warren s proposed ultra millionaire tax if implemented in 2021 would raise between 2 3 trillion including macroeconomic effects and 2 7 trillion not including macroeconomic effects in additional revenue in the 10 year window 2021 2030 by contrast warren s campaign estimated that the small tax on roughly 75 000 households will bring in 3 75 trillion in revenue over a 10 year period while the wharton model shows a significant shortfall compared to warren s projections the tax revenues would still be substantial this is not nickels and dimes even in our estimate kent smetters who runs the model at the university of pennsylvania told the wall street journal it s nothing to sneeze at as regards tighter enforcement warren s campaign calls for measures that include a significant increase in the irs enforcement budget a minimum audit rate for taxpayers subject to her wealth tax and a 40 percent exit tax on the net worth above 50 million of any u s citizen who renounces their citizenship to discourage people from offshoring their assets the wharton report also found that warren s wealth tax would have a negative knock on effect on the average hourly wages which are projected to fall between 0 8 percent to 2 3 percent the drop would be due to the reduction in private capital formation democratic presidential hopeful sen elizabeth warren d mass speaks during a town hall in charleston s c on dec 8 2019 meg kinnard ap photo ultra millionaire tax warren s is the most aggressive tax the rich scheme in the field of democrats vying for their party s nomination for the opportunity to oust president donald trump in the 2020 presidential election initially her proposed ultra millionaire tax targeted net worth of between 50 million and 1 billion with a 2 percent tax while wealth above 1 billion would be taxed at 3 percent that model has since been adjusted upwards with a 4 percent annual billionaire surtax 6 percent tax overall on household net worth above 1 billion elizabeth originally proposed a wealth tax of 2 percent on wealth between 50 million and 1 billion and a 3 percent tax on wealth above 1 billion on nov 1 2019 elizabeth proposed an additional 3 percent surtax on wealth over 1 billion bringing the total annual rate to 6 percent on every dollar over 1 billion which generates an additional 1 trillion in revenue her campaign said a simulation on her campaign website shows that a hypothetical heir with a net worth of 20 billion would pay a 2 percent tax on the 950 million between 50 million and 1 billion and a 6 percent tax on the remaining 19 billion for a total annual liability of 1 16 billion in another example a hedge fund manager with a net worth of 500 million would pay a 2 percent tax on the 450 million in net worth above the 50 million threshold producing a total annual liability of 9 million legal scholars are debating whether a u s federal tax on net worth would violate the constitution while it would be novel in the united states a wealth tax has been tried in other countries according to the wharton report in 1990 12 of the 36 member countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd imposed wealth taxes by 2019 this number shrank to norway belgium spain and switzerland an oecd review concluded that administrative difficulties modest revenues and failure to adequately address wealth inequality are among the main reasons why most member countries have abandoned wealth taxes the report said ragged edge of the middle class the 70 year old u s senator from massachusetts is a leader of the party s progressive wing and has focused her presidential campaign on a populist anti corruption message promising to fight what she calls a rigged system that favors the wealthy warren s pitch is for big structural changes to the economy to help americans pushed to the ragged edge of the middle class and who can barely breathe after decades of largely flat wages and exploding household costs experts contend that her perspective overlooks the facts about how well the economy is performing lee ohanian economics professor at ucla and senior fellow at the hoover institute says warren s type of rhetoric such as dismissing the strength of the economy by arguing that higher equity values only benefit the wealthy is misleading more than half of americans indirectly hold stocks through various retirement plans moreover higher stock values promote business expansion and economic growth real gdp growth averaged 2 1 percent under obama but is averaging around 2 9 percent under trump ohanian wrote in an op ed with the lowest unemployment rate in about 50 years and the strongest real gdp and productivity growth in about 20 years there is no doubt that this is one of the best economies we have had in a long time he added warren a former harvard bankruptcy law professor has also vowed to reverse parts of the trump tax cut though she has not specified how much of it she would repeal according to forbes contributor and licensed cpa tony nitti warren has proposed repealing enough of the tax cuts and jobs act to raise another 1 trillion of revenue in his deep dive into warren s tax plan nitti says it s not clear where that revenue would come from but notes that it s likely that she intends to cut corporate deductions or repeal the new 20 percent deduction against pass through income earned by sole proprietors s corporation shareholders and partners in partnerships warren has also proposed a real corporate profits tax scheme which would apply to companies that report more than 100 million in profits last year this was around 1 200 companies that first 100 million is left alone but for every dollar of profit above 100 million the corporation will pay a 7 percent tax warren said that means amazon would pay 698 million in taxes instead of paying zero and occidental petroleum would pay 280 million in taxes instead of paying zero wall street investors slam warren s policies some wall street investors and democratic donors have she said economists saez and zucman estimate her real corporate profits tax scheme will bring in 1 trillion in revenue over the next 10 years some wall street investors and democratic donors have sharply criticized warren s policies on issues from taxation to affordable healthcare because they are impractical speaking at the reuters global investment outlook 2020 summit several investors said however they were not too worried by a potential warren presidency because many of her plans would struggle to pass what is likely to be a divided congress her policies scare the heck out of every wealthy guy i know said mike novogratz ceo of galaxy digital which invests in cryptocurrency and blockchain but he added they don t scare me as much because i don t think they re practical while cool on warren s specific policy proposals several donors and investors credited her political savvy and financial knowledge and agreed that policymakers needed to confront rising income inequality or face long term adverse social and economic repercussions but many questioned whether warren s proposals would successfully address these issues saying they feared her plan to fund trillions of dollars in social projects through a range of taxes could have unintended adverse consequences such as reducing economic growth or dampening the stock market senator

by noah smith the us dollar s position as the world s reserve currency might be weakening in the last few years the fraction of global reserves denominated in dollars has been inching down this follows a longer term slide at the turn of the century more than 70 of reserves were in dollars meanwhile central banks are buying more gold which could signal a lack of confidence in the dollar or the global monetary system more generally if the dollar loses its status as the reserve currency it would be a major shift in the global economy the likes of which only happens once or twice a century what happens then is anybody s guess the result could be chaos if it s mismanaged but if it s handled well the loss of the reserve currency could be healthy for the us and the world indeed given the us s waning economic dominance the consequences of keeping the dollar as the sole reserve currency could be worse because the dollar is the reserve currency central banks around the world hold large amounts of dollar denominated assets mostly us government bonds they hold these reserves for a number of reasons to maintain exchange rate pegs to insure against capital outflows and to facilitate international trade in the 19th century countries held their reserves in gold or in british pounds which were backed by gold but after world war i the us accumulated a large share of the world s gold meaning that holding dollars became the next best thing to holding the yellow metal itself this arrangement was formalized in the bretton woods agreement of 1944 when the dollar became the world s official reserve currency and the us promised to hold large amounts of gold in the early 1970s all connection between the dollar and gold was severed but the us dollar remained the reserve currency of choice so why is dollar dominance slipping now one long term reason is the rise of the euro as an alternative reserve currency a more recent factor is china s increasing desire to diversify its foreign exchange holdings to reduce its vulnerability to shifts in us policy amid the trade war but in the long term the shrinking us share of world economic output is the biggest threat to the dollar s status in 1960 the us represented about 40 of the world economy but that has shrunk to less than a quarter as poorer nations catch up to rich ones they face pressure to diversify and hold less of their growing reserve stockpiles in the currency of one decreasingly important country it s no coincidence that the 1980s when the dollar dipped below half of global reserves were a time when it looked as if the us might be economically eclipsed by a rising europe and japan that didn t happen but this time it might economists have a hard time predicting the effects of a shift away from the dollar because this is to some extent uncharted territory one theory says that american borrowers would be forced to pay higher interest rates causing the us economy to suffer now in order to acquire dollar reserves foreigners essentially are forced to lend money to either the us government or to us companies that demand for us assets can bid down the price of loans within the us but former federal reserve chair ben bernanke argues that the us no longer enjoys this so called exorbitant privilege noting that other countries real interest rates are almost as low bernanke could be wrong those other countries rates might be held down by their slow population growth while the faster growing us benefits from reserve status instead but in a world already awash in capital the extra effect of reserve status is probably not that much another theory says that the us would benefit less demand for the dollar would cause the currency to depreciate that would cut the price of us exports and make imports more costly reducing the trade deficit that could ultimately lead to a more balanced global economy it could even potentially help the us become more competitive in manufacturing and other high value export industries but as paul krugman has noted reserve currency status might not be that big a factor because a number of other countries have run big trade deficits in recent decades as well in the end a shift to a basket of world currencies might be the healthiest outcome if the euro yen and yuan were to join the dollar as international reserve currencies it would mean a safer and more stable global economy and it would enable the world s major economies to compete on a more or less level playing field the problem is the other major economies may be either unwilling or unable to help bring about that outcome the euro zone crisis cast doubt on that currency s long term dominance while china shows no inclination to abandon capital controls and make the yuan fully convertible reserve holding countries may thus be stuck with the dollar and the us and its central bank may be stuck with the unenviable task of stabilizing a global economy that increasingly dwarfs it in size bloomberg opinion
detroit s success was a very complicated story its failure is a simpler one how did detroit become the motor city at the center of the u s automotive business it wasn t obvious that it would be at the end of the 19th century more than 100 automobile companies were organized in the united states most of them in new england and ohio but michigan won out because it had a hugely important advantage in one natural resource smart people ask a half dozen car guys why detroit beat out the rest and you ll get a half dozen answers maybe because henry ford and ransom olds lived in michigan or maybe because standard oil helped to lift the gasoline powered michigan manufacturers over competitors in cleveland and boston which leaned toward steam and electric power electric cars imagine that but one of the main reasons detroit became the motor city is that it already was a motor city before it was a powerhouse in the automobile business it was an important center for manufacturing marine engines as was cleveland and as such was home to a work force with skills relevant to building automobiles metalworkers mechanics engineers machinists experienced laborers the most useful kind of intelligence resides in particular people and in particular intellectual communities whether those are theoretical physicists or construction workers that kind of intelligence cannot be boxed up and redistributed like surplus cheese it is where it is and it is there because of organic developments that cannot be managed advertisement advertisement henry ford offered good wages and an intelligently organized production process but he didn t exnihilate those skilled workers into existence he just hired them the larger and more complex the intellectual ecosystem of detroit became the greater the advantage provided by its workforce was and the more it became a magnet for the best workers and henry ford wouldn t have got very far without them i will here offer the obligatory periodic reminder that the story about henry ford s bootstrapping the automobile market into existence by paying his workers enough to afford his products is a myth pure folk economics henry ford s problems are our problems still north carolina is the detroit of the american upholstered furniture industry and its biggest problem right now is finding skilled workers to man the industry s factories a program set up by furniture manufacturers and a local community college is training up new workers as fast as it can but that is not fast enough the good news is we can graduate 150 people a year one furniture executive told the wall street journal the bad news is that the industry needs 800 to 1 000 people another recruiter described hiring an upholsterer through a temp agency as winning the lottery advertisement advertisement and yet millions of americans somehow manage to languish in persistent joblessness the story is familiar with businesses ranging from the literally old timey mechanical watch manufacturers to the high tech chemical companies complaining loud and long that they cannot fill their openings that highly skilled reliable labor is impossible to find old fashioned business strategies such as radical idea substantially raising wages are not always effective keep trying guys it worked for henry ford eventually industry groups have put together training and apprenticeship programs such as the one for furniture makers in north carolina where a 600 eleven month course prepares workers for jobs that can pay in excess of 75 000 a year the institute of swiss watchmaking operates training programs in fort worth texas along with hong kong and shanghai for those on shorter timelines there are still a bunch of oil and gas companies that will pay you to get a commercial driver s license and then hire you when you do if the demand side story is familiar then so are the excuses from the potential supply side if you ve followed the intramural debate on the right between the classical free market conservatives and the new right wing anti capitalists then you ve heard this before i want a good job but i don t want to move to one of those awful expensive godless coastal metros to get it okay but there are lots of jobs to be had in lots of other places that aren t palo alto but i don t want to invest four years in college and go into debt to do it okay there are jobs to be had in west texas gas fields and north carolina furniture factories and all sorts of other places that don t require a four year degree but there s always another but advertisement advertisement furniture factory recruiters tell the wall street journal that potential workers sometimes turn their noses up at their training programs because there is no guarantee that demand for workers will be as strong years in the future as it is today factories trying to recruit millennials also have discovered that starting the workday at 6 30 a m is an obstacle the usual thumbsuckers offer the usual thumbsucking excuses a cynical man might wonder what exactly would get these folks to take the job an iron rice bowl there s a reason so many of the complaints we hear about china are characterized not by horror at the brutality of the chinese regime but by frank envy of its command and control powers tom friedman calls it being china for a day marco rubio calls it industrial policy sen elizabeth warren speaks at the presidential gun sense forum in des moines iowa august 10 2019 if you are willing to consider the full mind bending complexity of the u s economy then elizabeth warren s you didn t build that argument becomes in a sense leonard read s argument in i pencil everything touches everything else and burdens are shared in complicated ways senator warren s story is an attempt to create a compelling moral narrative for managerial progressivism the dusty intellectual antique installed firmly in the center of her brain but while her political conclusions do not necessarily follow from the facts she isn t wrong about the facts themselves entrepreneurship does not happen in a vacuum and nobody seriously thinks it does advertisement advertisement senator warren leans heavily on an old politician s trick arguing with positions that nobody really supports in this she is a lot like our friends on the new anti capitalist right who believe they have a patent on the idea that there is life beyond the market consider the early days of the automotive industry when alexander winton drove from cleveland to new york city to promote his new automobile the trip took nine days and was thought to be such a feat that he was greeted by a million people upon arriving in manhattan the roads were as winton put it outrageous a few years later an enthusiast in another winton automobile made the first coast to coast automobile road trip in the united states from san francisco to new york as ken burns tells the story at the time there were only 150 miles of paved roads in the entire u s all of them within city limits there were no gas stations although general stores in some towns sold gasoline for farm equipment and no road maps as we know them today most americans doubted that the automobile had much of a future except as a rich man s toy for driving around town libertarians have two good jokes the first of which is the lamentation but who will build the roads uttered after anybody suggests the slightest reduction or reform in any government program the other one is the libertarian party the actual story of the roads is as most things are more complicated than our political discourse allows for the constitution invests the federal government with the power to build postal roads and using core federal obligations as a pretext for road building and other infrastructure projects is a time honored american tradition alma ark and tucumcari n m are linked by a gigantic federal freeway thanks to the dwight d eisenhower national system of interstate and defense highways advertisement advertisement but the first paved intercity road in the united states was a privately built and privately operated turnpike connecting philadelphia with lancaster old school gladwyne types still refer to u s 30 as the pike the vast network of municipal and intercity roads in the united states was in fact built by a very complex combination of public and private efforts think about the road building efforts themselves but also all the things that went into making them possible you might have a federal highway project carried out by a private contractor who buys asphalt from another privately owned firm that relies on engineers and chemists trained at public schools which were funded by taxes on private businesses which relied on you get the picture many of the most effective public works projects have followed the practice of relying heavily on public funding and administration and private sector execution of the work itself that doesn t always work and it has obvious drawbacks the inevitable corruption and waste in the contracting process one of the seldom considered scandals of the war mobilization in the 1940s but it also offers an alternative to the characteristic problems of monopolistic public sector bureaucracies such as government schools the complexity of real world economic relationships is the point of i pencil read s famous essay which illustrates that even something as straightforward ubiquitous and cheap as a no 2 pencil relies on a vast network of industrial processes specialized knowledge trade etc so vast as to be well beyond the comprehension of any single organization much less any individual that s the miracle nobody knows how to make a pencil but we have plenty of them anyway read took this as an argument against central planning and he might be reasonably criticized for minimizing the role of the public sector senator warren takes the same entangling relationships as an argument for more central planning even though she occasionally remembers to make a rhetorical gesture in the direction of capitalism read was basically right and warren is basically wrong but warren s distortion of the underlying principle does not diminish the importance of public sector and non market institutions in the ecosystem of readian economic complexity the complicated truth is that henry ford and every other entrepreneur drafted behind both public sector and private sector investments that preceded him and his own innovations the marine engine business helped lay the foundations for the subsequent success of detroit s automotive industry but so did roads and schools and the like there s a word for that civilization isaac newton was not the only one who stood on the shoulders of giants all of us do and not just giants nobody invented the automobile or the internal combustion engine there were thousands and thousands of contributors to that subtle and spectacular evolution advertisement advertisement if it seems like we have drifted a long way from the original point about the role of the work force in the entrepreneurial process we haven t sen marco rubio the current argument about the future of capitalism is about a lot of different things some of which are only tangentially related to one another some of these considerations are matters of narrow political self interest senator rubio et al have discovered that there is some juice in trumpian neo mercantilism and believe with good reason that there is even a little cross partisan appeal to it they have failed to articulate a set of policies or meaningful principles to go along with that hunch but if president trump has shown republicans anything it is that policies and principles are optional for a working majority of right leaning voters who can be had at the price of some vague grumbling about the national interest and intellectually dishonest claptrap about how market fundamentalists on the right want more record setting days in the stock market above all else as senator rubio put it advertisement advertisement i will reiterate here two things the first is that senator rubio is engaged in a political fight to the death with a straw man and that so far the fullest expression of his conception of the national interest in economic policy is subsidies for politically connected sugar producers in florida in politics vague principles rarely stand up to specific demands from specific constituents on the wider cultural front the fight about the future of capitalism is in no small part a matter of status competition less a question of economic development than of how we talk about economic issues practitioners of resentment politics wish to reduce the prestige of cultural rivals and so we have the strange spectacle of our so called nationalists abominating the actual centers of american power prestige and influence silicon valley wall street the ivy league hollywood etc both warren style progressives and right wing critics such as my friend michael brendan dougherty seek to undermine the heroic account of entrepreneurship and corporate success traditionally put forward by apologists for capitalism for these critics the professional and financial elites represent a morally corrupt class that needs to be taken down a peg those of you who have followed this conversation for a while will remember that dougherty s famous thought experiment about garbutt n y had conservatives advancing the interests of a typical coke sniffer in westport and his in laws down the road in darien their argument is at heart about social status holding that the finance workers in fairfield county and the multinational firms that employ them deserve less admiration as do the start up founders and venture capitalists on the opposite coast which is why it is important that they be cocaine enthusiasts or sexual deviants or whatever for purposes of political narrative if not in real life where the coastal elites practice the bourgeois values stable marriages and thrift and relative sobriety and all that to a remarkable extent at the same time the same critics argue that we should have more sympathy for those who are stuck in economically stagnant and socially backward communities and who do not wish to leave them dougherty presents this explicitly as a sympathy deficit on the part of the capitalism camp any investments he made in himself previously are for naught people rooted in their home towns that sentimentalism is for effete readers of edmund burke join the hyper mobile world advertisement advertisement though the protectionism put forward by the likes of trump and rubio is couched in the language of national interest it is the opposite of that americans as a whole would be better off with lower food prices but a small handful of americans is much better off with higher prices secured by the policies supported by rubio and other like minded politicians americans as a whole are much better off when markets are allowed to allocate resources efficiently but there is a vast and politically significant archipelago of communities that would prefer that certain inefficiencies be preserved because their livings are tied to those inefficiencies and their communities have been built atop them detroit in 1960 was on top of the world it was the highest income city in the united states detroit would have been very comfortable if it could have been frozen in time economically in that moment and a very wide array of politicians and activists from local union leaders to president ronald reagan took extraordinary steps to try to preserve the position of the u s automotive industry with the disastrous consequences that you can see in front of you in detroit today the things that gave detroit its critical advantages in the early 20th century were not things that could be planned out in advance by super intelligent philosopher kings in the bureaucracies creating a marine engine industry that would help to prepare the workforce for an automotive industry that would not exist until decades in the future is not the kind of plan that mere mortals can conceptualize or execute if you had tried to explain to the best and most forward looking thinkers of detroit s golden years that china and india would soon enough be significant high tech competitors they would have laughed at you also if you d told them that one of the biggest and most valuable u s companies in 2019 would be an electronic bulletin board where you can go to denounce your aunt as a hate monger they would have been perplexed as indeed some of us are remember that many of the best minds of the time believed that the automobile would be a passing fad conservatives like to laugh at paul krugman revisiting his long ago prediction that the internet would prove no more economically significant than the fax machine but nobody is really very good at predicting the future of economic developments at any meaningful level of detail go spend some time around private equity investors and see how they come by their billions they are smart but they are not superhuman and they do not have any special insight into long term economic trends they do a tremendous amount of grunt work discovering and creating value in ordinary companies and complex deals inch worming their way through that s how a lot of wealth gets built that s the real world and senator rubio scoffs at it as fiddling with financial flows detached from real production as though factories just built themselves a woman walks next to the abandoned packard motor car company building that ceased production in the 1950 s in detroit mich in 2008 you couldn t have planned detroit s success but you could have avoided its catastrophic failure detroit was not done in by lack of clever industrial policy or by shortage of some other species of cleverness it was done in by corrupt and ineffective government and a local political culture that went from bad to worse to much worse to coleman young they tried to save detroit with tariffs and failed they could have saved it with safe streets and functional schools and the hundred thousand other tiny needful things that good governments do well advertisement advertisement good government including a steady stable predictable policy environment multiplies the value of labor just as training and capital do that is why investment capital around the world for years has flowed largely to well governed countries most of them liberal democracies with the largest recipients of foreign direct investment being the united states and the european union china the important exception to that rule is not well governed it is governed brutally but predictably an ugly but useful reminder that stability has economic value too there are many places that businesses could go in search of low wages and a loose regulatory environment but you aren t driving a car made in haiti or using a computer built in burundi investors aren t putting a lot of money into factories in yemen or afghanistan and that is what is so irritating about senator rubio s new push for industrial policy is the u s government really performing its core duties so well so ably so competently that we need to add to them with additional duties that demand a kind of competence it does not have and cannot acquire the truth is something closer to the opposite the u s government is in many cases a force for instability and non confidence in our national economic life peter navarro s position as trump s china hand is as ridiculously implausible as hunter biden s role on the board of burisma but there he is whispering into the president s ear senator rubio is no less implausible in his belief that he has eagle eyes to detect subtle national interests in complex economic affairs of which he has no substantial first hand knowledge his problem isn t stupidity it s hubris a nation as rich as ours can afford a great deal of stupidity but hubris is expensive senator rubio represents a government that has shown little competence in the small and ordinary things it cannot even manage to follow its own ordinary processes for creating budgets or appropriating funds instead lurching from season to season with a series of emergency measures in a state of never ending crisis you might think that that would be the cause of some modesty and circumspection in washington you would be wrong rather than monkeying around with things that are beyond his ken and outside of the credible operating capacity of the u s government senator rubio should be seeing to some of the things that might actually make a difference the u s government is on a catastrophic fiscal course that will without reform eventually result in a ruinous debt crisis the likes of which the world has never seen we ve seen fiscal crises in canada and argentina but the u s economy represents nearly a quarter of the world s economic output we have entitlement programs that are in need of reform decaying and archaic infrastructure under federal purview serious k 12 educational problems entangled with federal policy a tax code in great need of simplification a series of worldwide military engagements that have failed or are on the verge of failing enormous deficits an out of control presidency and administrative state etc all of it under the responsibility of a federal apparatus that cannot even produce an accurate count of how many programs it administers senator rubio and his colleagues are like fast food workers who haven t yet mastered the drive thru but demand a seat on the board of the company they are not doing a very good job with the responsibilities they already have and many of those are responsibilities that cannot be taken on by anybody else if the united states is to have an immigration system characterized by intelligence and decency or a federal criminal justice system characterized by justice then the federal government is the instrument that is going to bring that about these tasks cannot be delegated to the chamber of commerce or the rotary club but rather than see to these and other authentic federal responsibilities senator rubio would spend his days micromanaging the world s mining markets lest the sneaky chi comms hoard all the ytterbium seriously what was true for detroit is true for the united states as a whole the first step toward success in government is avoiding failure and what emerges from the complicated story of detroit s success and the relatively simple story of its failure is not that government must master economic complexity and put it in harness but rather that government must do a lot of relatively simple things well detroit did not need a thomas jefferson or a mohandas gandhi or another great political philosopher with a world changing idea it needed someone to fix the potholes balance the books keep order on the streets see to the schools and keep the city agencies orderly and honest and effective without that all of detroit s productive capital physical financial and human was devalued and ultimately dispersed detroit s fall happened hard and fast as the poet said goin down slow ain t the only way to go deride financial flows detached from real production all you like but if you want workers to have jobs then you need enterprises to employ them if you want enterprises to employ them then you need investment and if you want investment then you need good government and a stable predictable policy environment not senator rubio freelancing around the economy like a kid trying to play chess without even knowing how the horsey thingies move the u s economy is a vastly complex system with countless variables here s a puzzle with only three variables 1 there are about 5 7 million unemployed people in the united states right now 2 we have thousands and thousands of jobs going unfilled because employers cannot find workers to fill them 3 we spend about 10 billion a week on unemployment benefits sort that out and the ytterbium will take care of itself more from national review

editor s note will china set a growth target above 6 percent next year how will china achieve such a goal two economists share their opinions on china s economy in 2020 full text below growth target to remain an anchor in 2020 the year 2020 marks the closing year of a decade long endeavor for china as the country s leadership has pledged to build a moderately prosperous society by 2020 a year before the 100th anniversary of the communist party of china to achieve that goal china needs to double real gdp from the 2010 level by next year and therefore requires a minimum growth of 6 1 6 2 percent in both 2019 and 2020 despite external and domestic challenges china s 10 year goal appears within reach the meeting of the political bureau of the cpc central committee on dec 6 reaffirmed the commitment and called on the government to keep economic growth within a reasonable range by properly using counter cyclical tools we think the government will set the 2020 growth target around 6 percent providing policy support for a slightly higher growth rate while gdp growth rates up to 2018 are likely to be revised based on the latest economic census we at standard chartered bank believe the upward revisions will be marginal and insufficient to meaningfully lower the 2020 growth target govt realizes structural downward pressure compared with the growth target of 6 0 6 5 percent set for 2019 a lower target would suggest the government recognizes the structural downtrend of the economy and does not want to over stimulate the economy especially because of an already high leverage ratio and the need to reserve policy space in its long term competition with the united states still to stabilize employment and build some cushion for achieving the decade long goal we expect the government to err on the higher side of 6 percent the us triggered trade war and the property sector are sources of downward pressure on china s economy if a phase one deal at the sino us trade talks pre empts new us tariffs and includes some rollback of existing tariffs we estimate the existing tariffs will trim china s 2020 growth by 0 3 percentage points in a worse case scenario where all announced us tariffs are fully implemented china s growth could reduce by up to 0 6 percentage points next year yet despite restrictive housing policies curtailing property developers appetite to acquire land and launch new projects that bodes ill for property investment next year we see some positive factors including policy support and cyclical tailwinds which would help contain the risk of a sharp downturn therefore we forecast 6 1 percent growth for 2020 above market consensus policy support to fuel growth proactive fiscal policy has been doing the heavy lifting this year while the official budget only shows a deficit of 2 8 percent of gdp this year the broadly defined budget deficit which covers both the general public budget and the government funds budget has been increased to 6 5 percent of gdp this year from 4 7 percent last year data so far suggest the budget will be fully implemented delivering fiscal stimulus of 1 8 percent of gdp fiscal stimulus in fact has played an important role in offsetting the fallout from china s deleveraging measures last year and higher us tariffs this year we also expect the government to keep the broadly defined budget deficit around 6 5 percent of gdp in 2020 the official budget however may only show a deficit of 3 percent of gdp observing the implicit ceiling of 3 percent the mix of fiscal support however may shift from tax cuts to spending as it tends to have a higher fiscal multiplier and as the meeting of the political bureau of the cpc central committee emphasized the need to strengthen infrastructure construction both central and local government bond issuance quotas will likely be raised to finance the deficit the authorities have shown a preference for maintaining a conventional monetary policy for as long as possible recent statements by senior people s bank of china s officials suggest deep skepticism over the utility and sustainability of quantitative easing and negative interest rates tools that have been commonly used in major advanced economies as such china is unlikely to engage in aggressive monetary easing due to concerns over the already elevated debt level and the diminishing effects of policy loosening on activity in the real economy accommodative monetary policy expected next year we expect monetary policy to be accommodative in 2020 both the reserve requirement ratio rrr and medium term lending facility mlf rate are likely to be cut and the central bank might keep monetary and total social financing growth slightly above nominal gdp growth next year to achieve that it will have to cut the rrr to raise the money multiplier as its balance sheet has not been expanded for a while we forecast three rrr cuts of 50 basis points each or an equivalent liquidity injection through a targeted rrr cut or central bank lending in the first three quarters of 2020 to accommodate government bond issuance and to prevent a crowding out of the private sector in addition to facilitate a decline in the average lending rate the central bank may cut the mlf rate by 10 basis points each in the first and second quarters with pass through to the seven day reverse repo rate and loan prime rate next year will be a year of soft but stabilizing growth for the global economy in our view and we forecast global growth at 3 3 percent for 2020 slightly higher than our 3 1 percent estimate for 2019 industrial inventory likely to bottom out in china infrastructure investment may pick up further supported by fiscal spending faster project approvals and the lowering of the project capital requirement the industrial inventory cycle appears close to bottoming out curbing downside risks to manufacturing investment historical data suggest there is an inventory cycle that lasts three to four years and it has been three and a half years since the last bottom of the cycle besides car sales may become less of a drag on retail sales next year due to recent policies to encourage car purchases automobile sales dropped 9 7 percent year on year in the first 10 months of 2019 because of the expiration of the tax benefit slower home sales and restrictive purchase policies in large cities but since the base effect has waned in recent months sales growth has become less negative and could further pick up next year ding shuang chief economist for greater china and north asia

over to sean o connor the company s ceo sean o connor chief executive officer president director thanks bill good morning everyone and thanks for joining our fiscal 2019 year end earnings call market conditions were modestly favorable in certain areas such as grains due to weather events in the us and fixed income particularly for our mortgage business but was subdued in other areas in addition we saw a more accommodative stance from the fed with three interest rate cuts two of which happened during the quarter under review and one shortly after interest rates obviously affect the return we get on our customer float but it s important to note that growth in the underlying customer assets tempers the impact of the lower interest rates bill will highlight this later in his section we had a record q4 by almost every measure from operating earnings through to eps although net earnings were boosted by bad debt insurance recovery on the 2017 coal matter our operating revenues were up 18 versus a year ago and up slightly sequentially versus the immediately prior q3 net income was up 73 versus a year ago and diluted eps was 1 40 also up 73 resulting in a quarterly roe of 18 7 during the fiscal 2019 we had several one off items and when netted out had a positive impact of 7 6 million on our pre tax quarterly earnings segment net income was up a strong 43 from a year ago and up 27 if the insurance recovery is excluded all of our segments showed strong growth with the exception of global payments which was down slightly due to a reduced number of larger corporate cross border payments related to m a activity due to global uncertainty as well as the impact of the acquisition of paycommerce our swift service hosting business our largest segment commercial hedging showed strong growth of 20 in segment income due to a strong increase in both futures and otc revenues as a result of the weather events i mentioned security segment income was up 70 from a year ago off the back of a record results for our fixed income business a record result for our precious metals drove the physical commodities to 140 increase in segment income again excluding insurance recovery item in our clearing and execution segment we saw strong results from our fx prime brokerage business offset by modest declines in our futures activities as a result of de risking this business earlier in the year on an annual basis we had strong performance on almost every financial metric and nearly every one of our underlying business has achieved record results as well during the year we had several discreet items which affected our operating results these items include a bargain purchase gain on the gmp acquisition operating losses and restructuring charges related to acquisitions we have made as well as new initiatives we have started as well as the recovery on the physical coal matter the net effect on pre tax income of the acquisitions made including either restructuring charges or losses assumed net of the bargain purchase as well as the cost of new initiatives was a negative 4 8 million in fiscal 2019 over the fiscal year these items when offset against the 12 4 million recovery on physical coal net off to a positive impact overall of 7 6 million for the year on our pre tax earnings we think shareholders should look at the business the way management does and consider this net impact when evaluating the true underlying performance of our business related to this it s probably worth mentioning that we are always looking to invest in our business to either expand our financial platform by adding new products or capabilities or through the addition of new customers our default position is to do this organically but will of course always look at tuck in acquisitions that can achieve the desired result quicker and cheaper or with less risk in all instances we consider the payback period of the investments and the associated risk of achieving that outcome paying a large multiple of book or earnings really doesn t seem to make good commercial sense to us and most often we end up acquiring the small bolt on acquisitions at attractive values but assume some initial losses and restructuring charges as a result this has been our approach for many years and we believe that this is materially added to shareholder value as a result in all instances we have seen these initiatives to make good strides toward eliminating the cash burn we acquired and believe that they will be accretive in due course for the fiscal year we achieved a record operating revenues of 1 1 billion first time we breached the 1 billion up 13 from a year ago total non variable expenses increased 9 and if the total recoveries on the coal matter excluded are up 14 or 42 million of this increase 19 million or just less than 50 was related to the non variable cost picked up through these acquisitions and a large portion of the balance was due to increased it related costs being both cyber security and infrastructure upgrades as well as the cost of digitizing our platform our net earnings were 85 1 million or 4 39 in eps which represents a significant increase over the prior year although last year did include the impact of the tax reform act the roe was 15 5 for the 2019 year just above our long term target most financial services company use return on tangible equity as a primary measure of financial performance and on this basis we were 17 5 which we believe is a best in class result in reviewing our record performance of 2019 i would like to take some time to recap and highlight some of the items of a more strategic nature which we have mentioned in our earlier calls throughout the year overall 2019 was a busy year for us and one in which we significantly expanded and enhanced our financial platform by adding both capabilities and products as well as acquiring new client segments adding capabilities and clients are both significant objectives in growing in continuing to grow our franchise and become more relevant in the markets in the first quarter we closed the acquisition of carl kliem s a and independent inter dealer broker based in luxembourg which provides foreign exchange interest rates and fixed income products to more than 400 active institutional accounts across europe this acquisition expanded our client base in europe and provided us with an effective way to deal with brexit contingencies to house all of our european based employees and clients within a fully eu regulated business we are now well placed to pick up clients and opportunities from others who were not able to position themselves to serve eu based clients in the same way post brexit early in the second quarter we closed the acquisition of gmp securities formerly known as miller tabak roberts which brought 50 professionals and more than 2000 institutional client relationships to our platform as well as deep product knowledge and high yield convertibles and emerging market debt this acquisition added more breadth and depth to our existing fixed income product suite and enhances both our offering and relevance to institutional clients as part of our long standing commitment to serve the precious metals markets we acquired coininvest in march a leading online provider of gold silver platinum and palladium products to private individuals institutional investors and financial advisors coininvest significantly expanded our offering by enabling our clients to purchase physical gold and other precious metals in multiple forms and in denominations of their choice to add to the investment portfolios by developing and investing in technologies to change how precious metal is operated we continue to build a unique global franchise that delivers client solutions through our every part of the precious metals lifecycle from mine site to the private investor also in march we announced the acquisition of the singapore based uob s futures and options brokerage and clearing business with the deal closing shortly after year end this required a significant upgrade of our asia pacific presence and we scale from basically a small sales office to a fully regulated fcm in singapore with an additional 50 staff and more than 300 institutional accounts this acquisition which just closed in october has given us critical mass in asia pacific region provide us with access to a solid and reputable client base and enhances our global product offering as a one stop solution for all our client market access needs for listed derivatives globally in april we launched the prime brokerage division to leverage the existing capabilities in securities clearing and custody that we currently offer to introducing broker dealers headed by proven and experienced team based in atlanta this group offers multi asset prime brokerage execution outsource trading custody and both self clearing and introducing introduced clearing services for hedge funds mutual funds and family offices to accelerate the build out of this offering in september we acquired fillmore advisors llc a leading provider of outsourced trading solutions and operational consulting to institutional asset management asset managers we also acquired an outsourced it development consulting firm in bangalore india so this consulting firm was almost exclusively serving our company so there was no material financial impact although we are now able to leverage technology expertise in india to serve all of our business lines at a lower cost and with faster delivery this is especially relevant given our strategic priority to digitize the financial platform we have built we also established a wholly owned subsidiary in canada and became a member of the investment industry regulatory organization of canada commonly known as iiroc allowing us to offer exchange traded products to client throughout canada this membership allows us to offer a broad array of risk management tools to commercial and institutional organizations in canada we amended our senior secured credit facility extending the maturity through february 2022 and increased the size of the facility to 350 million comprising 175 million in revolving credit facility and 175 million term loan facility post year end this facility was increased by a further 43 million we believe that it is now a strategic imperative to digitize our financial platform to facilitate easier and more effective engagement from our growing client base and to accelerate adoption as well as to provide an efficient and scalable infrastructure where we can drive marginal transaction cost to zero it is clear that in almost every business i know that digital platform scaled exponentially compared to linear platforms we believe that a digital platform can effectively deliver the high touch and superior service that has been our hallmark we have spent the better part of three years putting the foundational pieces in place to allow us to deliver on this promise and are now seeing a good cadence of delivery and use cases this has been difficult and time consuming and has increased our it costs meaningfully over the past three years transforming any business is not easy and will take time and costs real money but we believe we are at an inflection point where this will increasingly become a reality for us some examples of the components that we already have in place include we have developed a significant internal market intelligence assets and now deliver all of this to our clients through a digital platform that allows us to showcase all of our research in one place enable us to track usage and seek out patterns and potential client needs as a result additionally we have just launched a real time client trade reporting portal for our commercial clients which combines all transactions clients do with us across asset classes and regulatory entities delivering clients a comprehensive view of the activity with intl both on derivative exchanges and otc products we also have a real time client trading reporting and workflow portal for our securities clearing business which we developed in house which has automated most functions for our introducing brokers we have a market leading online precious metals trading platform for both financial and physical trading which is seeing both exponential adoption and volume growth making it one of the leading precious metals trading platforms available globally we also have an online platform for constructing complex structured otc products with the ability to stress test them at a theoretical market scenarios and requests real time price indications we have just launched an algorithmic based trading platform in foreign equities integrating multiple market prices as well as foreign exchange rates to allow for best execution for our institutional clients in various markets we are close to launching a client portal for our lme market to provide clients there with a leading set of tools and workflows to manage positions and exposure in this market internally we have implemented salesforce with all our salespeople which allows them to see a more integrated view of the client relationship with us we are now introducing a more disciplined sales process which should drive faster organic growth as well as better leveraging all of our capabilities and products through every client relationship and of course we have our industry leading global payments platform which offers automated access to over 175 countries we are very excited with our progress thus far but much work lies ahead before we have a comprehensive and meaningful solution for all of our various client segments so with that i d like to hand you over to bill for a discussion of the financial results bill william j dunaway chief financial officer thank you sean i ll be referring to slides and the information we have been made available as part of the webcast specifically starting with slide number 3 which shows our performance over the last five fiscal quarters the chart depicts our net income earnings per share and roe over the last five quarters as shown net income in the fourth quarter of 2019 was 27 2 million which represents a 10 9 million increase over the immediately preceding quarter and 11 5 million increase over the prior year earnings per share were 1 40 in the fourth quarter as compared to 0 84 and 0 81 per share in the immediately preceding and prior year quarters respectively moving on to slide number 4 which represents the bridge between operating revenues for the fourth quarter of last year to the current period operating revenues were 286 9 million in the current period up 43 7 million or 18 over the prior year this growth was led by our security segment which added 31 7 million or 66 in operating revenues versus the prior year within this segment equity capital markets added 12 4 million in operating revenues versus the prior year primarily as a result of a 7 8 million increase in conduit securities lending revenues as well as a 13 increase in the dollar volume traded debt capital markets also had a strong quarter adding 17 9 million in operating revenues versus the prior year primarily driven by increased activity in our domestic fixed income business improved performance in argentina and the acquisition of gmp securities operating revenues increased in our commercial hedging segment by 6 6 million versus the prior year to 75 6 million exchange traded volumes increased 9 driven by weather related volatility in the domestic grain markets while otc volumes increased 11 as a result of the growth in both north and south american markets as well as global energy interest income in this business increased 4 to 7 1 million driven by higher short term rates which was partially offset by a 4 decline in average client equity to 967 8 million physical commodities increased operating revenues 9 1 million or 57 versus the prior year driven by a 9 2 million increase in precious metals operating revenues which was partially offset by 100 000 decline in physical ag energy the increase in precious metals operating revenues is driven by a 2 million gain on the sale of inventory carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value at the end of the preceding quarter as well as an 18 increase in the number of ounces traded driven by geopolitical tensions surrounding tariffs and global trends in the interest rate environment our global payments segment added 1 6 million in operating revenues versus the prior year to 26 8 million as the number of payments made increased 17 as sean mentioned earlier this growth was tempered by a lower average revenue per payment driven by a lower number of m a and capital transition payments for our international banking clients due to heightened levels of uncertainty in the global markets finally operating revenues in our clearing and execution services segment declined 4 9 million or 6 as compared to the prior year within this segment exchange traded futures and options operating revenues declined 9 million as volumes decreased by 3 and the average rate per contract declined 21 somewhat offsetting this decline our fx prime brokerage business had a strong quarter adding 3 1 million in operating revenues the next slide number 5 represents a bridge from 2018 fourth quarter pre tax income of 20 5 million to pre tax income of 34 1 million in the current period the largest change from the prior year came from our physical commodity segment which added 16 7 million in segment income this was primarily driven by the insurance policy claim received as well as the organic growth in precious metals operating revenues our security segment added 4 7 million in segment income versus the prior year this growth in segment income was driven by 4 4 million increase in debt capital markets versus the prior year as well as a 1 2 million increase in profitability on our asset management business these gains were tempered by a 900 000 decline in equity capital markets as the increase in operating revenues in that business were more than offset by higher interest expenses related to our securities lending activities and the start up costs associated with our prime brokerage initiative commercial hedging segment income increased 4 5 million as a result of the 6 6 million increase in operating revenues combined with the 700 000 decline in bad debt expense which was partially offset by increases in variable and fixed compensation and benefits of 800 000 and 600 000 respectively ces segment income increased 1 5 million versus the prior year driven by strong performance in our fx prime brokerage business global payments segment income declined 1 million in the segment income to 14 7 million as the increase in operating revenues were offset by a 2 1 million increase in non variable expenses as a result of the acquisition of paycommerce and the addition of several new front office employees finally the net cost in unallocated overhead increased 12 8 million versus the prior year of which 3 5 million was related to an increase in variable compensation and benefits non variable unallocated costs increased 8 million versus the prior year of which 1 3 million was associated with our recent acquisitions and initiatives the remaining increase was driven by increased headcount in several administrative departments as well as higher non trading technology and support costs related to various it client engagement accounting and human resource systems slide number 6 shows the interest and fee income on our investment of client funds in our exchange traded futures and options businesses as well as client balances held on our correspondent clearing and independent wealth management businesses as noted on this slide earnings on these balances have increased 1 5 million versus the prior year to 16 9 million as our yield on these balances has increased 18 basis points to 2 18 in the current period as sean noted earlier the fed recently dropped short term rates however our overall yield still increased versus the prior year as the two rate cuts in the current quarter offset rate hikes in september and december of last year and the effective rate hikes typically lag one quarter due to investment maturities in addition our average client balances increased modestly versus the prior year moving on to slide number 7 our quarterly financial dashboard i would just highlight a couple of items of note variable expenses represented 61 9 of our total expenses for the quarter well above our target of keeping more than 50 of our total variable of total expenses variable in nature non variable expenses which are made of both fixed and bad debt expenses increased 3 5 million versus the prior year excluding the recovery on the bad debt on physical coal non variable expenses increased 13 5 million of which 5 9 million is related to the recent acquisition of gmp paycommerce financial solutions carl kliem and coininvest as well as the launch of our securities prime brokerage and canadian initiatives we reported net income of 27 2 million in the fourth quarter for an 18 7 return on equity above our stated target of 15 our total assets increased 27 versus the prior year primarily due to increased activity in our domestic fixed income and securities lending activities finally and closing out the review of the quarterly results our average revenue per employee was relatively flat with the prior year at 584 000 on an annualized basis above our target of 500 000 and our book value per share increased 4 43 to close out the quarter at 31 15 per share next i ll move on to a discussion of the year to date results and i ll refer to slide number 8 year to date operating revenues were up 130 3 million or 13 to 1 1 billion in the current fiscal year all segments of our business reported increases in operating revenues as compared to the prior year to date period with the exception of the ces segment the largest increase was in our security segment which added 99 1 million including 56 1 million increase in interest income driven by increased activity in our conduit sec lending and fixed income businesses in addition the increase in operating revenues was the result of a 58 increase in the gross dollar volume traded in our equity capital markets business our physical commodities and commercial hedging segments added 16 9 million and 15 7 million respectively while our global payments segment added 13 6 million versus the prior year to date ces operating revenues declined 6 3 million versus the prior year finally the decline in unallocated overhead operating revenues is primarily related to the net fluctuation in market value of economic hedges held against the argentine peso as well as the increase in elimination entries to eliminate gross ups among our segments moving on to slide number 9 for a discussion of the variance in pre tax income by segment for the year to date period the largest variance was seen in our physical commodity segment which added 21 4 million versus the prior year as a result of the 12 4 million recovery on the bad debt on physical coal as well as the strong performance in precious metals operating revenues segment income in our securities segment increased 6 6 million as a result of the strong operating revenue growth noted earlier which was tempered by higher interest expense in our institutional fixed income and securities lending activities as well as decline in performance in our municipal securities business global payments added 6 3 million in segment income versus the prior year as the result of 8 growth in the number of payments made as well as a 4 increase in the average revenue per payment in addition the ces segment added 5 8 million to segment income driven by a 4 3 million increase in fx prime brokerage including the 2 1 million barclays last look net settlement received in the first quarter as well as improved performance in correspondent clearing and derivative voice brokerage commercial hedging segment income added 3 7 million as compared to the prior year period driven by the increase in operating revenues and 1 5 million decline in bad debt expense finally the 34 3 million increase in net cost in unallocated overhead were driven by the decline in operating revenues noted earlier a 5 3 million increase in variable compensation a 5 8 million increase in cost associated with our recent acquisitions and initiatives as well as increased headcount in several administrative departments and higher non trading technology and support costs related to various it and client engagement systems finally i will touch on the year to date dashboard which is slide number 10 in the presentation deck variable expenses are above our internal target of exceeding 50 of total expenses coming in at 60 3 of total expenses net income was 85 1 million for the current fiscal as compared to 55 5 million in the prior year with the prior year including a 20 1 million charge related to the tax reform the return on equity for the year to date period is 15 5 which exceeds our internal target of 15 with that i would like to turn it back to sean to wrap up sean o connor chief executive officer president director thanks bill as most of our shareholders know our financial north star has been to compound our shareholder capital to become a bigger and more valuable business this is why we have set roe as our primary financial target which has also been embedded in our executive compensation plan as well as compensation for senior management generally this approach enables us to create our own capital runway to support our growing franchise and as a result we are less dependent on the capital markets and can thus be flexible and opportunistic in approaching them in short we will only take on capital when it is available and priced right from our perspective we also believe that by this roe metric we have handily outperformed our peer group companies and most of the bulge bracket banks which is validation empirically of our strategy and approach our book value now stands at 31 15 versus 24 two years ago an increase of 30 the result of us achieving our 15 target over the last two years our business model offers vertically integrated execution and clearing in all major asset classes and markets for our clients this is a unique and increasingly valuable platform in the mid market space because it allows clients to efficiently access many markets and asset classes through one provider which is generally only available with the bulge bracket banks this has drawn clients to our platform and as consolidation continues and it will enable us to create sticky client relationships and increased clearing and execution revenues while also growing our client balances management s priority is to remain intently focused on our goal of becoming best in class financial franchise by relentlessly pursuing the following objectives increasing the value of our financial platform by adding new products capabilities and markets and liquidity venues for our clients this can be done either organically or through disciplined acquisition to make us the financial franchise of choice for commercial and institutional clients looking to access markets with efficient execution as well as post trade clearing settlement and custody services second expanding into client segments and geographies where we are underrepresented by acquiring suitable talent through recruitment or disciplined acquisition of teams this requires that we build efficient on ramps onto our financial platform that are both cost effective for us as well as compelling from a client engagement perspective three more tightly integrating our offerings platforms marketing strategy and customer experience in order to make the relationship more meaningful for the customer stickier for our company and more valuable to us both next increasing digitization of our platform by investing in client facing technology through an efficient mix of proprietary and industry standard platforms to better leverage our intellectual capital in driving revenue growth and providing customers with easier more efficient access to our products and services create a scalable execution and clearing infrastructure where cost per transaction are decreasing in absolute terms and hopefully get to zero on an incremental basis maintaining a robust environment to dynamically allocate capital and resources to create maximum long term value for our shareholders and lastly multi layered risk management to ensure that we achieve the best risk adjusted return for our business one of our biggest challenges and perhaps our greatest opportunity is to accelerate growth and fundamentally differentiate our business by digitizing our financial platform and provide more seamless effective and efficient connections for our clients for the global markets and the liquidity sources they want to access i outlined some of our recent wins in this regard earlier and we have already seen strong adoption and revenue generation from each of these initiatives individually we remain convinced that building a more comprehensive and integrated digital offering will provide an exponential growth opportunity and cement our reputation as a leading financial platform connecting clients to the global markets this success here will not come quickly or easily but it can eventually propel us to what to our objective of being a leading global financial franchise this is one of the more exciting times we ve had in the company s history with that i would like to turn back to the operator and open the question and answer session operator questions and answers operator our first question comes from bill dezellem of tieton capital your line is open bill dezellem tieton capital analyst hi thank you that s tieton capital a couple of questions first of all relative to your variable expense target of 50 and that you ve been running for some time closer to 60 is it time to change your target or over time would you expect that 50 to really be a better number sean o connor chief executive officer president director hey bill it s sean thanks for joining so part of variable cost is exchange fees because when we execute trades we have to pay some fees to the exchanges and that s obviously variable so to a certain extent that percentage and that target is influenced by our business mix how many of our transactions go to exchanges and also is related to the increase in those fees and also the margin on underlying transaction so there is a kind of a complex interplay fees are becoming an increasingly larger proportion of what we trade so that s why i think the number is higher i don t think we need to change it because i suspect we will see some of those metrics going the other way at some point but i think that s the reason we have been above that percentage bill would you agree with that or william j dunaway chief financial officer no i agree and i think that we establish those targets right and i think have proved historically that if we hit those targets that we ve set that we ll reach our ultimate target which is a 15 roe and you know product mix will provide some variability in a few of those targets over time but i think the long term performance shows that if we hit those targets we re successful bill dezellem tieton capital analyst thank you both sean o connor chief executive officer president director thanks bill operator there are no further questions i d like to turn the call actually we do have a question from erick sonne of private capital management your line is open erick sonne private capital management analyst good morning guys i have a question sean o connor chief executive officer president director hey erick erick sonne private capital management analyst how are you sean o connor chief executive officer president director good erick sonne private capital management analyst i have a quick question with regards to the incremental capital invested in new initiatives this year or maybe in the last 24 months i mean have you guys quantified in terms of how much incremental capital have you guys deployed both on the new initiatives in terms of like organically generating new business and also investing on buying new platforms sean o connor chief executive officer president director well let me try and answer the question generically and bill will correct me if my numbers are wrong how about that erick sonne private capital management analyst yeah sean o connor chief executive officer president director so i would say during the last year our estimate is that the discrete initiatives we ve mentioned on this call have cost us in terms of p l over 10 million so we ve invested 10 million of our earnings in new initiatives some of these have been we ve acquired initiatives that are loss making and we ve got to we ve got to bear some losses and take on some retention costs to turn them around and that s a net of kind of the bargain purchase gain that we got so in aggregate the losses were more like 15 million and offset by a 5 million gain that s the amount of p l impact in terms of underlying capital that is committed to those businesses almost all of those activities are very light capital uses so we ve been able to absorb those activities without any meaningful addition to capital to support them most of them have been straight execution businesses the capital to support those is really kind of show capital which we have so those have when we turn those businesses around and they are all on track to turnaround those businesses should be very accretive to roe as a result but we have to kind of bear the cost of the sort of 10 million the one exception to that which is yet to be reported is the acquisition of uob which we ve sort of spoken about for a while that business actually closed just after the year end i think it was the 5th of october the actual close date that was a meaningful build of expenses now we will get the offset of revenues which is why that deal was so interesting to us and it is a fairly material commitment of capital we think that it s a pretty significant transaction for us because it has given us critical mass out in asia but it is a fully regulated fcm in asia and a lot of clients in asia want to leave their money in the asian time zone with a locally regulated entity so it sort of opens up all of that for us but that business is probably going to require somewhere between 20 million and 30 million of core equity dedicated to it sort of permanently right so that is our biggest capital user in terms of acquisitions we spoken about the rest are being pretty modest the good news with uob is under the sort of transaction terms we probably are not going to bear any cash burn on that business of any magnitude we re getting enough revenue to offset the pretty material cost of building a fully regulated entity and we can grow from there so there was a trade off there where we maybe didn t take on so much of a cash burn or retrenchment costs but we have to put capital into that business to support it so i don t know if that

editor s note will china set a growth target above 6 percent next year how will china achieve such a goal two economists share their opinions on china s economy in 2020 full text below growth target to remain an anchor in 2020 the year 2020 marks the closing year of a decade long endeavor for china as the country s leadership has pledged to build a moderately prosperous society by 2020 a year before the 100th anniversary of the communist party of china to achieve that goal china needs to double real gdp from the 2010 level by next year and therefore requires a minimum growth of 6 1 6 2 percent in both 2019 and 2020 despite external and domestic challenges china s 10 year goal appears within reach the meeting of the political bureau of the cpc central committee on dec 6 reaffirmed the commitment and called on the government to keep economic growth within a reasonable range by properly using counter cyclical tools we think the government will set the 2020 growth target around 6 percent providing policy support for a slightly higher growth rate while gdp growth rates up to 2018 are likely to be revised based on the latest economic census we at standard chartered bank believe the upward revisions will be marginal and insufficient to meaningfully lower the 2020 growth target govt realizes structural downward pressure compared with the growth target of 6 0 6 5 percent set for 2019 a lower target would suggest the government recognizes the structural downtrend of the economy and does not want to over stimulate the economy especially because of an already high leverage ratio and the need to reserve policy space in its long term competition with the united states still to stabilize employment and build some cushion for achieving the decade long goal we expect the government to err on the higher side of 6 percent the us triggered trade war and the property sector are sources of downward pressure on china s economy if a phase one deal at the sino us trade talks pre empts new us tariffs and includes some rollback of existing tariffs we estimate the existing tariffs will trim china s 2020 growth by 0 3 percentage points in a worse case scenario where all announced us tariffs are fully implemented china s growth could reduce by up to 0 6 percentage points next year yet despite restrictive housing policies curtailing property developers appetite to acquire land and launch new projects that bodes ill for property investment next year we see some positive factors including policy support and cyclical tailwinds which would help contain the risk of a sharp downturn therefore we forecast 6 1 percent growth for 2020 above market consensus policy support to fuel growth proactive fiscal policy has been doing the heavy lifting this year while the official budget only shows a deficit of 2 8 percent of gdp this year the broadly defined budget deficit which covers both the general public budget and the government funds budget has been increased to 6 5 percent of gdp this year from 4 7 percent last year data so far suggest the budget will be fully implemented delivering fiscal stimulus of 1 8 percent of gdp fiscal stimulus in fact has played an important role in offsetting the fallout from china s deleveraging measures last year and higher us tariffs this year we also expect the government to keep the broadly defined budget deficit around 6 5 percent of gdp in 2020 the official budget however may only show a deficit of 3 percent of gdp observing the implicit ceiling of 3 percent the mix of fiscal support however may shift from tax cuts to spending as it tends to have a higher fiscal multiplier and as the meeting of the political bureau of the cpc central committee emphasized the need to strengthen infrastructure construction both central and local government bond issuance quotas will likely be raised to finance the deficit the authorities have shown a preference for maintaining a conventional monetary policy for as long as possible recent statements by senior people s bank of china s officials suggest deep skepticism over the utility and sustainability of quantitative easing and negative interest rates tools that have been commonly used in major advanced economies as such china is unlikely to engage in aggressive monetary easing due to concerns over the already elevated debt level and the diminishing effects of policy loosening on activity in the real economy accommodative monetary policy expected next year we expect monetary policy to be accommodative in 2020 both the reserve requirement ratio rrr and medium term lending facility mlf rate are likely to be cut and the central bank might keep monetary and total social financing growth slightly above nominal gdp growth next year to achieve that it will have to cut the rrr to raise the money multiplier as its balance sheet has not been expanded for a while we forecast three rrr cuts of 50 basis points each or an equivalent liquidity injection through a targeted rrr cut or central bank lending in the first three quarters of 2020 to accommodate government bond issuance and to prevent a crowding out of the private sector in addition to facilitate a decline in the average lending rate the central bank may cut the mlf rate by 10 basis points each in the first and second quarters with pass through to the seven day reverse repo rate and loan prime rate next year will be a year of soft but stabilizing growth for the global economy in our view and we forecast global growth at 3 3 percent for 2020 slightly higher than our 3 1 percent estimate for 2019 industrial inventory likely to bottom out in china infrastructure investment may pick up further supported by fiscal spending faster project approvals and the lowering of the project capital requirement the industrial inventory cycle appears close to bottoming out curbing downside risks to manufacturing investment historical data suggest there is an inventory cycle that lasts three to four years and it has been three and a half years since the last bottom of the cycle besides car sales may become less of a drag on retail sales next year due to recent policies to encourage car purchases automobile sales dropped 9 7 percent year on year in the first 10 months of 2019 because of the expiration of the tax benefit slower home sales and restrictive purchase policies in large cities but since the base effect has waned in recent months sales growth has become less negative and could further pick up next year ding shuang chief economist for greater china and north asia

presentation there will be a question and answer session i would now hand the conference over to the chief financial officer and treasurer mr scott zuehlke scott zuehlke senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks for joining the call this morning on the call with me today are bill griffiths our chairman president and chief executive officer and george wilson our chief operating officer this conference call will contain forward looking statements and some discussion of non gaap measures forward looking statements and guidance discussed on this call and in our earnings release are based on current expectations actual results or events may differ materially from such statements and guidance and quanex undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements to reflect new information or events for more detailed description of our forward looking statement disclaimer and a reconciliation of non gaap measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures please see our earnings release issued yesterday and posted to our website i will now discuss the financial results net sales decreased by 1 5 year over year to 240 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to continued softness in our north american cabinet components segment however we generated net sales of 893 8 million for the year which represents growth of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2018 the increase was driven by above market growth and our north american and european fenestration segment which was mostly the result of price increases related to raw material inflation recovery excluding foreign exchange impact we realized revenue growth of 1 4 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 we reported a net loss of 30 9 million or 0 94 per diluted share for the three months ended october 31st 2019 compared to net income of 6 7 million or 0 19 per diluted share during the three months ended october 31st 2018 for fiscal 2019 we reported a net loss of 46 7 million or 1 42 per diluted share compared to net income of 26 6 million or 0 76 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 the reported net losses were primarily attributable to a 44 6 million non cash goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter and a 30 million non cash goodwill impairment in the second quarter both in the north american cabinet components segment mainly due to lower volume expectations related to the ongoing shift in the market from semi custom to stock cabinets and customer specific strategy changes on an adjusted basis net income was 14 million or 0 42 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 19 compared to 7 6 million or 0 22 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted net income was 31 4 million or 0 95 per diluted share for fiscal 2019 compared to 22 7 million or 0 65 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 the adjustments being made to eps are for restructuring charges certain executive severance charges non cash asset impairment charges accelerated d a the impact of deferred loan costs for the credit facility foreign currency transaction impacts transaction and advisory fees loss on the sale of a plant and adjustments related to the tax cuts and jobs act on an adjusted basis ebitda increased to 34 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the full year 2019 adjusted ebitda was 102 7 million compared to 89 9 million in 2018 increases in adjusted earnings were largely driven by lower incentive accruals operational efficiency gains and the successful implementation of pricing initiatives in late 2018 i ll now move on to cash flow and balance sheet cash provided by operating activities was 96 4 million in 2019 compared to 104 6 million in 2018 we generated free cash flow of 71 5 million in 2019 and 78 1 million in 2018 as a result of our strong free cash flow profile consistent with our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet while returning capital to shareholders we repurchased approximately 9 6 million of stock and repaid 52 5 million of bank debt during fiscal 2019 we also exited fiscal 19 with a leverage ratio of 1 2 times net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda which surpassed our goal as for 2020 guidance and as noted in the outlook section of our earnings release based on current trends in the latest macro data we are taking a measured approach to our 2020 revenue forecast we expect low single digit sales growth in our north american and european fenestration segments offset by continued decline in revenues in our north american cabinet components segment on a consolidated basis sales are expected to be approximately 865 million to 885 million in fiscal 2020 however we expect to generate between 102 million and 110 million in adjusted ebitda at fiscal 2020 which would yield margin expansion of approximately 60 basis points to the midpoint of guidance we plan to stay focused on generating cash and maintaining a strong balance sheet while also continuing to opportunistically repurchase stock for modeling purposes it is appropriate to make the following assumptions for 2020 depreciation of approximately 32 million amortization of approximately 15 million sg a of 100 million to 105 million interest expense of 7 million to 8 million and a tax rate of 25 from a capital expenditure standpoint we expect to spend approximately 35 million in 2020 which is about 10 million more than in 2019 as we intend to invest in certain specific projects in an effort to grow organically our target is to generate free cash flow between 55 million and 60 million in fiscal 2020 i will now turn the call over to george for his prepared remarks george wilson vice president chief operating officer thanks scott as i reflect on our performance in 2019 it is highlighted by free cash flow of over 70 million for the second consecutive year allowing us to exit the year with a leverage ratio of 1 2 times which easily surpassed our goal of 1 5 times we also saw very strong performance in our fenestration segments in europe and north america in europe adjusted ebitda margins improved by approximately 340 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 300 basis points for the full year volume growth and price increases were the drivers for the improved performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year excluding foreign exchange impact we realized above market sales growth of 3 3 during the fourth quarter and 9 1 for the full year in this segment in our north american fenestration segment adjusted ebitda margins expanded by approximately 250 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 110 basis points for the full year volume growth price increases improved operational performance and sg a savings were all reasons for the improvements sales in our north american fenestration segment grew at 6 during the fourth quarter and 3 8 for the full year which compares favorably to ducker s latest window shipment estimate of negative 0 4 for the three months ended september 30th 2019 and negative 1 6 for the 12 months ended september 30th 2019 our north american cabinet components segment continue to face headwinds in 2019 particularly in the semi custom segment with revenue shrinking by 8 1 resulting in a margin contraction of 120 basis points for the full year our focus in this segment going forward will be to continue to improve operational performance rightsize our capacity footprint and optimize working capital as we look to 2020 there is a great deal of uncertainty at the macro level brexit is yet to be resolved we have an election here in the us and there is continued uncertainty with trade wars and tariffs which mostly relates to the cabin cabinet industry in our case as a result we feel it prudent to take a conservative view on our 2020 outlook we believe we can continue to outperform the market in our two fenestration segments albeit was slightly lower overall growth expectations unfortunately we believe the semi custom segment could continue to shrink even further in 2020 resulting in our consolidated revenues being down year over year notwithstanding that we demonstrated in 2019 that we can execute on the things directly within our control so we expect another year of margin expansion with adjusted ebitda in 102 million to 110 million range as for capital deployment in 2020 the additional 10 million in capex compared to 2019 is to fund growth initiatives including a new screen facility the upgrade of our us vinyl extrusion technology and capacity expansion in europe as scott mentioned we will continue to focus on generating cash and maintaining a strong balance sheet while also opportunistically buying back more stock and finally i d like to take a moment to thank bill and the board of directors for giving me the opportunity to be the next ceo of quanex i m humbled by this opportunity yet very excited to be working with the executive team and all of the quanex employees we will remain focused on our internal initiatives of safety operational excellence and cash flow generation while continuing to explore all options to create incremental shareholder value i will now turn the call over to bill for his closing comments bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer thank you george let me close by expressing my thanks to our board of directors and our employees for their lending support over the past six years it s been a good ride and we ve made significant progress in transforming quanex into an industry leading pure play building products manufacturer while there will be no change in strategy it is time to hand over the reigns so that george and his team can take the execution of that strategy to the next level i will remain active in assisting george and his team as we continue down the path of operational excellence to further enhance profitability and cash flow and to ultimately increase value for your our shareholders thank you operator we ll now take questions questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from daniel moore with cjs securities please go ahead daniel moore cjs securities analyst good morning george wilson vice president chief operating officer good morning bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer good morning daniel moore cjs securities analyst i ll just start quickly just not take a lot of time but bill congrats on the transition and leaving quanex in great shape from not only competitive but certainly a financial stability and liquidity perspective and george congrats on the promotion top line guide for 2020 if doing the simple math but implies double digit declines in north american cabinet is kind of an extension of what we ve seen in the last quarter or two are there lines in that that you plan to exit or there larger customers that are you mentioned some strategy shifts among customers any more detail with regard to just the overall acceleration away from stock to semi custom is that accelerating any more detail there and color there would be very helpful thank you george wilson vice president chief operating officer in terms of the cabinet sales in addition to the continued shift from a semi custom to stock which we ve noted the major change has been with one customer who we have been working with in terms of strategic projects for a long period of time that changed their strategic direction during the year and is deciding to exit one of their product lines and so that is the big change year over year and what we re seeing and why it s expedited from that from what we had given guidance for in the past daniel moore cjs securities analyst helpful and from a cadence perspective i would presume that larger declines in the first half of the year versus the second given that decisions made within the last several months george wilson vice president chief operating officer i think it will be even is what we re seeing daniel moore cjs securities analyst okay bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer to be clear dan we are expecting those decline on a quarterly basis going forward daniel moore cjs securities analyst okay i can dig in a little further after on the margin side looking for 60 basis points of improvement at the midpoint maybe can you just provide a little bit more detail around the between the segments what your expectations look like and the drivers of that improvement thanks bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer sure i can add a little detail and color there so in the north american fenestration segment you should expect we said low single digit so 2 to 3 growth there we continue to gain share in the screens business we also gained some share back in the vinyl profile business and in the spacer business we expect some growth there as well in europe we expect again low single digit growth so i d say 1 to 2 range hopefully that s a conservative number but a lot s going on in europe as you know we re adding a line in germany to our spacer facility there we re also continuing to gain a little share in our vinyl profile business in the uk as really specifically one competitor continues to lose share and we are picking that business up for the most part and then and cabinets we just explained it s really the shift mid double digit shift down the shift from semi custom to stock daniel moore cjs securities analyst yeah that s great color on the top line i ll ask one more or just kind of review i was kind of looking for a little bit more detail as it relates to the margin expansion the 60 bps of margin expansion maybe it goes hand in hand with that top line that you described but if you could sort of rank order where you see the greatest opportunity for margin expansion among the segments and what the drivers would be and i ll jump back to queue thanks bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer sure on the margin expansion side it does kind of go along the same lines of revenue we expect the most margin expansion in north american fenestration in europe there is opportunity for better margin expansion the margins in that segment are already very healthy so maintaining or improving those is the plan and then in cabinet even with the lower revenue there is some opportunity to expand margin slightly george wilson vice president chief operating officer we re still seeing the results of the operational excellence programs that we ve been putting in across the board so as we ve said in past calls there would be continued margin improvement in all segments of the business based on those activities albeit at a slower rate and we re seeing some of that now daniel moore cjs securities analyst very good understood i ll jump back in queue with any follow ups thanks george wilson vice president chief operating officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from steven ramsey with thompson research please go ahead brian biros thompson research group analyst hey good morning this is actually brian biros on for stephen thank you taking my questions i wanted to start with the guidance for the fenestration segments low single digit growth you guys mentioned can you provide some color on how much of that is strictly price versus any other growth drivers and then maybe the cadence from quarter to quarter versus just the full year scott zuehlke senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i mean without going into too much detail i think we can comfortably say that price will be less of a driver in 2020 than it was in 2019 and the volume growth will drive revenue higher in 2020 and that s across the board except for cabinet brian biros thompson research group analyst got it is that kind of even across quarters or are you seeing maybe one quarter would jump out and be more substantial versus others george wilson vice president chief operating officer i think that s consistent across all quarters the ability at this time to get additional price i think we re priced very competitively in the market and we will see no major movements across any of the quarters brian biros thompson research group analyst got it helpful and then last one from me i guess is on the cabinet side the guidance previously mentioned probably down double digits for the year is there anything throughout the year that would have to change significantly or i guess what would have to change significantly to surprise on the upside and kind of do better than the guidance george wilson vice president chief operating officer i think the thing that we would look at is if there was any significant change in tariffs that would drive the pricing of something higher that would force them to look back in addition to that if we start seeing a consumer trend shift back to semi custom from the stock as people start to remodel and focus on that and upgrading their kitchens we may see a shift back to higher end cabinets which would lend to the upside on our business brian biros thompson research group analyst understood thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ken zener with keybanc please go ahead ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst good morning gentlemen bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer good morning george wilson vice president chief operating officer good morning ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst hello bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer yes can you hear us ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst i able to hear you multiple speakers okay i apologize about that well big quarter for everybody bill congratulations george since we met yeah obviously it s a nice as well as for you scott so i just want to take i think i understand how you re outlining 2020 i just want to go over some basics because you re doing so well in two of your three segments and north america margins are up nicely basically back to where they were in 16 europe wouldn t have thought in the middle of all this chaos you d be delivering the margins that you did there so you re obviously executing well in those core businesses and george as it relates to what is sustained cabinet headwind obviously you ve been involved with bill and bill you know you deployed capital in cabinets you did some of the european stuff but what is george your view cabinets it s unclear what s going to happen with the tariffs but is there a possibility that you ll have a simpler business in time within categories that are more secular in nature in terms of growth i know who knew cabinets was going to break away and could make a case for knowing that ahead of time but your margins are so strong in other businesses and cabinets does an oem cabinets really make sense to you and how are you going to go about determining that with the board george wilson vice president chief operating officer so to answer your question i think the first part of that would be i think it s really too early to make a wholesale strategic change in that business as you know the shift from semi custom down the stock happen so rapidly and wasn t predicted by anyone so i think that we re evaluating it we re obviously our eyes on it but it s too early to change strategic direction however i do think operationally we still have a lot of runway and we re making significant improvements on a continuous basis and so i think we re going to let both sides play out we re going to continue to focus on what we do well in the plants and making that even better and then we will keep our eye on the rapidly changing market and work with the board for strategic direction ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst okay and i do empathize with the challenges you face there in terms of the fenestration extrusion it really seems like the last i don t know if its two quarters or last two to six quarters you ve been gaining share can you talk to some of the dynamics in that category please because i know you guys had shut down a lot of the kentucky lines and it seems like you re actually gaining share from the point that you shut down lines is it what can you go into a little bit of the dynamic that is a that opportunity thank you george wilson vice president chief operating officer sure what we focused on in the vinyl space in north america specifically over the last few years is really controlling and improving what we do so focusing on our cost structure our ability to deliver on time and servicing customers and as some of our customers have left us for price and price things where we ve walked away we ve continue to focus on and doing the things that we do well the quality the delivery and as we ve seen as those customers figure out that their total cost is much more inclusive than just the purchase price per pound that we re starting to see some ability of us coming back and we re trying to capitalize on that so we ll continue to stay focused on working on operations delivering the customer service that we feel like we re very good at and we ll improve on and we will continue to go after share in that way ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst very nice to hear that related to window m a so large window company has recently been sold i believe that company was a big proponent of the warm edge spacers that you guys produce as well as some of the they had invested in some of the machinery to enable that possibility can you talk about growth rates that we re seeing in that warm edge spacer are you still getting share gains or and or how does the capex side look on the window side to enable greater market share gains in that category george wilson vice president chief operating officer sure so in regards to the spacer business we re still gaining share we ve been very open in past calls that the rate of that growth is being really dictated by the ability of machine and equipment makers to get that those high speed lines out to the customer base and there is very few globally that provide that equipment so lead times on new equipment are six months to a year so our the speed of growth is really dictated by the ability to get new equipment into the market the demand for automated equipment is still there customers are looking for ways to automate and outsource and eliminate their labor because the availability of labor across the country is still limited so i think we re just we still see growth rates it s dictated by the equipment makers right now ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst excellent and bill if i could try my perennial question for you realizing george is now in the seat would you like to give a margin dispersion for the fenestration business in north america bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer ken you never disappoint i shall miss talking to you ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst is that non answer though bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer my new role is chairman that s all i m allowed to give at this point ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst excellent george would you like expand upon the chairman s reticence george wilson vice president chief operating officer i think bill have taught me well and that s a level of detail that we re not prepared to disclose at this point ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst congratulations gentlemen on all your new opportunities thank you george wilson vice president chief operating officer thank you bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer thanks ken operator thank you and our next question is from julio romero with sidoti please go ahead julio romero sidoti analyst hey good morning everyone george wilson vice president chief operating officer good morning bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer good morning julio romero sidoti analyst hey first off bill congratulations on your success transforming quanex over the last few years certainly a large scale transformation and congrats to george as well in the new role bill griffiths chairman president and chief executive officer thank you george wilson vice president chief operating officer thanks julio romero sidoti analyst so george i know you ve had success at operational improvement can you just talk about how your background and experience at quanex maybe shapes your vision and strategy over the next three or so years or so george wilson vice president chief operating officer sure i think for me we re a manufacturing company that focuses on quality product quality service delivering energy efficient products to all of the fenestration and cabinet markets and we ll continue to stay focused on that and that starts with an operational background in an operational level so whatever business we were in we always going to be put put in that regards so my background in terms of operations i think lends itself very well because our strategy has always been an operational excellence and letting that drive our performance julio romero sidoti analyst got it and on that point you mentioned operationally you do have a lot of runway left in cabinets but how about runway for the two fenestration segments obviously the margins they are already very strong but how much headroom do you see in the fenestration segments to improve margins over two to three year timeframe george wilson vice president chief operating officer i think as we ve said in previous calls we still believe that there is some runway left not near the rate that we ve captured in previous years but in every facility in all of our product lines we have projects and goals and objectives set that have a path to completion and we believe that they will all contribute to margin expansion that s what we re focused on so there ll be some but just not at the rate that you ve seen in the past in those segments julio romero sidoti analyst understood thanks for taking the questions and best of luck in 2020 george wilson vice president chief operating officer thank you so much operator thank you and our next question is from daniel moore with cjs securities please go ahead daniel moore cjs securities analyst thank you again in the past you ve got as far as to quantify the in rough terms the dollars lost when you had a customer perhap shift in other segments to another supplier is there sort of rough terms a dollar amounts that we should be thinking about in annualized terms from the customer that you called out in the cabinets business and one last follow up george wilson vice president chief operating officer sure based on the run rates where we re at today we re expecting that would be between 10 million to 15 million range daniel moore cjs securities analyst got it very helpful and bill alluded to the answer being no but i ll ask it anyway in terms of just capital allocation toward any tweaks or subtle shifts in emphasis or focus you may have as you take over the reigns in 2020 and beyond george wilson vice president chief operating officer no as we said in our commentary our normal capital expense is very consistent and we will focus on operational improvements and then the additional 10 million this year is really identifying three major areas in terms of the new screen facility vinyl some new assets in our north american vinyl platform and then a capacity expansion and then outside of that we ll opportunistically buy stock as the cash flow dictates it and we ll continue to stay on that path daniel moore cjs securities analyst very good appreciate the color thanks again george wilson vice president chief operating officer thank you operator thank you and this concludes our q a session i would like to turn the call back to george wilson for his final remarks george wilson vice president chief operating officer i d like to thank you all for joining and we look forward to providing you an update on our next

editor s note will china set a growth target above 6 percent next year how will china achieve such a goal two economists share their opinions on china s economy in 2020 full text below growth target to remain an anchor in 2020 the year 2020 marks the closing year of a decade long endeavor for china as the country s leadership has pledged to build a moderately prosperous society by 2020 a year before the 100th anniversary of the communist party of china to achieve that goal china needs to double real gdp from the 2010 level by next year and therefore requires a minimum growth of 6 1 6 2 percent in both 2019 and 2020 despite external and domestic challenges china s 10 year goal appears within reach the meeting of the political bureau of the cpc central committee on dec 6 reaffirmed the commitment and called on the government to keep economic growth within a reasonable range by properly using counter cyclical tools we think the government will set the 2020 growth target around 6 percent providing policy support for a slightly higher growth rate while gdp growth rates up to 2018 are likely to be revised based on the latest economic census we at standard chartered bank believe the upward revisions will be marginal and insufficient to meaningfully lower the 2020 growth target govt realizes structural downward pressure compared with the growth target of 6 0 6 5 percent set for 2019 a lower target would suggest the government recognizes the structural downtrend of the economy and does not want to over stimulate the economy especially because of an already high leverage ratio and the need to reserve policy space in its long term competition with the united states still to stabilize employment and build some cushion for achieving the decade long goal we expect the government to err on the higher side of 6 percent the us triggered trade war and the property sector are sources of downward pressure on china s economy if a phase one deal at the sino us trade talks pre empts new us tariffs and includes some rollback of existing tariffs we estimate the existing tariffs will trim china s 2020 growth by 0 3 percentage points in a worse case scenario where all announced us tariffs are fully implemented china s growth could reduce by up to 0 6 percentage points next year yet despite restrictive housing policies curtailing property developers appetite to acquire land and launch new projects that bodes ill for property investment next year we see some positive factors including policy support and cyclical tailwinds which would help contain the risk of a sharp downturn therefore we forecast 6 1 percent growth for 2020 above market consensus policy support to fuel growth proactive fiscal policy has been doing the heavy lifting this year while the official budget only shows a deficit of 2 8 percent of gdp this year the broadly defined budget deficit which covers both the general public budget and the government funds budget has been increased to 6 5 percent of gdp this year from 4 7 percent last year data so far suggest the budget will be fully implemented delivering fiscal stimulus of 1 8 percent of gdp fiscal stimulus in fact has played an important role in offsetting the fallout from china s deleveraging measures last year and higher us tariffs this year we also expect the government to keep the broadly defined budget deficit around 6 5 percent of gdp in 2020 the official budget however may only show a deficit of 3 percent of gdp observing the implicit ceiling of 3 percent the mix of fiscal support however may shift from tax cuts to spending as it tends to have a higher fiscal multiplier and as the meeting of the political bureau of the cpc central committee emphasized the need to strengthen infrastructure construction both central and local government bond issuance quotas will likely be raised to finance the deficit the authorities have shown a preference for maintaining a conventional monetary policy for as long as possible recent statements by senior people s bank of china s officials suggest deep skepticism over the utility and sustainability of quantitative easing and negative interest rates tools that have been commonly used in major advanced economies as such china is unlikely to engage in aggressive monetary easing due to concerns over the already elevated debt level and the diminishing effects of policy loosening on activity in the real economy accommodative monetary policy expected next year we expect monetary policy to be accommodative in 2020 both the reserve requirement ratio rrr and medium term lending facility mlf rate are likely to be cut and the central bank might keep monetary and total social financing growth slightly above nominal gdp growth next year to achieve that it will have to cut the rrr to raise the money multiplier as its balance sheet has not been expanded for a while we forecast three rrr cuts of 50 basis points each or an equivalent liquidity injection through a targeted rrr cut or central bank lending in the first three quarters of 2020 to accommodate government bond issuance and to prevent a crowding out of the private sector in addition to facilitate a decline in the average lending rate the central bank may cut the mlf rate by 10 basis points each in the first and second quarters with pass through to the seven day reverse repo rate and loan prime rate next year will be a year of soft but stabilizing growth for the global economy in our view and we forecast global growth at 3 3 percent for 2020 slightly higher than our 3 1 percent estimate for 2019 industrial inventory likely to bottom out in china infrastructure investment may pick up further supported by fiscal spending faster project approvals and the lowering of the project capital requirement the industrial inventory cycle appears close to bottoming out curbing downside risks to manufacturing investment historical data suggest there is an inventory cycle that lasts three to four years and it has been three and a half years since the last bottom of the cycle besides car sales may become less of a drag on retail sales next year due to recent policies to encourage car purchases automobile sales dropped 9 7 percent year on year in the first 10 months of 2019 because of the expiration of the tax benefit slower home sales and restrictive purchase policies in large cities but since the base effect has waned in recent months sales growth has become less negative and could further pick up next year ding shuang chief economist for greater china and north asia

griffiths chairman president and ceo george wilson chief operating officer conference call participants daniel moore cjs securities brian biros thompson research ken zener keybanc julio romero sidoti operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2019 quanex building products earnings conference call at this time all participants are in a listen only mode after the speakersÃ¢ presentation there will be a question and answer session please be advised that todayÃ¢ s conference is being recorded i would now hand the conference over to the chief financial officer and treasurer mr scott zuehlke scott zuehlke thanks for joining the call this morning on the call with me today are bill griffiths our chairman president and chief executive officer and george wilson our chief operating officer this conference call will contain forward looking statements and some discussion of non gaap measures forward looking statements and guidance discussed on this call and in our earnings release are based on current expectations actual results or events may differ materially from such statements and guidance and quanex undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statement to reflect new information or events for a more detailed description of our forward looking statement disclaimer and a reconciliation of non gaap measure to the most directly comparable gaap measures please see our earnings release issued yesterday and posted to our website i will now discuss the financial results net sales decreased by 1 5 year over year to 240 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 mainly due to continued softness in our north american cabinet components segment however we generated net sales of 893 8 million for the year which represents growth of approximately 50 basis points compared to fiscal 2018 the increase was driven by above market growth in our north american and european fenestration segment which was mostly the result of price increases related to raw material inflation recovery excluding foreign exchange impact we realized revenue growth of 1 4 in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018 we reported a net loss of 30 9 million or 0 94 per diluted share for the three months ended october 31 2019 compared to net income of 6 7 million or 0 19 per diluted share during the three months ended october 31 2018 for fiscal 2019 we reported a net loss of 46 7 million or 1 42 per diluted share compared to net income of 26 6 million or 0 76 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 the reported net losses were primarily attributable to a 44 6 million non cash goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter and a 30 million non cash goodwill impairment in the second quarter both in the north american cabinet components segment mainly due to lower volume expectations related to the ongoing shift in the market from semi custom to stock cabinets and customer specific strategy changes on an adjusted basis net income was 14 million or 0 42 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of Ã¢ 19 compared to 7 6 million or 0 22 per diluted share during the fourth quarter of 2018 adjusted net income was 31 4 million or 0 95 per diluted share for fiscal 2019 compared to 22 7 million or 0 65 per diluted share for fiscal 2018 the adjustments being made to eps are for restructuring charges certain executive severance charges non cash asset impairment charges accelerated d a the impact of deferred loan costs for the credit facility foreign currency transaction impacts transaction and advisory fees loss on the sale of a plant and adjustments related to the tax cuts and jobs act on an adjusted basis ebitda increased to 34 4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to 25 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 for the full year 2019 adjusted ebitda was 102 7 million compared to 89 9 million in 2018 the increases in adjusted earnings were largely driven by lower incentive accruals operational efficiency gains and a successful implementation of pricing initiatives in late 2018 i will now move on to cash flow and the balance sheet cash provided by operating activities was 96 4 million in 2019 compared to 104 6 million in 2018 we generated free cash flow of 71 5 million in 2019 and 78 1 million in 2018 as a result of our strong free cash flow profile consistent with our commitment to maintain a strong balance sheet while returning capital to shareholders we repurchased approximately 9 6 million in stock and repaid 52 5 million of bank debt during fiscal 2019 we also exited fiscal Ã¢ 19 with a leverage ratio of 1 2 times net debt to last 12 months adjusted ebitda which surpassed our goal as for 2020 guidance and as noted in the outlook section of our earnings release based on current trends in the latest macro data we are taking a measured approach to our 2020 revenue forecast we expect low single digit sales growth in our north american and european fenestration segments offset by continued decline in revenues in our north american cabinet components segment on a consolidated basis sales are expected to be approximately 865 million to 885 million in fiscal 2020 however we expect to generate between 102 million and 110 million in adjusted ebitda at fiscal 2020 which would yield margin expansion of approximately 60 basis points to the midpoint of guidance we plan to stay focused on generating cash and maintaining a strong balance sheet while also continuing to opportunistically repurchase stock for modeling purposes it is appropriate to make the following assumptions for 2020 depreciation of approximately 32 million amortization of approximately 15 million sg a of 100 million to 105 million interest expense of 7 million to 8 million and a tax rate of 25 from a capital expenditure standpoint we expect to spend approximately 35 million in 2020 which is about 10 million more than in 2019 as we intend to invest in certain specific projects in an effort to grow organically our target is to generate free cash flow between 55 million and 60 million in fiscal 2020 i will now turn the call over to george for his prepared remarks george wilson thanks scott as i reflect on our performance in 2019 it is highlighted by free cash flow of over 70 million for the second consecutive year allowing us to exit the year with a leverage ratio of 1 2 times which easily surpassed our goal of 1 5 times we also saw very strong performance in our fenestration segments in europe and north america in europe adjusted ebitda margins improved by approximately 340 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 300 basis points for the full year volume growth and price increases were the drivers for the improved performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year excluding foreign exchange impact we realized above market sales growth of 3 3 during the fourth quarter and 9 1 for the full year in this segment in our north american fenestration segment adjusted ebitda margins expanded by approximately 250 basis points in the fourth quarter and approximately 110 basis points for the full year volume growth price increases improved operational performance and sg a savings were all reasons for the improvements sales in our north american fenestration segment grew at 6 during the fourth quarter and 3 8 for the full year which compares favorably to duckerÃ¢ s latest window shipment estimate of negative 0 4 for the three months ended september 30 2019 and negative 1 6 for the 12 months ended september 30 2019 our north american cabinet components segment continue to face headwinds in 2019 particularly in the semi custom segment with revenue shrinking by 8 1 resulting in a margin contraction of 120 basis points for the full year our focus in this segment going forward will be to continue to improve operational performance right size our capacity footprint and optimize working capital as we look to 2020 there is a great deal of uncertainty at the macro level brexit is yet to be resolved we have an election here in the u s and there is continued uncertainty with trade wars and tariffs which mostly relates to the cabinet industry in our case as a result we feel it prudent to take a conservative view on our 2020 outlook we believe we can continue to outperform the market in our two fenestration segments albeit with slightly lower overall growth expectations unfortunately we believe the semi custom segment could continue to shrink even further in 2020 resulting in our consolidated revenues being down year over year notwithstanding that we demonstrated in 2019 that we can execute on the things directly within our control so we expect another year of margin expansion with adjusted ebitda in 102 million to 110 million range as for capital deployment in 2020 the additional 10 million in capex compared to 2019 is to fund growth initiatives including a new screen facility the upgrade of our u s vinyl extrusion technology and capacity expansion in europe as scott mentioned we will continue to focus on generating cash and maintaining a strong balance sheet while also opportunistically buying back more stock and finally iÃ¢ d like to take a moment to thank bill and the board of directors for giving me the opportunity to be the next ceo of quanex i am humbled by this opportunity yet very excited to be working with the executive team and all of the quanex employees we will remain focused on our internal initiatives of safety operational excellence and cash flow generation while continuing to explore all options to create incremental shareholder value i will now turn the call over to bill for his closing comments bill griffiths thank you george let me close by expressing my thanks to our board of directors and our employees for their unending support over the past six years itÃ¢ s been a good ride and we have made significant progress in transforming quanex into an industry leading pure play building products manufacturer while there will be no change in strategy it is time to hand over the reins so that george and his team can take the execution of that strategy to the next level i will remain active in assisting george and his team as we continue down the path of operational excellence to further enhance profitability and cash flow and to ultimately increase value for our shareholders thank you operator we will now take questions question and answer session operator thank you and our first question comes from daniel moore with cjs securities please go ahead daniel moore good morning scott zuehlke good morning bill griffiths good morning daniel moore i will just start quickly just not take a lot of time but bill congrats on the transition and leaving quanex in great shape from not only competitive but certainly a financial stability and liquidity perspective and george congrats on the promotion topline guide for 2020 if doing the simple math but implies double digit declines in north american cabinet is kind of an extension of what we have seen in the last quarter or two are there lines in that that you plan to exit or there larger customers that are you mentioned some strategy shifts among customers any more detail with regard to just the overall acceleration away from stock to semi custom is that accelerating any more detail there color there would be very helpful thank you scott zuehlke in terms of the cabinet sales in addition to the continued shift from a semi custom to stock which we have noted the major change has been with one customer who we have been working with in terms of strategic projects for a long period of time that changed their strategic direction during the year and is deciding to exit one of their product lines and so that is the big change year over year and what we are seeing and why itÃ¢ s expedited from that from what we had given guidance for in the past daniel moore helpful and from a cadence perspective i would presume that larger declines in the first half of the year versus the second given that decisions made within the last several months scott zuehlke i think it will be even is what we are seeing daniel moore okay bill griffiths to be clear dan we are expecting those decline on a quarterly basis going forward daniel moore okay i can dig in a little further after on the margin side looking for 60 basis points of improvement at the midpoint maybe can you just provide a little bit more detail around the between the segments what your expectations look like and the drivers of that improvement thanks bill griffiths sure i can add a little detail and color there so in the north american fenestration segment you should expect we said low single digit so 2 to 3 growth there we continue to gain share in the screens business we also gained some share back in the vinyl profile business and in the spacer business we expect some growth there as well in europe we expect again low single digit growth iÃ¢ d say 1 to 2 range hopefully thatÃ¢ s a conservative number but a lotÃ¢ s going on in europe as you know we are adding a line in germany to our spacer facility there we are also continuing to gain a little share in our vinyl profile business in the u k as really specifically one competitor continues to lose share and we are picking that business up for the most part and then in cabinets we just explained itÃ¢ s really the shift mid double digit shift down the shift from the semi custom to stock daniel moore yeah thatÃ¢ s great color on the topline i will ask one more or just kind of review kind of looking for a little bit more detail with as it relates to the margin expansion the 60 bps of margin expansion maybe it goes hand in hand with that topline that you described but if you could sort of rank order where you see the greatest opportunity for margin expansion among the segments and what the drivers would be and i will jump back to queue thanks scott zuehlke sure on the margin expansion side it does kind of go along the same lines of revenue we expect the most margin expansion in north american fenestration in europe there is opportunity for better margin expansion the margins in that segment are already very healthy so maintaining or improving those is the plan and then in cabinet even with the lower revenue there is some opportunity to expand margin slightly george wilson we are still seeing the results of the operational excellence programs that we have been putting in across the board so as we have said in past calls there would be continued margin improvement in all segments of the business based on those activities albeit at a slower rate and we are seeing some of that now daniel moore very good understood i will jump back in queue with any follow ups thanks bill griffiths thank you operator thank you our next question comes from steven ramsey with thompson research please go ahead brian biros hey good morning this is actually brian biros on for steven thank you taking my questions i wanted to start with the guidance for the fenestration segments low single digit growth you guys mentioned can you provide some color on how much of that is strictly price versus any other growth drivers and then maybe the cadence from quarter to quarter versus just the full year scott zuehlke i mean without going into too much detail i think we can comfortably say that price will be less of a driver in 2020 than it was in 2019 and the volume growth will drive revenue higher in 2020 and thatÃ¢ s across the board except for cabinet brian biros got it is that kind of even across quarters or are you seeing maybe one quarter would jump out and be more substantial versus others george wilson i think thatÃ¢ s consistent across all quarters i the ability at this time to get additional price i think we are priced very competitively in the market and what we will see no major movements across any of the quarters brian biros got it helpful and then last one from me i guess is on the cabinet side the guidance previously mentioned probably down double digits for the year is there anything throughout the year that would have to change significantly or i guess what would have to change significantly to surprise on the upside and kind of do better than the guidance george wilson i think the thing that we would look at is if there was any significant change in tariffs that would drive the pricing of something higher that would force them to look back in addition to that if we start seeing a consumer trend shift back to semi custom from the stock as people start to remodel and focus on that and upgrading their kitchens we may see a shift back to higher end cabinets which would lend to the upside on our business brian biros understood thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ken zener with keybanc please go ahead ken zener good morning gentlemen bill griffiths good morning scott zuehlke good morning ken zener hello bill griffiths yeah can you hear us ken zener i can hearÃ¢ operator we can hear you ken ken zener okay i apologize about that well big quarter for everybody bill congratulations george since we met yeah obviously itÃ¢ s a nice as well as for you scott so i just want to take i think i understand how you are outlining 2020 i just want to go over some basics because you are doing so well in two of your three segments and north america margins are up nicely basically back to where they were in Ã¢ 16 europe wouldnÃ¢ t have thought in the middle of all this chaos you would be delivering the margins that you did there so you are obviously executing well in those core businesses and george as it relates to what is sustained cabinet headwind obviously you have been involved with bill and bill you deployed capital in cabinets you did some of the european stuff but what is george your view cabinets itÃ¢ s unclear whatÃ¢ s going to happen with the tariffs but is there a possibility that you will have a simpler business in time within categories that are more secular in nature in terms of growth i know who knew cabinets was going to break away and could make a case for knowing that ahead of time but your margins are so strong in other businesses and cabinets does an oem cabinets really make sense to you and how are you going to go about determining that with the board george wilson so to answer your question i think the first part of that would be i think itÃ¢ s really too early to make a wholesale strategic change in that business as you know the shift from semi custom down the stock happen so rapidly and wasnÃ¢ t predicted by anyone so i think that we are evaluating it we are obviously our eyes on it but itÃ¢ s too early to change strategic direction however i do think operationally we still have a lot of runway and we are making significant improvements on a continuous basis and so i think we are going to let both sides play out we are going to continue to focus on what we do well in the plants and making that even better and then we will keep our eye on the rapidly changing market and work with the board for strategic direction ken zener okay and i do empathize with the challenges you face there in terms of the fenestration extrusion it really seems like the last i donÃ¢ t know if its two quarters or last two quarters to six quarters you have been gaining share can you talk to some of the dynamics in that category please because i know you guys had shutdown a lot of the kentucky lines and it seems like you are actually gaining share from the point that you shutdown lines is it what can you go into a little bit of the dynamic that is affording that opportunity thank you george wilson sure what we focused on in the vinyl space in north america specifically over the last few years is really controlling and improving what we do so focusing on our cost structure our ability to deliver on time and servicing customers and as some of our customers have left us for price and price things where we have walked away we have continue to focus on and doing the things that we do well the quality the delivery and as we have seen as those customers figure out that their total cost is much more inclusive than just the purchase price per pound that we are starting to see some ability of us coming back and we are trying to capitalize on that so we will continue to stay focused on working on operations delivering the customer service that we feel like we are very good at and we will improve on and we will continue to go after share in that way ken zener very nice to hear that related to window m a so large window company has recently been sold i believe that company was a big proponent of the warm edge spacers that you guys produce as well as some of the they had invested in some of the machinery to enable that possibility can you talk about growth rates that we are seeing in that warm edge spacer are you still getting share gains or and or how does the capex side look on the window side to enable greater market share gains in that category scott zuehlke sure so in regards to the spacer business we are still gaining share we have been very open in past calls that the rate of that growth is being really dictated by the ability of machine and equipment makers to get that those high speed lines out to the customer base and there is very few globally that provide that equipment so lead times on new equipment are six months to a year so our the speed of growth is really dictated by the ability to get new equipment into the market the demand for automated equipment is still there customers are looking for ways to automate and outsource and eliminate their labor because the availability of labor across the country is still limited so i think we are just we still see growth rates itÃ¢ s dictated by the equipment makers right now ken zener excellent and bill if i could try my perennial question for you realizing george is now in the seat would you like to give a margin dispersion for the fenestration business in north america bill griffiths ken you never disappoint i shall miss talking to you ken zener is that non answer though bill griffiths my new role is chairman thatÃ¢ s all i am allowed to give at this point ken zener excellent george would you like expand upon the chairmanÃ¢ s reticence in terms of theÃ¢ george wilson i think bill have taught me well and thatÃ¢ s a level of detail that we are not prepared to disclose at this point ken zener congratulations gentlemen on all your new opportunities thank you george wilson thank you bill griffiths thanks ken operator thank you and our next question is from julio romero with sidoti please go ahead julio romero hey good morning everyone george wilson good morning bill griffiths good morning julio romero hey first off bill congratulations on your success transforming quanex over the last few years certainly a large scale transformation and congrats to george as well in a new role george wilson thank you bill griffiths thanks julio romero so george i know you have had success at operational improvement can you just talk about how your background and experience at quanex maybe shapes your vision and strategy over the next three or so years or so george wilson sure i think for me we are a manufacturing company that focuses on quality product quality service delivering energy efficient products to all of the fenestration and cabinet markets and we will continue to stay focused on that and that starts with an operational background and an operational level so whatever businesses we are in are always going to be put in that regards so my background in terms of operations i think lends itself very well because our strategy has always been an operational excellence and letting that drive our performance julio romero got it and on that point you mentioned operationally you do have a lot of runway left in cabinets but how about runway for the two fenestration segments obviously the margins they are already very strong but how much headroom do you see in the fenestration segments to improve margins over two year to three year timeframe george wilson i think we as we have said in previous calls we still believe that there is some runway left not near the rate that we have captured in previous years but in every facility in all of our product lines we have projects and goals and objectives set that have a path to completion and we believe that they will all contribute to margin expansion i mean thatÃ¢ s what we are focused on so there will be some but just not at the rate that you have seen in the past in those segments julio romero understood thanks for taking the questions and best of luck in 2020 george wilson thank you so much operator thank you and our next question is from daniel moore with cjs securities please go ahead daniel moore thank you again in the past you have gone as far as to quantify the in rough terms the dollars lost when you had a customer perhaps shift in other segments to another supplier is there sort of rough terms a dollar amounts that we should be thinking about in annualized terms from the customer that you called out in the cabinets business and one last follow up george wilson sure based on the run rates where we are at today we are expecting that would be between 10 million to 15 million range daniel moore got it very helpful and bill alluded to the answer being no but i will ask it anyway in terms of just capital allocation towards any tweaks or subtle shifts in emphasis or focus you may have as you take over the reins in 2020 and beyond george wilson no as we said in our commentary our normal capital expense is very consistent and we will focus on operational improvements and then the additional 10 million this year is really identifying three major areas in terms of the new screen facility vinyl some new assets in our north american vinyl platform and then a capacity expansion and then outside of that we will opportunistically buy stock as the cash flow dictates it and we will continue to stay on that path daniel moore very good appreciate the color thanks again george wilson thank you operator thank you and this concludes our q a session i would like to turn the call back

was expected later in the day to meet with advisers to discuss the dec 15 deadline to impose tariffs on more than us 150 billion in chinese exports the big challenge for risk markets now is that we are getting down to the brass tacks so its time for the u s administration to get off the trade talk merry go round and make a move one way or the other axitrader strategist stephen innes said

information administration said weekly crude inventories rose by 800 000 barrels last week markets had been expecting to see a decline of about 2 8 million barrels however a new opec forecast showing that the group now expects a small deficit in the oil market next year helped boost sentiment the report suggested that market supply is tighter than expected opec and its allies are also now set to further curb production in the new year helping further ease oversupply concerns the fact that we are still hovering near wti us 59 per barrel is a testament to the positive impact of the new opec agreement is having on oil markets axitrader strategist stephen innes said in an early note but he also cautioned that the primary catalyst in the near term remains u s china trade tensions navarro downplayed the idea that december tariffs will be delayed allowing more time for negotiations mr innes said still there seems to be enough evidence in the headlines to suggest both sides want to find

governor stephen poloz last week the central bank again kept interest rates unchanged citing a stabilizing global economy and healthy domestic demand days later statistics canada reported a surprise drop in hiring in this country in november cibc world markets deputy chief economist benjamin tal noted in a recent report that the november hiring decline came at the tail end of a six month period that saw essentially no growth in private sector employment in last week s policy announcement indications from the bank were that there would be no rate move in january but that came before the jobs report he noted he also noted while a recent report on third quarter gdp was largely uneventful revisions to previous numbers now put the economy on track for annual growth of 1 7 per cent for the year rather than earlier estimates of 1 5 per cent complicating the central bank s decision so what do you do when you don t know what to do mr tal asked at the minimum you don t take chances the bank

editor s note will china set a growth target above 6 percent next year how will china achieve such a goal two economists share their opinions on china s economy in 2020 full text below growth target to remain an anchor in 2020 the year 2020 marks the closing year of a decade long endeavor for china as the country s leadership has pledged to build a moderately prosperous society by 2020 a year before the 100th anniversary of the communist party of china to achieve that goal china needs to double real gdp from the 2010 level by next year and therefore requires a minimum growth of 6 1 6 2 percent in both 2019 and 2020 despite external and domestic challenges china s 10 year goal appears within reach the meeting of the political bureau of the cpc central committee on dec 6 reaffirmed the commitment and called on the government to keep economic growth within a reasonable range by properly using counter cyclical tools we think the government will set the 2020 growth target around 6 percent providing policy support for a slightly higher growth rate while gdp growth rates up to 2018 are likely to be revised based on the latest economic census we at standard chartered bank believe the upward revisions will be marginal and insufficient to meaningfully lower the 2020 growth target govt realizes structural downward pressure compared with the growth target of 6 0 6 5 percent set for 2019 a lower target would suggest the government recognizes the structural downtrend of the economy and does not want to over stimulate the economy especially because of an already high leverage ratio and the need to reserve policy space in its long term competition with the united states still to stabilize employment and build some cushion for achieving the decade long goal we expect the government to err on the higher side of 6 percent the us triggered trade war and the property sector are sources of downward pressure on china s economy if a phase one deal at the sino us trade talks pre empts new us tariffs and includes some rollback of existing tariffs we estimate the existing tariffs will trim china s 2020 growth by 0 3 percentage points in a worse case scenario where all announced us tariffs are fully implemented china s growth could reduce by up to 0 6 percentage points next year yet despite restrictive housing policies curtailing property developers appetite to acquire land and launch new projects that bodes ill for property investment next year we see some positive factors including policy support and cyclical tailwinds which would help contain the risk of a sharp downturn therefore we forecast 6 1 percent growth for 2020 above market consensus policy support to fuel growth proactive fiscal policy has been doing the heavy lifting this year while the official budget only shows a deficit of 2 8 percent of gdp this year the broadly defined budget deficit which covers both the general public budget and the government funds budget has been increased to 6 5 percent of gdp this year from 4 7 percent last year data so far suggest the budget will be fully implemented delivering fiscal stimulus of 1 8 percent of gdp fiscal stimulus in fact has played an important role in offsetting the fallout from china s deleveraging measures last year and higher us tariffs this year we also expect the government to keep the broadly defined budget deficit around 6 5 percent of gdp in 2020 the official budget however may only show a deficit of 3 percent of gdp observing the implicit ceiling of 3 percent the mix of fiscal support however may shift from tax cuts to spending as it tends to have a higher fiscal multiplier and as the meeting of the political bureau of the cpc central committee emphasized the need to strengthen infrastructure construction both central and local government bond issuance quotas will likely be raised to finance the deficit the authorities have shown a preference for maintaining a conventional monetary policy for as long as possible recent statements by senior people s bank of china s officials suggest deep skepticism over the utility and sustainability of quantitative easing and negative interest rates tools that have been commonly used in major advanced economies as such china is unlikely to engage in aggressive monetary easing due to concerns over the already elevated debt level and the diminishing effects of policy loosening on activity in the real economy accommodative monetary policy expected next year we expect monetary policy to be accommodative in 2020 both the reserve requirement ratio rrr and medium term lending facility mlf rate are likely to be cut and the central bank might keep monetary and total social financing growth slightly above nominal gdp growth next year to achieve that it will have to cut the rrr to raise the money multiplier as its balance sheet has not been expanded for a while we forecast three rrr cuts of 50 basis points each or an equivalent liquidity injection through a targeted rrr cut or central bank lending in the first three quarters of 2020 to accommodate government bond issuance and to prevent a crowding out of the private sector in addition to facilitate a decline in the average lending rate the central bank may cut the mlf rate by 10 basis points each in the first and second quarters with pass through to the seven day reverse repo rate and loan prime rate next year will be a year of soft but stabilizing growth for the global economy in our view and we forecast global growth at 3 3 percent for 2020 slightly higher than our 3 1 percent estimate for 2019 industrial inventory likely to bottom out in china infrastructure investment may pick up further supported by fiscal spending faster project approvals and the lowering of the project capital requirement the industrial inventory cycle appears close to bottoming out curbing downside risks to manufacturing investment historical data suggest there is an inventory cycle that lasts three to four years and it has been three and a half years since the last bottom of the cycle besides car sales may become less of a drag on retail sales next year due to recent policies to encourage car purchases automobile sales dropped 9 7 percent year on year in the first 10 months of 2019 because of the expiration of the tax benefit slower home sales and restrictive purchase policies in large cities but since the base effect has waned in recent months sales growth has become less negative and could further pick up next year ding shuang chief economist for greater china and north asia

said his presumption is that ratification would improve business investment sentiment in canada a finalized free trade deal would also follow substandard economic growth or serial disappointment since the global financial crisis hit a decade ago poloz said during his speech population growth has slowed and recent productivity gains have not been big enough to offset this poloz told his audience while there is the potential for greater productivity gains in the future with artificial intelligence and big data based on past experience they could be slow to arrive he said besides the near term risks around productivity growth are actually on the downside today poloz said this is because trade conflicts and the emergence of nationalist or populist policies more generally threaten to reverse some of the prior productivity gains that were made through globalization tariffs are upending existing supply chains and could lead to less efficient ones he continued uncertainty over trade policy and critical institutions such as the world trade organization is weighing on investment plans and economic growth advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the apparent forecast for slow economic growth is likely to mean low interest rates should persist as well poloz added although the governor stressed he was not making a near term prediction about the bank of canada s policy rate in any era interest rates fluctuate around a trend line and that trend line is determined by structural forces not by monetary policy poloz said what i am saying is that in this era it looks like interest rates are likely to fluctuate around historically low levels poloz s comments came after canada shed approximately 71 000 jobs in november which pushed up the unemployment rate to 5 9 per cent poloz though said the one labour report had not dented the bank of canada s confidence in the domestic economy in view of the

in its first meeting under the leadership of christine lagarde the european central bank kept it interest rates unchanged at historic lows of 0 5 percent the decision was largely expected and did little to move currency markets the interest rates will remain at this level until the inflation outlook reaches close to but still below the 2 percent inflation goal the ecb is currently purchasing 20 billion euro of assets monthly with newly created money and today s news release raised expectations for the bank to keep this program running for as long as needed analysts predicted that lagarde would keep rates steady in an effort to avoid deflecting from former ecb head mario draghi s late term policy so early into her tenure at the ecb the dollar surged against the british pound with the sterling falling 0 17 percent against the greenback as of 1 05 p m hk sin the sterling was trading at 1 3171 the dollar was also up against the yen trading 0 06 percent higher at 108 60 the euro maintained its edge over the dollar that began during the asian session trading up 0 03 percent against the dollar to 1 1131 on the commodity markets oil prices headed higher after a day of declines on wednesday u s wti futures were trading up 0 61 percent to 59 12 per barrel while brent crude futures spiked 0 78 percent to 64 22 per barrel gold futures were also higher trading up 0 26 percent to 1 479 40 per ounce these assets are especially sensitive to the trade concerns between the united states and china and with the next tariff deadline approaching traders are mostly staying to the side and waiting to see how u s president donald trump will handle the deadline trump is scheduled to have meetings today with his top trade advisors about whether to remain firm on the deadline or to extend the deadline in the hope of resolving the issues with china a firm deadline will likely send oil prices lower as it can signal a decrease in demand but gold prices will likely head higher as traders will remain worried about global growth prospects if the trade war rages on

it s bad but could be worse and that s good in the middle of october the economics community gathered for its annual parley to discuss the recent past and the path ahead holding court in washington d c the international monetary fund and world bank offered the standard fare of policy outlooks inflation debt and employment along with more interesting morsels empowering women entrepreneurs how to green economics conflict and violence however the week s tone the seasoning if you will had a piquancy to it when the new head of the organisation bulgarian kristalina georgieva pronounced the world s economies still synchronised but that it was no longer a good thing saying growth this year will fall to its lowest rate since the beginning of the decade it has been widely acknowledged that the post 2008 recovery from the great financial crisis has been the weakest of the 74 year post world war ii era thus to recast what georgieva said in starker historical context the most disappointing recovery in four generations is this year anticipated to deliver its worst annual rate of global growth it gives your writer sometimes given the honorary doctorate dr doom no satisfaction in disagreeing with the imf nevertheless a more encouraging constructive outlook for the global economy is reasonable recent data from leading economic indicators sentiment surveys and monetary metrics suggests the rapid deceleration in global economic activity is abating the balance of probabilities now favours surprises to the upside the optimism of the black knight advertisement one can observe improvement in several key areas for example south korean exports why would readers be concerned with what a small country dangling off the far right edge of asia is exporting because as one the world s most complex and largest economies south korean exports say more about the state of the global customer than it says about the nation presently that customer is not buying exports have been negative year over year for 11 months in a row but a second look shows the deep contraction has stopped cutting deeper the situation reminds your writer of a moment from a mid 1970s biographical docudrama regarding the life of arthur pendragon after a melee with king arthur the black knight seeing that his left arm was cut off responded tis but a scratch another leading indicator of future world economic activity is japanese machine tool orders the world s most complex economy and fourth largest exporter by value devoted 36 of its exports in 2017 to machines orders for machine tools are the leading edge of the commitment japanese manufacturers are willing to make in the search of financial return presently japanese manufactures having reviewed their customers conditions are chopping orders with a fervor not seen in over a decade but the rate of deceleration the change in change has slowed to zero data is still dreadful but not getting worse germany s new orders in manufacturing are the last in a triad of real transactions your writer relies on to augur economic tendencies the world s third largest exporter by gross value the country has devoted 47 of the planet s fourth largest economy to selling to the rest of the world the new orders in manufacturing data are available back to 1991 and there have only been two worse periods than the present in that context the present data is daunting not just for germany but for what it says more broadly about the state of the international economy and yet the data has been less bad since may here again the data reads as if it were lifted from brittonic scrolls of the late 5th and early 6th centuries after another scuffle and the loss of his second arm the black knight observed just a flesh wound the pooling of red can also be observed in sentiment data which precedes leading signals of consummated activity surveys of purchasing managers in manufacturing industries are generally across a 20 country sample at a multi year nadir but like markers from south korea japan and germany they have stopped getting worse an even broader amalgamation of sentiment surveys and other leading indicators constructed by the organisation for economic co operation and development across 38 important economies hints at a developing inflection like sentiment and economic statistics monetary measures are also decidedly negative some of the indications are outright alarming spreads in the overnight repurchase agreement market still register spikes indicating the lack of liquidity practically at any price and the market based effective federal funds spread relative to the technocratically determined federal funds target still has brief blowouts indicating that sometimes the federal reserve cannot control its own money market rate that being said both private and public banks are worrying a bit less lately in fact generally speaking the banking barometers have stopped getting worse and started to improve it is not dissimilar in this writer s opinion to the canonical arthurian literature with four appendages forcibly detached the black knight informed king arthur i m invincible always look on the bright side of data does the potential for less worse data signal recovery no because the underlying structural disorder a global monetary shortage remains unaddressed if not recovery then what about a solid reflation i e partial recovery no this also seems improbable how much effort would the business owner wholesaler and capital supplier put into a fourth reflation after the first three were scrapped the green shoots recovery of 2009 10 proved to be weeds when the european sovereign debt crisis struck in 2011 12 the global recovery of 2012 13 was revealed to be neither global nor recovery when the emerging markets roiled in 2014 16 the 2016 17 harmonisation of globally synchronised growth turns out to have been of the oscillating variety with economic momentum now attuned in the negative direction since 2018 the global business outlook survey a decade s long effort by ihs markit the business information company is based on a panel of 12 000 manufacturers and service providers from 7 000 firms and is conducted three times per year the survey shows how each reflation produces lower expectations each one feebler each one less optimistic than the one before thus concerned market participants are left with rebound dignified financial professionals call it a dead cat bounce the business media is predisposed to look on the bright side of economic data and the next wave of positivity appears to be near at hand because the worst impact of this present global downturn was in the fourth quarter of 2018 as the world economy laps this period the year over year comparisons likely will not seem as bad deceleration will slow fears will seem overblown and doomsayers defied an impending swelling chorus by the financial media sirens could lure the unwary onto the rocks with songs of recovery nevertheless in the spirit of thanksgiving canadian and american hanukkah christmas and the new year your writer will make it a point to look on the bright side of economic data it is a philosophy epitomised in the 1979 historical period comedy life of brian by monty python when in a final lyrical scene with all hope lost and death close at hand a character sings if life seems jolly rotten there s something you ve forgotten and that s to laugh and smile and dance and sing when you re feeling in the dumps don t be silly chumps just purse you re lips and whistle that s the thing emil kalinowski cfa is a member of the cfa

so the first year of andrÃ©s manuel lÃ³pez obrador s presidency of mexico has come and gone and there is both much and little to say about it while no major catastrophe has come to pass a bright new future seems more distant than ever he is cruising but his results are desultory according to most polls mr lÃ³pez obrador remains popular on average his approval ratings are in the low 60s roughly where two of his three predecessors vicente fox and felipe calderÃ³n found themselves at the same stage of their terms this is a remarkable feat since his actual performance in the areas that matter to most mexicans is dismal the two most important ones violence and the economy are the worst in years the survival of mexico s recent and precarious democracy is increasingly dim the same mexicans who applaud him personally disbelieve the success of his policies and disapprove of their results mediocre economic growth over the past quarter century contributed decisively to mr lÃ³pez obrador s election averaging less than 1 percent per capita growth annually mexico s economy was unable to lift people out of poverty raise incomes for the lower and middle sectors of society improve health and education or reduce inequality mr lÃ³pez obrador promised 4 percent growth per year in 2019 growth was nil and in 2020 it will barely reach 1 percent according to the most optimistic forecasters given the current fall of investment many believe zero growth next year is a more reasonable estimate

bold move comes as lira stabilises and turkey emerges from recession turkey s central bank surprised observers on thursday by slashing borrowing costs deeply yet again but signalled that the current cycle of bold cuts may be coming to an end as the lira stabilises policymakers slashed a key rate from 14 percent to 12 percent more than many analysts were expecting in its post meeting statement the monetary policy committee suggested its aggressive easing cycle was nearing an end as inflation levels off and as the economy emerges from recession thursday s cut brings turkish real rates adjusted for inflation below the levels in most emerging markets at this point the current monetary policy stance is considered to be consistent with the projected disinflation path the bank said after its policy meeting turkish inflation has dropped from a peak above 25 percent in last year s painful currency crisis but after touching single digits in recent months it edged up to 10 6 percent in november central bank governor murat uysal has said policy is tailored to leave a reasonable real rate on the underlying inflation trend the bank began slashing rates in july having raised the key rate to 24 percent in september of last year when the economy tipped into recession after three consecutive quarters of contraction turkey s economy grew 0 9 percent year on year in the third quarter shaking off the impact of a near 30 percent slide in the lira s value last year the lira was little changed on thursday it stood at 5 7865 against the united states dollar at 12 34 gmt compared to 5 7850 before the policy announcement it was more than 0 2 percent firmer on the day more rate cuts are coming unless we reach a point where the market pushes back strongly said piotr matys emerging markets forex strategist at rabobank the fourth consecutive easing comes a day after washington moved a step closer to imposing sanctions on turkey over its military action in syria and its purchase of russian made missile defences if applied sanctions could spark another bout of lira weakness curb the country s economic recovery and force the central bank to contemplate rate hikes despite pressure from the government president recep tayyip erdogan has repeatedly called for lower rates and on monday said the policy rate as well as inflation will hit single digits in 2020 erdogan ousted the former central bank chief in july after the two apparently clashed over the pace of interest rate cuts since taking the reins as central bank chief uysal has presided over an easing cycle that has far eclipsed expectations earlier in the year the bank has turned to other tools to help spur loan growth and reach the government s aggressive five percent economic growth target for next year last week it said it will use required reserves in an effective and flexible way in 2020 as a fine tuning tool so called base effect distortions have pulled down inflation readings after last year s spike in prices muddying the picture for a country in which annual food inflation was nine percent last month but 26 percent a year earlier the big question right now is what is the underlying rate of inflation said kieran curtis at aberdeen standard investments the central bank will hold monthly policy meetings next year up from eight in 2019 the us federal reserve s shift to lower interest rates which weakens the dollar has helped stabilise the lira this year clearing the way for turkey to dramatically slash borrowing costs but the fed held rates steady at its policy meeting this week and signalled there likely won t be a change in interest rate policy until 2021

word bank and federal government estimate that nearly 90 million people fall below the poverty line in the country at a baseline of 1 90 684 naira a day representing 45 of the population the highest ratio relative to population in all of the known universe last year nigeria overtook india as the country with the largest number of people living in extreme poverty a new world bank report released on december 2 2019 warns that nigeria will have 25 of world s poor without reforms and could slip into another recession if crude oil price drops 25 the economy is expected to expand 2 1 in 2020 and 2021 while the growth rate increases by 2 6 world bank projects that at the current trajectory by 2030 the number of nigerians living in extreme poverty could increase by more than 30 million the raging question then is how did the country fall so drastically into this conundrum within a short period of time and what are the measures to adopt to reverse the trend and bend the poverty curve downwards the unavoidable devaluation of the currency from n140 to 1 in 2014 to n360 to 1 in 2016 invariably swept nearly 36 million people below the poverty line by default the recessionary pressure that forced government s hand increased poverty rate by 72 ab initio and it s been a difficult climb out of the ditch ever since that said the simplest way out would have been currency revaluation but given the existing economic fundamentals that option is unsustainable and if currency revaluation is off the table then some other options have to take its place on it a notable option is to phase out the current fuel refined petroleum products subsidy regime and front load the subsidy into crude oil supply to local refineries to bring down refining cost and subsequently pump price fuel subsidy policy is a sensitive political and economic issue and successive administrations often steer clear from proposing bold policy prescription to rein in the massive drain to the financial health of the country fuel subsidy program is without question a real damper on the economic growth of the country a self evident truth one would say however given the political risk and the attendant economic disruption a sudden removal of such subsidy will present conventional wisdom always tilts in the direction of caution and this political calculation has limited government s ability to come up with big and bold ideas for lasting solution truth be told these are extraordinary times and extraordinary measures are appropriate to roll back the scourge of poverty in the country full disclosure while this is not an attempt to join the pressure campaign of organizations like imf and world bank that keep advocating for fuel subsidy removal out of lack of basic understanding of the unique set of circumstances the country faces it is a call for repurposing the subsidy from the front end of the supply chain to the back end of it advertisement to be clear all developed economies in the world have varying degrees of subsidy in place in critical sectors of their economy the us gives over 86b annually as farm subsidy to support food security and nutritional assistance to people in need likewise china supports manufacturing sector by offering more than 1t in financing and subsidies and at no time had imf or world bank admonished either of these countries to drop such government s initiatives and interventions so any self serving demand that nigeria drop fuel subsidy regime reeks of calculated and targeted hypocrisy because in nigeria fuel subsidy is more than just an economic necessity it is arguably the most consequential policy that separates the nation from chaos one good news coming out of the country is the near completion of dangote refinery in lagos with installed capacity to process 650 000 barrels of crude oil per day folks that s a massive production capacity and if national planners can harness this incredible crude oil processing plant and make it the central hub of economic growth prosperity may subdue poverty over time and the resulting economic security can displace all forms of insecurity bedeviling the nation in short order to accentuate the tremendous economic benefit of this project to the overall economic growth of the country it is apt to describe with granularity the petroleum refining process cost of production and distribution of the product taxes and other relevant information a barrel of oil is equivalent of 42 gallons or 159 liters of the product and in every 159 liter barrel of crude oil 73 liters of gasoline petrol 35 liters of diesel 20 liters of jet fuel heavy fuel 6 liters 142 200 btu of propane gas and 34 liters of other products like butane kerosene asphalt and sulfur can be produced also the refining cost of a barrel of crude oil in percentage is classified as follows cost of crude 48 51 refining 23 taxes 18 distribution and marketing 8 10 from the cost breakdown it is clear that the bulk of the overall refining cost is on the cost of crude oil and therein lies the opportunity to perform a subtle tweak to the overall cost curve advertisement on average close to 60 million liters of petroleum products are used up on a daily basis in the country which comes to about 450 000 barrels per day according to opec nigeria produces between 1 8m bbls off peak and 2 2m bbls per day outside of this opec allocation quota there is excess capacity production of about 500 000 bbls per day that nnpc has in stock on a rolling basis allocated for domestic consumption also the cost of extracting a barrel of crude oil from an oilfield in nigeria is between 15 and 22 and the current brent price hovers around 70 bbl so there s a profit margin of between 40 and 55 for every barrel produced because most oilfields in nigeria are joint venture projects with international oil companies iocs typically on a 60 40 profit sharing basis nnpc makes 60 cents on a dollar of the profit based on the current profit profile nnpc makes minimum of 24 per barrel translating to a minimum of 48m 1 7b naira per day in profit at 2 million bbls daily production and as identified above nnpc holds a floating excess production capacity of around 500 000 bbls which are sold to off takers like vitol trafigura and 13 other companies in exchange for refined petroleum products under an arrangement known as direct sale and direct purchase dsdp few of these companies have their own refineries therefore cannot optimize refining cost of the products to lower production cost and have to buy at prevailing global prices a weakened naira is another factor contributing to the high landing cost of the product practically speaking dsdp awardees have no other choice but to sell the products back to nnpc at higher landing cost hence the main reason why fuel subsidy regime persists and remain indispensable to the country s economic model nnpc has been fortunate that the price of crude oil is still below 70 any significant spike in global price will undoubtedly make the subsidy regime practically unsustainable having burrowed into the basics of the oil production refining and marketing structure this working knowledge can then be exploited to offer reasonable solution to the fuel subsidy crisis if nnpc produces excess capacity of about 500 000 bbls of crude oil per day and nigeria uses minimum 445 000 bbls of crude oil per day and has a refinery with a capacity to refine 650 000 bbls of crude oil per day then it can be projected that the fuel subsidy regime can be gradually phased out with minimum fuss or disruption to the economic or political situation of the country and here is the working theory let s assume that nnpc sells the excess capacity of 500 000 bbls to dangote refinery at 67 5 of platts price and get dangote refinery to sell the big 3 refined petroleum products pms ago dpk back to nnpc at 75 of the current pump price of n145 liter the pump price of gasoline can drop by 12 5 15 after accounting for distribution and marketing cost which is about 10 to keep this in perspective it costs approximately 2 bbl to ship petroleum products from loading port to destination port and for 500 000 bbls day domestic consumption it translates into 1m per day and 365m 366m per year just for transporting the products to the country from source if all domestic fuel consumption is processed locally then the shipping cost is eliminated saving nnpc a total of 365m 131b naira per non leap year before anyone says this isn t feasible let s do the math together here first nnpc selling excess capacity to dangote refinery doesn t impact government revenue in any material way since national budget is based on a revenue stream from opec quota only which will not be affected in this sort of arrangement second the ioc s profit of about 40 is still intact while selling at 32 5 discount it is the nnpc that will have to take 10 profit to make this work and forgoing 32 5 margin that would have accrued if product is sold at full price as profit to nnpc now becomes the new crude oil subsidy to replace the current refined petroleum products subsidy regime the beauty of this strategy is the fact that government wouldn t have to budget funds for this subsidy because it s frontloaded and it s essentially a cost of doing business if greed at the top level of nnpc echelon and the presidency will not stand in the way then this can be considered a viable solution to the existential threat to the national financial health occasioned by the fuel subsidy boondoggle third dangote refinery will make sizable profit even if it sells refined products like gasoline pms diesel ago and kerosene dpk at 75 of today s pump price and here s why as stated earlier about 50 of the refining cost is due to the cost of crude oil alone and only 23 is chewed up by the actual refining process itself so if nnpc and dangote refinery enter into such an arrangement the cost of refining a barrel of crude oil by the refinery will drop by at least 25 keep in mind that other products like jet fuel asphalt heavy base oil petrochemical derivatives are produced in the same barrel and the refinery is allowed to sell those products at 100 global market price in addition there is another 200 000 bbls day that the refinery can still absorb for export only this 200 000 bbls are to be sold to the refinery at platts price with nominal discount as typical only gasoline diesel and kerosene are to be sold back to nnpc at 75 of today s pump price selling other products at 100 will ensure the refinery operates at reasonable profit while also bailing the country out of a financial mess in the process to further incentivize the refinery government can mandate the works ministry to insert a clause in every road project contracts that minimum of 75 asphalt bitumen to be used on all new roads and resurfacing in the country must be sourced locally this way we boost the economy by being cyclical in our approach to national resources and looping the system fundamentally in critical sectors of the economy now how does this concept dovetail into the anti poverty programs already in place as earlier noted the devaluation of naira by nearly 200 caused a 72 spike in poverty rate and to really address the issue the strength of the currency cannot be overlooked and it begins with reducing both the cost and volume of fuel importation into the country once dangote refinery comes online government can begin to save over 3 6b 1 3t naira that s currently being spent on fuel subsidy fuel subsidy alone is about 15 of the national budget of 8 6t naira that s a ridiculous amount to be bleeding out of an economy on a yearly basis and the outrage ought to be universal across the country if fuel importation dials down to almost zero naira automatically appreciates in value by at least 20 a 20 improvement in currency strength lifts 6 6 million people out of poverty in a whiff the savings made by the subsidy removal can then be cycled back into the economy with a laser focus on poverty amelioration in the short term and near total eradication of the scourge in the long term according to the un the basic necessities of life are food clothing and shelter and if the country is serious about reducing poverty then cheap food items and affordable housing need to be at the front and center of government s policies advertisement one of the primary effects of a 12 5 15 reduction in the pump price of gasoline and diesel is the corresponding decrease in transportation cost across the country if there s a noticeable drop in transportation cost then food items cost will follow and the effects will trickle down to every other aspect of the economy another effect is the improvement in disposable income of the population thereby boosting the purchasing power of the people for instance an average household will have 5 to 10 more money to spend on food and other life s necessities that directly improve their well being rather than waste on transportation cost and inflated market price for basic needs more money in people s pockets translates into a vibrant local economy from the rural areas to the cities as more and more people have a little bit more to spend on tangibles to put hard numbers on it if 50 million working adults in the country on a conservative estimate save 10 naira on transportation related cost per business day for 260 business days in a year the economy will receive 130b naira in direct spending on other essentials that would have otherwise frittered away into intangibles the multiplier effect of this economic stimulus can be profound and significant in the overarching poverty alleviation policy with savings made through the elimination of the fuel subsidy about 50 of the 3 6b can be invested in food security and nutritional assistance to the populace there s a saying on my side of the rainbow that if lack of food is taken out of poverty the effect of poverty naturally abates one bright spot of the economy is agro business which accounts for about 24 4 of the gdp and if government can turbocharge this sector by channeling substantial resources from the fuel subsidy savings then broad based and shared prosperity is within reach if this sector can expand to account for 35 of the gdp in the next 5 years then an additional 40 million jobs would have been added to the economy from agro business alone a 1 gdp increase as a share of the economy in agriculture supports over 4 million new direct and indirect jobs agriculture food and related industries contributed 1 053t to us gdp in 2017 a 5 4 share of the overall gdp to put in proper context us agricultural sector supports 21 6 million full and part time jobs representing 11 of total us employment if a country that practices high end technology and advanced mechanized farming can generate 21 6 million jobs at just 5 4 of the gdp one can only imagine the sheer magnitude of jobs that can be supported by agriculture in nigeria once the people transition from survival mode to productive and investment mode the natural order of peace security tolerance and love of country automatically kicks in government has a significant role to play to beat back the ravaging hunger and pervasive poverty in the land by refocusing on the basic needs necessary for basic human dignity the other 50 can then be spent on infrastructure education and primary health care facilities advertisement in closing there s a useful management tool called the boston matrix that can help planners prioritize government s or organization s interventions to derive maximum effect a literal bang for every buck the tool breaks cost and corresponding impact into 4 quadrants low cost low impact high cost high impact high cost low impact and low cost high impact every planner is advised to always start a project on the low cost high impact side of the matrix first unfortunately the poverty alleviation policies of the country is heavy on high cost low impact column and that s one of the reasons these programs are yet to make any meaningful impact on people s lives the fuel subsidy regime is a high cost low impact proposition and it s time to move away from that idea and consider the low cost high impact of crude oil subsidy instead because it is the right thing to do while dangote refinery is expected to be commissioned by the end of 2020 and production to follow sequentially now is the time for nnpc and presidency to put a policy structure in place to evaluate analyze and calibrate the pace and sequence of weaning the nation s economy off the fuel subsidy teats existing refineries in port harcourt warri and kaduna should also be revamped to support the new refinery by acting as a buffer whenever dangote refinery is offline for routine shutdown maintenance and can be used as a redundancy system to keep supply undisrupted with their production capacities in the event that local refineries cannot come online fast enough by december 2020 then nnpc can revise the current dsdp program to go full blown barter system by 2021 in this case nnpc sells crude oil at 35 discount of dated brent price to dsdp participants and in return they supply refined products at 85 of the current pump price at the ports hence the need for subsidy to avoid pump price hike ceases to exist if this course of action is adopted and well executed then come 2023 nigeria would have become a net exporter of refined petroleum products and a more vibrant economy that s capable of lifting millions out of poverty so let s roll up our sleeves and get to work because when we collectively put our shoulders to the wheel of progress and push in lock step it moves forward change doesn t just roll in on the wheel of inevitability rather it takes common purpose and conscious effort to make it a reality kenny oladipo houston tx kindodey a reliability
