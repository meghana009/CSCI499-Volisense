following statements regarding important events that have occurred during the year on pages 4 to 5 chairman s statement overview by any standards 2018 was an extraordinary year with a confluence of major events and trends in world affairs creating a complex backdrop against which business operated trade wars rising us interest rates a slowdown in chinese and european growth growing populism and of course the uncertainties around the process of the uk planning to leave the european union provided a challenging macroeconomic and political backdrop for all business leaders throughout the year i am pleased to report that london stock exchange group successfully managed through this environment with income up 9 adjusted earnings per share up 17 and a proposed dividend of 60 4 pence per share up 17 as the group continued to deliver strong results it also pursued strategic initiatives in december the group increased its interest in lch to 82 6 while maintaining its customer partnership approach i am pleased to report also that lch skilfully navigated the complexities of the risk of a no deal brexit in a way that put its clients interests first as well as supporting financial stability of the market as a whole as a result lch informed its members that it intends to continue to offer all clearing services for all products and services to all members and clients after 29 march 2019 our members and clients will continue to benefit from the capital efficiencies of a global service lseg continues to believe that enhanced regulatory supervision and regulation on a global scale will far outweigh any short term political benefits of fragmenting financial markets which would introduce unnecessary risk into the financial system and undo much of the global regulation which was introduced post 2008 to make our markets more efficient stable and safe governance during the first half of the year the group was led by david warren who combined his role as cfo with that of interim ceo his collegiate approach and personal flexibility ensured that the group lost no momentum and i should like to record my gratitude and that of the board to him for his excellent work we were joined by david schwimmer in august as our new ceo he was chosen by the board from a selection of excellent candidates after an extensive search the board was impressed by david s deep knowledge of market infrastructure his evident intellect and clarity of thought and his understated style and collaborative mindset his first months in post have validated the board s choice and he has provided excellent leadership during this complex time period during 2018 we also welcomed several new non executive directors to our board marshall bailey was appointed chairman of lch group succeeding professor lex hoogduin who remains chairman of lch s two operating subsidiaries marshall joined the boards of lch group and lseg and brings banking and regulatory skills to the roles we also welcomed

schapiro and david nish both left the board in 2018 and on behalf of the board i would like to thank them for the valuable roles they both performed during a busy time for the board i am delighted

our wider commitment to supporting a culture that reflects the diversity of our customers and communities in which we operate around the world i will retire from the board this year it has been a privilege to chair this excellent group and it is with considerable regret that i stand down after the agm however it is important to honour the promise i made in 2017 to our shareholders don robert

core part of the capital raising and investment decisions we also continue to work with global and regional charities which help disadvantaged young people in the communities in which we operate in 2018 the group s foundation donated 1 3 million to various charities and our colleagues also were encouraged to volunteer through two paid volunteer days offered to every employee culture in the last year there have been a number of initiatives in the area of corporate governance culminating in the publication of the revised uk corporate governance code the code makes reference to the need for boards to consider carefully the culture of the company during the past year we have worked with the executive team to develop ways to ensure that we set the tone for appropriate collaboration and customer focused behaviours as well as monitor our culture on an ongoing basis we have had excellent support from the ceo in this endeavour and have introduced a 360 degree appraisal process as well as other feedback mechanisms detailed elsewhere in this report conclusion london stock exchange group is in robust health in a sector with much opportunity there will be a need to remain selective in the opportunities the group pursues to ensure a continuing focus on shareholder returns while also recognising the wider role the group plays in the financial system with its strong presence in the eu sitting also at the heart of the world s major international financial market and with its focus on customer partnership open access and innovation i believe the group faces a very bright future it has excellent people with which to capitalise on the opportunities ahead and i thank them for their support and wish them continued success sir donald brydon cbe chairman 1 march 2019 the annual report contains the following statements regarding principal risks and uncertainties facing the business with respect to principal strategic financial and operational risks on pages 48 to 57 and with respect to financial risk management on pages 133 to 137 the management of risk is fundamental to the successful execution of our strategic plan and to the resilience of our operations during 2018 the

economy as a diversified markets infrastructure business we operate in a broad range of equity fixed income and derivative markets servicing clients who increasingly seek global products and solutions if the global economy underperforms lower activity in our markets may lead to lower revenue economic data and inflation concerns have dominated central bank official rate actions the federal open market committee fomc increased the fed funds target rate 4 times during 2018 in november the bank of england boe increased the bank rate to 0 75 meanwhile the european central bank ecb has left rates unchanged at zero and has announced that its quantitative easing programme will end by the end of 2018 the expected economic growth could fail to materialise and higher rates could lead to a slowdown ongoing geopolitical tensions continue to add uncertainty in the markets which may impact confidence and activity levels this is being be monitored closely the footprint of the group continues to broaden further improving the geographical diversification of the group s income streams which serves to mitigate the risks of a localised economic downturn furthermore income streams across the business divisions of the group comprise annuity and fee based recurring revenues to balance against more cyclical and market driven activity the group performs regular analysis to monitor the markets and the potential impacts of market price movements on the business activities include key risk indicator tracking stress testing and hedging we continue to actively monitor the ongoing developments following the result of the uk referendum on leaving the eu committees have been established to assess and address areas of impact on our operations and the group has formulated contingency plans with the objectives of continuity of market function and customer service in the event of a hard no deal brexit the financial risk committee closely monitors and analyses multiple market stress scenarios and action plans in order to minimise any impacts stemming from a potential deterioration of the macroeconomic environment the stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated in response to changes in macroeconomic conditions additional ad hoc analysis such as special credit reviews of counterparties are presented to the financial risk committee for consideration where events dictate increasing for more information see market trends and our response pages 14 17 and note 3 to the accounts financial risk management on pages 133 137 regulatory change and compliance the group and its exchanges other trading venues ccps index administrators central securities depositories trade repositories and other regulated entities operate in areas that are highly regulated by governmental competition and other regulatory bodies brexit the uk vote in 2016 to leave the eu introduced significant uncertainty concerning the political and regulatory environment the uk s future relationship with the eu and the overall impact on the uk and european economies both in the short and medium term negotiations between the uk and the eu continue but the uk s final exit terms are unclear the lack of agreement between the uk and the eu increases the risk of a no deal scenario the effects of brexit including those that may follow an extension to the article 50 process are uncertain and could adversely affect the group s businesses operations financial condition and cash flows lseg companies conducting regulated activities in the eu or with customers in the eu are subject to eu regulation the group is executing contingency plans to maintain continuity of service to customers and orderly functioning of its markets including incorporation of new entities in the eu27 and applications for authorisation within the eu27 for certain group businesses the group also has a structured brexit programme to engage with uk eu and us brexit policy leads to advise on financial market infrastructure considerations however the complexity and the lack of clarity of the application of a hard brexit may decrease the effectiveness or applicability of some of these contingency plans as is the case with all change these contingency plans introduce some execution risk regulation impacting ccps regulatory initiatives with the potential to impact cleared derivatives markets and ccps continue through international standard setters and regulators in the eu and us and other major jurisdictions our primary focus remains on development of a coherent cross border regulatory framework for market access to global ccps including appropriate access rules under the emir review likely to be finalised in h1 2019 as part of this review emir 2 2 introduces the option to impose enhanced supervision or deny the recognition of third country ccps that are of systemic importance for the eu which could have implications for the group s ccps proper calibration of eu rules on ccp recovery and resolution and harmonisation with other key jurisdictions is also a key priority and could likely have an impact on the group s ccps mifid ii mifir together with mifir its accompanying regulation mifid ii came into force on 3 january 2018 lseg delivered a series of key technological and procedural changes to prepare for smooth implementation esma has signalled that reviewing the implementation of mifid ii r is a priority and it is likely to propose amendments with potential impacts on the group particularly in the areas of trading transparency and market data the third country access rules for trading venues and market participants continue to be evaluated in 2019 and could also have a potential to impact access to our trading venues in the uk and eu prudential capital rules in december 2017 the basel committee on banking supervision bcbs published final recommendations on the basel iii framework which as currently drafted could adversely impact the cleared derivatives industry one area of primary importance is the treatment of customer margin under the leverage ratio bcbs is considering reviewing its approach on this issue which would be a positive development for market participants and therefore the group the european commission also proposed a prudential regime for investment firms which may affect the ability of proprietary trading firms to provide liquidity on lseg markets however the nature of final political agreement on the proposal is highly uncertain regulatory change and compliance continued benchmark regulation regulatory focus on the role of benchmarks in the market and regulation of benchmark providers continues to increase in several major jurisdictions around the world ftse international limited was authorised by the uk s financial conduct authority fca in 2018 as a benchmark administrator under the european benchmark regulation in may 2018 the european commission proposed several sustainable finance legislative proposals which could potentially impact sustainable indices benchmark administrators located outside of the eu will likely have to elect an established method for eu users to access their benchmarks after the bmr transitional period ends this year financial transactions tax ftt some eu member states are considering a possible financial transaction tax ftt which could adversely impact volumes in financial markets during 2018 little progress was made but efforts continue to finalise the measure information and cyber security standards in many of our key regulatory jurisdictions there is an increasing legislative and regulatory focus on cyber security and data protection which could impact our operations and compliance models lseg supports the regulatory efforts on these issues as they increase the standards for clients vendors and other third parties with whom we interact we continue to support regional and global efforts to harmonise these standards to avoid conflicting or duplicative requirements for market infrastructure providers and our market participants regulation of emerging technology regulators are considering the application of existing or new frameworks around the development of innovative financial services technologies which are important for maintaining the resilience in the market and allowing innovation with emerging technology we are monitoring these efforts closely as they have potential to impact industry behaviour and potential application of emerging technology to our businesses changes in the regulatory environment form a key input into our strategic planning including the political impact on our growth strategies both organic and inorganic we monitor regulatory developments continually and engage directly with regulatory and governmental authorities at local regional and national levels the group has developed contingency plans to address the uk s exit from the eu and monitors developments closely we continue to develop our relationships with the key government and regulatory stakeholders in all relevant jurisdictions potential impacts from regulatory change are assessed and depending on the impact opportunities are developed and mitigating strategies and actions are planned and executed as the various regulatory initiatives progress there will be greater certainty with regard to their likely final form the group continues to focus on remaining well positioned to respond to regulatory developments and further opportunities exist for the group to deliver solutions to help the market address the changing regulatory environment including those linked with the departure of the uk from the eu the group continues to maintain systems and controls to mitigate compliance risk compliance policies and procedures are regularly reviewed to ensure that group entities and staff are compliant with applicable laws and regulations and uphold our corporate standards all staff across the group are subject to mandatory compliance

has been recognised by esma as a third country ccp under article 25 of emir this recognition will apply from 30 march 2019 until 30 march 2020 in the absence of a withdrawal agreement with the uk in accordance with article 50 2 of the treaty on european union this recognition confirms lch ltd s ability to continue to offer all clearing services for all products and services to all members and clients after 29 march 2019 in a no deal brexit scenario lch reserves its right to take any action it considers appropriate at any time should there be a material change in circumstances in addition lch sa and cc g are allowed under the bank of england temporary recognition regime trr to clearing services and activities in the uk for up to 3 years in a no deal scenario in june 2018 turquoise global holdings europe b v submitted an application for authorisation as an investment firm to operate a multilateral trading facility mtf in the netherlands similarly also in june 2018 unavista tradecho b v submitted an application for authorisation as a data reporting services provider drsp in the netherlands under which it will operate an approved reporting mechanism arm and an approved publication arrangement apa both applications are in advanced stages and we anticipate receiving regulatory authorisations imminently in addition mts has established 2 mtf markets in italy to replace certain markets operated by euromts in the uk potential impacts from regulatory change are assessed and depending on the impact opportunities are developed and mitigating strategies and actions are

laws and regulations and uphold our corporate standards all staff across the group are subject to mandatory compliance training increasing for more information on regulatory changes see market trends and our response on pages 14 17 competition the group operates in a highly competitive and global industry continued consolidation has fuelled competition including between peers and service providers in different geographical areas the group s information services business faces competition from a variety of sources notably from index providers which offer indices and other benchmarking tools which compete with those offered by the group as well as from other venues that offer market data relating to securities that are traded on the group s equity markets as the information services offering diversifies and seeks to meet customer needs for new data sources segments and asset classes it is facing a broader range of competitors in post trade services we continue to see increased clearing activity of otc derivative products across a number of asset classes reflecting the attractiveness of the group s current customer offering and open access philosophy however competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changing market conditions or develop products that are preferred by customers the group s track record of working with customers and other financial market infrastructure providers including the user focused model in lch will help us to continue to deliver innovative new products and services to seek to meet evolving customer needs our capital markets operations face continuing risk from competitors commercial and technological offerings there is strong competition for primary listings and capital raises from other global exchanges and regional centres private equity venture capital and new options such as crowd funding and crypto currencies are increasingly being considered as alternatives methods of capital formation for issuers we maintain a dedicated international team who promote the benefits of listing on our markets to international issuers the global advisory community and other stakeholders the group will need to continue strong and collaborative dialogue with customers and other relevant industry stakeholders to ensure it remains responsive to changing requirements and is able to react in a timely manner if competitors are quicker to access and deploy technology innovations such as artificial intelligence ai machine learning and analytics they may achieve a valuable advantage which may impact the attractiveness of the group s offering and its relative profitability our integrated and business led approach to technology innovation help us to manage this risk and the group is well advanced in investigating and applying numerous new technology innovations across its business portfolio in technology services there is intense competition across all our current activities and in some of our growth areas in addition to strong incumbent providers new entrants are increasing from both within and outside of our traditional competition base and some consolidation is evident start ups which may be sponsored by existing lseg competitors or customers are introducing new technology and commercial models to our customer base to which we need to respond with new products and services of our own continual client dialogue facilitated through our partnership approach and investment in product management and innovation are critical to understanding and managing the impact of changing customer requirements in our technology and other business lines competitive markets are by their very nature dynamic and the effects of competitor activity can never be fully mitigated senior management and a broad range of customer facing staff in all business areas are actively engaged with clients to understand their evolving needs and motivations we have established a group relationship programme to co ordinate this across group businesses globally the group undertakes constant market monitoring and pricing revision to mitigate risks and ensure we are competitive commercial initiatives are aligned with our clients and this is complemented by an ongoing focus on technology operations and innovation static transformation the group is exposed to transformation risks risk of loss or failure resulting from business integration transformation or integration this derives from internal organic change and change required by the integration of acquisitions whereby the group targets specific synergy benefits necessitating change to operating models business models technology and people a failure to successfully align the businesses of the group may lead to an increased cost base without a commensurate increase in revenue a failure to capture future product and market opportunities and risks in respect of capital requirements regulatory relationships and management time the additional effort related to m a and post transaction alignment activities could have an adverse impact on the group s day to day performance and or key strategic initiatives which could damage the group s reputation and financial performance the size and complexity of acquisitions in the past 6 years have increased the group s change management and transformation risks however it allows the group to compete on a global scale and it has diversified its revenue footprint by industry product and customer base the group s exposure to transformation risk is mitigated through the application of the group s enterprise risk management framework ermf to deploy consistent appropriate risk management across the group both during and post acquisition the governance of the group following a merger or acquisition is aligned and strengthened as appropriate oversight during transformation is provided by a steering committee comprising executive committee members and chaired by the chief financial officer with reports to the board risk committee and the board the group has an effective track record of integrating acquisitions and delivering tangible synergies supported by robust governance and programme management structures through the group s change framework to mitigate change related risks increasing reputation brand a number of the group s businesses have iconic national brands that are well recognised at international as well as at national levels the strong reputation of the group s businesses and their valuable brand names are a key selling point any events or actions that damage the reputation or brands of the group such as those propagated via social media or caused by its misuse could adversely affect the group s business financial condition and operating results failure to protect the group s intellectual property rights adequately could result in costs for the group negatively impact the group s reputation and affect the ability of the group to compete effectively further defending or enforcing the group s intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources which could adversely affect the group s business financial condition and operating results lseg has policies and procedures in place which are designed to ensure the appropriate use of the group s brands and to maintain the integrity of the group s reputation lseg actively monitors the use of its brands and other intellectual property including monitoring for internet brand impersonation and social media sentiment in order to prevent identify and address any infringements the group protects its intellectual property by relying upon a combination of trademark laws copyright laws patent laws trade secret protection confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with its affiliates clients customers suppliers strategic partners and others static financial risks the risk of financial failure reputational loss loss of earnings and or capital as a result of investment activity lack of liquidity funding or capital and or the inappropriate recording reporting and disclosure of financial results taxation or regulatory information risk description mitigation risk level credit risk clearing ccps in the group are exposed to credit risk as a result of their clearing activities a default by a ccp clearing member that could not be managed within the resources of the defaulted clearing member could adversely affect that ccp s revenues and its customers reputation ccps authorised in the eu are required to make a proportion of their regulatory capital available to cover default losses after the defaulter s resources have been exhausted and prior to allocation of losses to non defaulters and so in extreme circumstances a default could lead to a call on the group ccps own capital skin in the game ccps may also be exposed to credit exposure to providers of infrastructure services such as central securities depositaries csds and commercial banks providing investment and operational services in addition certain ccps within the group have interoperability margin arrangements with other ccps requiring collateral to be exchanged in proportion to the value of the underlying transactions the relevant clearing provider entities within the group are therefore exposed to the risk of a default of other ccps under such arrangements non clearing ccps and other parts of lseg group are also exposed to credit risk as a result of placing money with investment counterparties on both a secured and unsecured basis losses may occur due to the default of either the investment counterparty or of the issuer of bonds bought outright or received as collateral the group s credit risk also relates to its customers and counterparties being unable to meet their obligations to the group either in part or in full clearing as ccp members continue to work towards strengthening of their balance sheets the risk to lseg ccps of a member default reduces although continuing geopolitical uncertainty continues and the banking sectors of some countries remain stressed the financial risks associated with clearing operations are further mitigated by strict ccp membership rules including supervisory capital financial strength and operational capability the maintenance of prudent levels of margin and default funds to cover exposures to participants members deposit margin computed at least daily to cover the expected costs which the clearing service would incur in closing out open positions in a volatile market in the event of the member s default a default fund sized to cover the default of the 2 members with the largest exposures in each service using a suite of extreme but plausible stress tests mutualises losses in excess of margin amongst the clearing members regular fire drills are carried out to test the operational soundness of the ccps default management processes infrastructure providers are regularly assessed in line with policy non clearing policies are in place to ensure that investment counterparties are of good credit quality and at least 95 of ccp commercial bank deposits are secured ccp and non ccp counterparty concentration risk is consolidated and monitored daily at the group level and reported to the executive committee and to the board risk committee including limits and status rating group companies make a judgement on the credit quality of their customers based upon the customer s financial position the recurring nature of billing and collection arrangements and historically a low incidence of default static for more information on this risk see the post trade services section of the segmental review on pages 26 28 and note 3 to the accounts financial risk management on pages 133 137 market risk clearing the group s ccps assume the counterparty risk for all transactions that are cleared through their markets in the event of default of their clearing members therefore credit risk will manifest itself as market risk as this market risk is only present in the event of default this is referred to as latent market risk the latent market risk includes interest rate risk foreign exchange risk equity risk and commodity price risk as well as country risk issuer risk and concentration risk this risk is greater if market conditions are unfavourable at the time of the default non clearing the group is exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of its broadening geographical footprint there are however also benefits of global diversification including reduced exposure to local events such as the uk brexit vote and the geopolitical tensions the group is exposed to interest rate risk through its borrowing activities and treasury investments further changes in interest rates in 2019 may increase the group s exposure to these risks clearing the margins and default funds referred to previously are sized to protect against latent market risk the adequacy of these resources is evaluated daily by subjecting member and customer positions to extreme but plausible stress scenarios encapsulating not only historical crises but theoretical forward looking scenarios and decorrelation events all our ccps are compliant with the appropriate regulatory requirements regarding margin calculations capital and default rules latent market risk is monitored and managed on a day to day basis by the risk teams within the clearing services committees overseeing market risks meet on a regular basis non clearing foreign exchange fx risk is monitored closely and translation risk is managed by matching the currency of the group s debt to its earnings to protect key ratios and partially hedge currency net assets fx derivatives including cross currency swaps are used under a control framework governed by lseg board approved policy the split between floating and fixed debt is managed to support the group s target of maintaining an interest coverage ratio that underpins a good investment grade credit rating authorised derivatives can be used to transform fixed rate bond debt to supplement a mix of short dated commercial paper and floating rate loan borrowings to achieve the group s policy objective static for more information on this risk see note 3 to the accounts financial risk management on pages 133 137 liquidity risk clearing there are 2 distinct types of risk to which the group s ccps are exposed to that are commonly referred to as liquidity risk market liquidity risk and funding liquidity risk the former is the risk that it may be difficult or expensive to liquidate a large or concentrated position and is addressed under market risk the latter is the risk that the ccp may not have enough cash to pay variation margin to non defaulters or to physically settle securities delivered by a non defaulter that cannot be on sold to a defaulter and this is the subject of this section the group s ccps collect clearing members margin and or default funds contributions in cash and or in highly liquid securities to maintain sufficient ongoing liquidity and immediate access to funds the group s ccps deposit the cash received in highly liquid and secure investments such as sovereign bonds and reverse repos as mandated under emir securities deposited by clearing members are therefore held in dedicated accounts with csds and or international central securities depositaries icsds the group s ccps also hold a small proportion of their investments in unsecured bank and money market deposits subject to the limitations imposed by emir the successful operation of these investment activities is contingent on general market conditions and there is no guarantee that such investments may be exempt from market losses non clearing liquidity risk in a non clearing context is the risk that the firm may be unable to make payments as they fall due clearing the group s ccps have put in place regulatory compliant liquidity plans for day to day liquidity management including contingencies for stressed conditions the group s ccps have multiple layers of defence against liquidity shortfalls including intraday margin calls minimum cash balances access to contingent liquidity arrangements and for certain ccps access to central bank liquidity under the ermf ccp investments must be made in compliance with the group ccp financial risk policy as well as the policies of the ccps themselves these policies stipulate a number of risk management standards including investment limits secured and unsecured and liquidity coverage ratios committees overseeing ccp investment risk meet regularly each ccp monitors its liquidity needs daily under stressed and unstressed assumptions and reports to the group financial risk committee each month non clearing requirements for liquidity including headroom requirements are set out in the group s board approved treasury policy the group maintains appropriately sized liquidity facilities and monitors its requirements on an ongoing basis stressed facility headroom is assessed using plausible downside business projections group treasury risk is monitored daily and is managed within the constraints of a board approved policy by the group treasury team and is overseen by the treasury committee a sub committee of the financial risk committee both chaired by the cfo an update on group treasury risks and actions is provided monthly to the financial risk committee and to each meeting of the board risk committee static for more information on this risk see note 3 to the accounts financial risk management on pages 133 137 capital risk principal risks to managing the group s capital are in respect of regulated entities capital adequacy compliance risk the risk that regulated entities do not maintain and report sufficient qualifying capital to meet regulatory requirements and capital reporting compliance risk the risk that regulated entities fail to comply with capital reporting and regulatory obligations if a regulated entity in the group fails to ensure that sufficient capital resources are maintained to meet regulatory requirements this could lead to loss of regulatory approvals and or financial sanctions in respect of regulated and unregulated entities commercial capital adequacy and quality risk the risk that group and solo entities do not maintain both sufficient quantity and quality of capital to meet commercial requirements and investment return risk the risk that capital is held in subsidiaries or invested in projects that generate a return that is below the group s cost of capital availability of debt or equity capital whether specific to the group or driven by general financial market conditions the group s capital management policy provides a framework to ensure the group maintains suitable capital levels both at group and solo entity levels and effectively manages the risks thereof the group s treasury policy recognises the need to observe regulatory requirements in the management of the group s resources the risk appetite approved by the board includes components related to the group s leverage ratios and capital risks key risk indicators are monitored regularly the group maintains an ongoing review of the capital positions of its regulated entities to ensure that they operate within capital limits which are overseen by the financial risk committee the executive committee and the board the group can manage its capital structure by varying returns to shareholders issuing new shares or increasing or reducing borrowings the board reviews dividend policy and funding capacity on a regular basis and the group maintains comfortable levels of debt facility headroom the group regularly assesses debt and equity markets to maintain access to new capital at reasonable cost the group is mindful of potential impacts on its key metrics when considering changes to its capital structure static for more information on this risk see note 3 to the accounts financial risk management on pages 133 137 operational risks the risk of loss or other adverse consequences to the business resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events risk description mitigation risk level technology robust secure and stable technology performing to high levels of availability continues to be critical to the group s businesses technology failures may impact our clients and the orderly running of our markets potentially leading to a loss of trading or clearing volumes or impacting our information services activities the group continues to consolidate its technology delivery and operation capabilities through its lseg technology and lseg business services companies respectively continued efforts to consolidate to lseg technology solutions and a homogeneous technology stack may increase systemic technology risk as components and development are shared or similar in build furthermore increased demand on lseg technology as a mission critical supplier may result in over stretch resources to meet both the requirements of the group and those of third parties the group also has dependencies on a number of third parties for the provision of hardware software and networks for elements of its trading clearing settlement data and other systems the performance and availability of the group s systems are constantly reviewed and monitored to prevent problems arising and where possible ensure a prompt response to any potential service impacting incident the group continues actively to identify manage and mitigate risks associated with the consolidation of technology development and operations regular rigorous business impact and operational risk scenario analysis are performed in conjunction with the group risk group business continuity and crisis management functions to identify assess and remedy potential system and governance vulnerabilities in addition all technology solutions are comprehensively tested by both lseg technology and third party quality assurance providers as appropriate functional non functional user acceptance and other testing is performed across a number of technical environments to ensure products are ready for deployment the group s technology teams mitigate the risk of resource over stretch by ensuring prioritisation of key development and operations activities and resource utilisation and allocation are kept under constant review the lseg technology systems are designed to be software and hardware fault tolerant and alternative systems are available in the unlikely event of multiple failures from which the system is unrecoverable the group actively manages relationships with key strategic technology suppliers to avoid any breakdown in service provision which could adversely affect the group s businesses

cybercrime has the potential to have an adverse impact on our business public and private organisations continue to be targeted by increasingly sophisticated cyber attacks threats such as ransomware theft of customer data and distributed denial of service attacks were increasingly significant to the financial industry as a whole in 2018 such threats could result in the loss of data integrity or disruption to our operations and client facing services additionally new emerging technologies for the group such as cloud computing could impact our cyber security risk profile the group s technology and operational support providers internal and third party could suffer a security breach resulting in the loss or compromise of sensitive information both internal and external or loss of services such a breach could materialise as a result of weaknesses in system controls or processes or through the inadvertent or malicious actions of employees contractors or vendors a major information security breach that results in data and intellectual property loss system unavailability or sensitive data leakage could have a significant negative impact on our reputation financial results and the

framework are in place to prevent detect and respond to cyber security threats such as third party risks sophisticated malware system vulnerabilities and access control as well as enhancing our security event detection and incident response processes security training and awareness of our people remains a key component of the control framework regular testing of security controls and incident response processes is undertaken both internally and externally to provide assurance over the effectiveness of cyber security controls and recovery processes information security teams monitor intelligence and liaise closely with global government agencies as well as industry forums and regulators to help improve our ability to respond to the evolving threats faced by us and our industry increasing change management the considerable change agenda exposes the group to the risk that change is either misaligned with the group s strategic objectives or not managed effectively within time cost and quality criteria in turn this could lead to an adverse impact on the operation of core services and revenue growth as well as damaging the group s reputation the volume of simultaneous change could also lead to a loss of client goodwill if execution is not managed appropriately and supported with adequate operating models to operationalise new services synergies and cost benefits may not be delivered to anticipated levels the volume of change is driven by both internal and external factors internal factors include the diversification strategy of the group and its drive for technology innovation consolidation and operational resilience external factors include the changing regulatory landscape and requirements which necessitate changes to our systems and processes the risks associated with change are mitigated by effective implementation of the group s change framework this includes board oversight across the group s change portfolio and project pipeline to ensure these align to the group and divisional strategies and support our financial plans appropriate governance and executive oversight is exercised over individual programmes and

a proactive approach to wellbeing in the uk which we are in the process of rolling out globally this looks to improve wellbeing across 5 dimensions physical mental financial social purpose and work life balance in 2018 we also launched the new speak up campaign designed to provide our colleagues with the confidence to speak up and raise concerns when they witness or suspect inappropriate behaviour misconduct or wrongdoing that conflicts with our values career development remains a key enabler for success and we have a carefully managed learning and development budget which enables us to take a coordinated approach and focus investment in the development of colleagues we provide colleagues with a range of courses materials and tools to support them in owning their development in 2018 we launched our global career framework futures which outlines all roles in our organisation helping our colleagues understand how to navigate the opportunities that exist across the group and the development steps they need to take to progress we also offer additional investment to identified key talent and executives for instance by providing coaches for key senior successors in terms of talent management we always look to promote internally where possible we undertake a comprehensive annual review of critical roles and ensure we have succession plans in place to minimise the impact

seeks to protect its financial performance and the value of its business from exposure to capital credit concentration country liquidity settlement custodial and market including foreign exchange cash flow and fair value interest rate risks the group s financial risk management approach is not speculative and adopts a 3 lines of defence model it is performed both at a group level where the treasury function identifies evaluates and hedges financial risks from a group perspective and also locally where operating units manage their regulatory and operational risks this includes clearing operations at the group s ccps at lch group and cc g that adhere to local regulation and operate under approved risk and investment policies the group chief risk officer s team provides assurance that the governance and operational controls are effective to manage risks within the board approved risk appetite supporting a robust group risk management framework the financial risk committee a sub committee of the group executive committee and chaired by the chief financial officer meets monthly to oversee the consolidated financial risks of the group in addition the treasury committee a sub committee of the financial risk committee which is also chaired by the chief financial officer meets regularly to monitor the management of and controls around foreign exchange interest rate credit and concentration risks and the investment of excess liquidity in addition to its oversight of the group s funding arrangements both committees provide the group s senior management with assurance that the treasury and risk operations are performed in accordance with group board approved policies and procedures regular updates on a range of key criteria as well as new developments are provided

com about londonstock exchange group risk management oversight on 23 june 2016 the uk voted to exit the eu the uk companies within the group as members of the eu or european economic area eea rely on a number of rights that are available to them to conduct business with other eu or eea members this includes without limitation the right for uk ccps to offer clearing services to eu regulated firms under emir and the right for uk trading venues to offer services to members in the eu or eea the group companies have analysed the potential impacts and considered contingency plans that they may choose to execute should these rights not be replaced by rights that persist outside eu membership capital risk risk description risk management approach the group is profitable and strongly cash generative and its capital base comprises equity and debt capital however the group recognises the risk that its entities may not maintain sufficient capital to meet their obligations or they may make investments that fail to generate a positive or value enhancing return the group comprises regulated and unregulated entities it considers that increases in the capital requirements of its regulated companies or negative yields on its investments of cash or a scarcity of debt or equity driven by its own performance or financial market conditions either separately or in combination are the principal risks to managing its capital the group focuses upon its overall cost of capital as it seeks within the scope of its risk appetite to provide superior returns to its shareholders fulfil its obligations to the relevant regulatory authorities and other stakeholders and ensure that it is not overly dependent upon short and medium term debt that might not be available at renewal maintaining the flexibility to invest for growth is a key capital management consideration the group can manage its capital structure and react to changes in economic conditions by varying returns to shareholders issuing new shares or increasing or reducing borrowings the board reviews dividend policy and funding capacity on a regular basis and the group maintains comfortable levels of debt facility headroom a summary of the group s capital structure is presented below 31 december 2018 31 december 2017 book value of capital m m total shareholders funds 3 343 3 227 group consolidated debt 2 203 1 953 whilst the company is unregulated the regulated entities within the group monitor compliance with the capital requirements set by their respective competent authorities and the terms of reference of the financial risk committee includes oversight of the group s capital management policy the capital management policy seeks to ensure that compliance with local regulations is maintained and that there is a robust evaluation undertaken by the group s investment committee of the impact of new investments across the group on its capital position regulated entities within the group have to date predominantly issued equity and held cash to satisfy their local regulatory capital requirements we believe that capital held by group companies is sufficient to comfortably support current regulatory frameworks the level of amounts set aside by the group for these purposes remains subject to on going review with regulators particularly in europe a summary of the group s regulatory and operational capital is shown below 31 december 2018 31 december 2017 regulatory and operational capital m m total regulatory and operational capital 1 203 1 147 amount included in cash and cash equivalents 1 120

depreciation and amortisation foreign exchange gains or losses and non underlying items prorated for acquisitions or disposals undertaken in the period against a target range of 1 2 times the group is also mindful of potential impacts on the key metrics employed by the credit rating agencies in considering increases to its borrowings as at 31 december 2018 net leverage was 1 8 times 2017 1 7 times but remains well within the group s target range the group is comfortably in compliance with its bank facility ratio covenants net leverage and interest cover and these measures do not inhibit the group s operations or its financing plans credit and concentration risk risk description risk management approach the group s credit risk relates to its customers and counterparties being unable to meet their obligations to the group either in part or in full including customer receivables repayment of invested cash and cash equivalents settlement of derivative financial instruments in their roles as ccp clearers to financial market participants the group s ccps guarantee final settlement of transactions acting as buyer towards each seller and as seller towards each buyer they manage substantial credit risks as part of their operations including unmatched risk positions that might arise from the default of a party to a cleared transaction for more information see principal risks and uncertainties pages 48 57 notwithstanding regulations that require ccps to invest predominantly in secured instruments or structures such as government bonds and reverse repos cc g and the lch group ccps continue to be able to maintain up to 5 of their total deposits at commercial banks on an unsecured basis through this potential for its ccps to invest on an unsecured basis as well as by certain other regulated and unregulated operations observing agreed investment policy limits the group will continue to face the risk of direct loss from a deterioration or failure of one or more of its unsecured investment counterparties concentration risk may arise through group entities having large individual or connected exposures to groups of counterparties whose likelihood of default is driven by common underlying factors this is a particular focus of the investment approach at the group s ccps group credit risk is controlled through policies developed at a group level limits and thresholds for credit and concentration risk are kept under review group companies make a judgement on the credit quality of their customers based upon the customer s financial position the recurring nature of billing and collection arrangements and historically a low incidence of default furthermore the group is exposed to a large number of customers and so concentration risk on its receivables is deemed by management as low non ccp entities credit risk associated with cash and cash equivalents is managed by limiting exposure to counterparties with credit rating levels below policy minimum thresholds potentially overlaid by a default probability assessment except where specific approval is arranged to increase this limit for certain counterparties investment limits of between 100 million and 25 million apply for periods between 12 months and 1 week depending on counterparty credit rating and default probability risk derivative transactions and other treasury receivable structures are undertaken or agreed with well capitalised counterparties and are authorised by policy to limit the credit risk underlying these transactions ccps to address market participant and latent market risk the group s ccps have established financial safeguards against single or multiple defaults clearing membership selection is based upon supervisory capital technical and organisational criteria each member must pay margins computed and collected at least daily to cover the exposures and theoretical costs which the ccp might incur in order to close out open positions in the event of a member s default margins are calculated using established and internationally acknowledged risk models and are debited from participants accounts through central bank accounts and via commercial bank payment systems minimum levels of cash collateral are required and non cash collateral is revalued daily 31 december 2018 31 december 2017 bn bn clearing members margin ability 175

integrity of the markets in the event of multiple defaults in extreme market circumstances amounts are determined on the basis of the results of periodic stress testing examined by the risk committees of the respective ccps furthermore each of the group s ccps reinforces its capital position to meet the most stringent relevant regulatory requirements applicable to it including holding a minimum amount of dedicated own resources to further underpin the protective credit risk framework in the event of a significant market stress event or participant failure an analysis of the aggregate

bodies including through direct investments in highly rated regulatory qualifying sovereign bonds and supra national debt investments in tri party and bi lateral reverse repos receiving high quality government securities as collateral and in certain jurisdictions deposits with the central bank the small proportion of cash that is invested unsecured is placed for short durations with highly rated

description risk management approach distress can result from the risk that certain governments may be unable or find it difficult to service their debts this could have adverse effects particularly on the group s ccps potentially impacting cleared products margin collateral investments the clearing membership and the financial industry as a whole specific risk frameworks manage country risk for both fixed income clearing and margin collateral and all clearing members are monitored regularly against a suite of sovereign stress scenarios investment limits and counterparty and clearing membership monitoring are sensitive to changes in ratings and other financial market indicators to ensure the group s ccps are able to measure monitor and mitigate exposures to sovereign risk and respond quickly to anticipated changes risk committees maintain an on going watch over these risks and the associated policy frameworks to protect the group against potentially severe volatility in the sovereign debt markets the group s sovereign exposures of 1billion or more at the end of either of the financial reporting periods shown below are group aggregate sovereign treasury exposures 31

management approach the group s operations are exposed to liquidity risk to the extent that they are unable to meet their daily payment obligations in addition the group s ccps and certain other subsidiary companies are required to maintain a level of liquidity consistent with regulatory requirements to ensure the smooth operation of their respective markets and to maintain operations in the event of a single or multiple market stress event or member failure this includes the potential requirement to liquidate the position of a clearing member under a default scenario including covering the associated losses and the settlement obligations of the defaulting member the group is exposed to the risk that a payment or settlement bank could fail or that its systems encounter operational issues creating liquidity pressures and the risk of possible defaults on payment or receivable obligations the group uses third party custodians to hold securities and is therefore exposed to the custodian s insolvency its negligence a misuse of assets or poor administration group the combined group businesses are profitable generate strong free cash flow and operations are not significantly impacted by seasonal variations the group maintains sufficient liquid resources to meet its financial obligations as they fall due and to invest in capital expenditure make dividend payments meet its pension commitments support acquisitions or repay borrowings with the exception of regulatory constraints impacting certain entities funds can generally be lent across the group or remitted through dividend payments this is an important component of the group treasury cash management policy and approach management monitors forecasts of the group s cash flow and overlays sensitivities to these forecasts to reflect assumptions about more difficult market conditions or stress events non ccp entities treasury policy requires that the group maintains adequate credit facilities provided by a diversified lending group to cover its expected funding requirements and ensure a minimum level of headroom for at least the next 24 months the financial strength of lenders to the group is monitored regularly during the year ended 31 december 2018 the group extended the maturity of its 2017 arranged 5 year 600 million committed revolving credit facility by another year to 2023 and issued a 500 million bond due in 2027 further extending its debt maturity profile it also issued euro commercial paper under its newly established 1 billion programme further diversifying its sources of liquidity with 300 million in issuance at the end of the financial year at 31 december 2018 1 159 million 2017 675 million of the group s bank facilities were unutilised providing swingline backstop coverage for the 300 million euro commercial paper in issuance and financing flexibility more broadly for the group ccps the group s ccps maintain sufficient cash and cash equivalents and in certain jurisdictions have access to central bank refinancing or commercial bank liquidity support credit lines to meet the cash requirements of the clearing and settlement cycle revised regulations require ccps to ensure that appropriate levels of back up liquidity are in place to underpin the dynamics of a largely secured cash investment requirement ensuring that the maximum potential outflow under extreme market conditions is covered see credit and concentration risk section above the group s ccps monitor their liquidity needs daily under normal and stressed market conditions where possible the group employs guaranteed delivery versus payment settlement techniques and manages ccp margin and default fund flows through central bank or long established bespoke commercial bank settlement mechanisms monies due from clearing members remain the clearing members liability if the payment agent is unable to effect the appropriate transfer in addition certain group companies including the ccps maintain operational facilities with commercial banks to manage intraday and overnight liquidity custodians are subject to minimum eligibility requirements ongoing credit assessment robust contractual arrangements and are required to have appropriate back up contingency arrangements in place the table below analyses the group s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings

description risk management approach the group operates primarily in the uk europe and north america but also has growing and strategically important businesses in asia and other alliances and investments across the globe its principal currencies of operation are sterling euro and us dollars group companies generally invoice revenues incur expenses and purchase assets in their respective local currencies as a result foreign exchange risk arises mainly from the translation of the group s foreign currency earnings assets and liabilities into its reporting currency sterling and from occasional high value intragroup transactions exceptions exist including at millenniumit a sri lankan rupee reporting entity which invoices a material proportion of its revenues in us dollars and at certain operations of the lch group a euro reporting subsidiary which generate material revenues in sterling and us dollars and incur material costs in sterling intragroup dividends and the currency debt interest obligations of the company may create short term transactional fx exposures but play their part in controlling the level of translational fx exposures the group faces the group may be exposed from time to time to fx risk associated with strategic investments in or divestments from operations denominated in currencies other than sterling the group seeks to match the currency of its debt liabilities to the currency of its earnings and cash flows which to an extent protects its key ratios net leverage and interest coverage and balances the currency of its assets with its liabilities in order to mitigate the impact of unfavourable currency exchange rate movements on earnings and net assets non sterling cash earnings are centralised and applied to matching currency debt and interest payments and where relevant interest payments on sterling debt redenominated through the use of cross currency swaps a material proportion of the group s debt is held in or swapped into euros and us dollars as noted below 31 december 2018 31 december 2017 currency of debt m m euro denominated drawn debt 1 631 921 euro denominated cross currency interest rate swaps 361 355 us dollar denominated drawn debt us dollar denominated cross currency interest rate swaps 631 622 the cross currency interest rate swaps are directly linked to sterling fixed debt the euro and usd denominated debt including the cross currency swaps provides a hedge against the group s net investment in euro and usd denominated entities as at 31 december 2018 the group s designated hedges in its net investments were fully effective whilst transactional foreign exchange exposure is limited the group hedges material transactions in accordance with group treasury policy which requires that cash flows of more than 5 million or equivalent per annum should be hedged with appropriate derivative instruments or by settling currency payables or receivables within a short timeframe where appropriate hedge accounting for derivatives is considered in order to mitigate material levels of income statement volatility in addition to projecting and analysing its earnings and debt profile by currency the group reviews sensitivities to movements in exchange rates which are appropriate to market conditions the group has considered movements in the euro and the us dollar over the year ended 31 december 2018 and year ended 31 december 2017 and based on actual market observations between its principal currency pairs has concluded that a 10 movement in rates is a reasonable level to illustrate the risk to the group the impact on post tax profit and equity for the years ended 31 december is set out in the table below 31 december 2018 31 december 2017 post tax profit equity post tax profit equity m m

cash flow and fair value interest rate risk risk description risk management approach the group s interest rate risk arises through the impact of changes in market rates on cash flows associated with cash and cash equivalents investments in financial assets and borrowings held at floating rates the group s ccps face interest rate exposure through the impact of changes in the reference rates used to calculate member liabilities versus the yields achieved through their predominantly secured investment activities group interest rate management policy focuses on protecting the group s credit rating and maintaining compliance with bank covenant requirements to support this objective a minimum coverage of interest expense by ebitda of 7 times and a maximum floating rate component of 50 of total debt are targeted this approach reflects i a focus on the group s cost of gross debt rather than its net debt given the material cash and cash equivalents set aside for regulatory purposes ii the short duration allowed for investments of cash and cash equivalents held for regulatory purposes which by their nature generate low investment yields iii a view currently maintained that already low market yields are unlikely to move materially lower and iv the broad natural hedge of floating rate borrowings provided by the significant balances of cash and cash equivalents held effectively at floating rates of interest as at 31 december 2018 consolidated net interest expense cover by ebitda was measured over the 12 month period at 16 1 times 2017 15 5 times and the floating rate component of total debt was 14 2017 27 in the group s ccps interest bearing assets are generally invested in secured instruments or structures and for a longer term than interest bearing liabilities whose interest rate is reset daily this makes net investment revenue vulnerable to volatility in overnight rates and shifts in spreads between overnight and term rates interest rate exposures and the risk to ccp capital are managed within defined risk appetite parameters against which sensitivities are monitored daily in its review of the sensitivities to potential movements in interest rates the group has considered interest rate volatility over the last year and prospects for rates over the next 12 months and has concluded that a 1 percentage point upward movement with a limited prospect of material downward movement reflects a reasonable level of risk to current rates at 31 december 2018 at the group level if interest rates on sterling denominated euro denominated and us dollar denominated cash and borrowings had been 1 percentage point higher with all other variables held constant post tax profit for the year would have been 8 million higher 2017 5 million higher mainly as a result of higher interest income on floating rate cash and cash equivalents partially offset by higher interest expense on floating rate borrowings at 31 december 2018 at the ccp level in aggregate if interest rates on the common interest bearing member liability benchmarks of eonia fed funds and sonia for euro us dollar and sterling liabilities respectively had been 1 percentage point higher with all other variables held constant the daily impact on post tax profit for the group would have been 2 million lower 2017 2 million lower this deficit is expected to be recovered as investment

the global economic outlook is deteriorating government borrowing in the deficit countries will therefore escalate us treasury tic data confirms foreigners have already begun to liquidate dollar assets adding to the us government s future funding difficulties the next wave of monetary inflation required to fund budget deficits and keep banks solvent will not prevent financial assets suffering a severe bear market because the scale of monetary dilution will be so large that the purchasing power of the dollar and other currencies will be undermined failing fiat currencies suggest the dollar based financial order is coming to an end but with few exceptions investors own nothing but fiat currency dependent investments the only portfolio protection from these potential dangers is to embrace sound money gold the global economy is at a cross road with international trade stalling and undermining domestic economies some central banks notably the european central bank the bank of japan and the bank of england were still reflating their economies by supressing interest rates and the ecb had only stopped quantitative easing in december the fed and the peoples bank of china had been tightening in 2018 the pboc quickly went into stimulation mode in november and the fed has put monetary tightening and interest rates on hold pending further developments it is very likely this new downturn will be substantial the coincidence of the top of the credit cycle with trade protectionism last occurred in 1929 and the subsequent depression was devastating the reason we should be worried today is stalling trade disrupts the capital flows that fund budget deficits particularly in america where savers do not have the free capital to invest in government bonds worse still foreigners are now not only no longer investing in dollars and dollar denominated debt but they are suddenly withdrawing funds according to the most recent us treasury tic data in december and january these outflows totalled 257 2bn at this rate not only will the us treasury need to fund a deficit likely to exceed a trillion dollars in fiscal 2019 but the us markets will need to absorb substantial sales from foreigners as well in short america is going to face a funding crisis to have this funding problem coinciding with the ending of credit expansion at the top of the credit cycle is a lethal combination as yet unrecognised as the most important factor behind both american and global economic prospects the problem is bound to emerge in coming months while today s trade protectionism is less vicious than the smoot hawley tariff act america s drawn out trade threats today are similarly destabilising the top of the credit cycle in 1929 was orthodox its principal effect had been to fuel a speculative stock market frenzy in 1927 29 this time the credit bubble is proportionately far larger and its implosion threatens to be even more violent governments everywhere are up to their necks in debt as are consumers personal savings in america the uk and in some eu nations are practically non existent the potential for a credit economic and systemic crisis is therefore considerably greater today than it was ninety years ago bearing in mind the dow fell just under 90 percent from its 1929 peak the comparison with these empirical facts suggests we might experience no less than a virtual collapse in financial asset values however there is an important difference between then and now during the wall street crash the dollar was on a gold standard in other words the price effect of the depression was reflected in the rising purchasing power of gold this time no fiat currency is gold backed so a major credit economic and systemic crisis will be reflected in a falling purchasing power of fiat currencies the finances of any government whose unbacked currency is the national pricing medium are central to determining future general price levels just taking the us dollar for example the government s debt to gdp ratio is over 100 percent in 1929 it was less than 40 percent at the peak of the cycle the government should have a revenue surplus reflecting underlying full employment and the peak of tax revenues in 1929 the surplus was 0 7 percent of estimated gdp today it is a deficit of 5 5 percent of gdp in 1929 the government had minimal legislated welfare commitments the net present value of which was therefore trivial the deficits that arose in the 1930s were due to falling tax revenues and voluntary government schemes enacted by presidents hoover and roosevelt today the present value of future welfare commitments is staggering and estimates for the us alone range up to 220 trillion before adjusting for future currency debasement other countries are in a potentially worse position particularly in europe a global economic slump on any scale let alone that approaching the 1930s depression will have a drastic impact on all national finances tax revenues will collapse while welfare obligations escalate some governments are more exposed than others but the us uk japan and eu governments will see their finances spin out of control furthermore their ability to cut spending is limited to that not mandated by law even assuming responsible stewardship by politicians the expansion of budget deficits can only be financed through monetary inflation that is the debt trap and it has already sprung shut on minimal interest rates for a temporary solution governments can only turn to central banks to fund runaway government deficits by inflationary means the inflation of money and credit is the central banker s cure all for everything inflation is not only used to finance governments but to provide the commercial banks with the wherewithal to stimulate an economy an acceleration of monetary inflation is therefore guaranteed by a global economic slowdown so the purchasing power of fiat currencies will take another lurch downwards as the dilution is absorbed that is the message we must take on board when debating physical gold which is the only form of money free of all liabilities gold can only give an approximation of the loss of purchasing power in a fiat currency during a slump because gold s own purchasing power will be rising at the same time between 1930 and 1933 the wholesale price index in america fell 31 6 percent and consumer prices by 17 8 percent these price changes reflected the increasing purchasing power of gold because of its fixed convertibility with the dollar at that time therefore the change in purchasing power of a fiat currency is only part of the story however the comparison between purchasing powers for gold and fiat currency is the most practical expression of the change in purchasing power of a fiat currency because the choice for economic actors for whom gold has a monetary role is to prefer one over the other related u s tech stocks look increasingly vulnerable it is an ongoing process about to accelerate chart 1 shows how four major currencies have declined measured in gold over the last fifty years the yen has lost 92 4 percent the dollar 97 42 percent sterling 98 5 percent and the euro 98 2 percent prior to 2001 the euro price is calculated on the basis of its constituents click to enlarge the ultimate bankruptcy of currency issuing governments likely to be exposed by the forthcoming slump will be reflected in another lurch downwards in currency purchasing powers technical and market analysis of gold s position it should become apparent as time progresses that the price of gold in fiat currencies will continue to rise the reasons are not yet clear to the consensus of portfolio investors and speculators but it is likely that the more prescient among them will begin to realise that in the event of a significant recession slump or depression the dollar price of gold will rise substantially for the moment they are likely to concentrate on timing using technical analysis rather than thinking through economic concepts chart 2 illustrates the current technical position click to enlarge following its peak in september 2011 gold found a bottom at 1047 in december 2015 that was followed by a 31 percent rally to 1375 in july 2016 since when gold has established a triangular consolidation pattern last august the price sold off to 1160 becoming oversold to record levels that established the second point of a rising trend marked by the lower solid line in february the gold price mounted a challenge to the upper parameter of the consolidation range before retreating to test established support at 1280 1305 shown by the pecked lines there is a good chance that another attempt to break through the 1350 level will take place soon and that it will succeed the following bullet points sum up this positive case the current rally commenced from a record oversold condition on comex the selloff was consistent with extreme selling exhaustion indicating a major turning point the net managed money position on comex indicates the gold contract is still moderately oversold however the april contract is running off the board which means that some 200 000 expiring contracts are still to be sold stand for delivery or rolled forward by the end of this month march this suggests a little more consolidation may be needed before gold advances to attempt a challenge on the 1350 level the 55 day and 200 day moving averages recently completed a bullish golden cross with the price above both signalling a bullish trend a retest of the 55 day ma occurred at the beginning of this month and is normal if as the chart suggests a triangle pattern is emerging it is an ascending triangle which is bullish an ascending triangle has a flat top and a rising base admittedly the top line declines slightly but not enough to put it in the class of symmetrical triangles where the eventual break out direction is less certain related de beers to expand world s most profitable diamond mine it is possible for the gold price to trade another down leg within the confines of the triangle before making its final breakout to the upside in which case the gold price might decline towards the low 1200s before making its upwards break the possibility that the ascending triangle might need longer to play out leads to the common technical recommendation to wait until gold breaks through the 1350 1365 level before buying for the next leg of the bull market chart 3 gives a longer term perspective of gold s valuation it is of the gold price adjusted by mine supply and for changes in the fiat money quantity simply put fmq is the sum of cash bank deposits and savings accounts and also bank reserves held at the fed it is the total amount of fiat money both in circulation and available for circulation click to enlarge in 1934 dollars deflated by the increase in the fiat money quantity gold has returned to the extreme lows seen on only two previous occasions the first was when the london gold pool failed in the 1960s followed by the collapse of the bretton woods agreement in 1971 at that time the decline in the fmq adjusted price of gold since 1934 was fuelled by monetary expansion until a point was reached which could go no further this led to an explosive recovery taking the price of gold in adjusted terms back to 1934 levels the realisation that the dollar faced the prospect of uncontrolled price inflation forced the fed to raise interest rates so that the banks prime rate exceeded 21 percent in december 1980 this was sufficient to prevent the gold price from further rises and physical gold then became the collateral of choice for a developing carry trade central bank sales were designed to signal the demonetisation of gold and deter buyers they leased significant quantities of bullion for the carry trade which increased supply synthetically and drove the gold price back to the same extreme valuation lows seen in the 1960s this was 2000 2002 after rallying from these extreme lows to a nominal high in september 2011 an increase in derivative supply coupled with the banking and investment establishment retaining an increasingly rosy view of fiat currencies have been instrumental in returning gold to the valuation lows of the 1960s and 2000 2002 it is in this context that the outcome predicted in chart 2 should be considered if as argued earlier in this article america and the rest of the world faces a global slump a premium for physical gold is likely to arise relative to the systemic risks of holding gold substitutes such as derivatives and even physically backed etfs in that event a return to the 1934 price level for gold in fmq adjusted terms before any further monetary dilution implies a nominal gold price of about 24 000 this conclusion does no more than indicate an upper target for the price of gold adjusted for historic monetary inflation if as seems likely a developing credit crisis occurs as a consequence of today s events the quantity of fiat money in issue will rise significantly from current levels as government debt is monetised therefore given the extreme undervaluation of gold suggested by chart 3 it is hard to see how the price of gold measured in dollars can go much lower defining the gold market and vanishing liquidity the gold market has three basic elements to it there is an underlying stock of approximately 170 000 tonnes increasing at about 3 000 tonnes a year it is impossible to define how much of the total above ground stock is monetary gold not least because jewellery in asia is bought as a store of monetary wealth and is used as collateral against loans however if we are to classify asian jewellery as non monetary gold then monetary gold in the form of bars and coin is thought by many experts to represent between thirty and forty per cent of the total assuming a median estimate of 35 percent this is 60 000 tonnes of which 33 760 tonnes is stated to be in national reserves this leaves an estimated 26 240 tonnes of investment gold in public hands worth 1 1 trillion much of this can be regarded as being in long term storage for market purposes the physical market on its own is relatively illiquid secondly there are regulated futures and options markets the most important of which is america s comex currently there are about 520 000 comex contracts of 100 oz each outstanding which are worth a total of 68bn options on futures total a further 220 000 contracts which are impossible to notionally value being puts and calls at varying strike prices third there are unregulated otc derivatives mostly forward contracts in london the last bank of international settlements statistics estimated total gold forwards and swaps were valued at 419bn over six times the size of comex in addition there were 149bn of otc options the liquidity is broadly confined to comex london forwards and other otc media these are all derivatives with minimal physical settlement taking place consequently the price of physical gold is not determined by the marginal supply and demand for bullion but almost entirely reflects financial factors in the banking system if financial market conditions return to an approximation of the 1929 32 period for the reasons described earlier in this article there is likely to be a banking crisis or at the very least a serious dislocation of financial markets therefore it is possible that at the same time investment funds and private individuals seek to gain portfolio exposure to the gold price they will be doing so while the means of doing so are contracting or even disappearing altogether an outcome of this sort hinges on the depth and pace of economic deterioration time will tell as to whether the current rapid deterioration in the economic outlook goes on to replicate the 1929 32 precedent but it is getting increasingly difficult to argue against it happening in which case the gold price could rise rapidly due to its current undervaluation a shortage of monetary gold outside central bank reserves systemic disruption of paper markets and a renewed pace of monetary inflation before the fiat money investment community realises what is happening portfolio switching from fiat to gold if the combination of both a developing credit and trade crises leads to a modern version of the 1929 32 global economic slump financial asset values will fall heavily but this time there is the additional factor of a renewed acceleration of monetary inflation which at some point might offer some support to stock prices at least in nominal currency terms in every hyperinflation an index of stock prices can perform well on this basis but adjusted for the currency s loss of purchasing power stock prices actually suffer substantial losses that assumes of course the rest of the world s economy is broadly stable which is almost certainly not going to be the case in our scenario additionally the inflationary conditions of a fiat currency s twilight moments involve the market imposing increasing levels of time preference on everything including bond prices therefore the discount between market prices and final redemption values widens dramatically governments and other borrowers face a near impossible funding task unless they are prepared to pay increasingly higher interest coupons unlike the experience of the great depression when interest rates reflected those of gold this time bond yields paid in fiat currencies will rise and continue rising this leads towards a different progression of notable developments compared with 1929 32 an approximate sequence of how these might evolve is described as follows evidence of a looming recession becomes increasingly apparent central banks respond in their time honoured way by easing monetary policy and replacing stalling credit creation with extra base money government bond prices rise as they are seen to be the least risky investment in an uncertain economic outlook and equities rally after an initial sell off at the same time lending bankers observe increasing risk in commercial lending and respond by quietly withdrawing loan facilities from all but the largest manufacturers of goods and producers of services this appears to approximate to the current situation with unsold inventory increasing industrial production is reduced and rising numbers of workers are laid off analysts revise their forecasts for corporate profits downwards and the number of corporate failures increases bond dealers adjust their expectations of government borrowing and quantitative easing is reintroduced by central banks to ensure government bonds can be issued at suppressed interest rates at this stage investors face a worrying combination of falling equity prices reflecting a deteriorating economic outlook combined with unexpected monetary inflation in the form of qe foreigners liquidate us investments in order to sell dollars the reserve currency this appears to have started early and repatriate funds to support their base operations bond dealers facing a glut of government bond issues expect bond yields to continue to rise stock markets slide and with it is a growing realisation that the recession is turning into a wealth destroying slump as the markets demands for increased time preference undermine all debtors finances investors increasingly avoid bonds and equities abandoning hope of any recovery in financial asset prices hedging into gold mines and gold etfs gathers pace and the purchasing power of gold continues to rise measured against both fiat currencies and against the commodity and energy complex having fallen behind the time preference demanded by markets central banks are reluctantly forced to raise overnight interest rates to protect the currency and bring price inflation under control they have no choice but this is seen as capitulation by investors residential mortgage costs increase sharply driving consumers into negative equity as property prices suffer from forced selling in countries where the home has become the middle class s principal asset the effect on consumer spending is devastating governments end up bailing out or bailing in lenders while trying to moderate mortgage interest costs by now the gold price measured in unbacked currency is beginning to discount a continuing acceleration in monetary inflation the gold price will be at multiples of current levels in all currencies including the dollar the sense of crisis escalates and mounting bad debts at the banks raise the prospect of a systemic banking crisis despite depositor protection schemes depositors begin to take steps to reduce their bank balances with the facility to encash bank deposits being strictly limited alternatives to deposits in insolvent banks will be in high demand these will be gold silver and other perceived stores of value cryptocurrencies could come into their own as an escape route from holding deposits in the banking system those who attempt to escape systemic risk by exchanging bank balances for alternatives are simply passing bank deposits to the vendors this is fine so long as vendors are happy to accept the systemic risk if not then prices of alternative stores of value must rise to compensate a classic flight out of money into anything else develops and is made more urgent by the lack of a cash alternative the currency rapidly loses purchasing power and it will be moving into its end of life government bonds will have lost nearly all their value measured in gold and governments will still be accelerating inflationary financing because bond financing without the central bank buying them will not be possible during this process with few exceptions financial assets will face annihilation a further problem is failing banks are the custodians of stock entitlements with few being directly registered in the beneficial owners names at best this leads to a temporary loss of ownership at worst it provides the means for confiscation an intense bear market destroys wealth at some stage investors will begin to realise their portfolios are almost totally exposed to fiat currency risk the belief that inflation hedges such as overweight equities and underweight bonds offer protection against extreme monetary inflation will be disproved investors will need a radical new approach using sound money as their performance criteria this is cannot be an inflation index which is likely to become increasingly manipulated by statistical method it has to be gold instead of rapidly depreciating fiat currency the problem investors will then face is mathematical there are probably less than 30 000 tonnes of monetary gold excluding asian jewellery in private hands today worth about 1 1 trillion according to the boston consulting group in 2015 there were 71 4 trillion of portfolio assets of which 36 1 trillion were in us dollars with the monetary gold held outside government reserves being about 1 5 percent of portfolio assets how do you replace non performing fiat currency dependent assets with a portfolio designed with sound money in mind this is why the return to sound money will destroy the west s financial system driving the purchasing power of gold higher measured against commodities goods and services while that of paper fiat moves towards worthlessness the destruction of financial wealth could easily compare with 1929 32 and if it wipes out fiat currencies will be even worse the removal of cash as an effective escape route for investors fleeing systemic risk turns systemic risk directly into a collapsing preference for money relative to goods gold cryptocurrencies and the rest once it starts it could happen quite quickly by zerohedge via goldmoney com more top reads from safehaven com
executive summary market volatility picked up dramatically over the last few months was this a shot across the bow or a temporary disruption consensus views are for corporate earnings and economic growth to trough in first quarter 2019 we believe the consensus is premature in calling for a trough this quarter which we believe lies further out while us growth should continue to slow likely bottom in global growth by the middle of the year with dovish pivot by u s fed a weaker usd is likely and why em equities and commodities could perform well recent market volatility over the last several months has been surreal we ve gone from december 2018 s 9 2 percent decline in the s p 500 representing the worst december since 1931 to january 2019 s 7 9 percent return representing the best january performance since 1976 such a rapid turn of events begs the question was it all just a bad dream the answer to that question depends on what one believes were the ultimate causes of the decline and what the outlook is for 2019 if you believe the fourth quarter 2018 decline was largely due to an aggressive u s federal reserve and rising trade tensions between china and the u s then the fourth quarter nightmare was likely just a bad dream however if there are other forces at work then we need to ask if the market s rally off the december lows has gone beyond what the fundamentals would dictate and is the market underappreciating other factors at play the fed was a large part of the decline during the last few months of 2018 we pointed this out in our last article in which markets reacted widely to fed speeches and press conferences part of the anxiety felt last year stemmed from the perception that current fed chairman jerome powell was more pragmatic than his predecessors as he was not an academic being the first non economist to hold the job as the federal reserve chairman in over 40 years chairman powell was also seen as more hawkish than his predecessors ben bernanke and janet yellen which was put to the test months into his career when the s p 500 plunged more than 10 percent from its january 2018 high to its february 2018 low powell did not comment on the decline while his two predecessors were often more willing to pontificate on the undulations of the market in their speeches or go so far as to unleash gobs of liquidity in bernanke s case or put off planned fed rate hikes in yellen s when the market plunged over 10 percent from its all time high in september of last year powell s right hand man vice chairman richard clarida commented in early december that the market should not think the fed was there to backstop a decline such thinking was only temporary as a further 10 percent decline from those levels exceeded the pain threshold for the fed leading chairman powell to make a complete pivot and not only go on pause regarding further rate hikes but to even mention that it would begin looking at ending its balance sheet reduction program the so called fed pivot has been met with cheer by financial markets adding more fuel to the equity fire is the ongoing work towards a china trade deal helping markets back to where they were late in october and november of last year with an aggressive u s fed and trade tensions with china now moving into the rearview mirror where do markets go from here if u s economic growth and corporate earnings remain firm and the only real negative hits to the outlook for the stock market were an aggressive u s fed and a trade war with china then a new move to reclaim the highs set last year appears in the cards that is not the narrative that we subscribe to for numerous reasons outlined below u s economic slowdown to continue one of the largest reasons why we do not feel new highs are around the corner is our expectation for the economy to continue to slow well into the summer which will impact consumer spending and corporate earnings last year the u s economy saw real gross domestic product gdp grow at an annual rate of 2 9 percent matching the high for the cycle set in 2015 and accelerating from 2017 s 2 2 percent growth aided by trump s tax stimulus plan in our second quarter newsletter last year we called for a growth slowdown ahead for the u s economy and it does appear that the fourth quarter was the high water mark as quarterly real gdp peaked at 4 2 percent in the second quarter and decelerated to 3 4 percent and 2 6 percent in the third and fourth quarterly respectively the economic deceleration that began in the second half of last year looks to have continued into this year as the atlanta fed s real time estimate for first quarter 2019 real gdp is coming in at a snail s pace of 0 40 percent click for link while the new york fed s real time estimate comes in at 1 4 percent click for link most economists are expecting a re acceleration after a likely poor showing for economic growth this quarter but we believe that economic growth will continue to disappoint as we do not yet see a trough in the current slowdown based on the message from our leading economic index lei the u s lei we developed is based on data from the manufacturing and service sectors as well as housing and employment it typically leads the conference board s lei and has yet to show any hint of a trough in fact our lei recently plunged into negative territory with the lowest reading seen since the 2007 2009 great recession which does not bode well for the u s economic outlook source bloomberg l p financial sense wealth management what is particularly troublesome is that this move into negative territory by our lei is occurring in the context of the u s economy being quite late in the business cycle we created our business cycle index to help aid us in determining where we are in the business cycle with the following phases defined below 1 early expansion recovery between 0 30 2 middle expansion index is rising and between 31 70 3 late expansion index is rising and 70 4 early contraction index is falling and 70 5 late contraction recession index is falling and between 31 70 at our current reading of 97 we are clearly late cycle and investment risk rises materially as we move further into the business cycle now is not the time to throw caution to the wind and take a sanguine outlook as recession soon follows when our business cycle index turns down source bloomberg l p financial sense wealth management in the table below we show the s p 500 s forward returns at various levels of the business cycle broken up into five segments the market s cumulative return out 12 months 24 months and 36 months is greatest at the beginning of the business cycle and diminishes as it progresses this is shown in the table below which looks at the s p 500 s forward returns when our business cycle index is rising when we are in the upper quantile the market s 12 month forward return has averaged only 1 0 percent but turns negative when we look out two three years s p 500 forward returns when the fswm business cycle index is rising source bloomberg l p financial sense wealth management past performance is no guarantee of future results it is for this reason that we have maintained a defensive posture for our clients we feel the market s risk reward outlook is not favorable and risks to the u s economy continue to mount as

from a high of 6 3 percent in may 2018 to a low of 1 2 percent in december 2018 the second slowest growth rate of the entire expansion one of the recent economic developments that has caught our eye is the signs of a bottom forming in continuing jobless claims jobless claims are a canary in the economic coal mine as they consistently bottom prior to the onset of a recession as seen by the chart below where recessions are shown by the red vertical bars source bloomberg l p financial sense wealth management past performance is no guarantee of future results looking at recessions since the late 1970s and treating the 1980 and 1981 recessions as one long recession shows that continuing jobless claims bottom on average between 16 17 months before the onset of a recession should the low set in october of 2018 hold we could be staring at a recession in the first half of 2020 something that clearly bears watching u s joins global growth slowdown we re all familiar with the narrative of an aggressive fed and a trade war with china behind the fourth quarter decline in the u s stock market there s also the analogy of the current decline and the one we experienced in 2016 which laid the foundation for the strongest period of global synchronized growth since we came out of the 2007 2009 great recession we argued against this comparison in our january letter as we had yet to see a bottom in global economic activity this is still the case and yet the comparison in the investment community remains despite continued economic downgrades just last week we saw the european central bank ecb slash its 2019 and 2020 outlooks to justify delivering a fresh round of monetary stimulus to help slow the economic decline of the eurozone the european central bank delivered a fresh round of monetary stimulus in a bid to shore up the weakening economy as it cut its growth forecast by the most since the advent of its quantitative easing program four years ago ecb president mario draghi said the euro zone economy will now expand only 1 1 percent this year a drop of 0 6 percentage point from forecasts just three months ago a package of assistance from new loans for banks to a longer pledge on record low rates is intended to expand existing stimulus he said the announcement by the ecb last week came quickly on the heels of the oecd report in which the organization downgraded its global growth outlook again and raised the alarm for further deterioration the global expansion continues to lose momentum the paris based organization for economic cooperation and development said as it downgraded almost every group of 20 nation s economy growth outcomes could be weaker still if downside risks materialize or interact the oecd s numbers are more downbeat than the imf s for many economies particularly the euro region and the u k as the organization warns that things could get worse the oecd outlook goes against hopes that sources of weakness at the end of 2018 including lower confidence would prove temporary that creates a headache for policy makers who may now need to find more combative solutions with limited room for maneuver on the fiscal and monetary side confirming the downbeat outlook from the ecb and the oecd is a report from bloomberg economics that shows its current global gdp tracking estimate has yet to turn around the global economy s sharp loss of speed through 2018 has left the pace of expansion the weakest since the global financial crisis a decade ago according to bloomberg economics its new gdp tracker puts world growth at 2 1 percent on a quarter on quarter annualized basis down from about 4 percent in the middle of last year while there s a chance that the economy may find a foothold and arrest the slowdown the risk is that downward momentum will be self sustaining say economists dan hanson and tom orlik the bullish comparison of the 2016 global upturn to present is premature as economic data in most global economic regions years back turned up prior to the bottom in global equities which supported the rally in risk assets however as clearly illustrated by citigroup s economic data change indices there is no visible upturn in any major geographic economic region to support the rally in risk assets that we have seen in 2019 source bianco research used with permission the economic cycle research institute ecri has a long track record of accurately predicting turns in the u s and global business cycle while every economist was drinking the global synchronized growth kool aid at the start of 2018 they predicted a sharp slowdown in global growth as early as october 2017 see global growth outlook darkens given their early and accurate warning of a global slowdown their current outlook should be given serious consideration are they in the global recovery camp and drawing the comparison to the 2016 upturn not at all as the following report from ecri last month illustrates ecri s sequential leading indexes helped us correctly forecast the current slowdown a year ago please recall that this was when the global pmis were around their highs for the cycle in retrospect it is now clear that the global pmis were just starting to peak but it then took clear declines in the pmis for the consensus to catch on to the reality of the global industrial slowdown today while the current downturn is not yet over

investment strategy where do we go from here after major stock market declines there is typically a period of indigestion in which the market finds its footing and begins the process of forming the foundation of a bottom before advancing throughout the current bull market we have seen major declines followed by a period of consolidation before a new sustained rally took place we saw this after the sharp correction in 2010 as well as the mini bear market of 2011 source bloomberg l p financial sense wealth management past performance is no guarantee of future results during the steep 2015 and early 2016 corrections the market retested the initial lows before resuming its march higher and took a couple of months to form a solid bottom source bloomberg l p financial sense wealth management past performance is no guarantee of future results looking back even further to prior bull markets there is a pattern of the market retesting its initial lows during sharp selloffs in an ongoing bull market other famous examples include the 1987 stock market crash where the s p 500 fell more than 20 into the october 1987 bottom and was retested in december of that year before the market began to crawl higher top chart below we also saw a similar pattern where the market fell more than 20 in 1998 as long term capital management lost 4 6b in less than four months which ultimately required the fed to step in with emergency measures in response the markets briefly headed even lower than the initial september low before finally heading higher bottom panel below source bloomberg l p financial sense wealth management past performance is no guarantee of future results the process of forming a bottom after a steep correction has not taken place after the december 2018 lows rather just the opposite has occurred the rally in the s p 500 over the first 45 trading days since the december lows has been straight up and has been the sharpest rally seen over 45 trading days since the 2009 bear market lows as the economy was emerging from a recession in fact going back further the next occurrence of such a sharp rally occurred as the u s was exiting the 2001 recession if we are correct that the stock market has rallied beyond what fundamental and economic realities suggest then we are likely to see the market cool off in the coming weeks and months until there is greater visibility of an economic bottom in the global economy as well as u s economy one of our strongest investment convictions over the coming months is a significant top in the us dollar usd a peak in the usd is likely to form this year as the economic growth premium the u s has witnessed over the last two years to the rest of the world due in large part from trump s tax stimulus is likely to reverse as global growth stabilizes and u s economic growth continues to cool peaks in the usd are typically associated with outperformance of foreign equities relative to the u s as well as stronger returns in foreign currencies and commodities the recent fed pivot away from expecting two rate hikes in 2019 to none will clearly pressure the usd lower a lower usd will be a continued boon to emerging markets em as many em countries borrow in dollars additionally stronger em currencies will help to cool their local inflation rates and provide relief both to their consumers and corporate profit margins as input costs stabilize while a weaker usd will likely be a positive catalyst for em countries the missing and key ingredient for sustained gains in their equity markets will be stabilization in global growth on that point the oecd leading indicator for the largest 7 economies has yet to stabilize em equities tend to correlate with trends in growth for the global economy so the current rally in em equities could be at risk if the stock market is discounting an economic turnaround that does not materialize the correlation between global growth and em equities is shown below source bloomberg l p financial sense wealth management we are beginning to see some light at the end of the tunnel for global growth as our proxy for global growth is starting to turn up and suggests that a trough in global growth will likely occur in q2 with a slight uptick in q3 source bloomberg l p financial sense wealth management in addition to em equities likely performing well in the months ahead we are also likely to see commodities in general and the companies that produce them benefit from the same two catalysts stabilizing global growth and a weaker usd with copper likely presenting an interesting opportunity currently copper inventories are at their lowest levels since the great financial crisis of 2008 and any pickup in global economic growth may push copper prices higher one additional area that likely stands to benefit from the fed being on hold is gold the price of gold put in a multi decade low in 2001 at just under 260 ounce after former fed chairman alan greenspan began cutting interest rates in response to the 2001 recession and rose to over 400 ounce when greenspan made his final rate cut in the last cycle gold rallied over 50 from the middle of 2007 into early 2009 as former fed chairman ben bernanke was slashing interest rates our belief of a significant top in the usd stems from the fed progressively pivoting from an interest rate hawk tighter policy stance to an interest rate dove looser policy stance with the first step being a cessation of its interest rate hike program the next progression for the fed to respond to a weakening u s economy is an end to its balance sheet reduction program which it will do by september of this year followed by an eventual interest rate cut the futures market as of 03 21 2019 is currently pricing in a 48 2 probability that the fed will cut rates at its january 2020 meeting as economic projections for 2020 gdp are expected to come in even lower than 2019 estimates summary the current consensus view is that the nightmare seen in u s equities in the fourth quarter of 2018 was just a bad dream largely caused by an overly aggressive fed and rising trade tensions between the u s and china with both of those sources of stress on the markets behind us the stock market continues its advance that was abruptly halted last year a major catalyst to fuel further market gains many believe is a replay of the 2016 bottom in stocks in which a global growth downturn ended and was followed by strong synchronized growth the bottom in global growth began in late 2015 and was already beginning to turn up in early 2016 when markets bottomed currently markets have rallied strongly ahead of an upturn in global economic growth and is why we believe much of the strength in u s equities looks overdone in our view a period of cooling appears likely in the months ahead until the markets rosy belief for the outlook turns into reality us stock markets are not that far off their highs set last year while em and developed foreign equities are still well off their highs and present a better value proposition while the global slowdown that began late in 2017 is very mature and showing signs of a bottom in the middle of this year the u s slowdown that began late last year may have a longer runway ahead of it thus despite a more dovish fed on our hands the u s economy is likely to disappoint and is one reason why investors are likely to find better returns and value looking abroad more attractive opportunities will likely be present in investments that stand to benefit from a weaker usd such as foreign stocks commodity producing stocks gold as well as deep value stocks with cheap valuations and high dividend yields particularly given the fall in global bond yields to find out more about financial sense wealth

the great miscalculator spring 2019 in the minds of economists market outcomes are deterministic the price system is an efficient calculating machine leading households and firms to make reliable decisions to be sure economists can identify market failures but these are isolated predictable and amenable to correction with taxes or regulation this standard economic story takes the fundamental soundness of the market for granted but in the real world the market cannot possibly make the sort of reliable calculations that economists expect from it market outcomes are highly contingent on strategies beliefs and past choices that are somewhat arbitrary the market is not as well informed as we would like to believe which in turn makes policymaking more problematic than we would like to think actual markets miscalculate an awful lot this distance between our expectations of markets and their actual abilities has numerous implications it argues for humility about economic analysis and public policy and for a sense of perspective about what the tools of economists offer us the work of economists and policymakers is not entirely without such humility of course and the distance between economic theory and practice is hardly an unknown problem but the most important implication of this view of the market as a great miscalculator is actually badly underappreciated more fully accounting for the limits of markets as calculators would suggest that policy should focus above all on the fragility of the economy our prosperity has come to rely on certain key companies business practices habits of thought and assumptions about government finances when there is a major shift in beliefs or conventions these institutions can come under sharp severe and sudden stress this will happen there is no getting around it but when it does just how will these important firms practices and norms handle the problem whether they will degrade gracefully or fail catastrophically ought to be a foremost concern of policymakers the system of equations anyone who attempts to learn economics in college will encounter a curriculum that uses mathematics the further one advances in the subject the greater the reliance on mathematical models and equations economists have come to have faith in mathematics because they see the market as a mechanism for solving one giant math problem to be taken up in two key steps in step one they take certain conditions as given the initial endowments of resources held by individuals as well as their tastes the engineering relationships that determine the feasible production outputs and the rules regulations and tax policies set by government in step two they find a set of prices that will balance supply and demand for every form of input and output when prices have adjusted to the point where at those prices no consumer wishes to buy more and no firm wishes to supply more the economy is said to have arrived at equilibrium this approach leaves no room for contingency historians are often keenly aware of idiosyncratic factors at work as shown by such expressions as alternative history or historical accident but economic analysis is conducted outside of time and history nearly all models are written as if one could arrive here from mars and be able to predict and explain economic outcomes looking just at conditions as they exist today with no knowledge of the path that got us here in short historians understand intuitively that they are describing processes that are too complex to be captured by scientific laws and mathematical models economists pretend otherwise but economics is history we observe circumstances that are peculiar to a particular time and place every firm and each household is following habits and norms that were developed in response to past experiences many of which have long been forgotten on paper one can find the equilibrium in which supply and demand are everywhere balanced by solving a set of equations this is what economists do when they articulate their theories in the real world as friedrich hayek pointed out the information needed to describe tastes and technologies is too dispersed for any one person to actually carry out the computation the market itself collects the information and finds the solution the mathematical economist is merely performing a partial simulation according to the neoclassical or mainstream economic paradigm the market grinds out its solution by undertaking marginal analysis for every input and output the market calculates the value of the output that an additional unit of input could produce this is called the marginal product if the marginal product of say an apple picker exceeds that of an automobile assembler then market prices will guide one or more workers out of automobile plants and into apple orchards both market friendly and interventionist economists share the assumption that individual productivity is well defined and can be calculated by the households and firms responsible for allocating resources economists go on to identify situations in which market calculations will yield suboptimal results as when a factory owner does not bear the social costs of the pollution that the factory causes such situations are deemed market failures interventionists suggest that government can correctly identify market failures and undertake policies to steer the market toward a better social outcome market friendly economists focus instead on the flaws in the policy process and on the hope that private entrepreneurs will see opportunities to start businesses that reduce the waste that market failures otherwise would generate but even market failure theory rests on a foundation of mathematically precise calculations of individual productivity although a market might be imperfect in the theoretical sense it is still treated as generating predictable deterministic outcomes the case for government intervention is based on the presumption that taxes or regulation can shift the outcome from one that is suboptimal to one that is better in a predictable and deterministic way in reality market outcomes are not nearly this predictable and deterministic they are contingent a given set of pre conditions including government policies does not entail a predictable economic outcome many alternative outcomes can arise depending on individuals strategies and beliefs this is a straightforward fact and it would not be easy for economists to deny it in particular situations and yet the practical premise of much of contemporary economics is rooted in denying it overhead labor marginal productivity theory is at the center of mainstream economics it asserts that economic decisions are based on the measurement of the incremental output produced by an additional hour of work in theory everyone s work can be converted into the equivalent of the number of bushels of apples picked or the number of cars assembled in an hour but think of yourself and your associates do any of you produce measurable output it is more likely that you are engaged in intellectual or managerial work that does not directly yield output in 2018 there were 150 million americans employed in the non farm business sector of these only 9 million were production and non supervisory workers in manufacturing that is just 6 of the non farm labor force consisted of workers directly producing goods in 1948 these blue collar workers were 28 of the labor force over 90 of employed americans are not blue collar production workers what are they doing some service sector workers such as manicurists or lawn mowers produce output that can be readily counted but the majority of us are providing indirect support to the provision of goods and services project teams at firms for example often are not creating measurable outputs they are building capabilities that the firms hope to use to generate revenue from the security guard to the graphic designer to the tax accountant we are overhead labor for a traditional manufacturing firm the number of production workers is closely tied to unit sales production labor can be incrementally increased or decreased as needed but overhead labor is not adjusted strictly according to sales volume some overhead is necessary regardless of the level of output you cannot get rid of tax accountants just because sales are down 10 other overhead is discretionary suppose that your company is undertaking an initiative to develop a new product or service if sales of existing offerings are down and your financial position is less robust than you expected you may choose to cancel the initiative in order to conserve cash but you also have the option of continuing with the initiative and retaining the overhead workers who are undertaking the task important segments of the economy are dominated by overhead costs for example pharmaceutical companies spend relatively little actually manufacturing pills research testing and marketing are all more important cost components for an airline the cost of flying an additional passenger is trivial compared to the cost of equipment fuel personnel maintenance facilities the reservation system and so on for a telecommunications service provider the cost of transmitting an additional gigabyte of data is trivial compared to the cost of building and maintaining the firm s infrastructure for a hospital the cost of undertaking an additional diagnostic test or procedure is small relative to the cost of managing equipping and maintaining the facility businesses in these industries cannot present their customers with prices that reflect the marginal costs of production if every consumer paid the marginal cost of manufacturing a pill or flying on an airplane the revenue would not be sufficient to cover overhead costs the significance of overhead costs relative to incremental production costs has greatly increased in the internet era news and entertainment used to require such media as paper or vinyl discs which were costly to produce and ship now the cost of distribution to an additional customer over the internet is essentially zero so the challenge is to recover the cost of creating the content writers editors artists and producers must obtain revenue through digital subscriptions advertising donations or other means when a firm s costs are dominated by overhead price discrimination becomes an attractive strategy even a necessity the airline will try to attract price sensitive customers with a low price while charging a higher price to those customers who are more committed to flying at a particular time rather than searching for a bargain the hospital bill will include superficially outrageous charges for products like orange juice or aspirin because the hospital is arbitrarily allocating its overhead costs to these items if it were forced to charge only for the cost of certain items or procedures it would have to raise the fees for other billable goods or services there is a sense in which the dominant role of overhead costs creates market failures that is the market is not allocating resources by making marginal calculations the quantity of overhead labor is adjusted by management discretion rather than being shifted up and down directly in response to incremental demand fluctuations consumers face prices that are marked up to cover overhead costs and these prices can far exceed the incremental cost of supplying more of the good or service but unlike textbook market failures the problem of heavy overhead costs cannot be corrected by a policymaker who understands the source of the failure each firm must try to develop management priorities that make effective use of overhead labor each firm must come up with pricing strategies that exploit those most willing to pay in order to recover overhead costs there is no tax or regulation that can solve those problems more easily this also complicates the problem of treating ordinary market failures for example suppose that the government wishes to use a tax on airline fuel as a tool to get passengers to internalize the pollution cost of flying if the airline allocates this additional cost to price insensitive passengers and leaves its discounts for price sensitive passengers in place then the total air miles flown may remain approximately unchanged in response to the tax because most labor is overhead labor the market s calculations must be viewed as more approximate than conventional economics assumes that in turn means that policies that try to correct textbook market failures risk achieving fewer intended consequences and having more unintended consequences than would be the case if markets operated as the textbooks claim understating contingency for neoclassical economists when consumer tastes are given material conditions determine what output is produced and what inputs are used to produce it there can be only one equilibrium outcome but in reality strategies and beliefs exert powerful effects outcomes are highly contingent i am old enough to remember when service station attendants pumped gas into your car then in the 1970s when oil prices shot up stations adopted the self serve model wherever it was legal to do so this change in strategy was not reversed when oil prices plummeted in the 1980s it seems that the timing of the sudden conversion to self serve was accidental rather than determined by material conditions restaurants to take another example are one of the most competitive industries in the united states yet we do not observe prices determined by marginal cost instead these businesses typically use the strategy of trying to recover much of their overhead cost by charging higher markups on beverages than on food the evolution of business practices and industry structure can seem inevitable in hindsight but this is misleading the personal computer industry is famous for the role of start ups including apple microsoft and dell but with slightly different business decisions it could instead have been the province of xerox and ibm until the mid 1990s consumer online access was dominated by proprietary services such as compuserve and america online each with its own separate content but eventually these gave way to the inter operable networks known as the internet yet in today s social networking we see no such inter operability instead we see separate platforms notably twitter linkedin and facebook it is not obvious why some business strategies succeed and others fail google has attempted to extend its reach from web search to email web browsing computer operating systems mapping video and social networking its success in each realm has varied with different approaches to strategy and execution it might have dominated social networking and flopped in email rather than the other way around none of this was inevitable or even readily predictable google s approach has usually been to offer software and content at no charge to consumers with revenue coming from advertising indeed under industry leaders google and facebook much of the content on the internet is supported by advertising but in theory there are other plausible business models including micropayments bundled subscriptions and patronage we could have arrived at an outcome where one of these alternative business models prevailed that in turn might have led to a very different industry structure contingency plays a particularly large role in finance financial markets can arrive at many different outcomes depending on the pattern of self fulfilling beliefs the financial crisis of 2008 reflected a sharp swing in investor sentiment regarding mortgage related securities and other debt instruments backed by bank loans prior to the crisis there was overconfidence in these instruments at the height of the crisis in the fall of 2008 there was probably an excess of pessimism about what many securities were worth investor beliefs also affect the performance of businesses amazon would never have gained such a prominent role in retail without the confidence of investors who kept pouring capital into the company patiently enduring years in which earnings were low or non existent in macroeconomics most economists posit a tight relationship between the money supply and the overall price level but money s role in inflation is also mediated by beliefs households and firms have many choices regarding the means of payment credit cards and electronic funds transfers are increasingly important means for carrying out transactions young people in the united states rarely conduct business in cash even for purchases under 10 they prefer to employ credit cards they are starting to use smartphone apps to make payments and in fact some other countries may be ahead of the u s in their adoption of mobile payment technologies the widespread use of paperless payment mechanisms has broken the direct link between the supply of money and the ability of people to undertake transactions as a result there is no tight mechanical relationship between the quantity of money as controlled by the federal reserve and the overall behavior of prices instead prices are determined in large part by habit people accept payment in dollars and sign contracts for future payments based on what they assume they will be able to buy with those dollars in the future they know that the general trend in some industries such as health insurance and college education is for prices to rise they know that in other industries such as computers and communication quality adjusted prices are decreasing they know that the prices of commodity based goods such as gasoline can experience more short term fluctuations than other prices but in general people assume that the purchasing power of a dollar will be about the same next month as it is today these expectations become self fulfilling as many businesses keep their prices unchanged for long periods the u s government could by running a substantial budget deficit financed by money creation eventually dislodge these habitual expectations for prices and generate high and variable inflation but short of that most wages and prices are likely to continue to move within a narrow range this degree of contingency and the importance of preferences habits and expectations suggests that the social order studied by economists is not nearly as stable and predictable as mainstream theories assume and it should move policymakers to ask whether our economy is prepared for that stability to be shaken or lost the question of fragility the neoclassical economist sees the economy in a deterministic equilibrium and asks how that equilibrium can be improved if instead we looked at economic outcomes as contingent we would ask how catastrophic failure can best be prevented instead of assuming that the economy is robust we would look for sources of fragility instead of hunting for market failures to avert we would look for fragilities to mitigate the infrastructure for delivering electrical power offers a helpful analogy if we assume that the grid is robust we might look for ways to squeeze more efficiency out of it if instead we see it as fragile we would look for ways to introduce redundancy and to isolate points of potential failure in the economy we might identify three sources of potential catastrophic failure the government budget the financial sector and large firms in the technology sector at the moment investors treat government debt as a safe asset everyone who owns government bonds expects to be paid in good funds on time this belief is self fulfilling in that it allows government to roll over its debt meaning that it can pay off debts as they come due by undertaking new borrowing a sovereign debt crisis occurs when enough investors doubt that a government will always be able to roll over its debt no one wants to be holding government debt just before it goes into default fear of default will make investors reluctant to hold government debt thus the fear causes the event that is feared to take place at present the u s government budget is on an unsustainable path as the congressional budget office repeatedly indicates barring a change in the outlook for taxes and spending deficits will get larger and larger until eventually there will not be enough tax revenue available even to cover interest on the debt for now investors take the view that a crisis is a long way off they assume that for the near future they can expect government debt to be repaid but if that expectation were to change it would trigger a self fulfilling crisis this would send the interest rate on debt soaring forcing the government to immediately correct its fiscal path by some combination of reneging on spending obligations sharply raising taxes partially defaulting on the debt and engaging in inflationary finance the social and political consequences of a sovereign debt crisis are severe germany s social fabric did not recover from the hyperinflation of the 1920s which wiped out the savings of many middle class households greece was torn apart by its sovereign debt crisis even though it was given substantial support from the european union of course the united states is much larger than greece but this cuts both ways it means our economy is more robust but also that there is no entity that could bail out this country in a crisis the best way to address the fragility of the budget would be to put government finances on a sustainable path the most important step would be to rein in future entitlement spending other options include reducing non entitlement spending and raising taxes needless to say our political system is no mood to do any of that but leaders looking to mitigate the risks of fragility would make it a priority the financial sector contends with another form of fragility as we have seen the failure of significant financial entities can cause a general freeze up as the creditors of that firm and the creditors of similar firms try to clarify their balance sheets and reduce exposure it can take a long time to resolve the bankruptcy of a large complex financial institution and until things are sorted out the creditors of that firm cannot know how much they will be paid it is far from clear what can be done to mitigate this risk throughout our country s history regulators have attempted many approaches to this problem and none of them has eliminated fragility as charles calomiris and stephen haber point out in their 2014 book fragile by design until the 1980s banking policy was dominated by the public s fear of large national banks the result was a fragmented financial system with banks unable to cross state lines while the small size of individual banks limited the consequences of any single bank failure american banks were not robust and the system as a whole was not well diversified in the 1930s many banks failed at once in the 1980s many savings and loan associations failed at once by 2008 the united states had a much more concentrated financial system including large national banks as well as other major financial institutions from bear stearns lehman brothers and freddie mac to fannie mae and aig these firms had obligations to other firms that were so voluminous and so complex that doubts about their ability to meet those obligations threatened many other financial institutions both here and abroad the dodd frank legislation that was enacted in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 envisions two approaches to the problem of large complex financial entities one approach is tighter regulation of firms designated as systemically important the other approach has such firms develop living wills that would specify how they would be reorganized should they fail the hope was that implementing such reorganizations would obviate the need for bailouts there are good reasons to be skeptical of both of these approaches it is unlikely that mere human beings at government agencies can develop sufficient expertise insight and proficiency to render any firm too regulated to fail as for the living wills it is hardly straightforward to break up and reorganize a major bank when everything is going well let alone during a crisis many economists believe that the capital structure of banks and perhaps of non financial institutions as well is too heavily weighted toward debt and away from equity these economists cite the relatively minor economic impact of the stock market crash of 2000 2001 in comparison to the financial crisis of 2008 a decline in stock prices is a more graceful form of failure than a debt crisis but it is not easy to force a more robust financial structure on banks a bank with a low ratio of debt to equity can still be highly leveraged for example a bank with low debt but a large exposure to financial derivatives would be susceptible to failure that throws counterparties into confusion with consequences quite similar to those of the failures of financial institutions in 2008 it might be better to aim for a system in which financial firms can fail gracefully some scholars have proposed adding a new chapter in the bankruptcy code which would allow for the rapid transfer of ownership of a failed bank to a single class of debt holders leaving other creditors of the bank unaffected for the system as a whole it might be better to reduce the size of the largest institutions in less than 50 years we have gone from a system that was too fragmented to one that is probably too concentrated even though the canadian banking system is highly concentrated the largest u s banks now have much larger balance sheets than those of their counterparts in canada the u s could discourage the growth of the largest banks by for example limiting the total amount of insured deposits permitted for any one banking entity next consider large firms in a different sector technology the traditional anti trust approach is to ask how industry concentration affects consumers but consumer welfare is difficult to assess in industries with high fixed costs and low marginal costs in the case of advertising supported content for example the consumer may be paying nothing directly but do google or facebook exploit monopoly power with advertisers and if so how can we tell how this affects social welfare it may be impossible to answer such questions and perhaps they are not the right questions to be asking in the first place instead we might wish to ask the same questions of large tech companies that we ask of large financial firms could they fail gracefully or would the failure of such a firm create an economy wide crisis from this perspective it seems that we need not fear facebook or twitter the rest of the economy does not seem to be intimately tied to those firms but for google amazon and apple it may be a different story each of those firms is embedded in large business ecosystems could each ecosystem largely survive the failure of the core firm if the answer is no then policymakers should look for ways to try to promote greater redundancy and resiliency in those ecosystems steps might include making it easier for other firms to compete in businesses that are at the center of those ecosystems we might want to try to avoid a situation in which the economy depends heavily on a single provider of cloud computing or streaming video failing gracefully these observations point toward a fundamentally novel conception of the role of economic policy and especially economic regulation the idea that policymakers and regulators should seek to help markets that are highly effective calculators avert predictable failures is based on a conception of the economy that could not withstand scrutiny and that perhaps no one really believes a more plausible conception of what markets are good at would suggest not more interventionist regulation but an approach that seeks to shore up the economy where it is most fragile and weak knowing that markets aren t infallible calculators at all and that contingent judgments have immense implications policymakers should be on the lookout for weak points and should hunt and eradicate sources of especially concentrated and dangerous fragility economists and policymakers tell themselves that they are dealing with a robust predictable system with easily recognized points of failure and that they have reliable regulatory tools for steering it toward more optimal results in reality they are dealing with a fragile complex system it is less appropriate to seek to optimize this system and more appropriate to worry about keeping it from failing catastrophically
nigeria africa s largest largest economy is missing from the list of world s fastest growing economies even though analysts expect gdp to increase 2 4 in 2019 which is down 0 1 percentage points from last year s projection next year growth is seen rising to 2 9 thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe meanwhile chinese economy s meteoric rise over the last few decades has been one of the biggest stories in economics however china s growth has begun to slow in the last few years as authorities have begun to transition the economy from a manufacturing based economy to a services based economy thus other economies have begun to post larger growth rates in recent years in this piece we compile a list of the top 15 fastest growing economies in 2019 according to our consensus forecasts from over 1000 sources one thing to keep in mind about most of these economies is that fastest growing does not necessarily mean largest economy or most developed in fact most of these countries suffer from things such as high income inequality low levels of per capita gdp political instability and widespread corruption 1 ethiopia gdp growth projection 2019 7 9 gdp growth projection 2023 6 7 ethiopia is the second most populous country in africa and is a one party state with a planned economy for more than a decade before 2016 gdp grew at a rate between 8 and 11 annually this growth was driven by government investment in infrastructure as well as sustained progress in the agricultural and service sectors more than 70 of ethiopia s population is still employed in the agricultural sector but services have surpassed agriculture as the principal source of gdp the state is heavily engaged in the economy ongoing infrastructure projects include power production and distribution roads rails airports and industrial parks key sectors are state owned including telecommunications banking and insurance and power distribution under ethiopia s constitution the state owns all land and provides long term leases to tenants ethiopia s foreign exchange earnings are led by the services sector primarily the state run ethiopian airlines followed by exports of several commodities while coffee remains the largest foreign exchange earner ethiopia is diversifying exports and commodities such as gold sesame khat livestock and horticulture products are becoming increasingly important manufacturing represented less than 8 of total exports in 2016 but manufacturing exports should increase in future years due to a growing international presence source the world factbook cia economic outlook economic growth cooled in fiscal year 2017 as production in the important agricultural sector increased only modestly and the pace of expansion in the industrial sector softened the slowdown in the industrial sector was chiefly driven by a moderation in infrastructure spending as the government reduced capital imports in an attempt to alleviate dollar shortages that said the banking sector continued to enjoy good financial health in early february the country s mines and petroleum minister announced the forthcoming adoption of a comprehensive reform of the mining and oil sectors reflective of the government s attempts to open up the economy the reform will aim to improve the fiscal regime in order to attract more foreign investment and thus also ease dollar shortages economic activity should pick up in fy 2018 powered by an improving business environment and solid public investment spending a weak external liquidity position however clouds the outlook focuseconomics panelists see the economy growing 8 1 in fy 2018 which is unchanged from last month s forecast and 7 9 in fy 2019 2 rwanda gdp growth projection 2019 7 6 gdp growth projection 2023 7 8 rwanda is a rural agrarian country with agriculture accounting for about 63 of export earnings and with some mineral and agro processing tourism minerals coffee and tea are rwanda s main sources of foreign exchange despite rwanda s fertile ecosystem food production often does not keep pace with demand requiring food imports energy shortages instability in neighboring states and lack of adequate transportation linkages to other countries continue to handicap private sector growth rwanda has achieved rapid growth over the last decade thanks to the implementation of effective economic development and poverty reduction programs today the country is one of east africa s fastest growing economies with 70 of the workforce in the agricultural sector which remains the backbone of the economy its top exports are gold tea and petroleum with kenya and democratic republic of congo the biggest export destinations followed by china malaysia and the united states the government is finalizing the national strategy for transformation aimed at economic social and governance transformation toward the east african community eac vision 2050 source the world factobook cia and focuseconomics 3 bangladesh gdp growth projection 2019 7 4 gdp growth projection 2023 7 0 bangladesh s economy has grown roughly 6 per year since 2005 despite prolonged periods of political instability poor infrastructure endemic corruption insufficient power supplies and slow implementation of economic reforms although more than half of gdp is generated through the services sector almost half of bangladeshis are employed in the agriculture sector with rice as the single most important product garments are the backbone of bangladesh s industrial sector accounting for more than 80 of total exports in fy 2016 17 the industrial sector continues to grow despite the need for improvements in factory safety conditions steady export growth in the garment sector combined with 13 billion in remittances from overseas bangladeshis contributed to bangladesh s rising foreign exchange reserves in fy 2016 17 recent improvements to energy infrastructure including the start of liquefied natural gas imports in 2018 represent a major step forward in resolving a key growth bottleneck source the world factbook cia economic outlook the economy is likely to grow at a robust but slightly slower rate this fiscal year private consumption should continue to be underpinned by remittance growth while strong government consumption and investment are also seen providing buffers however risks of natural disasters a weak global trade environment and a struggling domestic banking system all cloud prospects our panelists expect gdp to expand 7 4 in fy 2019 which is unchanged from last month s forecast and 7 2 in fy 2020 4 india gdp growth projection 2019 7 3 gdp growth projection 2023 7 2 india s diverse economy encompasses traditional village farming modern agriculture handicrafts a wide range of modern industries and a multitude of services slightly less than half of the workforce is in agriculture but services are the major source of economic growth accounting for nearly two thirds of india s output but employing less than one third of its labor force india has capitalized on its large educated english speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services business outsourcing services and software workers nevertheless per capita income remains below the world average india is developing into an open market economy yet traces of its past autarkic policies remain economic liberalization measures including industrial deregulation privatization of state owned enterprises and reduced controls on foreign trade and investment began in the early 1990s and served to accelerate the country s growth which averaged nearly 7 per year from 1997 to 2017 source the world factbook cia economic outlook economic momentum is expected to remain steady in fy 2019 strong government spending should support growth as could a possible sustained lull in oil prices although weak public finances and global trade protectionism could weigh on prospects our panelists expect gdp growth of 7 3 in fy 2019 which is unchanged from last month s estimate and 7 3 again in fy 2020 5 c√¥te d ivoire gdp growth projection 2019 7 1 gdp growth projection 2023 6 7 cote d ivoire is heavily dependent on agriculture and related activities which engage roughly two thirds of the population cote d ivoire is the world s largest producer and exporter of cocoa beans and a significant producer and exporter of coffee and palm oil consequently the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for these products and to climatic conditions cocoa oil and coffee are the country s top export revenue earners but the country has targeted agricultural processing of cocoa cashews mangoes and other commodities as a high priority mining gold and exporting electricity are growing industries outside agriculture source the world factbook cia economic outlook the economy should remain in rude health this year bolstered by upbeat private consumption and increased fixed investment in addition exports are expected to rebound this year on the back of increased agricultural output and stable prices for cocoa political turmoil ahead of the 2020 presidential election remains the key downside risk however our panel sees growth at 7 1 in 2019 which is unchanged from last month s forecast and at 6 9 in 2020 6 cambodia gdp growth projection 2019 6 7 gdp growth projection 2023 6 1 cambodia has experienced strong economic growth over the last decade gdp grew at an average annual rate of over 8 between 2000 and 2010 and about 7 since 2011 the tourism garment construction and real estate and agriculture sectors accounted for the bulk of growth around 700 000 people the majority of whom are women are employed in the garment and footwear sector an additional 500 000 cambodians are employed in the tourism sector and a further 200 000 people in construction tourism has continued to grow rapidly with foreign arrivals exceeding 2 million per year in 2007 and reaching 5 6 million visitors in 2017 mining also is attracting some investor interest and the government has touted opportunities for mining bauxite gold iron and gems textile exports which accounted for 68 of total exports in 2017 have driven much of cambodia s growth over the past several years the textile sector relies on exports to the united states and european union and cambodia s dependence on its comparative advantage in textile production is a key vulnerability for the economy especially because cambodia has continued to run a current account deficit above 9 of gdp since 2014 economic outlook the garment and tourism sectors are expected to drive the economy this year further fueled by chinese fixed investment and public consumption nevertheless cambodia could lose its preferential market access to the eu which would hurt the garment sector while the slowdown in china could affect tourist arrivals our panelists expect the economy to expand 6 7 in 2019 which is unchanged from last month s forecast and 6 5 in 2020 7 myanmar gdp growth projection 2019 6 7 gdp growth projection 2019 7 3 since myanmar began the transition to a civilian led government in 2011 the country initiated economic reforms aimed at attracting foreign investment and reintegrating into the global economy myanmar s economic growth rate recovered from a low growth under 6 in 2011 but has been volatile between 6 and 7 2 during the past few years myanmar s abundant natural resources and young labor force have the potential to attract foreign investment in the energy garment information technology and food and beverage sectors the government is focusing on accelerating agricultural productivity and land reforms modernizing and opening the financial sector and developing transportation and electricity infrastructure the government has also taken steps to improve transparency in the mining and oil sectors through publication of reports under the extractive industries transparency initiative eiti in 2016 and 2018 source the world factbook cia economic outlook growth should be robust going forward although the slowdown in china could drag on activity the potential loss of preferential market access to the eu persistent twin deficits and the resurgence of violence in the rakhine state pose further downside risks to the outlook the panel sees growth at 6 7 in 2019 which is down 0 2 percentage points from last month s forecast and 7 1 in 2020 8 laos gdp growth projection 2019 6 7 gdp growth projection 2023 6 5 the government of laos one of the few remaining one party communist states began decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise in 1986 economic growth averaged more than 6 per year in the period 1988 2008 and laos growth has more recently been amongst the fastest in asia averaging more than 7 per year for most of the last decade laos economy is heavily dependent on capital intensive natural resource exports the economy has benefited from high profile foreign direct investment in hydropower dams along the mekong river copper and gold mining logging and construction although some projects in these industries have drawn criticism for their environmental impacts source the world factbook cia economic outlook economic growth is set to remain strong in 2019 on the heels of solid energy exports continued infrastructure spending and higher fdi inflows nevertheless vulnerability to external shocks persistent twin deficits and a slowdown in china a key trading partner represent the principal risks to the outlook focuseconomics consensus forecast panelists expect gdp to expand 6 7 in 2019 which is unchanged from last month s forecast and 6 8 in 2020 9 vietnam gdp growth projection 2019 6 6 gdp growth projection 2023 6 3 vietnam is a densely populated developing country that has been transitioning since 1986 from the rigidities of a centrally planned highly agrarian economy to a more industrial and market based economy and it has raised incomes substantially vietnam has a young population stable political system commitment to sustainable growth relatively low inflation stable currency strong fdi inflows and strong manufacturing sector source the world factbook cia economic outlook the economy should continue to grow at a robust albeit weaker pace in 2019 propelled by strong fdi inflows a burgeoning role as a manufacturing hub in the region and solid domestic demand however a more challenging trade environment amid persistent sino american trade tensions and cyclical slowdowns in the u s and china could dampen export prospects focuseconomics panelists project the economy expanding 6 6 in 2019 which is unchanged from last month s forecast and 6 4 in 2020 10 tanzania gdp growth projection 2019 6 3 gdp growth projection 2023 6 2 tanzania has achieved high growth rates based on its vast natural resource wealth and tourism with gdp growth in 2009 17 averaging 6 7 per year dar es salaam used fiscal stimulus measures and easier monetary policies to lessen the impact of the global recession and in general benefited from low oil prices tanzania has largely completed its transition to a market economy though the government retains a presence in sectors such as telecommunications banking energy and mining the economy depends on agriculture which accounts for slightly less than one quarter of gdp and employs about 65 of the work force although gold production in recent years has increased to about 35 of exports all land in tanzania is owned by the government which can lease land for up to 99 years proposed reforms to allow for land ownership particularly foreign land ownership remain unpopular economic outlook strong public investment spending solid credit growth and more favorable weather conditions should underpin growth this year higher infrastructure expenditure however could inflate fiscal and current account deficits while weakening investor sentiment clouds the outlook focuseconomics panelists expect gdp to expand 6 3 in 2019 which is unchanged from last month and 6 4 in 2020 11 philippines gdp growth projection 2019 6 3 gdp growth projection 2023 6 4 the philippines economy has been relatively resilient to global economic shocks due to less exposure to troubled international securities lower dependence on exports relatively resilient domestic consumption large remittances from about 10 million overseas filipino workers and migrants and a rapidly expanding services industry economic growth has accelerated averaging over 6 per year from 2011 to 2017 compared with 4 5 under the macapagal arroyo government and competitiveness rankings have improved although 2017 saw a new record year for net foreign direct investment inflows fdi to the philippines has continued to lag regional peers in part because the philippine constitution and other laws limit foreign investment and restrict foreign ownership in important activities sectors such as land ownership and public utilities source the world factbook cia economic outlook the economy is expected to expand at a solid pace in 2019 household spending should be buoyed by falling inflation robust remittances and a tighter labor market moreover fixed investment and government expenditures while expected to moderate from 2018 will continue to support growth slower growth in china and the region at large and the ongoing sino american trade spat remain the main risks to the outlook focuseconomics panelists see gdp expanding 6 3 in 2019 which is unchanged from last month s forecast and 6 2 in 2020 12 senegal gdp growth projection 2019 6 3 gdp growth projection 2023 7 9 senegal s economy is driven by mining construction tourism fisheries and agriculture which are the primary sources of employment in rural areas the country s key export industries include phosphate mining fertilizer production agricultural products and commercial fishing and senegal is also working on oil exploration projects it relies heavily on donor assistance remittances and foreign direct investment senegal reached a growth rate of 7 in 2017 due in part to strong performance in agriculture despite erratic rainfall senegal has few natural resources and is heavily reliant on foreign assistance it is highly exposed to rainfall variations and fluctuations in commodity prices yet the world bank considers it one of the most stable economies in africa and one of west africa s key economic hubs the country is a shipping and transport hub in the region and has one of the most developed tourism industries on the continent despite its economic stability and modest growth major risks to the economy include twin fiscal and current account deficits should the government continue its structural reforms the economy is expected to remain relatively stable however source the world factbook cia 13 china gdp growth projection 2019 6 2 gdp growth projection 2019 5 3 the chinese economy experienced astonishing growth in the last few decades that catapulted the country to become the world s second largest economy in 1978 when china started the program of economic reforms the country ranked ninth in nominal gross domestic product gdp with usd 214 billion 35 years later it jumped up to second place with a nominal gdp of usd 9 2 trillion since the introduction of the economic reforms in 1978 china has become the world s manufacturing hub where the secondary sector comprising industry and construction represented the largest share of gdp however in recent years china s modernization propelled the tertiary sector and in 2013 it became the largest category of gdp with a share of 46 1 while the secondary sector still accounted for a sizeable 45 0 of the country s total output meanwhile the primary sector s weight in gdp has shrunk dramatically since the country opened to the world economic growth soared in the last few decades mainly due to the country s increasing integration into the global economy and the government s bold support for economic activity however the successful economic model that lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty and fueled the country s astonishing economic and social development has also brought many challenges severe economic imbalances mounting environmental issues rising economic inequality and an aging population are the key questions that the new administration lead by president xi jinping will have to tackle in the near future in order to ensure the country s sustainability source focuseconomics economic outlook economic growth is set to decelerate this year on the back of previous efforts to tackle financial deleveraging and moderating global demand however fiscal and monetary easing are expected to cushion the economy against any sharp slowdown conversely a further deterioration in relations between china and the u s is the main downside risk focuseconomics panelists see the economy growing 6 2 in 2019 which is unchanged from last month s forecast before decelerating further to 6 0 in 2020 14 mongolia gdp growth projection 2019 6 2 gdp growth projection 2019 6 6 foreign direct investment in mongolia s extractive industries which are based on extensive deposits of copper gold coal molybdenum fluorspar uranium tin and tungsten has transformed mongolia s landlocked economy from its traditional dependence on herding and agriculture exports now account for more than 40 of gdp mongolia depends on china for more than 60 of its external trade china receives some 90 of mongolia s exports and supplies mongolia with more than one third of its imports mongolia also relies on russia for 90 of its energy supplies leaving it vulnerable to price increases remittances from mongolians working abroad particularly in south korea are significant source the world factbook cia economic outlook growth should remain strong this year powered by the oyu tolgoi copper mine expansion however the country is vulnerable to lower commodity prices due to slower global growth and a weaker chinese economy its main export market focuseconomics panelists see growth clocking at 6 2 in 2019 which is down 0 2 percentage points from last month s forecast and 5 9 in 2020 15 ghana gdp growth projection 2019 6 0 gdp growth projection 2019 5 1 ghana has a market based economy with relatively few policy barriers to trade and investment in comparison with other countries in the region and ghana is endowed with natural resources ghana s economy was strengthened by a quarter century of relatively sound management a competitive business environment and sustained reductions in poverty levels but in recent years has suffered the consequences of loose fiscal policy high budget and current account deficits and a depreciating currency agriculture accounts for about 20 of gdp and employs more than half of the workforce mainly small landholders gold oil and cocoa exports and individual remittances are major sources of foreign exchange expansion of ghana s nascent oil industry has boosted economic growth but the fall in oil prices since 2015 reduced by half ghana s oil revenue source the world factbook cia economic outlook solid growth will carry over into this year underpinned by robust household consumption and healthy investment activity growth on top of that the price outlook for ghana s key export commodities remains favorable boding well for the all important external sector nevertheless volatile energy and financial sectors as well as the uncertainty surrounding fiscal discipline after the imf bailout program ends in april pose key risks to the outlook focuseconomics panelists expect the economy to expand 6 0 in 2019 unchanged from last month s forecast and 5 7 in 2020

by ian shilling neoliberalism is corporatism neoliberal globalism is corporatism on a global scale corporatism is the merger of corporate and state power and the transfer of all wealth and power upwards towards the corporate oligarch elites it is a system of total corruption whereby power and wealth is used to buy corrupt politicians and bureaucrats to further transfer power and wealth upwards towards the corporate elites corporatism is also about reducing competition by creating monopolistic systems where a handful often around 6 of large corporations control 80 or more of a given market which then have the power to buy the politicians to determine the regulations that apply or are to be removed from their specific industry see the top 5 or 6 big banks in america or the largest 5 or 6 big banks in the uk or the 5 or 6 largest drugs companies in the world or the 5 or 6 largest media conglomerates that control over 80 of american mass media n b neoliberal globalist bill

dow chemicals and syngenta or the top 5 or 6 american arms makers bae systems is the only large arms company in the uk if we take the eu there are 4 or 5 the large weapons makers spend many millions of dollars every year bribing politicians to start exacerbate or prolong more conflicts and wars so they can sell more weapons etc etc we also have total monopoly positions in the central banking system the privately owned federal reserve controls the money supply interest rates and regulation in the us for the benefit of the big banks across the entire usa instead of each of the 50 states having their own state owned central bank controlling their own interest rates money supply and lending and competing with the other 49 states as to which has the best policies 10 things every american should know about the privately owned federal reserve themindunleashed com 2014 01 10 things everyone know federal reserve html the privately controlled bank of england which does the same thing in the uk the bank of england is not controlled by the uk government the controlling voting shares are held in a private company bank of england nominees the largest shareholders in both the federal reserve and the bank of england are the rothschild family the rothschilds are rarely mentioned in the media and it is certainly never mentioned just how wealthy and powerful they are controlling the financial system and buying politicians across the world and now we have the monopoly position of the ecb in the eurozone to control the money supply in europe again for the benefit of the big banks goldman sachs deutschebank etc the purpose of setting up the euro and the ecb was to set up a more monopolistic system to enhance the bankers control over europe and to greatly encourage more debt by artificially lowering interest rates in the eurozone periphery government debt corporate debt and personal debt it was a great success consigning large parts of europe and the vast majority of europeans into debt bondage to the big banks when a country rebels against neoliberalism corporate control debt bondage or austerity it is subjected to economic warfare and financial terrorism see greece in 2015 whose new government attempted to rebel against austerity but was then subjected to massive financial terrorism by the newly created ecb into total submission and slavery greece still hasn t recovered and is still suffering from massive unemployment and poverty due to the conditions imposed by the eu and the ecb or venezuela now which started to sell oil in something other than dollars in 2017 all of the privately owned financial system operates under the control of the bis bank of international settlements in switzerland which controls world wide financial regulation only a handful of countries currently have a government owned non bis controlled central bank these are syria iran north korea cuba and iceland before 2001 this list also included iraq and libya but did not include iceland venezuela started rebelling against this system in 2017 n b people often mistakenly also include russia china and even hungary on this list of independent central banks but this is not true russia has a privately owned central bank the russian central bank was privatized under yeltsin putin did kick out the big private american investment banks from operating in russia such as goldman sachs and merryl lynch in the early 2000 s but this is not the same thing jp morgan and goldman sachs have actually been increasing their investments in russia recently despite the sanctions we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us china has a government owned central bank but it operates under the control of the bis and world bank under wto rules china also kicked out the big western banks in the early 2000 s after previously allowing them in to study their methods hungary merely had a dispute with goldman sachs and severely limited its and other american banks operations in hungary russia and china started rebelling against the petrodollar system and the us monopoly control of the financial system in 2011 hence economic warfare and financial terrorism aka sanctions and actual war against its interests in syria and ukraine were started to be applied against russia from soon after this date russia and china are now building their own alternative financial systems to replace the us dollar controlled ones an alternative to the swift payment system their own independent credit cards and their own version of the world bank the aaib which is being used to fund china s new silk road trillion dollar economic and infrastructure development programs across asia and into europe italy has just joined the petrodollar system and the petrodollar wars explained ian56 blogspot com 2017 06 the petrodollar system and petrodollar html more on neoliberal globalism geopolitics and the war against russia and china ian56 blogspot com 2018 05 compendium of important articles on html the lobbying efforts by the neoliberal corporatists are often about introducing more regulations to introduce barriers to entry or other disadvantages to prevent smaller more nimble and more efficient smaller competitors from gaining a significant share of the market so we have massive regulations and huge costs if you want to set up a new bank we have regulatory capture of the american fda by the large food and drug companies regulatory capture of nice which controls which drugs are approved to be used by the nhs in the uk by the large drug companies bribing nice officials regulatory capture by the big banks of the american sec and the uk s fsa which are supposed to regulate financial services huge tax breaks for massive multinationals like amazon and starbucks but not for small local retailers or coffee shops amazon and starbucks pay near zero corporate taxes regulatory capture of the fcc in the us etc etc i challenge you to name me a large government agency that is supposed to regulate a large industry which has not been captured and controlled by the large corporations in that industry i don t know of one neoliberal control of all aspects of peoples lives is set to get even worse in the future if the neoliberal elites continue to operate unchallenged the eu is already planning mass censorship to prevent more people finding out about the eu with article 13 now article 17 twitter com ian56789 status 1097091134067826688 it is planning to force more budget and spending control over eu member states see the recent arguments by the eu over italy s mildly anti austerity budget proposals macron and merkel are pushing for an eu army which will be used to suppress internal dissent german troops will be used to oppress french civilians and vice versa etc who is this eu army going to fight a war with or defend against russia don t make me laugh defend the borders the eu haven t wanted to do this up until now why would they suddenly want to start the purpose is for internal domestic control the un has already passed the global compact for migration which is principally aimed at the eu and encourages unlimited illegal mass immigration forces eu countries to accept them and will be a huge burden to receiving countries in terms of welfare payments and the use of limited government resources such as healthcare education and housing accommodation at the expense of existing citizens the eu refugee crisis of 2015 was principally caused by the neocon wars since 2001 which have created the largest refugee crisis since ww2 and merkel encouraging illegal economic migrants to try and get into the eu by saying everyone welcome merkel is now trying to force the other eu countries to share the burden she herself created in 2015 the visegrad countries are refusing to go along with merkel and eu diktats which is causing ructions and arguments within the eu the purpose of the un migration pact is to keep poor and lower income europeans impoverished by suppressing real wages and provide a cheap source of labor for corporations to enhance corporate profits theresa may also signed up to this global migration pact in december 2018 which received zero coverage in mainstream media there were however large protests in brussels outside the eu office buildings against it but just like the recent massive yellow vest protests in france the protests in brussels were not shown on mainstream tv such as the bbc etc this has been a longstanding goal of the neoliberal globalists to destroy europe to achieve total control by the bankers see former senior goldman sachs exec and former un special representative for migration 2006 to 2017 peter sutherland note also how he disparages democracy and the popular will of the people by using the derogatory term populism the eu absolutely hates the new government in italy and the yellow vest protesters in france the eu s neoliberal solution to the eu s declining birth rate below replacement levels is to import millions more uneducated and unskilled illegal immigrants from the middle east and africa this is no solution at all after 3 years 95 of the over one million illegal immigrants who entered germany in 2015 and 2016 were still unemployed imposing massive burdens on the rest of the german population in welfare payments and the limited resources available in education healthcare and housing accommodation at the expense of the ordinary workers and taxpayers in germany there is no doubt that the neoliberal policies over the last 30 plus years have greatly exacerbated the declining birth rate in europe and the us the austerity programs in europe since 2009 have made the problem even worse ordinary people can no longer afford to have so many children and young people are being forced to live much longer at home because they cannot afford to buy or rent their own home due to higher housing rental costs and the higher paid ones have massive student debts the solution to declining birth rates is to make it easier for ordinary young people to afford children this would include reducing taxes on basic necessities such as electricity fuel government licenses such as annual vehicle taxes for cheap cars not gas guzzlers cheap basic clothes property taxes for cheap housing accommodation there are a whole range of government stealth taxes that disproportionately affect low income people reduce student debt i recommend lowering tuition costs and far fewer people going to college and far more people doing on the job training as was the case in years past with apprentices or student nurses etc without college fees students are racking up ever more student debt for increasingly worthless degrees reducing taxes for people who have 2 or more children viktor orban in hungary has just announced new measures where people who have four or more children pay no taxes for life he is also refusing to obey the eu diktats of accepting the brussels imposed quota of the 1 5 million illegal immigrants from 2015 2016 that brussels and merkel encouraged quite right let merkel and brussels pay for their own mistakes don t encourage them to make more needless to say the neoliberal dictators in the eu absolutely hate orban for putting the interests of ordinary hungarians first and refusing to obey brussels orban is smeared at every opportunity in the neoliberal globalist media such as the bbc the disastrous consequences of neoliberal polices are everywhere and very easy to see from increasing wealth and income inequality to falling birth rates to increasing poverty for the lower 90 to increasing social unrest as more and more people wake up and realize there is something terribly wrong with what s going on and government policies over the last 30 plus years its time we put an end to neoliberalism and consign it to the garbage can of history that means kicking the entire current system out tearing down the existing neoliberal institutions such as the eu and the federal reserve replacing the corporate media by making it go bankrupt and switching it off completely abandoning current and recent policies and putting in policies and systems that benefits the people and not the oligarchs the eu and the us are now the slowest growing economic areas in the entire world the reasons for this are very easy to understand new wealth is only going to the top 1 and increasingly the top 0 01 while the ordinary 95 or 98 of people become increasingly poorer the developing countries especially china and south asia have lifted large numbers of ordinary people out of poverty over the last 30 years china now has a large middle class that simply didn t exist 30 years ago we need to go back to expanding the middle class not actively destroying it massive amounts of wealth are also being wasted on war and militarism economic charts showing the transfer of wealth from the many to the few neoliberalism isn t working we need to ditch it
content sourced from the world gold council dr alan greenspan was chairman of the federal reserve from 1987 to 2006 and has advised government agencies investment banks and hedge funds ever since here he reveals his deep concerns about economic prospects in the developed world his view on gold s important role in the monetary system and his belief in gold as the ultimate insurance policy wgc in recent months concerns about stagflation have been rising do you believe that these concerns are legitimate ag we have been through a protracted period of stagnant productivity growth particularly in the developed world driven largely by the aging of the baby boom generation social benefits entitlements in the us are crowding out gross domestic savings the primary source for funding investment dollar for dollar the decline in gross domestic savings as a share of gdp has suppressed gross nonresidential capital investment it is the lessened investment that has suppressed the growth in output per hour globally output per hour has been growing at approximately ¬Ω annually in the us and other developed countries over the past five years compared with an earlier growth rate closer to 2 that is a huge difference which is reflected proportionately in the gross domestic product and in people s standard of living as productivity growth slows down the whole economic system slows down that has provoked despair and a consequent rise in economic populism from brexit to trump populism is not a philosophy or a concept like socialism or capitalism for example rather it is a cry of pain where people are saying do something help at the same time the risk of inflation is beginning to rise in the united states the unemployment rate is below 5 which has put upward pressure on wages and unit costs generally demand is picking up as manifested by the recent marked broad increase in the money supply which is stoking inflationary pressures to date wage increases have largely been absorbed by employers but if costs are moving up prices ultimately have to follow suit if you impose inflation on stagnation you get stagflation wgc as inflation pressures grow do you anticipate a renewed interest in gold ag significant increases in inflation will ultimately increase the price of gold investment in gold now is insurance it s not for short term gain but for long term protection i view gold as the primary global currency it is the only currency along with silver that does not require a counterparty signature gold however has always been far more valuable per ounce than silver no one refuses gold as payment to discharge an obligation credit instruments and fiat currency depend on the credit worthiness of a counterparty gold along with silver is one of the only currencies that has an intrinsic value it has always been that way no one questions its value and it has always been a valuable commodity first coined in asia minor in 600 bc wgc over the past year we have witnessed brexit trump s election victory and a decisive increase in anti establishment politics how do you think that central banks and monetary policy will adjust to this new environment ag the only example we have is what happened in the 1970s when we last experienced stagflation and there were real concerns about inflation spiraling out of control paul volcker was brought in as chairman of the federal reserve and he raised the federal fund rate to 20 to stem the erosion it was a very destabilising period and by far the most effective monetary policy in the history of the federal reserve i hope that we don t have to repeat that exercise to stabilise the system but it remains an open question the european central bank ecb has greater problems than the federal reserve the asset side of the ecb s balance sheet is larger than ever before having grown steadily since mario draghi said he would do whatever it took to preserve the euro and i have grave concerns about the future of the euro itself northern europe has in effect been funding the deficits of the south that cannot continue indefinitely the eurozone is not working in the uk meanwhile it remains unclear how brexit will be resolved japan and china remain mired in problems as well so it is very difficult to find any large economy that is reasonably solid and it is extremely hard to predict how central banks will respond wgc although gold is not an official currency it plays an important role in the monetary system what role do you think gold should play in the new geopolitical environment ag the gold standard was operating at its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries a period of extraordinary global prosperity characterised by firming productivity growth and very little inflation but today there is a widespread view that the 19th century gold standard didn t work i think that s like wearing the wrong size shoes and saying the shoes are uncomfortable it wasn t the gold standard that failed it was politics world war i disabled the fixed exchange rate parities and no country wanted to be exposed to the humiliation of having a lesser exchange rate against the us dollar than it enjoyed in 1913 britain for example chose to return to the gold standard in 1925 at the same exchange rate it had in 1913 relative to the us dollar us 4 86 per pound sterling that was a monumental error by winston churchill then chancellor of the exchequer it induced a severe deflation for britain in the late 1920s and the bank of england had to default in 1931 it wasn t the gold standard that wasn t functioning it was these pre war parities that didn t work all wanted to return to pre war exchange rate parities which given the different degree of war and economic destruction from country to country rendered this desire in general wholly unrealistic today going back on to the gold standard would be perceived as an act of desperation but if the gold standard were in place today we would not have reached the situation in which we now find ourselves we cannot afford to spend on infrastructure in the way that we should the us sorely needs it and it would pay for itself eventually in the form of a better economic environment infrastructure but few of such benefits would be reflected in private cash flow to repay debt much such infrastructure would have to be funded with government debt we are already in danger of seeing the ratio of federal debt to gdp edging toward triple digits we would never have reached this position of extreme indebtedness were we on the gold standard because the gold standard is a way of ensuring that fiscal policy never gets out of line wgc do you think that fiscal policy should be adjusted to aid monetary policy decisions ag i think the reverse is true fiscal policy is much more fundamental policy monetary policy does not have the same potency and if fiscal policy is sound then monetary policy becomes reasonably easy to implement the very worst situation for a central banker is an unstable fiscal system such as we are experiencing today the central issue is that the degree of government expenditure growth largely entitlements is destabilising the financial system the retirement age of 65 has changed only slightly since president roosevelt introduced it in 1935 even though longevity has increased substantially since then so the first thing we have to do is raise the retirement age that could cut expenditure appreciably i also believe that regulatory capital requirements for banks and financial intermediaries need to be much higher than they are currently looking back every crisis of recent generations has been a monetary crisis the non financial part of the us economy was in good shape before 2008 for example it was the collapse of the financial system that brought down the non financial part of the economy if you build up enough capital in the financial system the chances of serial contagious default are much decreased if we raised capital requirements for commercial banks for example from the current average rate of around 11 to 20 or 30 of assets bankers would argue that they could not make profitable loans under such circumstances office of the controller of the currency data dating back to 1869 suggests otherwise these data demonstrate that the rate of bank net income to equity capital has ranged between 5 and 10 for almost all the years of the data s history irrespective of the level of equity capital to assets this suggests we could phase in higher capital requirements overtime without decreasing the effectiveness of the financial system to be sure there would likely be some contraction in lending but arguably those loans should in all likelihood never have been made in the first place wgc against a background of ultra low and negative interest rates many reserve managers have been large buyers of gold in your view what role does gold play as a reserve asset ag when i was chair of the federal reserve i used to testify before us congressman ron paul who was a very strong advocate of gold we had some interesting discussions i told him that us monetary policy tried to follow signals that a gold standard would have created that is sound monetary policy even with a fiat currency in that regard i told him that even if we had gone back to the gold standard policy would not have changed all that much this article was sourced from this world gold council publication our free weekly precious metails email brings you weekly news of interest to precious metals investors

the perspective atlanta georgia march 22 2019 governance is a straightforward affair it is only made complicated when we infuse politics and veer off time tested principles that guide strengthen stabilize and define success in major capital market economies economics is not just about industry and the application of capital market instruments it heavily involves understanding the historical lessons that move those forces having a hands on appreciation for the historical aspects of economics is just as important as exercising the art itself in fact failing to understand the historical applications that drive the machine that is economics will place any country in a stagnated state like the one we have experienced in liberia for some 150 years in this piece i will lay out simple common sense approaches to address the failing state of the liberian economy i will provide clear instructions on how we can reverse the collapsing system and the growing rate of inflation that continue to burden everyday liberians first we must understand the role of government and the reasons for the institution thereof governments are set up to function like referees providing security law and justice equitability in the distribution of the country s resources and an enabling economic environment where each and every person can pursue and achieve her full potential government s role is not to provide employment howbeit welcomed if it does one of its primary duties is to set up and protect independent institutions that administer the affairs of government and ensures jobs and opportunities are available in the society for its citizens however governments must not be dormant throughout this process yes even in the free capital market system government must strategically salt and pepper the economy using free market principles and with expert advice exert logically controlled intervention policies to advance its desired objectives on the contrary countries in the third world and more specifically liberia have had staggeringly diverse developmental experiences simply because we have foolishly refused to employ the very economic principles that have taken developed countries to heights we can only imagine however delay in this case could actually work to our advantage because we could learn from their mistakes and develop a more robust system but first let s look at what other countries did when they were in our position take india and south korea for example before 1980 these countries were in a worse social economic state than we are in today they look like any third world country in fact some parts of india still look that way today by any standard both countries were extremely poor india s gni gross national income per capita was about 160 in 1980 dollars and south korea s stood at around 350 liberia s at this same time was 490 world bank with a much smaller population and more natural resources to make both countries salivate their life expectancy hovered around 45 years roughly 70 of their populations worked the fields accounting for 40 percent of their national incomes south korea was far worse off than india which had some infrastructure left by their colonial masters including railroad a relatively high literacy rate a competent judiciary and a system to guide their developmental process south korea had mostly peasant farmers these countries were so far behind the industrialized world that no economist worth his salt would have predicted or even conceive that either country would have attained a reasonable standard of living in the next 100 years in fact the west wrote these countries off like they do us today believing these places were too poor too far behind way too uneducated to be taken seriously or helped all they could do was to provide sustaining aid to somehow slow their downward spiral but these countries had other intentions in forty years a relatively short time countries which had rejected the orthodoxies of free market economics began to revisit them with serious and targeted intentions by the end of the 1980 s and through the implementation of free market principles south korea increased its per capita to 2 900 it stands at 30 000 today in contrast india s had only risen slightly today india gni is 1700 a respectable number when you consider their huge population of 1 3 billion people during this same period liberia s gni per capita dropped below 300 even the richer countries did not grow as fast as south korea and india during similar stages of their developmental period india and south korea achieved such meteoric rise because they avoided upward inflationary pressures by implementing policies that secured and increased their export commodities diversifying their export basket thus increasing their foreign reserves invested heavily in human capital development and had a grounded domestic capital market development strategy that was designed by their best and brightest citizens not untrained and untested loyalists there was no such thing as giving unprepared or outdated thinking individuals critical positions that lowered their chances for growth these countries central banks introduced policies that protected domestic markets from high interest rates hikes and debt servicing difficulties they created optimism and investment friendly climate in their respective countries increasing investors confidence and direct investment thus expanding their tax base to build needed national infrastructure such policies were not restricted to india and south korea however the rest of the super achievers of east asia also known as the dragons to include singapore taiwan and hong kong were implementing similar policies and experiencing equal exponential growth nevertheless the question now becomes how do we employ free market principles to attain the kind of growth the likes of south korea and the east asian dragons continues to enjoy and improve upon i first want to be clear about government intervention government involvement in the free market must be kept at a minimum its main focus here should be regulatory oversight a positive laissez faire intervention to curb inefficiencies and market failings government must stay clear of dirigisme an economic doctrine that promotes frequent and strong directive role by central government in the free market system the free market must operate in a mostly free and unencumbered way free from unnecessary or artificial influences let the market grow and adjust freely to what s happening to it it creates opportunities that force the market to expand on the other hand and in the case of liberia we must go back to the fundamentals first we must have a clearly defined economic recovery stability act this act must include economic stabilizing instructions that are tagged labeled and delegated to abled directors who must submit regular reports on progress and stated achievable along a pre established grid where we want to get in a set number of years secondly we must strictly follow the liberian constitution and amend it where it has not met modern standards of governance heck i will aggressively advocate that the government becomes constitutionally brutal in the application of the law the judiciary must play its role as intended consequently weigh free market principles with trained eyes and in the words of kwame nkrumah tailor your own style of government suited to its special circumstances to conform to your national vision let s begin this common sense approach by cutting the present government workforce by 40 only maintaining the most prepared we are all aware that the government is bloated it must be immediately deflated to ensure it does not suffer from economic constipation the liberian government will function more efficiently and on a balanced scale if this is done instead of focusing on who praises you and who doesn t the republic should be focused on the serious business of creating a feasible plan for meeting governance obligations managing expenses strategic allocations bringing officials compensation packages in line with gni in the country preventing waste spending less than you earn and reducing corruption in order to foster a sustainable economic future for the citizens of liberia we need economic and progressive ingenuity keep things simple and allow complex approaches only when you have upped you capabilities to address them stay committedly within the confines of your predetermined plans weigh your resources and direct them to address areas you have prioritized list areas of economic burdens and devise a plan to address their adverse effect on your objective do not lump them into one group but rather have separate directorship addressing each crucial area while at the same time remaining focused on the shared objective full economic revitalization treat your directors let your personal creditors have them create plans that guide us out of this trap of debt and economic instability appoint abled people not just people who meet the full spectrum of qualifications but people who are willing to quit and walk away if the leadership refuses to follow time tested economic instructions keep bootlickers and flunkeys far away from these positions you want to hear the entire truth of what is happening and what is required sycophants will do the opposite giving you illegal and illogical economic reports simply to appease remember appeasement has no place in economic revitalization or public administration only the truth will get the job done have confidence in your own abilities read more and be more knowledgeable than your lieutenants suspend and in some areas end all forms of consultancies these so called consultants cost the government millions in unnecessary advisory fees that add little and in most cases nothing to governance all these consultants do is compete with each other creating contradictory instruction plans while at the same time overstaffing their works to drive up billable hours the most ridiculous part is no one manages them to prevent such grandstanding and mystery accounting that siphon millions from liberia instead of freely giving away millions to services we don t need or use and being victims of financial shenanigans cut them off and re allocate the much needed funds to crucial areas such as agriculture education or infrastructure international financial grants that are followed by expats consultants must be looked at very carefully and be supervised with certain restrictions especially when it comes to the amounts that are paid to these tagalongs these amounts must be administered under liberian laws with full consideration for liberian citizens if the expertise exists bring liberians from overseas if you must the intent is to keep the monies in liberian hands and stop the give and take underhand donations dealings that are promoted by the wealthier countries this common sense approach must touch every sector of government there should be no sacred cows and no one should be spared yes including the president in fact the president must spearhead this process this process can only work if it s holistic and there is a national sacrifice made by all especially those in the highest echelon of government issue an executive order to reduce and cap all salaries and benefits across the entire government to no more than 2000 usd month a huge amount when you consider our per capita income of 700 annum no official s salary and all benefits should exceed this amount end gas slips rent for officials phone cards and such other choppings the legislature must immediately pass a law that ties salaries and benefits to the average civil servants salaries and benefits meaning no future raises of salaries or benefits by any branch of government can be done in isolation civil servants pays will be the common denominator there will be special cases exceptions however they must be approved by a sitting judge and be made public this should be the framework of the law do not be concern about losing people the opposite will be true keep in mind that less than 1 of liberians can earn more than 2 000usd month in the private sector and those who you attract will be those who truly want to serve and not fleece the country moreover liberia s long term economic sustainability depends on future investment and access to capital markets i cannot stress this enough investors weigh every decision speech perception and actions inactions by the leadership of our country nothing is taken lighted or ignored be fully cognizant of this and at all times and lead accordingly an economy is a very complicated system that balances not just industry humanity flow of capital but equally important is to be aware that it is a living breathing machine that must be oiled daily with tested decisions that keep the wheels spinning the individuals who oil those wheels must have an in depth appreciation of the overall inner working of that machine qualification matters hugely such is our economy most investors are very sophisticated and understand these intricacies of the economy their decisions to invest or not invest into a given location are informed by the weighted average of all those factors your job as a government is to be equally sophisticated so as to influence investors decisions to your favor by doing things they expect and are accustomed to back to one of the duties of governance creating an enabling environment where people feel comfortable to bring their money we must ask ourselves a few questions if we truly want to woo investors are our laws investors friendly is the cost of doing business comparable when measured regionally is the human capital developed enough to support what investors want how are the power supply issues in the country are basic infrastructure such as water and road adequate to support investment security court system and sovereignty risk issues what are the level of corruption and official interference the demanded bribe question the list is long but these are the crucial questions have we answered these questions favorably and in a sophisticated way to satisfy investors weighted average decisions to invest in our country if not what are our plans consider the following recommendations immediately address the investment friendly requirement listed above create investment friendly laws and implement them with sincerity investors are not your friends they owe you nothing except the legal costs of doing business remove artificial barriers that complicate the investment process investors do not have to see the president or legislators it terrifies them given historical records and from speaking with other investors yes they do talk officials do not have to have a stake in an investment simply because they hold an official position stop it be completely transparent and do not be seen with investors outside of official business except for at the ministry only dealings remove all perception even if you are doing nothing illegal finally but most importantly be uncompromisingly aggressive and immediate with legal enforcement and punishments against any official who contravenes these statutes be very public with prosecutions and punishments to maintain investors confidence our commercial courts must justly support this effort furthermore orthodox economics maintains that countries prosper through trade the application of orthodox principles in the 1960 s benefited the asian countries in an enviable way the dragons capitalizing on the advantages of cheap labor liberia has abundance of this diversified their export basket increased their exports developed a robust price system and increase their foreign exchange with which to buy investment goods from abroad to hasten their industrialization process let s use this historical lesson to beef up our economy because the principles still work institute a policy to gradually end all extractions of our non renewable natural resources to include iron ore gold timber diamond etc in 10 years close the mines why because we are being exploited and because our institutions are not developed enough to protect our interest save our resources until the capacity is developed and for our own industrialization purposes finally mine closures will force the government to focus in an area with the greatest potential reorient the entire liberian market to an agro based economy and prepare to look outward for growth to understand why this area will bring about the fasting development opportunities consider the following statistics liberia has one of the cheapest labor forces in the world capitalize on this the land and weather are perfectly suited to grow almost any commercial crop on an industrial scale liberia has a relatively small gdp gross domestic product 2 23b world bank an amount that can be easily replaced from the industrialization of just three crops like cassava butter pear avocado cocoa soybean bananas pineapple rice corn etc these crops bring in billions in revenue worldwide every year and are renewable we can plant to cut out our share their prices hardly ever drop mainly due to increasing demands caused by increasing world population and urbanization they are not like natural resources that experience huge price fluctuations we could literally put every liberian in the labor market to work in five years if we focus our efforts on agriculture the refusal to embrace the benefits of agriculture has been one of our greatest failures avoid the mistakes of most african countries which thought that their economies were inflexible and could not adjust to changing conditions or make a drastic move even though their current state of affairs was permanently stagnated in addressing our vulnerabilities to adverse economic events we must understand that the world has changed there are no more easy access to capital back to back world recessions high interest rates a drying up of external finances and declining prices for raw material have caused countries to hold on to their limited resources we must appreciate this reality and do all we can to limit the impact to our own economy by diversifying our export basket developmental strategy based on free market approach holds the view that macroeconomic stability outward trade addressing rising inflation limited interventionist tactics are crucial for rapid economic growth adding domestic enterprise and entrepreneurship to that list is equally fitting especially for a country such as ours that relies heavily on small businesses gear a large portion of your austerity measures toward local businesses to reinforce your economic revitalization efforts remove all quantitative restrictions and discourage monopolies protect your local businesses with subsidies and higher importation tariffs against goods that compete directly with locally produced commodities but keep your market open with fair and adequate regulations do not maintain state run institutions that are inefficient distort prices and provides near zero contributions on the contrary i will strongly advise that entities like lec liberia electricity corporation lprc liberia petroleum refinery corporation the freeport etc be immediately privatized stick with your primary role regulatory oversight and strengthening governance institutions the market will move itself the current state of affairs in liberia is very desperate and getting worse by the day set aside emotions and petty disagreements liberia is bleeding and directly confront this brewing storm with policies outlined in this article to arrest the coming recession and possible depression if nothing is done quickly the people will rise up because history says so posing serious sovereignty risk issues the fact is there is absolutely no way this weah led administration will complete its tenure if it does not quickly address the crumbling economy and put an end to industrial corruption let s table our political bickering ask for help and use common sense or else we will all fall to ruin about the author dualu is the author of several articles including the leveraging liberia s resources to lift the pro poor agenda and the modernization guide for liberia

putting dynamism in its place spring 2019 the phrase economic dynamism has become so ubiquitous its connotations so obviously desirable that we accept uncritically the dressing up of policy debates in its terms the standard narrative goes something like this disruption a close cousin of dynamism occurs when a new market entrant s superior offering or lower price allows it to displace an incumbent resources shift to this more productive use and both workers and consumers reap the benefit an economy featuring high levels of disruption is dynamic and with dynamism comes the innovation and economic growth that leads to rising material living standards for all the dynamists who tell this story speak confidently of its centrality to economic growth and of their ability to divine which policies will foster or frustrate it more economic dynamism is always better and so public policy must always be oriented toward nurturing it with of course the caveat that policy inherently constrains dynamism and so we should be skeptical of its use merely inquiring as to the basis or veracity of these axioms risks exposing oneself as unsophisticated and perhaps worst of all insufficiently pro growth but an inquiry is very much needed that disruption and dynamism can deliver enormous benefits is certainly true that poorly conceived policies can interfere with such benefits is equally true but the concepts involved are so vaguely defined and correlate so weakly to their stated objectives that they obscure and compound rather than illuminate and address our economic choices and challenges the problem is that disruption and dynamism are not ends unto themselves but means to the ends of higher worker productivity and widely shared economic prosperity and their effect is contingent on their form and on the presence of accompanying and at times opposing forces disruption offers no guarantee that disrupted resources will be re allocated effectively so embracing it blindly yields an overbroad endorsement of corrosion as well dynamism also relies upon the vitality of numerous social endowments and institutions to facilitate and channel it ensuring that it remains productive over time requires some deference to those forces even when they constrain it in the short run exhibit a for the complexity of these phenomena is international trade where the absolutist case for dynamism has been asserted most strongly and where it has proved most catastrophically incomplete trade offers a uniquely useful case study because the disruption itself originating outside the domestic economy is clearly disaggregated from any subsequent benefit a foreign producer supplanting a domestic one is disruption yes but do the disrupted resources shift to more productive uses and does the domestic economy s productive capacity increase maybe but maybe not especially if the trade is unbalanced and the domestic economy sees no commensurate increase in foreign demand for its own production the disruption is not inherently good or bad the context in which it occurs and the effects that ripple outward determine its valence the simple heuristic that the least constrained market is the most dynamic and thus produces the best outcomes turns out not to be a useful guide for policymakers to state the obvious though bizarrely controversial throwing people out of work and shuttering their businesses is not always good either for them and their families in the short run or for the nation and its economy in the long run where dynamism performs as advertised with the dislocation of disruption occurring alongside the emergence of new and better opportunities we need to celebrate it and defend it against those who would place protection of a particular job above progress for society but we also need to acknowledge that dynamism comes with costs and can malfunction a coherent and sustainable dynamism requires addressing not ignoring these limitations trade for good and ill trade delivers its benefits in several ways the standard mechanism taught in economics 101 is specialization where two parties have capabilities that make them better at different types of things they can both be more productive and create more output for consumption if they specialize where they are relatively better equipped this is true of next door neighbors where the accountant does both households taxes and the carpenter does both households repairs and it is true of the united states and mexico where one nation s climate is ideal for growing wheat the other s for growing avocados when american farmers abandon their struggling avocado orchards and mexican farmers their low yield wheat fields the disruption can be painful but when in conjunction the more productive american wheat farmers and mexican avocado growers gain new markets for their crops the net effect for both economies and their workers can be positive a second benefit which many economists now believe is more important in the international context is scale think of the carpenter who must buy a full set of tools even if just to maintain his own house but would prefer via trade to deploy his talents and equipment throughout the neighborhood likewise microsoft can expect far greater revenue and invest more in product development if its software will be bought not just in the united states but around the globe the third benefit is technological diffusion when producers come into contact they can learn from each other and competition can force both to become more effective an example of dynamism in action if the carpenter can work all around town instead of just in his neighborhood he will likely discover superior techniques that some of his peers use and seek to improve his time per job to match what they offer especially if they will be doing business in his neighborhood as well although the stiff competition from international automakers dealt harsh blows to detroit it compelled the introduction of products and processes that over time led to better domestic cars too through all these channels workers can become more productive while consumers can benefit from greater choice lower prices and more rapid innovation thanks to these effects the elimination of trade barriers and increase in international trade in the second half of the 20th century produced gains throughout the world above all in certain developing countries in the 1960s less than one quarter of global economic output traveled across international borders by 2003 that share had reached half as of 2015 it stood at nearly 60 yet trade is not without costs the parties trading almost certainly gain it is after all their choice to make an exchange if one measured prosperity solely in terms of consumption this might be the end of the story firms and people who once could buy things only on the domestic market now can also buy from the larger international market what s not to love but as irving kristol once observed where is it written that the welfare of consumers takes precedence over that of producers from the perspective of worker productivity the calculus is more complex in isolation opening the u s market to a global supply of labor could be cause for serious concern trade needs to be balanced for the anticipated dynamism to materialize and the net effect on the labor market to be positive only if the world buys more from the united states in tandem with the united states buying more from the world will workers not only face greater competition but also enjoy greater opportunity that balanced outcome is by no means guaranteed if trillions of dollars of foreign goods are flowing into the united states then americans must send back something in return but other countries might impose obstacles to american producers selling in their markets and instead acquire u s assets like stocks bonds and real estate for instance what if china sends 50 billion worth of electronics to the united states and we send 50 billion worth of u s treasury bonds back to china in colloquial terms china has sent the goods on credit american production is lower and government debt is higher such an imbalanced exchange is far from the model of prosperity enhancing free trade taught in economics classes it is disruptive yes but in ways that can reduce opportunities for workers lower the trajectory of their productivity and diminish the nation s real prosperity just such an imbalance has emerged in recent decades for instance in 2017 the united states traded 3 89 trillion in goods 1 55 trillion of exports and 2 34 trillion of imports which resulted in a roughly 800 billion deficit offset only in part by a 240 billion surplus on 1 32 trillion of services trade of that 3 89 trillion in goods about 20 was in goods dependent on agriculture or natural resources where differing national endowments would make one country or another an obvious importer or exporter trade of this type was balanced 394 billion of imports against 339 billion of exports 43 product categories with net imports and 43 with net exports by contrast for the 80 of trade in manufactured products americans bought 1 60 of imports for every 1 of exports sold overseas 1 86 trillion in imports against 1 16 trillion in exports overall 120 product categories with net imports and 53 with net exports of the 22 product categories with a surplus or deficit of at least 10 billion 21 ran deficits the only manufactured product that the united states exports significantly more of than it imports is airplanes the u s trade deficit in advanced technology is particularly stunning balanced trade might include a large deficit in unsophisticated manufacturing that relies heavily on low cost unskilled labor offset at least in part by american exports of more sophisticated products yet the united states is a net importer even of what the u s government designates as advanced technology products importing 464 billion against 354 billion of exports in 2017 in addition to airplanes american exports do exceed imports in weapons and flexible manufacturing tools but the nation is a net importer of biotechnology life sciences computers and electronics advanced materials including semiconductors and even nuclear technology this imbalance has not happened by accident countries like south korea taiwan and japan have achieved rapid growth in part through mercantilist policies that aggressively subsidized and promoted their strategically important industries on the global stage while preventing foreign for instance american producers from selling in their markets today china is the primary practitioner of this kind of mercantilism and its gargantuan scale is producing unprecedented economic distortions china s litany of abuses is by now well known the world trade organization limits the explicit protectionism of tariffs but china subsidizes its own producers while throwing roadblocks in the path of foreign competitors arbitrary regulations discrimination in government contracting and requirements for partnerships with local firms and for the use of local components it also facilitates intellectual property theft on an unprecedented scale which general keith alexander former head of the national security agency and u s cyber command and admiral dennis blair former director of national intelligence have called the greatest transfer of wealth in history as the new york times reported in early 2017 china has charted out a 300 billion plan to become nearly self sufficient by 2025 in a range of important industries from planes to computer chips to electric cars the so called made in china 2025 program would provide large low interest loans from state owned investment funds and development banks assistance in buying foreign competitors and extensive research subsidies already rolling off the assembly line china s c919 commercial aircraft a direct competitor to boeing s 737 built conveniently through at least 16 joint ventures for avionics flight control power fuel and landing gear the c919 made its first test flight in may 2017 and by early 2018 had accumulated almost 800 orders computer chips potato chips to the untrained observer it might seem self evidently harmful to both send away the labor intensive industrial employers that sustain communities and forfeit leadership in the industries that might play such a role in the future especially if the result is to become increasingly more indebted in the process why does everyone stand and cheer as the heart of america s dynamic economy parades away dynamists dismiss such concerns as resistance to disruption one can t make an omelet without breaking a few communities after all and as harvard professor greg mankiw assured his new york times readers full employment is possible with any pattern of trade the main issue is not the number of jobs but which jobs americans should work in those industries in which we have an advantage compared with other nations and we should import from abroad those goods that can be produced more cheaply there mankiw s formulation is telling have an advantage equals produce more cheaply trade s disruption need not bear any relationship to boosting worker productivity it operates to deliver consumers the lowest possible prices concern for the long term falls by the wayside in this perspective assuming away differences between industries in employment profiles growth trajectories opportunities for productivity improvement and spillovers to broader research ecosystems and supply chains rejecting the feeling that it s better to produce real things than services christina romer council of economic advisers chair under president obama observed in the new york times american consumers value health care and haircuts as much as washing machines and hair dryers or as michael boskin chairman of george h w bush s council of economic advisers reportedly said computer chips potato chips what s the difference this unreflective presumption that disruption on consumers behalf always ends well is myopic in the aggregate at the national level imbalanced trade places the economy on a lower trajectory in the short run it reduces productive capacity it also allocates both human and physical capital away from industries that hold the most potential for the future and it builds industrial ecosystems and supply chains outside the united states which will make future efforts to regain a competitive foothold more difficult he products a country makes today explains the economist describing research conducted by harvard professor ricardo hausmann and mit professor c√©sar hidalgo determine which products they will be able and likely to make tomorrow through the evolution of their capabilities what begins as a distortion or imbalance becomes genuine advantage as supply chains and know how embed in the countries that have seized them frustratingly the same consumer focused advocates who dismissed the strategic value of retaining industrial strength and regarded concern for its departure as anti dynamism now also dismiss the possibility of restoring industrial strength on the ground that it has become too firmly entrenched elsewhere the massive advantages of established supply chains and built expertise now preclude american led disruption and stand as obstacles to future american growth and dynamism itself when apple attempted to manufacture its mac pro in austin texas several years ago it couldn t even source enough screws the effects of imbalanced trade come home to roost for individuals and their communities in their local labor markets mankiw rightly defines the issue as not the number of jobs but which jobs but which jobs do americans lose and which do they gain if trade is imbalanced and other nations are dominating the most promising industries presumably other jobs have not been available to them all along in which they could have been working more productively nor can we simply presume that the domestic labor market will be generating new demand especially in the absence of export growth commensurate to the import surge the new jobs could well be ones in which workers are less productive and that will provide less opportunity for gains over time furthermore where unbalanced trade reduces the american economy s output of the tradeable goods and services that can be produced in one place and sold to another the suggestion that workers shift into the services economy is unhelpful americans take for granted that they can buy what products they want from around the world but how can someone whose work consists entirely of serving others in his community expect a firm halfway around the world to make something for him tradeables are the keystones of local economies consider the local physician who provides care only to those in his town he may be well compensated but he can t sell his work to the makers of cars or phones in asia or even to the medical equipment supplier in the next state he must trust instead that some of his patients produce goods or services that can be sent to those places and in purchasing his medical services give him the resources to acquire the goods that he needs or consider the plight of a local economy as a whole it wishes to receive from elsewhere almost all of its food medicine vehicles electronics energy and more so it must send tradeables of equal value not every individual must do so most may work in the local services economy but they cannot all just cut one another s hair tradeables can take many forms wall street provides its financial services around the country and the world hollywood exports its movies orlando sells the disney world experience to tourists call center workers are exporters too but manufactured products represent by far the largest category of tradeables and are along with agriculture and natural resources the ones in which less skilled workers and less urban locations are best suited to excel the strength of the industrial economy dictates the fortunes of workers with a comparative advantage in physical activity and regions with a comparative advantage in open spaces and raw materials the importance of tradeables to a local community also helps to illuminate the vast difference between the often equated phenomena of automation and globalization for the worker dislocated by trade the facility in which he once worked is likely gone and the production now occurs somewhere else but for the worker laid off or never hired because of automation the facility is still operating in town likely producing more output than before total demand for labor from the firm and its surrounding ecosystem is likely larger and if capital has replaced labor the remaining workers are likely earning more and some other highly paid professionals may be arriving in the area with new demand for services of their own furthermore while productivity gains occur bit by bit year by year a plant that shuts down and moves overseas is here today and gone tomorrow in which situation might it be easier to find a new well paying job a reporter telling the story of automation speaks to a laid off worker at a lunch counter one telling the story of trade reports from the empty parking lot of an abandoned building there is no one left to talk to the installation of a robot and the offshoring of a production line may appear similarly disruptive in the abstract but their economic effects differ radically an economy that aggressively offshores and one that aggressively automates may both appear equally dynamic in the moment but only one is likely to still look dynamic a decade later securing a productive dynamism if disruption can corrode dynamism and dynamism untended can undermine itself then the least constrained market achieving the greatest efficiency and best satisfying the consumer at a moment in time may not in fact be the ideal or the appropriate objective for public policy attention to the social and economic conditions necessary to a productive dynamism will be critical to its sustainability and success even when that attention shifts focus in other directions or indicates policies that might impinge on the market at first glance such a focus can seem to invite big government or imply a rejection of dynamism per se but we should demand greater nuance from policymakers and pundits alike consider the patent the government awards a patent to an inventor which allows him to exclude others from using his invention for a period of years even the fiercest libertarian often especially the fiercest libertarian will defend this rule as crucial to a well functioning market without patent protection if people could freely use each other s inventions what incentive would anyone have to spend the time and money developing something new this seems like a fairly obvious assumption even if empirical research calls into question whether stronger patent protection necessarily correlates with higher rates of innovation stipulating that patents equal innovation notice what this implies a rule that obstructs transactions suppresses output and raises prices for consumers in the short run can also be the rule that is best for the market and for society over time things become even more complicated when we introduce an international boundary and conflicting legal regimes we protect patents on new drugs but what should we do when drug makers voluntarily sell those patented drugs in canada at prices far below what they charge in the united states because the canadian government requires the lower price should someone be allowed to buy the drug in canada and then re sell it in the united states undercutting a drug maker s american price we call this drug re importation and we prohibit it again on the basis of bolstering the free market again with strong support from libertarians some politicians will offer a rationale of safety as if we can t trust canadians to monitor their drug supply as well as we do the actual rationale is that we wish to insulate what we consider to be our freer market in drugs from contamination by the more controlled canadian market canada is hardly the archetypal case of market distortion take china s industrial policies which ignore intellectual property law entirely and flood producers with subsidies too if re imported drugs from canada are a problem why not artificially cheap chinese products what if the chinese government reimburses its producers for the cost of licensing patented technology so that those companies can behave as if there are no patents at all should products made that way be allowed into the united states the point is not that these questions are easy but that they are hard they represent policy choices necessary to the management of a free market and the advancement of a productive dynamism but these are not situations in which a particular choice moves us obviously closer to a free market ideal or where such an ideal would necessarily achieve the best outcome if expanding trade merges a decidedly unfree market with our own then we will have to choose between the freest of trade and the freest of markets we cannot have both the patent is but one tool in the innovation policy belt the major technological breakthroughs that power productivity gains and rising living standards often entail disruption but they also frequently depend on aggressive government action the defense sector especially in times of military conflict has proved a major contributor to innovation as has the space program the health care sector for all the laments about intrusive regulation and the dominance of medicare and medicaid as purchasers of products and services provides frequent life saving breakthroughs that are often cited as the most important achievements of economic growth and they are funded directly through the national institutes of health and other research grants and indirectly through the government s participation as a payer silicon valley meanwhile for all its veneration in the popular culture may be more adept at producing parody worthy uses of the word disruption than genuine examples as mark mills has observed in city journal researchers at bell labs won eight nobel prizes while ibm won five no one funded by a valley company has achieved that feat while california s initial wave of hardware and semiconductor firms delivered genuinely new technology today s giants do not google with its search engine facebook with its social network and apple with its smartphone each built a specific product that proved a cash cow yielding massive profits none has managed to invest those profits in subsequent research and development that yielded a second act in 2010 longtime intel ceo andy grove described in bloomberg businessweek how america s technology ecosystem was suffering from its eagerness to offshore manufacturing and argued that the result was the departure of innovation as well silicon valley is a community with a strong tradition of engineering and engineers are a peculiar breed he observed they are eager to solve whatever problems they encounter if profit margins are the problem we go to work on margins with exquisite focus each company ruggedly individualistic does its best to expand efficiently and improve its own profitability however our pursuit of our individual businesses which often involves transferring manufacturing and a great deal of engineering out of the country has hindered our ability to bring innovations to scale at home without scaling we don t just lose jobs we lose our hold on new technologies losing the ability to scale will ultimately damage our capacity to innovate he cited specifically his concern about the advanced battery ecosystems that would be crucial to electric vehicles because america had lost its lead in batteries as electronics manufacturing migrated overseas u s companies did not participate in the first phase and consequently were not in the running for all that followed i doubt they will ever catch up in a narrow sense he was wrong boosted by massive federal subsidies tesla motors became an industry leader and constructed its massive battery gigafactory in nevada but more broadly he was exactly right in july 2018 tesla reached a deal to build its second electric vehicle plant in shanghai not the united states supported by a 50 investment from the chinese government that would include free land its shanghai gigafactory is now under construction as well who would bet that 10 years hence the majority of tesla manufacturing will still occur on this side of the pacific disruption represents only half of the dynamism equation the desirable dynamism that moves workers and resources toward more productive uses requires two components disruption of the status quo and a labor market that generates new opportunities in an ideal case these might occur together for instance a firm finds new products or processes to deploy its workers toward essentially disrupting itself with its own resources but often as the trade example illustrates the two effects are disconnected in that case for disruption to yield a productive dynamism it must occur against the backdrop of other firms and entrepreneurs searching constantly for new and more productive ways to deploy existing workers in a society capable of facilitating that redeployment disruption into a healthy labor market boosts dynamism otherwise it begets corrosion the same problem of imbalance that presents itself so starkly in the international context is present in the domestic market as well america s economic dynamism has exhibited a skills bias with disruptions tending to emerge in the form of new production by highly educated workers that dislocates less educated workers the second step re allocation of those workers to more productive uses has been lacking and dislocated workers have often found themselves pushed into less productive work than they previously performed in aggregate the economy s productivity and output may be higher but that is little consolation to society s struggling segments under these conditions dynamism produces a narrow prosperity and must rely upon redistribution to lift all boats which is a far cry from the widespread productivity gains and prosperity that we expect and need dynamism to deliver enthusiasm for policies that strengthen the labor market and focus investment on boosting worker productivity not just in aggregate but for less productive workers in particular must accompany enthusiasm for disruption in any discussion of economic dynamism this complicates matters because those two objectives may be in tension and thus a balance must be found between them consider for instance a new business that deploys large numbers of unskilled unproductive low wage guest workers to deliver a service more cheaply than an existing business that employs fewer workers at a higher wage this is disruptive the emergence of the new business and the bankruptcy of the old one would score high on traditional measures of dynamism consumers would benefit but the end result may be more workers in less productive roles than had the guest workers never arrived conversely without access to guest workers a model that boosted the productivity of existing workers would have offered the new business s investors a more feasible path to successful disruption likewise in education outcomes for young people who never finish college may seem unimportant to the pursuit of disruption but if dynamism requires both disruption and the productive re allocation of those disrupted effective pathways into the labor force for less educated workers become critical and as in the guest worker example the construction of such pathways is doubly important because it increases the likelihood that entrepreneurs pursuing disruption will want to use existing workers to achieve it that form of disruption is inherently more dynamic than one that leaves the disrupted workers behind even organized labor often regarded as the hobgoblin of dynamism can play a constructive role in helping to facilitate the effective resource re allocation that must accompany disruption america s depression era unions are plainly ill suited to the role and as institutions have no interest in playing it but the american model is a sclerotic outlier especially as compared to european models in which independent worker organizations focus on redeploying dislocated members and firm based works councils create the space for collaborative arrangements between management and labor that prioritize productivity gains rather than celebrating labor s demise as a victory for their vision dynamists should be leading the effort to find a replacement that could help to ensure the economy delivers on their promises individual firms need the freedom to pursue productivity gains even at the expense of workers but someone needs to represent and insist upon the interests of workers economy wide implicitly dynamists do acknowledge that a productive dynamism demands more than merely disruption when they lament barriers to rapid adjustment in the labor market the lesson to learn from the so called china shock the argument goes is that america needs more and better training programs higher levels of geographic mobility fewer occupational licensing requirements and a safety net that pushes people toward the workforce that all may be true as far as it goes but it errs in disconnecting deeply interrelated phenomena the rate and nature of adjustment is not exogenous it is dictated in large part by the same conditions that drive disruption in the first place and by the type of disruption that occurs no one should be shocked that adjustment fails when all the same forces catalyzing the disruption are also ones that discourage investment in less educated domestic workers and business models that employ them no serious effort to restore productive dynamism can leave disruption s side of the equation untouched dynamism rightly understood rebalancing the conversation in these ways runs afoul of the diktat that policymakers must not interfere with dynamism given its extraordinary power to deliver prosperity that reasoning is circular of course beginning from the assumption that dynamism has such an effect policymakers should stand aside but for situations where it does not deliver on its promise the presumption makes no sense an active policy response is pro dynamism for the long run does discussion of the policy environment that will facilitate the highest levels of economic dynamism and the most broad based prosperity over time risk embarrassment for the dynamists who have offered unequivocal support for economic forces that are now delivering mixed results at best well yes and that is cause for some concern they have struggled mightily to convey the complicated but important idea that disruption and dynamism while costly to those affected can be worthwhile and ultimately beneficial the argument s past success owed much to its straightforward and universal applicability disruption and dynamism are always good and more is always better to admit error in that assertion and insist on drawing finer distinctions invites protectionists of all stripes to argue that disruption of their preferred status quo is the bad kind but the embarrassment has already occurred the mistakes of an absolutist approach have been laid bare by a 40 year stagnation in median wages and even worse results for struggling segments of the population and for less educated men in particular the concentration of dynamism s benefits into ever narrowing geographic pockets and the plainly disastrous results that unconstrained trade with china has had for millions of people and the national economy s industrial strength no one believes that more disruption is always good or that dynamism automatically equals prosperity nor should they the choice we face is therefore not between reassertion of the old orthodoxy and grappling with our challenges it is between grappling with our challenges and abandoning the field building a better model that is more correct that persuades and that produces a healthier labor market that can co exist in a symbiotic relationship with disruption is the only option for sustaining the genuine dynamism we all want to see
over a year since the opec deal to cap oil production was announced we thought it would be interesting to take a look at the latest news and forecasts on oil prices and how top oil producing countries economies are performing in light of it all thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe as is often the case with the energy sector crude oil has been at the forefront of the news of late for the last few years the story has centered on the global crude oil price plunge that started back in mid 2014 eventually bottoming out in january of 2016 falling to the lowest level in over a decade uncertainty over the health of the global economy as well as the feared economic slowdown in china that began in mid 2015 led to a decline in global demand and consumption of oil oil producers continued output desperately trying to gain precious market share from others in the sector even as prices continued to fall an agreement to freeze production between major oil producers speaheaded by saudi arabia and russia finally came to frution in late november of 2016 which caused oil prices to rally at the end of 2016 into 2017 prices were sent skyrocketing after the deal announcement was made and prices gradually increased throughout 2017 as members of the deal cut production in addition to a little help from increased political tensions in the mena region during the year the deal was later extended through december 2018 with oil prices steadily increasing that opec members have proved compliant has surprised the markets which had initially doubted they would adhere to the cuts a substantial volume of oil has been taken off the market however the drop in global inventories has been slow given rising u s stocks the international agreement to cut crude output has reinvigorated rivals in the u s shale industry which has undermined the efforts of saudi arabia and russia indeed some analysts have speculated that deal may be abandoned before december 2018 especially as internal conflicts between saudi arabia and iran ramp up once again focuseconomics analysts expect brent crude oil prices to average usd 63 1 per barrel in q4 2018 and wti crude oil prices to average usd 59 6 per barrel in q4 2018 so with all of the above said how are the top oil producing country s economies expected to perform this year amid all this news surrounding oil let s take a look united states the economy looks poised to have recorded its best performance in over three years in the second quarter fueled notably by recent tax cuts and strong consumer dynamics however growth may have reached its peak as mounting trade concerns heighten risks to the outlook average retail sales growth in q2 reached a 6 year high supported by robust consumer confidence and an improving labor market throughout the quarter with labor participation rising in june meanwhile industrial output recorded solid increases in each of the three months of the second quarter on the other hand survey data for june shows heightening concerns about supply side strain magnified by the sizeable uncertainty caused by recent escalations in trade tensions and tariff measures this uncertainty will likely drag on growth going forward particularly if the u s administration goes ahead with tariffs on usd 200 billion of additional chinese goods as unveiled on 10 july an expected increase in federal outlays resulting from the budget deal should support growth this year and the next an effect that will be compounded by the tax rewrite approved last december household spending is also projected to benefit from a sturdy labor market and solid housing gains while business investment should remain resilient on fiscal stimulus and stronger global growth focuseconomics panelists see gdp expanding 2 6 in 2018 which is unchanged from last month s estimate in 2019 growth is seen moderating to 2 2 russia incoming data suggests that economic momentum held up in the second quarter after gdp growth accelerated at the start of the year higher oil prices are buttressing the all important energy sector and export growth was firm in april and may in addition the unemployment rate remained at a multi year low in june and retail sales growth picked up in the same month buoyed by world cup related spending on the political front president vladimir putin stated on 20 july that a planned increase in the retirement age would be reviewed the legislation had provoked widespread protests earlier in the month although analysts argue it is necessary to combat the effects of an ageing workforce and improve the sustainability of the pension system growth is expected to pick up this year thanks to strengthening private consumption and firmer oil prices an improving labor market and low inflation should buoy household spending while higher commodity prices will support export growth that said high geopolitical uncertainty and the possibility of further economic sanctions remain key risks to the outlook focuseconomics consensus forecast panelists see gdp expanding 1 7 in 2018 which is unchanged from last month s forecast in 2019 growth is seen steady at 1 7 saudi arabia the economic recovery is gathering pace mostly due to opec s decision to increase oil production in order to keep markets adequately supplied and high oil prices which have stoked activity in the all important oil sector moreover the recovery is broadening as the impact of the vat implemented in january fades and gains from the recovery in the oil sector are slowly trickling down to the rest of the economy the non hydrocarbon pmi hit a six month high in june while credit growth and foreign reserves improved in q2 higher production and oil prices are also translating into an improvement in the government s fiscal position and the current account balance which recorded a healthy surplus in q1 on the flip side the government s saudization policy which is expelling foreign workers could create labor shortages in some sectors while the crackdown on corruption implemented last year is deterring investment and spurring capital outflows rising oil production and higher prices for the black gold will fuel this year s economic recovery however the vat implementation that disrupted activity at the outset of the year persistent regional threats and domestic political unrest will weigh on growth this year focuseconomics consensus forecast panelists expect growth of 1 7 in 2018 which is up 0 1 percentage points from last month s projection in 2019 growth is seen picking up pace to 2 3 canada canada s economy appears to have held up reasonably well through the first half of the year despite the slowdown in consumer spending in the first quarter although growth in april was modest as cold weather hit retail trade it beat expectations on solid manufacturing gains higher interest rates and new mortgage lending rules continued to pinch consumers in the second quarter although recent employment gains likely provided some upside for household spending meanwhile housing metrics have begun to stabilize after falling off for much of the past year leaving policymakers to breathe a cautious sigh of relief nevertheless external headwinds are picking up canada u s trade relations are at an all time low and the possibility of additional tariffs on automotive exports would bruise the external sector furthermore recent posturing suggests that wrapping up nafta renegotiations before year end is currently all but off the table despite this exports and investment both seem largely unshaken so far firm economic fundamentals are expected to support a solid outturn this year although household spending is seen moderating as higher interest rates squeeze indebted consumers tight labor market dynamics should cushion wages oil and gas exports as well as stronger non residential investment are expected to lend support risks to the outlook persist however nafta remains in limbo and the housing market is still fragile focuseconomics analysts expect growth of 2 1 in 2018 unchanged from last month s forecast and 1 9 in 2019 iraq protests broke out in july after iran decreased its energy exports to iraq intensifying the effects of the heat wave protesters also vented frustration over rising unemployment corruption and government policies demonstrators blocked roads to oil fields in the south and the prostest will likely dent the country s growth prospects in h2 the situation is compounded by political gridlock more than two months after general elections a new government has yet to be formed more positively however recently released data showed the economy performed fairly well in the first quarter of the year thanks to a strong oil sector which was buoyed by increased output and higher barrel prices this year the economy should benefit from higher oil prices however protests could significantly dent economic activity particularly if they become more prolonged in addition a large fiscal deficit and a long government formation process cloud the outlook focuseconomics panelists expect growth of 2 4 in 2018 up 0 1 percentage points from last month s forecast and 3 9 in 2019 iran tensions between iran and the u s have intensified in recent weeks ahead of two waves of u s sanctions scheduled for august and november adding downward pressure on growth which already slowed sharply in sh 2017 in response the iranian government vowed to retaliate by imposing a blockade on gulf oil exports if sanctions materialize the rial has continued to plunge and hit a record low against the dollar on the unregulated market this week following a dramatic sell off on 25 july president hassan rouhani replaced central bank governor valiollah seif with abdolnaser hemmati who will be in charge of halting the slide of the rial further cabinet reshuffling could follow as the government grapples with a deepening economic crisis iran s uncertain economic outlook continues to reflect looming sanctions moreover growing social unrest and mounting inflationary pressures could exacerbate the economic quagmire focuseconomics consensus forecast panelists see growth at 2 7 in sh 2018 down 0 1 percentage points from last month s estimate in sh 2019 growth is expected to slow to 0 9 china authorities efforts to curb shadow banking and support financial deleveraging weighed on growth in q2 amid rising trade tensions with the united states on 6 july the united states imposed tariffs on usd 34 billion worth of chinese imports china immediately retaliated with corresponding tariffs on 11 july president trump s administration released a list of 10 tariffs on an additional usd 200 billion of chinese goods likely to be enforced in two months chinese officials stated that the country will take unspecified measures to counter this threat which could include non tariff barriers as china imports only around 150 billion from the u s the actual impact of ongoing trade disputes with the united states will start to be seen this month especially in manufacturing activities and logistics global and domestic headwinds are expected to impact growth in h2 and beyond the brewing full blown trade war between china and the united states is the main downside risk to the country s economic outlook domestic threats however including a cooling property market and financial deleveraging are also building focuseconomics panelists forecast the economy will grow 6 5 in 2018 which is unchanged from last month s forecast in 2019 the economy is seen expanding 6 3 united arab emirates economic activity appears to have been robust in q2 supported by a pick up in oil production recent pro business reforms and solid activity in the non oil sector the pmi rose to its highest level of the year in june while in the same month the uae exceeded its opec oil production target for the first time in 2018 new policies implemented in recent months including a visa reform in may a joint investment plan with saudi arabia a large stimulus package in abu dhabi and several measures aimed at cutting red tape and increasing the ease of doing business have also been supportive of business confidence which hit the highest level on record in the june pmi moreover while employment growth remained negligible throughout the quarter it appears poised to increase in q3 as backlogs of work have reached historic highs on july 29 the abu dhabi government announced it would allow gcc nationals to apply for its business license scheme without requiring an office and increased the scope of eligible industries in a bid to reduce firm set up costs and further attract new businesses growth in the non oil economy should accelerate this year on the back of strong investment notably the large infrastructure push underway as part of the country s preparation to host the 2020 world expo recent business friendly reforms and stimulus and a new investment law to be unveiled in q4 which will authorize complete foreign ownership of firms in select sectors will likely buttress investor confidence and provide a large boost to fdi inflows in addition the country can count on the dynamism of its tourism sector especially in dubai focuseconomics panelists expect gdp to increase 2 6 in 2018 which is unchanged from last month s forecast and 3 2 in 2019 brazil weak economic data continues to roll in for the second quarter confirming that the nationwide truckers strike derailed the recovery economic activity recorded the largest contraction on record in may retail sales plunged in the same month and the manufacturing pmi fell into contractionary territory in june however the shock should be temporary seeing as the strike ended in early june and leading data for after the strike has shown some improvement in the political arena five centrist parties declared in july that they would back center right brazilian social democracy party candidate geraldo alckmin in the october election which should boost his chances moreover the combination of parties supporting him will give alckmin who is regarded as the most market friendly candidate an edge against his competitors as he will consequently receive the largest tv airtime during the campaign the latest opinion polls prior to the announcement placed him in fourth place brazil s growth forecast was chopped for a third consecutive month as the truckers strike a less supportive global backdrop and higher oil prices dent the country s outlook focuseconomics panelists now see the economy growing 1 7 this year down 0 2 percentage points from last month s forecast a market friendly outcome to october s election remains critical to ensuring a sustainable recovery however this is far from certain next year gdp is seen growing 2 5 kuwait economic growth likely firmed up in q2 and the start of q3 after q1 s modest recovery following opec s decision to raise oil production starting in july kuwait has begun to ramp up exports as deals to increase supply of light crude oil to several asian countries are underway the economy continues to benefit from the oil price rally which should improve both the fiscal and current account balances improved dynamics in the oil sector however could result in further delays in economic reforms aimed at bolstering the non oil economy parliament has shown reluctance to impose reforms including the introduction of a vat with the economic recovery well underway the outlook for this year and next remains positive stronger domestic demand underpinned by a pick up in both fixed investment and private consumption should bolster growth furthermore increased oil production and higher oil prices will also propel momentum however diversification efforts could dissipate in the wake of a stronger oil sector and drag on the non oil economy focuseconomics panelists expect growth of 2 1 in 2018 up 0 1 percentage points from last month s forecast and 3 0 in 2019 venezuela the economy remains in dire shape according to the opposition controlled congress the economy contracted 12 year on year in the first quarter on the back of falling oil output a reflection of years of chronic underinvestment and mismanagement in the all important industry in june oil production slipped to a new multi year low while the number of active oil rigs dropped to the lowest level in over 15 years pointing to further declines in output moreover the bolivar continued to tumble in both the official and parallel markets in july further feeding into spiraling inflation in late july president nicol√°s maduro announced his first set of economic measures that seek to contain hyperinflation and stabilize the free falling bolivar which include a monetary reconversion and potential loosening of currency controls the details of how these policies would be implemented however remain unknown rampant inflation dwindling oil production and a dysfunctional exchange rate system are expected to keep the economy in depression increased financial pressure from sanctions also compound the country s woes furthermore the recent government proposals are expected to be ineffective in tackling the crisis the severity of the crisis may generate the conditions for a political transition with the latest incident being an apparent assassination attempt on president maduro on 4 august and is a scenario that some of our panelists have begun factoring into their forecasts focuseconomics panelists see the economy contracting 11 3 in 2018 which is down 0 1 percentage points from last month s forecast in 2019 the panel sees gdp falling 4 1 norway latest indicators suggest that the economy grew at a good pace in q2 following a weak start to the year retail sales in may grew at the fastest pace since december 2017 amid a tight labor market and high wage growth moreover data suggests that house prices bottomed out at the beginning of 2018 and are slowly recovering as evidenced by price increases in q2 the recovery in house prices has been supported by low interest rates and declining unemployment meanwhile exports of goods increased at the fastest pace in over a year in q2 buttressed by higher oil prices however complicating the economic picture for q2 is industrial production which contracted for the fourth consecutive month in may the economy is expected to grow at a robust pace this year and next on the back of higher prices for norwegian commodities such as oil and natural gas the mainland economy which excludes petroleum activities and related ocean transport should benefit from a tight labor market and favorable credit conditions focuseconomics consensus forecast panelists expect total gdp to expand 2 1 in 2018 which is up 0 1 percentage points from last month s forecast and 2 0 in 2019 mainland gdp is expected to grow 2 4 in 2018 which is up 0 1 percentage points from last month and 2 2 in 2019
reforming the appropriations process spring 2019 everybody knows the federal budget process is broken members of congress their staffs executive officials judges policy experts and citizens can all see it plainly the procedures established nearly a half century ago are technically still in place requiring congress to pass an annual budget resolution as well as appropriations and authorization bills for various areas of government spending in practice however the process has become an artifact frequently ignored and rarely used as intended as a result we now have government by continuing resolutions in which congress passes short term funding measures designed to give lawmakers and the white house more time to negotiate appropriations if the parties can t agree the government shuts down this practice results in a haphazard approach to fiscal policy with lawmakers contriving artificial deadlines and budgeting from crisis to crisis the chaos of contemporary budgeting was once again evident in the recent 35 day partial government shutdown from december 2018 to january 2019 the longest in modern history the shutdown which resulted from a dispute between president donald trump and congressional democrats over billions in funding for a wall on the u s mexico border ended when the white house and republicans agreed to a short term spending bill that allowed more time for deliberations congressional negotiators later reached an agreement that funded all government operations through the end of september the current annual appropriations system is ill suited to strategic budgeting and the regular deliberation of the nation s spending priorities and it is particularly disastrous for fiscal conservatives lawmakers wary of shutdowns and the zeroing out of federal dollars for government operations inevitably reach rushed agreements that almost always raise government spending as a result discretionary spending and thus annual deficits and the national debt continue to rise members of congress who often exhibit an inability to make choices and adjust priorities certainly deserve some blame for the breakdown and our increasingly polarized media and political environments have not made it easier to reach compromises on spending or anything else but the truth is that process and institutional rules matter to restore transparency regularity strategic deliberation and fiscal restraint to the federal budget we need a new process and new rules that provide different incentives to lawmakers we need a system of permanent appropriations that by eliminating the threat of shutdowns and funding gaps will enable the country to debate its economic future without the looming specter of crisis roots of budgetary dysfunction today s federal budget process came about in 1974 with the passage of the congressional budget and impoundment control act cba the democratic led congress at the time wanted to counter executive aggrandizement and overhaul the way washington made fiscal policy spiraling inflation increasing deficits and a highly fractured and decentralized process of constructing budgets helped generate practically unanimous support for root and branch reform the act created the institutions that shape our budget process today the congressional budget office cbo house and senate budget committees and the multi stage process through which lawmakers ensure coordination of revenues and expenditures the cba provided the platform for the enactment of the major fiscal policy developments of the past 45 years there have been important formal changes throughout but the process it established remains recognizable the process is meant to go something like this after receiving the president s proposed budget both chambers of congress craft a blueprint by binding targets for spending outlays and authority in 19 function areas through a concurrent resolution unlike an ordinary bill the budget resolution does not go to the president for his signature or veto because it merely sets taxing and spending targets for other congressional committees it needs only a majority vote to pass and cannot be filibustered in the senate this is followed by the allocation of funds at the line item level by each chamber s appropriations committee each of the 12 appropriations subcommittees in both houses writes a spending bill for consideration and passage by the parent chambers the bills fund different parts of the government for the following fiscal year a second later resolution guides the authorizing committees and enables revisions to programs that lie outside of the appropriations process most notably entitlements such as social security and medicare this second concurrent resolution was later eliminated in a 1985 reform of the budget process establishing a single budget resolution then congress can choose whether to pass what is known as a reconciliation bill which was originally intended as a kind of bridge between the two resolutions to tweak taxing and spending reconciliation bills like the budget resolution are considered under expedited procedures they cannot be filibustered in the senate and need only a simple majority to pass in the four and a half decades since the cba established this structure congress has increasingly employed blunt budgetary mechanisms to set its spending levels occasionally making ad hoc adjustments to delay the pain of cuts in practice the federal budget process established by the cba in which both houses agree to an annual budget resolution that sets orderly taxing and spending targets for committees has become a relic frequently ignored or not used as intended and therefore still tacitly supported but largely ineffective some years the chambers cannot agree on a resolution and in others the senate has failed even to pass its own resolution the budget control act of 2011 bca and its sequestration caps might be seen as a kind of resolution it creates a spending projection for example but the budget deals of 2013 2015 and 2018 reveal that sequestration can be amended in other years even when a resolution has been agreed to it has effectively been ignored and swept away by more immediate and critical political and policy considerations moreover congress has barely utilized reconciliation since 2000 and when it has been deployed some of the policies promoted have been at best tangentially related to budgetary matters the college cost reduction and access act of 2007 for example as well as democratic efforts to reform and republican efforts to repeal president barack obama s signature health care law which was originally passed without resort to reconciliation in 2010 a haphazard process clearly fiscal policymaking in today s congress lacks the planning coordination routinized procedures holistic approach and coherent outcomes that the cba was designed to deliver for several reasons the most obvious being the continued inclination of the american public to divide control of the elected branches of government between the two increasingly polarized parties we now have a fractured haphazard and deadline driven budget process this chaotic approach to budgeting in recent decades has produced three trends government by continuing resolution the ever present threat of shutdown and acrimonious fights over the nation s debt limit a continuing resolution cr is a stop gap and often omnibus or consolidated appropriations bill that maintains operations at or slightly below the previous fiscal year s spending levels for a set but generally short period from as little as a few days to as long as several months the goal is to buy time for congress and the white house to agree on conventional appropriations through the remainder of the budget year there were 109 crs between fiscal years 1998 and 2017 with at least one every year the last year without a cr was 1997 since 2002 congress has not completed the appropriations requirements until on average nearly four months into the fiscal year by which time of course it should already be busily preparing for the next year without consolidated or single appropriations bills after the start of the fiscal year the government experiences a shutdown the furlough of non essential personnel and curtailment of activities in the departments and agencies funded by the unapproved appropriations there have been 20 of these shutdowns since the early 1970s most of them perhaps surprisingly occurred prior to 1990 when the cba was supposedly functioning moderately well they have frequently been short and have resulted in only a partial curtailment of government operations many involved only a single or small number of appropriations bills covering defense health education or welfare spending that became caught up in political combat between conservatives and liberals adding further uncertainty to budget politics and making congress s general approach to fiscal policy even more haphazard is the requirement that lawmakers extend the nation s debt limit so the federal government can borrow funds legally to continue operations for many years congress routinely raised the debt ceiling and passed the authorization into law without much controversy or fanfare because many members feared that their votes to raise the debt ceiling would be considered fiscally irresponsible by their constituents in 1979 the house established the gephardt rule named after democratic representative richard gephardt of missouri which automatically increased the limit when congress approved the budget resolution in 2011 the house did away with the rule and adopted what the senate had done all along a separate transparent vote on a measure raising the debt ceiling free to use the debt ceiling as leverage house republicans threatened not to increase it that summer as the federal government s borrowing authority was about to expire they coupled a debt limit extension with legislation calling for deep cuts in many programs and agencies and their leadership emphasized the popularity of such a maneuver by introducing a clean authorization that merely raised the debt ceiling which went down to heavy defeat on the floor finally after steep declines in stock prices and facing a downgrade of federal debt by standard and poor s congressional leaders and the administration crafted the bca and essentially kicked the can down the road the new house democratic majority re established the gephardt rule in 2019 but because the consequences of default would be so severe the debt ceiling continues to provide a powerful political tool the urgency of avoiding default forces otherwise unwilling lawmakers to compromise by either raising the debt limit or suspending consideration of the ceiling as the recent history of continuing resolutions shutdowns and debt ceiling imbroglios demonstrates congress has abandoned the routine process established by the cba in favor of crisis budgeting this procedural chaos has been particularly unsettling for fiscal hawks there were annual deficits some of them quite large when cba was working as its designers intended but absent the discipline it provided they have ballooned with the exception of a few years in the early 1980s and early 1990s cba kept the federal budget deficit below 3 of gdp but then the great recession hit in 2008 and blew a huge hole in the nation s finances total public debt now exceeds 21 trillion and is more than 100 of gdp without a functioning budget process annual deficits have returned to somewhat manageable levels through economic growth and sequestration but economists largely agree that our level of indebtedness is unsustainable and the ramshackle procedures congress now uses will not ameliorate the situation what is needed is a fundamental reform of federal budgeting that will not only address the concerns of fiscal conservatives but also restore the constraints that the cba imposed on the budget process almost a half century ago transparency regularity and discriminate strategic budgeting reform proposals almost as soon as the ink from president richard nixon s pen had dried on the cba in 1974 academics and policy practitioners began circulating proposals for reform given the state of the budget process today it should be no surprise that recommendations for change are legion a balanced budget amendment to the constitution and the presidential line item veto have always been popular both were central features of the republicans contract with america a document that guided the party s house majority after the 1994 elections a balanced budget amendment ultimately failed by a single vote in the senate mark hatfield of oregon was the only republican who voted against the measure on substantive rather than procedural grounds the line item veto enabled the president to block sections of a bill with taxing and spending provisions rather than accept or reject the entire measure a power already enjoyed by 44 state governors as a piece of ordinary legislation and therefore facing a lower hurdle than a balanced budget amendment the line item veto was passed into law but the supreme court declared it unconstitutional in 1998 biennial budgeting has also been proposed for much of cba s existence at the turn of the new millennium it seemed that there was significant momentum to establish a two year rather than the existing annual budget process during the 106th congress 1999 2001 numerous influential voices in washington advocated such change including president bill clinton both of the major party presidential candidates in the 2000 election house speaker dennis hastert and senate budget committee chair pete domenici who introduced a well publicized bill to establish the biennial calendar there are already numerous models at the state level 19 states have biennial budgets though only north dakota and wyoming have true two year processes the others enact two annual budgets simultaneously the second of which is often revised before it takes effect the calls for a biennial budget do not seem quite as loud today though during the recent 114th congress 2015 17 republican senator mike enzi of wyoming chair of the budget committee held hearings on a two year appropriations process a house bill to establish such a budget cycle accrued 237 co sponsors the building a better budget process project run by the nonprofit convergence center for policy resolution advocates stronger congressional budget committees greater independence and resources for cbo and the joint committee on taxation new and more meaningful periodic reports about the fiscal state of the nation and the financial footing of major programs and alterations to the fiscal year that would bring the budget process cycle more closely in line with the political calendar another popular set of proposals are referred to as functional reform or portfolio budgeting under this framework the budget process is conceived of as a series of major issues or policy areas and decisions regarding aggregate spending and program priorities within them are made holistically fiscal policy regarding transportation for example would be coordinated within a single process that pulls together all related programs many of which are scattered across committee jurisdictions functional reform has been popular for some time but it suffers from various flaws most notably its complexity and the inevitable intramural turf wars it would unleash in the house and senate the committee for a responsible federal budget crfb recently rolled out a proposal that has numerous supporters on capitol hill republican senator david perdue of georgia has made perhaps the most serious push to enact it into law crfb s reform provisions include elevating the budget resolution to the status of law by making it joint rather than concurrent it would then require the president s signature or a congressional override of his veto to become law crfb would also have the budget resolution include the debt limit and items currently outside of the appropriations process such as the massive social security program leon panetta the organization s co chair has described the current budget process as eight months of posturing followed by one month of hard deals crfb s reforms aim to avoid this deadline driven budgeting james capretta has proposed a similar set of ideas in these pages suggesting a joint budget resolution would force the two branches to begin coordinating early in the process by reconciling the differing estimates from cbo and omb in order to come up with an agreeable joint plan another proposal that has gained popularity among members of congress is known as the automatic cr acr the government accountability office formerly called the general accounting office completed a detailed analysis of various types of acrs in the mid 1980s and there have been about a dozen acr measures introduced in congress since the early 1990s usually with names like the government shutdown prevention act several have received committee attention and floor action the most energetic proponent of the acr today is republican senator rob portman of ohio the former omb director for president george w bush he has introduced a version in every congress of which he has been a member since his election in 2010 with 10 co sponsors mostly republicans he introduced the end government shutdowns act in the 115th congress 2017 2019 if any appropriations bill or continuing resolution has not been passed by october 1 portman s bill provides for a 120 day cr at previous fiscal year levels additional acrs would be attached at 90 day intervals and with each extension spending would be reduced by 1 a related proposal known as capping and pegging cp would cap aggregate spending by pegging it to revenues or an estimate of gdp like acr cp strategies have an important virtue fiscal and procedural discipline glenn hubbard chair of the council of economic advisers under george w bush and tim kane a fellow at the hoover institution have outlined a reform in these pages and elsewhere that would replace the appropriations process and limit aggregate spending to a number calculated from recent revenue amounts congress could still increase expenditures at any time and by any amount but only if a supermajority of legislators approved the most recent iteration of the maximizing america s prosperity map act introduced in 2015 by republican representative kevin brady of texas then the house ways and means committee chair would restrict non interest federal spending to between 16 and 19 of potential or full employment gdp to constrain spending further the president would have to prioritize programs congress could then expedite consideration of line item rescissions that the president would offer many of the proposals above would entail sweeping and convoluted changes requiring everything from constitutional amendments to tackling the debt limit to reforming entitlement programs the main contributor to federal deficits and national debt but i would suggest that effective reforms to the budget should have a narrower focus concentrating more intently on the appropriations process and discretionary spending discretionary spending after all constitutes 30 of the annual 4 4 trillion budget and as the disintegration of the cba illustrates our fiscal problems are as much about process as they are policy perhaps more important these proposals neglect to address one of the most troubling aspects of the current appropriations process the constant threat that government operations will run out of funds completely if spending bills aren t passed into law it is this feature that after a series of rushed negotiations and artificial deadlines compels lawmakers to agree to increase federal spending by significant amounts thwarting the efforts of fiscal conservatives to rein in government spending and reduce the debt an effective alternative to the current budget system therefore must create a new reversion point and a new status quo a new appropriations regime for most legislation defeat in congress simply means the status quo is maintained but if one of the 12 annual discretionary spending or appropriations measures fails to pass prior to the beginning of the fiscal year government expenditures on the covered operations go to zero the reversion point the outcome should nothing happen is not the status quo and a reversion to zero constitutes what a majority of members of congress would just about always consider bad policy and bad politics few lawmakers want to do away with federal functions entirely or receive the blame for bringing them to a halt however temporarily the threat of government shutdown is therefore unattractive to most practical conservatives and strategic budget cutters the regular appropriations process is truly stacked against fiscal hawks those who desire to constrain spending do not enjoy the leverage generally conferred on coalitions built to protect the status quo coalitions that benefit from procedures like bicameralism the presidential veto and the senate filibuster those who want cuts are further disadvantaged by informal federal budget norms which conform to aaron wildavsky s view that he largest determining factor of the size and content of this year s budget is last year s budget members desiring cuts a group with naturally diverse views and motivations must forge a coalition around a single manufactured position and push against this inertia their proposals will face numerous competitors and because spending bills are subject to the kind of logrolling essential to secure passage in the house and senate members are likely to withhold support from these plans unless they also protect and possibly increase expenditures on their favorite line items thereby diluting any budget cutting effects ultimately the zero dollar reversion point for appropriations bills directs spending upward everyone knows it will be invoked if nothing is done pressuring members to back any deal that avoids it but because it is so undesirable this reversion point cannot credibly discipline lawmakers proclivity to secure increased spending on their pet projects or those of their colleagues to whom they owe favors there often emerges no viable alternative to government shutdown but a compromise that raises spending it is somewhat surprising then that in march 2013 congress actually enacted billions in cuts through sequestration although the procedure is blunt and the caps it established have been raised repeatedly the six years of experience we have with sequestration are instructive for conservatives sizeable spending cuts occurred because sequestration is practically the inverse of the annual appropriations process its reversion point at least for fiscal year 2013 was a substantial trimming but it was also economically appealing and politically tolerable as the default outcome of inaction the spending reductions enjoyed all the procedural and political advantages of a status quo position as the no vote against any legislation to squelch it sequestration constituted the baseline spending agenda the procedure s numerous but disparate opponents found themselves in the position usually occupied by conservatives they had barely any opportunity to propose force onto the floor construct a winning coalition for and pass a substitute in one chamber let alone both an appealing alternative appropriations regime incorporates these lessons from sequestration i propose that congress pass a law permitting appropriations to last many years even into perpetuity an approach called permanent appropriations under permanent appropriations or pa each program and agency would be directed to plan for annual expenditures of a certain amount the treasury would replenish the annual allotment for each appropriation at the beginning of the next fiscal year and repeatedly thereafter until legislation alters it this procedure would dramatically change the reversion point for federal spending if lawmakers fail to pass an appropriations bill the consequence would not be zero dollars but the continuance of current levels advocates of additional spending a position at neither the reversion nor status quo points would have to construct legislative coalitions large and cohesive enough to set the agenda and mobilize support behind a proposal that could be enacted into law while the length of the appropriations process would change the rest of the current budget architecture could remain in place efforts to change spending levels could use the existing appropriations bills as legislative vehicles and house and senate committee structures could still generate them a budget resolution might recommend revisions to coordinate spending levels across government but unlike now appropriations bills reflecting those recommendations need not become law there is no constitutional prohibition against making appropriations permanent under the constitution congress is simply required to appropriate money that the treasury spends article i section 8 forbids an appropriation of money o raise and support armies for more than two years but the constitution says nothing about annualized spending or at what intervals money is to be allocated to domestic defense or foreign operations since 1789 and the very first congress the tendency has been to do this every year this created the assumption that absent an annual appropriation a particular function of government would be unfunded a succession of statutes and rule changes in the post civil war era formalized this rhythm both congressional bodies established their committees on appropriations in the mid 1860s separating appropriations from the process of raising revenues in 1876 the house established the holman rule named after democratic representative william holman of indiana with the goal of permitting the appropriations committee to reduce expenditures and thereby increase the authority of the committee by decoupling actual spending from its authorization as a result while many federal programs and agencies are authorized for many years at a time most discretionary spending amounts are appropriated annually there are some multi year and even permanent appropriations today the federal government spends more than 60 of its 4 trillion annual budget on entitlements social welfare programs particularly social security medicare and medicaid that are considered mandatory and are funded automatically by rules that define the qualifications of beneficiaries entitlements are generally not considered appropriations but they are permitted by congressional action and paid for by the u s treasury in fact although appropriations bills do not affect the amount paid to individuals these allocations are directed by established formulas and regulations that describe eligibility criteria spending bills do formally provide for about 35 to 40 of current entitlement spending occasionally the appropriation is just a technicality rather than a substantively important measure the state grant component of medicaid the supplemental nutrition assistance program and some veterans programs for example are paid for by annual appropriations that merely rubber stamp an amount that congress has already authorized for a multi year period congress however also ensures full payments to individuals with annual appropriations such as for beneficiaries of the children s health insurance program entitlement programs require appropriated funds for their administration the courts have repeatedly favored congressional supremacy in cases that challenge congress s power of the purse and how it makes appropriations in train v city of new york 1975 the u s supreme court ruled that the environmental protection agency s impoundment of appropriated funds for municipal water treatment and sewage plants was unconstitutional the case which had begun with a presidential directive to the epa in november 1972 provided much of the impetus for the cba in may 2016 u s district court judge rosemary collyer ruled that the affordable care act s cost sharing subsidies to insurers as well as tax credits to low income americans purchasing coverage on the obamacare exchanges were unconstitutional because congress had not appropriated them the trump administration voluntarily withdrew the cost sharing approach in 2017 settling house v burwell notwithstanding president trump s defiant reassignment of congressionally appropriated funds to build a wall under the guise of a national emergency the case law is unambiguous if congressional appropriations regulate the federal government s spending the manner in which congress makes these appropriations is surely a matter only it can determine benefits of permanence while my proposal for permanent appropriations is certainly informed by the automatic cr and cap and peg strategies mentioned above the permanent appropriations approach exhibits three additional characteristics that make it superior the first is that the status quo presents itself as a more legitimate alternative as noted earlier reversion is not just a fallback position in pa it maintains current spending levels without any dramatic zero dollar threats any changes to annual spending must go through the full legislative process and meet the constitutional requirements of bicameralism approval by a majority of each congressional house and presentment presentation to the president for his signature or veto this requires proponents to build the coalitions necessary to win house and senate passage and presidential approval or at least the votes necessary to override a veto members would have to take floor votes that are mostly recorded these days registering preferences transparent to their colleagues and constituents and unlike with cp there is no arbitrary and intuitively unfair requirement that spending changes receive supermajority approval acr and cp are also blunt instruments they constitute an effort to convert all government spending decisions into matters of economic philosophy and as a result would likely pull congress into partisan squabbles over broad fiscal policy in order to alter expenditures on individual programs and agencies relatively minor actions that are better disposed of in a pragmatic and consensual manner with permanent appropriations the country can debate its economic future without artificial deadlines members can agree across the aisle on individual spending items without their decisions affecting other more fundamental fiscal and economic policy matters no longer afraid of incurring the wrath of their party s ideological enforcers and base voters lawmakers would feel empowered to reach discrete compromises the second reason permanent appropriations are superior is that because acr and cp exert explicit downward pressure on government expenditures they have more extreme reversion points than pa acr and cp would thus likely permit spending to rise more over the long term just as the zero dollar reversion point in our current budget system leads to last minute deals that increase spending acrs generally call for rapidly accelerating cuts to expenditures absent annual appropriations representative brady s map act puts in place a permanent cr at 90 of previous spending levels if congress does not pass these bills to be sure a congress and president in a big spending mood could increase expenditures more easily under pa and acr than cp although the victorious coalition would still have to meet the constitutional hurdles of bicameralism and presentment but the broadly unattractive reversion point in cp even with supermajority requirements creates significant pressure on members to agree upon an alternative given coalition building dynamics in congress and depending on the level of the cap or peg these deals might well contain meaningful spending increases empirical research on lengthening appropriations cycles suggests that pa would result in decreased spending regardless of its effect on reversion points although this research is somewhat dated and equivocal states with annual appropriations tend to spend more than those with a biennial budget the theory here is not clear but without any requirement to pass legislation to keep the government operating at the end of the first year of the biennium there is less need for the kind of pork often necessary to build winning legislative coalitions the third and final reason to favor permanent appropriations is that they are flexible and make it easier for lawmakers to practice strategic budgeting supporters of the current system of annual appropriations tend to emphasize its capacity to enhance the planning that executive departments and agencies inevitably undertake but it is also true that in practice the existing system greatly impedes strategic budgeting within executive units as the budget watchdog group open the books has reported federal agencies spend sizeable portions of their budgets 50 billion in fiscal year 2017 in the last week of the fiscal year to close out their accounts in a use it or lose it spending spree not only would pa enable congress to enact appropriations bills at any time with little or no consideration of the fiscal calendar but it could also permit departments and agencies to hold money across fiscal years as happens in many other advanced industrialized democracies sequestration multiple crs supplemental appropriations and rescissions force agencies to continually accelerate and decelerate expenditures within fiscal years as they sometimes receive unanticipated windfalls and cuts as a practical matter agency heads today cannot plan their budgets with much confidence pa would also give more certainty than annual appropriations to the multi year contracts that are increasingly a feature of the federal procurement system which is no longer based upon tangible goods but the acquisition of staffing and large technologically sophisticated systems more important it would permit greater coordination between the authorizations and appropriations processes until the 1950s congress authorized most programs on a permanent basis the appropriations schedule thus did not matter much to the agencies that administered them today however the authorization process is incredibly complex as different programs are authorized for different durations many programs have experienced authorizations for various annual and multi year terms over the course of their existence the national science foundation and the national aeronautics and space administration being prime examples others became the subjects of routine annual authorizations in the vietnam war era including most notably the department of defense department of state and department of justice for most if not all programs pa could be adapted to dovetail with the existing authorizations regime the existing incompatibility of appropriations and authorizations inevitably results in unauthorized spending and what many observers believe is largely unchecked power for congressional appropriators and the standing committees on which they sit these zombie authorizations including for agencies and programs like the department of veterans affairs head start the national institutes of health the low income home energy assistance program and a number of housing assistance programs weaken congressional oversight of government spending the oversight that does occur tends to be dramatic and uneven driven by media sensationalism and attention hungry members of congress focused on re election routinized authorizations would bring about more comprehensive measured and efficient oversight because agencies would receive instructions in statutory form at regular intervals such authorizations would allow congress to provide necessary structural and substantive updates to programs that account for political economic and technological changes and they would assist the white house and agency heads as officials construct budget forecasts and approve expenditures they would also likely reduce waste and fraud ultimately pa would make it practical to re empower authorizers so they can provide an additional check on augmented spending this would be done without the kind of radical overhaul of the relationship between authorizers and appropriators that was proposed by republican representative cathy mcmorris rodgers of washington former chair of the house republican conference in her unauthorized spending accountability acts of 2016 and 2017 the ultimately unsuccessful bills would have subjected all programs to a three year authorization cycle and would have effectively sunset and sequestered the funds of those unable to secure reauthorization pa would not solve all of the country s fiscal problems given the constitution s directive against the funding of standing armies it would be difficult to apply to some if not most of the department of defense s spending an amount that has now reached about 600 billion annually pa doesn t address mandatory spending for entitlement programs or interest payments to service the national accumulated debt though there is nothing to prevent every dime of federal spending from being formally appropriated whether it s permanent or not the crfb proposal mentioned above for example requires the budget resolution to incorporate spending on social security but at the very least pa would place an effective brake on discretionary spending process matters improvements to the budget process established by the cba will continue to feature in legislative proposals and public debate the february 2018 budget bill for example established a bipartisan joint select committee on budget and appropriations process reform and members of congress as well as fiscal policy practitioners seem to be coming to a consensus that change is desirable the joint select committee has held a few hearings and attracted some media attention but for the time being at least has appropriately general and modest goals these developments are encouraging to budget hawks because as washington has demonstrated repeatedly political will alone cannot curb the growth of federal spending although discretionary items accounted for only 6 3 of gdp and 30 of all federal outlays in 2017 declines of about 50 over the past half century they have risen by more than 25 in constant dollars since 2000 much of the increase occurred during the republican unified government presided over by president george w bush from 2001 to 2006 even though republican congressional majorities claim they want to shrink the size of government they do not seem capable of preventing increased spending a self imposed moratorium on earmarks is now largely ignored in fall 2017 president trump collaborated with democratic house and senate leaders to pass a legislative package containing a continuing resolution debt ceiling raise and relief for hurricane victims despite opposition from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and house speaker paul ryan a year or so later supported now by republicans in congress president trump forced a partial government shutdown because he wanted more money for his border wall project reflecting on the cba s failures 40 years after its passage former ranking member of the house budget committee bill frenzel a republican from minnesota put the blame solely on the makers of policy not the process the real culprit is the congress s inability to make choices or stated another way to adjust priorities but this is not quite right the process matters institutional rules can force members of congress to make choices and adjust their priorities though they would not be easy to establish permanent appropriations would make any proposal to increase or reduce discretionary spending pass through the legislative process and win the support of a majority of legislators or a supermajority in response to a presidential veto or filibuster by eliminating the backstop of a disastrous zero dollar reversion point this would finally lead to the creation of fiscal policy in congress that is deliberate transparent stable and restrained

commercial sections parks and walking paths plans for schools and banks and pubs and coffee shops it still takes some imagination to picture it all the streets are mostly empty there are clusters of homes and stores under construction there are only a smattering of residents so far but eventually the plan is for about 15 000 people to live here which would make it bigger than all but five

project is coming to life at the same time his most controversial legacy of his time in office has become a major albatross around newfoundland s economic neck last month public hearings resumed in a sweeping public inquiry into the muskrat falls hydroelectric project a 12 7 billion political and economic quagmire that is running at least two years behind schedule and more than double its original budget scheduled to last more than a year with a budget of 34 million the inquiry represents a massive and a very public self flagellation over how what was supposed to be a symbol of the province s economic independence became as current premier dwight ball has called it the biggest economic mistake in newfoundland and labrador s history the muskrat cost overruns have pushed the already daunting provincial debt load into potentially dangerous territory so high in fact that some experts have openly questioned newfoundland s long term capacity to pay its bills the government already faced serious questions about its long term capacity to make ends meet given its aging population and its shrinking labour force that threaten to put an ever tightening squeeze on its finances the fallout from muskrat falls may bring that to a head earlier than anyone had expected even more urgently the project s runaway price tag threatens to almost double newfoundlanders electricity rates a cost that would not only pummel consumers but would be a massive disincentive for business in the province it s particularly poor timing as the province begins to emerge from a severe slump that battered its critical oil sector and wrestles its wayward finances back under control the government which has pinned much of its strategy for an economic renaissance on attracting outside investors now faces a choice between two bad options either it must subsidize part of the steep electricity increase at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars a year that it can t afford or leave the province saddled with by far the highest power costs in canada it s the no 1 issue no doubt mr ball said in an interview from his st john s office on a bone chilling february afternoon neither taxpayers nor industries

hydroelectric project in eastern labrador championed by mr williams for years and officially sanctioned by his successor kathy dunderdale in 2012 was supposed to have struck a blow for newfoundland and labrador s economic independence newfoundlanders have never gotten over the partnership agreement the province struck 50 years ago with neighbouring quebec on the churchill falls hydro development hydro qu√©bec provided financing for churchill falls in exchange for a 70 year deal to receive electricity supplies at a fixed price that turned out to be far below prevailing market rates the result has been that quebec receives the vast bulk of the profits from the project until 2041 mr williams was determined that this time around newfoundland would maintain control over muskrat falls and reap the benefits muskrat falls was supposed to deliver lower and more stable electricity rates to newfoundland consumers and generate revenues for provincial coffers when mr williams unveiled plans for the project with much fanfare in 2010 his crowning achievement before abruptly announcing just a week later that he was quitting politics its budget was 6 2 billion through his representatives mr williams declined interview requests for this story now with the final capital cost estimated at 12 7 billion those expected benefits have transformed into a world of worry by law the capital costs of the project which is scheduled to begin producing electricity by the end of this year must be incorporated into rates charged for the power it generates that means that once muskrat falls is fully up and running newfoundlanders electricity rates stand to roughly double by 2021 to an estimated 22 89 cents a kilowatt hour which would be by far the highest in canada and among the most expensive in north america mr ball s government which inherited the headache when it took office in late 2015 is now scrambling to find ways to reduce the rate hit rate mitigation as it s called in the industry the government has already earmarked 200 million a year to effectively subsidize electricity costs but last month the province s board of commissioners of public utilities issued a report estimating it would cost the government 744 million a year to fully mitigate the muskrat related increase for a province with an annual budget of 8 billion that s a major expense we know that we can t raise taxes to do it we know we can t increase rates we have to be competitive mr ball said we ll find a way to get this done of even bigger concern for many observers is the debt the province has taken on to finance muskrat falls the project has taken newfoundland s already smouldering public debt brush fire and poured gasoline on it muskrat related loans account for more than a third of the total provincial debt which has nearly doubled in the past decade to more than 15 billion or a steep 47 per cent of gross domestic product the highest in the country debt expenses eat up about 1 billion a year about 12 per cent of newfoundland s budget when asked about the province s dicey financial position newfoundland finance minister tom osborne s response is that if you think this is bad you should have seen the mess his government inherited when it took office a little more than three years ago things are considerably better today than they were in december of 2015 he said the province was mired in a 2 2 billion deficit within days of taking office mr ball was informed that unless the province made an emergency issue of treasury bills they wouldn t be able to make payroll since then the government has chipped away at the deficit reducing it to an estimated 547 million in the current budget year ending march 31 thanks to disciplined spending and a partial recovery in oil revenues but the province still lacks a concrete plan to reduce its debt we re still on track to return to surplus in 2023 once we get back to surplus we can start paying down the debt mr osborne said all of this is happening against the backdrop of canada s most serious demographic deterioration which threatens to make it increasingly difficult for the province s economy and its tax revenues to keep pace with its expenses and debt burden at the time of the cod moratorium in 1992 when the province s huge cod industry was forced to shut down essentially permanently due to a near extinction of northern cod newfoundland was the youngest province in the country with a median age of 31 years today it s the oldest at 46 5 years almost six years older than the national median the population isn t just aging it s shrinking the provincial head count has fallen two years in a row its working age population 15 64 has declined in each of the past eight years newfoundland s death rate is higher than its birth rate and after nearly a decade of having more canadians move to newfoundland than leave it an important stemming of the province s long time migratory bleed the net outflow has resumed in the past two years and while immigration is going a long way to stem the demographic tide and sustain labour force growth in other parts of the country canada s immigration success story has largely bypassed newfoundland according to the 2016 census immigrants make up just 2 4 per cent of newfoundland s total population barely one 10th of the national level of 22 per cent despite policy changes that increased its immigration intake newfoundland still only brought in about 1 500 new immigrants last year a rate of three people for every 1 000 of the province s population that s far below the national average of 8 8 and less than half of the rate of the next lowest province new brunswick economist richard saillant author of a book on atlantic canada s demographic plight called a tale of two countries believes the demographic slide will increasingly squeeze newfoundland s already strained government finances in the coming years as the taxpayer base dwindles while the health care costs accelerate as the senior population gets even bigger and on average older we ve only seen the tip of the iceberg mr saillant said in a 2017 report the parliamentary budget officer the federal watchdog on government finance matters warned that newfoundland and labrador s fiscal path is not sustainable over the long term in light of its heavy debt and its demographics it called for strong medicine permanent tax increases and or spending reductions totalling 6 5 per cent of provincial gdp that s the equivalent of a 26 per cent tax hike or a 21 per cent gutting of program spending the pbo projected that without a major rethink of fiscal policy newfoundland s debt to gdp ratio will rise from its current 47 per cent to more than 200 per cent by 2040 and close to 500 per cent by 2060 mr saillant fears that the province will hit a wall long before that barring a surge in the price of oil that would ignite newfoundland s economy and revive government revenues he predicts that the province is headed toward a fiscal crisis within probably five to 10 years the major bond rating agencies were concerned enough to downgrade newfoundland and labrador s credit rating in 2016 but they have always by convention assumed that the debts of newfoundland and indeed all canadian provinces are implicitly backed by the federal government should push ever come to shove this belief has its roots in the rather dubious precedent of the only provincial default in canada s 152 year history alberta during the great depression which after years of negotiations and much reluctance eventually ended in a federal debt restructuring package but in the case of newfoundland s muskrat falls debt the federal backing is quite explicit ottawa guaranteed two loans for the project in 2012 and again in 2016 totalling 9 2 billion effectively the federal government is on the hook for a substantial chunk of newfoundland s debt obligations open this photo in gallery the city of st john s n l seen

autonomous british colony teetered on the edge of bankruptcy the former was brought on by heavy debts from an overambitious economic strategy of railway construction the latter stemmed from newfoundland s onerous first world war debts and the advent of the great depression but it s near impossible to have any discussion about newfoundland s modern economy past present or future without talking about the cod moratorium in 1992 with the species teetering on the brink of extinction ottawa declared an indefinite halt to commercial cod fishing the industry that had served as the province s economic foundation for nearly 500 years was shut down almost overnight the government has allowed a small amount of cod fishing in recent years about 9 000 tonnes were harvested under what is called the stewardship cod program in 2018 compared with more than 800 000 tonnes at its peak in the late 1960s the death of the cod fishery devastated the province s largely rural economy hundreds of small villages dotting the coastline lost their reason for existence more than 35 000 people in the fishery lost their jobs seeing no future young newfoundlanders left the province in droves the province s demographic decline was on then something came along to postpone the inevitable slow death of newfoundland s small aging communities the oil boom newfoundland s first offshore oil field hibernia went into production in 1997 followed by terra nova in 2002 and white rose in 2005 the emergence of newfoundland s oil industry coincided with the greatest bull market for oil on record prices rose from us 12 a barrel in 1999 to more than us 120 a barrel by 2008 the oil boom propelled struggling newfoundland into a new status as one of canada s wealthier provinces and its government led by mr williams spent accordingly per capita spending doubled from 2000 to 2010 newfoundland s program spending in the past year was almost 14 000 a person the highest in the country but when oil

s budget with some of the brightest near term prospects in years after what was likely a small contraction in newfoundland s economy in 2018 the conference board of canada has projected it will be one of the fastest growing provinces in the country this year with oil prices having recovered from their lows hopes are high that additional major development of the province s offshore oil reserves is inevitable over the next decade leading an economic revival that will replenish the government coffers but the first order of business is to come up with a plan to address those muskrat related electricity costs something that looks certain to be front and centre in the budget one key option would be to refinance the muskrat falls debt in order to reduce near term repayments and spread out the debt over a longer time period thus bringing down the year to year cost of servicing the debt that would require going back to the federal government as the guarantor of the project s two key loans to seek further agreements and guarantees mr osborne the finance minister says the province is also looking at ways to blend the muskrat falls power output with cheaper electricity produced at its churchill falls facility to reduce average prices and increasing power revenues by selling its reserve power supplies into the spot electricity market when prices are high the board of commissioners of public utilities report argues the province will need to pull a lot of these kinds of mitigation tools out of its hat if it expects to reverse the steep costs of muskrat falls power it estimated that the cost to completely offset the muskrat related price increase and keep the province s power prices at their current 12 26 cents a kilowatt hour would be 744 million annually even to maintain newfoundland s price in line with the atlantic canada average of around 16 cents to 18 cents a kilowatt hour which would still be about a 40 per cent increase from the current rate would

goals include diversifying the economy increasing immigration doubling tourism attracting resource investment expanding agriculture and aquaculture and promoting innovation and technology it also encompasses streamlining the public sector to reduce costs and improve efficiency the government is still dealing with the fact that in the good years when oil royalties surged so did spending it left them very vulnerable said pedro antunes chief economist at the conference board of canada they ve admitted that their problem is an expenditure problem it s not just an oil price problem nevertheless it s clear that newfoundland s economic future still hinges on oil the sector accounts for more than one quarter of the province s gdp and offshore oil royalties generate about 15 per cent of government revenue that s less than half of their share of revenues in the early part of the decade a decline owing largely to the drop in oil prices by comparison two of the key growth sectors the government is pursuing in its diversity efforts tourism and technology make up just 4 per cent of newfoundland s gdp combined the way forward has targeted a doubling of oil production by 2030 an ambitious goal in a sector in which production has been trending generally downward for more than a decade while the province has developed four offshore fields in the past 22 years including the latest hebron which went into production in late 2017 mr osborne believes the industry is still just getting started based on newfoundland s considerable untapped offshore reserves we ve got at least 10 more oil projects out there he says it s huge but future development may be more complicated and costly than what the province has seen in the past the fields that have been developed to date have been in shallow water on the continental shelf the deepest of them is 120 metres the deepwater fields that constitute the next wave of potential development including bay du nord the next project under consideration in the flemish pass basin are more than a kilometre deep and 500 kilometres removed from the newfoundland coast it s a whole new frontier for the province and prospective producers investment decisions for the envisioned multitude of major projects in the next decade are far from a slam dunk nevertheless the government sees its natural resources not just oil but also mining and forestry as pivotal to keeping the economy afloat and creating the jobs that will attract workers to the province thus stemming the demographic decline we are going to build on the assets that we have naturally available to us and that s our natural resources attracting that investment mr ball said if we re going to increase our population we need jobs mr osborne said we ve been focused on creating those jobs on the population front the government set a goal to increase its annual immigration intake by 50 per cent by 2022 and it is halfway to that target but it started from the country s lowest base tony fang a memorial university of newfoundland economist who specializes in demographic and immigration issues says newfoundland needs to roughly triple its immigration targets just to match the national immigration rate and should probably shoot higher given its serious demographic situation immigration is not a silver bullet but it s definitely a piece of the puzzle he said but while economists believe the way forward is a move in the right direction they are skeptical that there will be enough there to overcome the economy s long term ills long term it s a bit of a wing and a prayer it will depend on revenue from a strong resource sector said economist finn poschmann of the fraser institute an economic think tank unless you have a reason to draw people in to keep them around you will shrink that s the big long term challenge mr saillant meanwhile believes the ultimate solution for newfoundland may have to come from ottawa he argues that we need to rewrite the rules for federal health transfers and or equalization to account for the province s deep demographic disadvantage within a decade or so from now we ll need to have a frank conversation about sharing resources in this country to recognize that some provinces are aging much faster and that s exerting major pressure on both revenue and spending he said you either deal with recognizing demographic realities or you have the likelihood of one province and at this point the main candidate is newfoundland and labrador being in a situation where it can t borrow any more open this photo in gallery people out for dinner or drinks at the mallard cottage in st john s fred lum the globe and mail open this photo in gallery comedian and commentator mark critch of this hour has 22 minutes is photographed at the mallard cottage fred lum the globe and mail comedian and lifelong newfoundland resident mark critch star of cbc s this hour has 22 minutes argues that government leaders have been slow to acknowledge the seriousness of the problems the province faces and voters have let them people would love to not believe the situation we re in mr critch said over a pint at the mallard cottage a converted 18th century wooden house in st john s quidi vidi district where people have been debating newfoundland s future around the dinner table for centuries for a politician to be able to lead people into a place where we can overcome those obstacles you have to convince them that there is a fire in the house a lot of people want to say agh it s just smoke st john s lawyer melissa royle mr critch s fiance√© agrees i don t think that as a province we ve adequately realized the magnitude of this situation that there s not enough young people here to continue supporting the province the way it s going ms royle said we re losing a lot of young people and we re losing a lot of those immigrants who come we can attract them to come here but they flow through mr critch said it s like the fishery it s catch and release here but when he tries to explain why he still believes in the place indeed why many of his gen x and millennial friends have hope newfoundland can overcome its challenges to spawn an economic revival he slips easily into weather hardened sailor metaphors newfoundlanders and labradorians are always very aware of storms on horizons you look out and you see those clouds i think a lot of people here and it may come from the seafaring way will bunker down in storms knowing they will pass he said and he points to mr williams and the dream of galway as evidence that bold thinking newfoundlanders still have faith the province has a bright future beyond the current clouds if you did not think the economy was better you d be an idiot to build a town he said the fix is waiting for oil my worry is fine we can survive until then if it should come around if it doesn t you re in big trouble but let s assume it will it doesn t matter if no lessons have been learned from the last time he argued people are going to want to try to spend in those times we have to be so aware that the lights and the phone bill might be cut off that when the money comes in we have to go oh jeez we can finally pay that bill as opposed to we should buy a new car it will happen it will come around again he said but if we have learned nothing from the time we re in then shag it let us sink into the sea bonavista and the new newfoundland there are glimpses of what might be possible if newfoundland shifts its demographic trend and cod dependent past and finds a new path for its younger generation one of them is in bonavista the former cod capital of newfoundland that simply refused to die in the years after the cod fishery shut down this picturesque seaside town population 3 500 lost 20 per cent of its population homes and workplaces were abandoned boarded up left to rot in the harsh north atlantic wind with the town s tax base gutted its municipal government was spending 38 per cent of its budget simply to service its debts then the town council decided to do something about it roughly 20 years ago council proposed to invest its scarce funds along with contributions from the federal and provincial governments in a not for profit foundation to rescue and revitalize the town s structures hundreds of them considered heritage buildings the town dates back to the 1600s bonavista mayor john norman refers to it as an investment in place capital nurturing and building on the assets that give the town its unique value as a place to live and work we said community development and place identity is incredibly important in community pride and in retaining and recruiting year round residents and business investment if that happens it will become naturally a nice place to visit said the energetic 33 year old one of the youngest mayors in newfoundland that was fairly forward thinking in rural newfoundland at that time

as reviewed by dr caroline gray senior economics editor at focuseconomics thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe to ease or not to ease when the european central bank took the decision to embark on a massive quantitative easing program in early 2015 it seemed to have little other option with heavily indebted governments across western europe coming under fire from their citizens suffering the brutal effects of austerity measures politicians were practically begging for some room for maneuver and with interest rates already pretty much as low as they could go the ecb s only way of responding to the clamor was to start injecting liquidity into the economy buying up government debt and thereby lowering bond yields and alleviating some of the pressure on governments fast forward a couple of years and the voices railing against quantitative easing are even stronger than those that initially clamored for it while the theory behind quantitative easing suggests it should ultimately boost demand and investment and thereby the real economy in reality the benefits in the euro area seem to have been muted at the same time perverse situations generated by the ecb s bond buying program have proliferated the average yield of euro denominated junk bonds i e the riskiest non investment grade corporate bonds recently dropped below 3 to come remarkably close to the yields on u s treasuries which are much more liquid and considered the safest investment in his latest book escape from the central bank trap daniel lacalle joins the anti qe camp with a convincing tirade against so called unconventional monetary policy which he suggests has become far too common and conventional he puts experiences of quantitative easing in the united states japan and europe under the spotlight in order to denounce modern monetary theory as a short term trap that fails to resolve structural imbalances and argue instead in favor of supply side policies in the european case lacalle argues the central bank did not function as a transmission mechanism to improve the real economy but as a perpetuator and instigator of yet another asset bubble in other words low interest rate risk has simply moved from house prices to bonds ecb president mario draghi s warnings to governments not to forget that qe is supposed to be a temporary measure and that structural reforms remain as necessary as ever have largely gone unheeded and so the new bubble is being perpetuated lacalle s focus on structural reforms and supply side measures puts him at risk of attracting the wrath of left wing and anti capitalist commentators and of being dismissed by them as a libertarian but he anticipates and attempts to counter such criticism by arguing that quantitative easing has actually contributed to the rise in inequality that such commentators are concerned about qe programs he suggests disproportionately benefit those who have access to widespread credit and whose wealth is in financial assets while hitting ordinary citizens with small savings in cash which becomes devalued even if the reader disagrees he says the question is simple how do we get out of expansionary policies without another financial crisis that hurts again households and taxpayers the most lacalle does not mince his words in warning of the risks of prolonged qe if eu countries get used to ultralow rates he suggests the risk of multibillion nominal and real losses in bond portfolios and pension funds is enormous because the tiniest tilt in inflation will make the house of cards collapse in the present scenario if interest rates raised a stunted one percent in the european union it would lead to massive budget cuts to maintain current deficits the irony here if we compare lacalle s words with european governments initial reasons for wanting qe cannot go unnoticed since qe slashes borrowing costs desperate governments had pinned their hopes on it reducing at least marginally and temporarily the pressure for ever stricter austerity measures while most of the jury now seems to be out on quantitative easing an alternative remains elusive in addition to structural reforms to promote lower government spending and higher efficiency lacalle recommends tax cuts to let households and smes thrive in this regard he reminds us that in europe it was the netherlands and the uk which emerged from recession earlier they were the countries which reduced taxes rather than boosting government spending during the initial period of stimulus across the eu at the height of the financial crisis prior to the shift to austerity convincing citizens of all this and thereby making it politically viable is however entirely another matter as lacalle himself acknowledges tax cuts may be welcomed if the public perceives them as benefitting the ordinary citizen rather than just wealthy high earners but on their own they cannot suffice meanwhile citizens who have already suffered enough from austerity are understandably not about to change their tune and embrace the need for structural reforms which often have an overwhelmingly harsh short term impact before the longer term benefits start to become apparent the central bank trap is clearly anything but an easy one to get out of author caroline gray phd senior economics editor daniel lacalle is a fund manager who holds a

the world bank similarly drew attention to a role for international institutions as a mechanism for making external commitments when national governments undertake internal and potentially unpopular changes these outside commitments make it more difficult for governments to backtrack on domestic reforms in the face of popular opposition rules and democracy therefore don t mix well rules are used to back up the insistence that there is no alternative tina there is no value in even discussing alternatives because we have rules to follow tumlir also explained that international rules could help save national politicians from internal pressures the international economic order as an additional means of entrenchment protecting national sovereignty against internal erosion in this orwellian formulation protecting national sovereignty implies its opposite it instead means protecting the national political establishment from the wishes of a nation s people with a more extensive institutionalised order national politicians are able to defer to the interests of the world economy or to globalisation or to the eu or to the rules of the wto to validate their actions or inactions it is convenient for national leaders to have a supranational master to whom they can point their electorate and shrug we had to do it there wasn t an alternative for instance during the eurozone debt crisis in 2015 a majority of greek voters rejected the terms of the bailout agreement drawn up in brussels and berlin in response the german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble succinctly summed up the globalist outlook elections change nothing there are rules it is not coincidental that hayek s rejection of minimal statism in law legislation and liberty came alongside a sustained critique of democracy specifically hayek criticised what he called the unlimited unrestrained representative democracy that led to stupid and damaging economic policies this conclusion rested on his denial of the possibility of economic control which led to another denial people cannot be masters of their own fate hayek was representative of neoliberal globalism when he determined that restricting political freedoms including democratic rights was sometimes necessary to preserve economic freedom while hayek thought that democracy needs the broom of strong governments he thought democracies could allow governments too much power this is why he explained he was always very careful to distinguish between limited democracies and unlimited democracies and his preference was for the limited variety this is why throughout his lifetime and especially after 1945 hayek and other neoliberal globalists put increasing faith in the law both national and supranational hayek distinguished the positive role law must play from the dangers of a legislative state he therefore recoiled from the expansion of democracy around the world because it enabled the potential for economic intervention through legislation this he saw as corrosive to the preferred separation of economics from politics it is now widely accepted especially among europeans that supranational law can override national law within domestic courts the high profile operations of the eu s european court of justice illustrate this but this anti democratic tendency does not mean globalists are always dismissive of the domestic courts on the contrary many recognise that domestic courts have the advantage over international ones of a greater semblance of legitimacy in practice domestic judges are also believed to be more reliable than democratic governments for enforcing international law this indicates that for globalists the denigration of the political by the law assumes even greater importance than the promotion of the supranational per se this type of thinking confirms that the globalist scepticism towards the nation state is to a great extent driven by anxieties over its democratic content rather than over its mass political aspects globalists fear the nation state only insofar as it is a mechanism for democratic power the globalist denial of the effectiveness of national state policies is mostly a denial of the acceptance of democratic politics the globalist and neoliberal attack on nationalism and sovereignty is really an attack on the unlimited power of the people of which hayek was so critical complementing their combined fears of a return of international conflict and of economic breakdown what worries our globalist often neoliberal elite most on a day to day level is popular democracy they baulk at the notion of people intruding into their technocratic practices and procedures in conclusion motivated by those three concerns international conflict capitalist collapse and the distrust of people globalists are pragmatic often fervent about using state institutions to maintain and stabilise capitalist economic relations the liberal rules of the international financial regime were constructed more to build the capacity of international organisations not to limit the interventions of individual governments globalists are happy running not just international institutions but national ones too as long as they can build in protection from democratic accountability globalists and neoliberals will still today repeatedly recite their belief in the free market and in free trade but the freedom that really motivates them is not freedom from state intervention it is freedom from the intrusion of politics in the end this comes down to freedom from being answerable to the people the triple goals of protecting capitalism from war from breakdown and from popular intrusion and ultimately from popular insurrection is what necessitates the globalist desire to curb the potentially disruptive effects on market processes of national democracy the synthesis of those three fears accounts for the anti political core of neoliberal globalism slobodian appropriately describes neoliberalism as less a theory of the market or of economics than of law and the state neoliberal informed globalism is much more a political project than it is an economic one hayek s most important contribution to globalism was not his romantic attachment to the free market it was his arguments about what he called the dethronement of politics the irony is that the neoliberal goal of depoliticising the economy is itself a political programme it ultimately finds expression in trying to shield capitalism from democratic influences as early as 1932 eucken the father of german ordoliberalismus had openly denounced what he called the democratisation of the world referring to the masses coming into politics through universal although then mostly male suffrage almost exactly 50 years later after visiting pinochet s chile hayek was equally explicit about his contempt for democracy in an interview with the chilean newspaper el mercurio he said he was totally against dictatorships as long term institutions but at times it is necessary for a country to have for a time some form of dictatorial power personally he continued i prefer a liberal dictator to democratic government lacking liberalism 14 this summed up the globalist philosophy that you cannot have political freedom without economic freedom but economic freedom is okay without political freedom a quarter century later in 2015 jean claude juncker president of the european commission expressed the same authoritarian message there can be no democratic choice against the european treaties 15 this was no slip of the tongue a few years earlier when leading the eurogroup of finance ministers juncker explained monetary policy is a serious issue we should discuss this in secret he went on to acknowledge i m ready to be insulted as being insufficiently democratic but i want to be serious i am for secret dark debates it is not such a long step from hayek supporting general pinochet s

remarks at the challenges in understanding the monetary transmission mechanism conference speech by yves mersch member of the executive board of the ecb warsaw 22 march 2019 should we radically rethink the role of cash to deal with the lower bound on interest rates the lower bound on interest rates has been a major challenge for central bankers in the multiple crises over the last ten years it threatens the effectiveness of monetary policy by preventing it from steering financial conditions moreover the continuous decline in both the real rate and confidence in the central bank as well as resistance at the retail level raises the question of whether negative rates should be part of the standard toolkit of central banks in the context of the eurosystem s asset purchase programmes the combined package of negative nominal interest rates and lending schemes that incentivise banks to increase lending e g the targeted longer term refinancing operations or tltros have been an effective and appropriate way to combat these challenges while cash represented the largest part of central bank balance sheets before the crisis other elements of the balance sheet have since gained more prominence in the operational framework of monetary policy some people want to abolish cash by taking advantage of recent technological advances such as distributed ledger technology dlt or replace public money with private money in total denial of people s trust in liabilities issued by central banks and the fact that their continued demand for cash exceeds gdp growth others argue for the introduction of a dual currency scheme where the central bank would divide the monetary base into two separate local currencies cash and electronic money e money e money would be issued only electronically and would pay the policy rate of interest and cash would have an exchange rate the conversion rate against e money which could be manipulated to match negative rates on e money by setting the conversion rate for cash lower than one to one i have experienced the nightmare of dual exchange regimes before the euro and i have doubts about these arguments our unconventional measures have proven sufficient to meet the challenges of low inflation the governing council has confidence in the sustained adjustment in the path of inflation recent evidence supports the hypothesis that there is some substitutability between conventional and unconventional monetary policies additionally while being able to set significantly negative rates may work smoothly in an economic model i am less certain how the general public would react particularly after millennia of positive nominal rates not only would such rates be deeply unpopular there may also be unintended changes in behaviour that could dampen the effectiveness of the measure the fact that banks do not pass negative rates on to most depositors and notably not to households is a warning sign for central banks of how people may react if attempts were made to extend the lower bound of rates downwards by replacing cash with some form of remunerated digital currency what assets the central bank ought to hold against these widely held liabilities driving bank disintermediation and deleveraging a potential decision to issue a central bank digital currency cbdc needs to be assessed in relation to the impact on the financial system in an extreme case during a systemic banking crisis holding risk free central bank issued cbdc could become vastly more attractive than bank deposits there could be a sector wide run on bank deposits magnifying the effects of the crisis even in the absence of a crisis readily convertible cbdc could crowd out bank deposits putting the two tier banking system at risk then the efficient flow of credit to the economy would likely be impaired the central bank now holders of deposit funding would have to decide which projects to finance either directly by replacing commercial banks or indirectly by deciding which banks would receive funding this would lead to a situation in which the central bank pretends to know better than the established system of the decentralised allocation of credit overall there is currently no convincing motivation for the eurosystem to issue cbdc to the general public it is unnecessary and appears to be disproportionate to the aims put forward by its proponents there is no need to fix something that is not broken if anything one could imagine a digital representation of cash that replicates the features of cash in the reasonably distant future if people demanded it and i have not even mentioned the insufficient robustness or reliability of some technologies like dlt or their energy insufficiencies and dependencies how does technological change affect the monetary transmission mechanism and monetary policy technological change has multifaceted effects on the transmission mechanism it is important not to jump to conclusions for example that because the phillips curve has become flatter monetary policy needs to be more aggressive let me add that beyond technological changes additional liquidity demand factors also stem from regulatory change fragmentation and the fact that the banking union is incomplete i will consider how technological change affects the following three broad channels of monetary transmission without focusing on the consequences structural changes will have for the operational framework how policy rates affect market interest rates and financial conditions labour markets and the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment nairu price setting and the phillips curve financial innovations have the potential to impact the way the economy is financed a change from bank based to market based financing has been taking place for some time in the euro area partly related to financial innovation this has led to firms having a more diversified financing structure and has improved their resilience to shocks emanating from the banking system at the same time corporate exposure to volatility in market rates has increased fintechs can lead to further bank disintermediation but also financial deepening by allowing otherwise constrained households and firms to borrow in addition fintech can strengthen unregulated lending activities posing challenges to financial stability this might affect the transmission mechanism although how it will do so is not yet clear labour markets and the nairu the possible disruption from technological change is likely to be felt in labour markets email videoconferencing secure vpn connections and outsourcing across countries all enable services to be provided from a distance and permit a greater degree of flexibility in working practices a massive socioeconomic shift in the labour market the internet enables more services to be offered with less intermediation at lower prices fragmentation of labour time is shown in the diverging results of compensation per employee and compensation per hour worked for some workers this is a positive development allowing them to participate in the workforce where previously they were excluded for others the greater individualisation can lead to insecurity affecting households income more individualised roles can also weaken the power of collective bargaining to maintain the labour share of income while the productivity enhancing aspects of digitalisation might tend to raise potential output growth the effects operating through labour and capital are more uncertain and might even work in different directions there may be some substitution of labour for capital with possible repercussions for the bargaining power of workers and a shift in investment to the it sector as a result of digitalisation and servicification if there is a skill bias in the transition to digital technology this could lead to a greater mismatch in labour markets and therefore a higher nairu and lower potential output growth on the other hand digital production and supply chains and digital communication and connectivity would tend to lower the nairu and raise potential output because of the productivity increases resulting from faster collection and evaluation of data and the greater efficiency of digitally underpinned production the overall effect of digitalisation and new technologies on demand and supply therefore depends on many factors these include the initial conditions economies with high quality institutions and governance are likely to see faster adoption and implementation of digital technologies and a faster impact on potential output from a monetary policy perspective it is important to monitor the digital transformation of the economy some economists argue that output productivity intangible investment and prices have become more difficult to measure as a result of digitalisation literature suggests that even though some mismeasurement exists its impacts may not necessarily be greater than in previous episodes of technological change but the analysis is ongoing with various opinions and sometimes conflicting results of course the fast pace of change across all areas of the economy also requires us to update our tools for monitoring it and leverage the opportunities modern technology gives us including new and better data price setting and the phillips curve technological progress poses a particularly acute challenge because of its direct impact on businesses price setting behaviour behaviour that directly underlies the inflationary process the growing importance of e commerce rapid product introduction and substitution and the quality adjustment of new products also pose their own challenges for measuring inflation technological progress has resulted in the creation of products such as smartphones and internet service providers that had no equivalent in the past failing to properly measure the quality improvements in new products can result in an upward bias in measured inflation on the other hand the reduction in shelf life of many products and the heavy discounting of less fashionable older versions could instead create downward bias in traditional price indices technological changes to price and wage setting behaviour have much deeper relevance for central banks than just the measurement of inflation the speed and extent of how inflation reacts to shocks affects the optimal monetary policy response e commerce may result in suppliers changing prices more frequently not only are amazon s prices more flexible than prices of brick and mortar stores amazon s competitors are forced to adjust prices more often for products that are also offered by amazon more frequent price changes result in a steeper phillips curve prices react more quickly and strongly to changes in costs and output this could also mean that inflation reacts much faster to monetary policy not only are amazon s prices more flexible than prices of brick and mortar stores amazon s competitors are forced to adjust prices more often for products that are also offered by amazon more frequent price changes result in a steeper phillips curve prices react more quickly and strongly to changes in costs and output this could also mean that inflation reacts much faster to monetary policy since online stores effectively offer the same price across locations e commerce may restrict the ability of businesses to set prices that deviate substantially from those of large online retailers while reflecting local conditions so prices may change more often but they may be more uniform which in turn may restrict the ability of prices to reflect idiosyncratic and regional shocks e commerce changes not only how firms set prices but also how consumers shop it has revolutionised the transparency of pricing both within and across countries allowing consumers to easily compare prices and swap one product for another this can result in higher demand elasticities eroding the monopolistic and monopsonistic power of suppliers and reducing mark ups profit margins at amazon less than 4 are much lower than at walmart more than 20 such a change in demand elasticities and mark ups can be viewed as a flattening of the phillips curve such a change in demand elasticities and mark ups can be viewed as a flattening of the phillips curve finally the emerging prevalence of e commerce can create new opportunities for consumers to switch their shopping outlets over the business cycle for example there is evidence that households actively exploit price differentials across stores and trade down in recessions e g switch from a regular grocery store to a discounter it could be predicted that this switching will be amplified in the future because switching to an online store is particularly easy as a result aggregate true inflation may be more cyclically sensitive than is suggested by headline inflation the impact of e commerce on the slope of the phillips curve is uncertain and studies have generally struggled to find large effects on annual inflation given the overall difficulty in estimating the slope of the phillips curve this is not entirely a surprise conclusions as with measuring consumer price indices the greater availability of more granular data has enabled a much greater understanding of how businesses set prices but while policymakers should adapt policy to take into account changes in the underlying price setting process we should also exercise due prudence given the uncertainty surrounding model estimates price stability oriented monetary policy needs to monitor innovations and their impact on financial conditions economic growth and inflation and we have to be mindful of changes in the information content of the indicators that central banks use as a basis for policy decisions e g monetary aggregates and inflation rates as the impact of innovations cannot be estimated in advance with sufficient certainty regarding the direction size and duration of the effects and uncertainty therefore prevails monetary policy should act prudently and be forward looking
emerging markets have suffered in recent years due to low commodities prices and slower global demand with signs that emerging markets were on the comeback trail in 2017 many analysts earlier this year believed that 2018 would be much brighter for emerging markets however there are signs that tailwinds are fading the imf said in its latest world economic outlook that this year and next growth in emerging market and developing economies will rise before leveling off thank you for reading this post don t forget to subscribe our economists believe that there is a growing divergence between developed and developing economies among developing nations with economies with relatively solid fundamentals and driven by commodity exports especially oil growth is accelerating this year going into next however higher yields in the united states the rise in energy prices and large exposure to foreign debt are putting pressure on some oil importing countries and those with persistent macroeconomic imbalances this mostly results in heightened volatility in their financial and equity markets as well as sizeable currency depreciations let s take a closer look at what s expected for some of these countries in the coming year emerging markets economic outlook 2019 nigeria higher oil prices improved liquidity and increased public spending in the run up to the 2019 elections should

on may 31st we were able to continue growing through our diversified global distribution network and further consolidate our leading position in terms of market share with global demand recovering strongly we remain confident in the future prospects of our business and expect module shipments to grow by approximately 30 in 2019 china s national energy administration recently laid out plans for a bidding system and is expected to again begin granting subsidy approvals for utility scale projects most importantly subsidies will be prepaid by the state grid which means there will be no more delays in payment for new projects the new policies set a clear direction for the country s solar plans and will help to greatly improve sentiment for the solar sector as the country tries to smoothly transition towards grid parity and encourage a more market driven environment based on the new policies we believe domestic installations in 2019 will exceed last year distributed generation projects and projects completed at grid parity will continue to make up a larger portion of overall installations us demand continues to strengthen thanks to the introduction of the solar investment tax credit itc which is expected to generate robust growth during the second half of 2019 our u s manufacturing facility began pilot production in november 2018 and has been steadily ramping up with full production capacity expected to begin during the second quarter of 2019 with such enormous growth potential we will continue to expand our presence in the us by leveraging our strong brand recognition

european markets is surging especially in some of the biggest markets such as spain the netherlands and germany emerging markets are also booming with jordan kuwait south africa and oman growing rapidly we are also benefiting from our early entry into southeast asian markets such as malaysia thailand and the philippines where demand remained robust throughout 2018 we continue to make progress implementing large scale crystallization furnaces to increase productivity while working to develop technologies to reduce both oxygen content and light induced degradation we are also leading the industry in terms of efficiency improvements on our diamond wire cutting which is continuously reducing our wire consumption our large area n type monocrystalline silicon solar cell reached record high efficiency of 24 2 in january 2019 we are rapidly increasing our capacity to produce high efficiency products by increasing both mono wafer capacity and perc cell capacity and converting our existing non perc capacity to perc capacity to increase output with our production gradually ramping up into the middle of 2019 our expanded capacity will improve the competitiveness of our products and strengthen our cost advantages this and other constant technological developments not only enable us to provide our clients with competitive high efficiency products but also allow us to sustainably cut costs we are confident in our ability to further optimize our cost structure going forward and are fully prepared to enter an era of grid parity in the near future looking out to 2019 we believe chinese and global demand will grow as solar energy becomes more and more competitive we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and are confident in our ability to further

u s review a wait and see approach the unanimous decision by the fomc to keep rates unchanged this week was widely expected but the committee s increased caution regarding the outlook reaffirmed its wait and see approach to monetary policy in other news the leading economic index for february suggests economic growth will continue but with the positive contributions to the index getting smaller on trend the index suggests a moderation in the pace of growth a wait and see approach the two day meeting of the federal open market committee fomc was the focal point this week concluding with a unanimous decision to keep the range of the federal funds rate unchanged between 2 25 and 2 50 this decision was widely expected by financial markets but the committee s increased caution regarding the outlook reaffirmed its wait and see approach to monetary policy perhaps expected equity markets gained at the onset of the announcement but markets soon gave back most of those gains after fully digesting the breadth of the fomc s decision the committee downgraded its assessment of the economy with officials median projection for growth this year dropping to 2 1 from 2 5 previously with this more reserved outlook the committee scaled back its expectations regarding tightening and now looks to be on hold for the rest of this year does this suggest the fomc believes it has reached its neutral policy rate taking the dot plot at face value would suggest there is still a modest preference to hike rates 25 bps next year but given the patient tone of the fomc and its data dependent approach it is remains a close call on if the next move would be a hike or a cut our most recent forecast looks for the fed to hike rates 25 bps later this year markets had previously priced in a low probability of a hike this year but after this week s meeting the tone among markets shifted with the market implied probability of a cut in late 2019 jumping to about 60 although a rate hike in 2019 is still possible the committees communication this week suggests that the risk to our forecast is skewed to the downside we have been looking for a step down in growth this year for some time now and as highlighted in the committees statement more recent data around consumer spending and business fixed investment suggest such a moderation in growth will unfold for more detail regarding the fomc decision please see our interest rate watch on page 6 besides the fomc meeting we also learned that the leading economic index rose 0 2 in february while the index continues to suggest a solid pace of growth the positive contributions to the index have been getting smaller on trend suggesting some temperance this is clearly seen in the interest rate spread component as the spread between the 10 year treasury and fed funds rate has continued to fall although it has not fallen into negative territory if or perhaps when the yield curve inverts market apprehension of a recession will heighten but while we look for growth to moderate we think financial markets may be underestimating near term growth both upside and downside risks to the outlook persist perhaps one of the largest of these risks remains the outcome of trade negotiations between the united states and china a new round of talks are set to take place in beijing next week with the hopes of a deal by the end of april but president trump said this week that tariffs on chinese goods may remain in place for a substantial period of time which only increases uncertainty around the impact to economic growth we will continue to monitor these developments as they arise and adjust our forecast as necessary u s outlook housing starts tuesday next week we get a look at the extent to which the fed s dovish pivot has fed through to the housing market as we enter the spring buying season the announcement of the pause in december spurred a 50 bps plunge in mortgage rates which appears to have been just in time to stem the slide in residential activity as housing starts rebounded 18 6 in january after the 14 drop in december the jump in single family starts last month broke a string of four consecutive declines with permits running 15 ahead of starts we expect to see a continued modest rebound through the spring moderating home price appreciation and firming mortgage applications and builder confidence should boost new home sales for which we also receive february data next week as a primary transmission mechanism for monetary policy the housing market will be closely watched this spring for clues as to the efficacy and sustainability of the fed s new stance previous 1 230k wells fargo 1 201k consensus 1 210k consumer confidence tuesday consumer confidence stabilized last month as the government shutdown and the equity market sell off retreated further in the rear view mirror while off the peak of 137 9 from last october the index reading of 131 4 remains elevated amid a very strong labor market and accelerating wages as financial markets and consumers digest the fed s new policy stance their expectations for future conditions will drive the outlook for personal consumption such elevated readings of consumer confidence are consistent with robust growth in personal consumption which explains our surprise at the 0 6 drop in real spending reported in december we caution against reading too much into this one figure or the alarming december retail sales report real pce rose a stronger than expected 2 8 in q4 going forward we expect a moderation rather than a decline on friday we get january spending data which should reflect a more moderate pace of growth from the consumer sector previous 131 4 wells fargo 131 8 consensus 132 0 trade balance wednesday slowing global growth and surprisingly resilient domestic demand pose a challenging backdrop for the u s trade balance last month the deficit widened to a 10 year high of 59 8 billion as imports surged and exports fell for the third consecutive month systemic global uncertainty surrounding the trade environment as well as country specific slowdowns in major trading partners china japan and germany should eat into global demand for the foreseeable future weighing on the u s trade balance and overall gdp growth u s trade representatives will be in beijing on thursday and friday as the two countries continue to negotiate toward a potential deal net exports were originally reported to have subtracted 0 2 percentage points off of growth in the fourth quarter but revisions to the national accounts data released next thursday will likely bump up the drag to 0 3 percentage points previous 59 8b wells fargo 58 4b consensus 57 3b global review brexit uncertainties persist norges bank goes hawkish as the end march deadline approaches brexit developments continue to dominate headlines u k prime minister theresa may has stated her intention to seek a delay to the deadline while u k parliament might reconvene again to vote on may s deal amid brexit the bank of england held policy rates steady this week as uncertainty is likely to persist for the time being the central bank of norway opted to raise interest rates at this week s monetary policy meeting and suggested more hikes may be coming as other major central banks have become more dovish norges bank has undertaken a more hawkish path as oil prices recover and the domestic economy improves see eu later not so fast with a little over a week before the u k s current deadline to leave the eu brexit developments have again dominated headlines this week while the situation between the u k and the eu is very fluid and susceptible to frequent change at the current juncture u k prime minister theresa may has formally signaled her intention to ask the eu for a short extension of the article 50 deadline to june 30 as expected the eu has pushed back on this request granting may only a two week extension of article 50 during these two weeks may must get members of parliament to approve her current brexit deal if she cannot gather u k parliament support the eu has indicated may will have until april 12 to decide whether the u k leaves the eu with no deal or must formally request a much longer extension of the deadline with commentary from eu officials suggesting a possible extension of up to a year these new developments have significantly increased the risk of a no deal brexit while a longer extension of the deadline makes options such as a leadership challenge and second referendum more likely as well as brexit developments continue to unfold the british pound is likely to remain quite volatile despite a recent decline we expect volatility in the pound to pick up as any brexit votes will likely be contentious among the midst of brexit the bank of england boe met on thursday to decide monetary policy as expected the boe left policy rates unchanged as the uncertainty regarding the outcome of brexit lingers over the economy despite a more dovish policy stance of global central banks markets are still implying the boe will look to raise rates over the next few years as of now markets are pricing in about 1 bp of rate hikes in 12 months and about 11 bps over a two year horizon while we share a similar outlook for higher interest rates we believe the boe will look to be more aggressive in tightening monetary policy with our forecast calling for a 25 bps hike in the third quarter of this year and another hike in q1 2020 our primary rationale continues to be centered on our view that the u k will come to a brexit agreement and an orderly exit from the eu is imminent with the domestic economy resilient and performing relatively well an orderly exit should remove the majority of the uncertainty hanging over the u k economy and should provide the boe with sufficient rationale for raising policy rates aside from the boe a few other major foreign central banks decided monetary policy this week with the central bank of norway being the most notable in response to recently higher oil prices and an improving domestic economy norges bank opted to hike its benchmark deposit rate 25 bps to 1 up from 0 75 this is the first policy rate hike from the central bank of norway since august 2018 and marks a diverging path of monetary policy from the rest of the developed world as major central banks continue to suggest steady monetary policy for the time being policymakers from norges bank also suggested that interest rates may increase again in the second half of this year as oil prices continue to recover the domestic economy continues to strengthen and inflation remains above the central bank s target rate global outlook central bank of mexico decision thursday last year the central bank of mexico maintained a relatively hawkish stance on monetary policy raising interest rates four times over the course of 2018 the combination of hawkish global central banks along with an unstable currency were likely the most influential factors in the central bank s decision to raise policy rates however as global monetary policy has become more benign and the peso has stabilized the central bank of mexico is likely to remain on hold in the short term in fact mexico s economy slowed noticeably in 2018 while this sluggish momentum has carried into 2019 as well as a result the central bank may look to reverse course and cut policy rates in an effort to reignite growth and inflation markets share a similar outlook as well and are currently pricing in two full rate cuts from the central bank over the next year while we expect the central bank to keep rates steady next week we anticipate the tone to be more dovish in nature suggesting cuts may be on the horizon previous 8 25 consensus 8 25 argentina economic activity thursday following last year s currency crisis and extreme tightening of monetary policy argentina s economy fell into a deep recession while we expected the economy to show signs of bottoming out by now economic activity has not recovered and continues to underperform expectations in february economic activity contracted by 7 year over year a much larger decline than consensus forecasts had suggested the worse than expected data have put renewed downward pressure on the peso once again and with cpi inflation recently hitting a new high weak economic activity in march may push the peso towards an all time low and extend argentina s recession despite soft economic activity authorities have taken adequate steps toward curing argentina s domestic imbalances this is evidenced by the imf applauding the administration s efforts towards achieving a balanced budget while disbursing another us 10 8b to the government to ensure economic stabilization previous 7 0 year over year eurozone cpi inflation friday at its latest meeting the ecb made significant downward revisions to its forecasts for both gdp growth and inflation on the inflation side the ecb cut its outlook in 2019 to 1 2 year over year down from a previous forecast of 1 6 while also cutting its forecasts in 2020 and 2021 in an effort to stimulate growth and inflation dynamics across the broader european economy the ecb introduced a new round of targeted long term refinancing operations tltros aimed at encouraging commercial banks to lend to the private sector along with the forecast revisions and tltro announcement the ecb also changed its forward guidance to suggest policy rates will remain on hold through the end of 2019 we share a similar outlook with our forecast now calling for a rate hike in march 2020 as growth and inflation are likely to remain relatively subdued for the time being any indications that cpi inflation is still slowing could push back the timing again for an ecb policy rate hike previous 1 5 wells fargo 1 3 consensus 1 5 year over year point of view interest rate watch fed on hold through 2019 as universally expected the federal open market committee fomc voted unanimously on march 20 to keep the range for the fed funds rate between 2 25 to 2 50 that said the announcement was not without consequence for starters the fomc downgraded its assessment of the current state of the economy saying that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter furthermore it shaved down its gdp growth forecast for 2019 and 2020 top chart more consequentially the committee indicated it may not raise rates any further this year in december the median fomc forecaster projected 50 bps of tightening in 2019 and another 25 bps rate hike in 2020 the median forecaster now believes that the fomc will keep the target range for the fed funds rate unchanged at 2 25 to 2 50 for the rest of 2019 middle chart the median forecast of one 25 bps rate hike next year remains in the forecast but seven of the 17 fomc members think that rates will be on hold next year as well in other words the forecast of a rate hike next year is a close call the committee also said that it will slow the pace at which its balance sheet is shrinking and that it will end the runoff of treasury securities altogether in october as we have been writing for some time the fed s balance sheet will be elevated for the foreseeable future furthermore it will continue to hold trillions of dollars of treasury securities which everything else equal should keep long term interest rates lower than they otherwise would be our most recent forecast which was compiled earlier this month looks for the fed to hike rates by 25 bps later this year we expected that the fomc would then remain on hold until the end of 2020 when we forecasted that it would cut rates by 25 bps although another rate hike in 2019 is still possible the fomc s announcement this week means that the risk to our current forecast is skewed to the downside we will continue to monitor incoming data to determine whether we need to adjust our forecast for the fed funds rate credit market insights foreigners flee u s equities data released from the u s treasury showed foreign investors fleeing u s equities in january as the stock market volatility continued into the new year foreigners offloaded a net 31 2 billion in u s equities the largest decline since september 2015 when fears about the chinese economy caused another stock market swoon this large january decline came on the heels of an 18 2 billion drop in foreign equity holdings in december the sharp declines in december january were part of a larger trend that has seen foreigners reducing their holdings of u s equities over the past 12 months foreign holdings of u s equities have declined a net 187 billion the largest on record where then has foreign money been flowing into u s fixed income particularly treasuries and agency debt in january chinese investors purchased 15 billion of agency debt the largest net purchase since july 2013 the foreign flows into treasuries have been mostly concentrated among foreign private investors as foreign official holders of treasuries have continued to see net selling over the past several months to some extent the net decline in foreign holdings is also a result of u s residents reducing their exposure to foreign securities u s residents have been heavy sellers of foreign securities over the past 12 months particularly foreign fixed income with concerns about the current economic cycle it appears capital is flowing toward domestic sources and fixed income topic of the week shifting burdens of household debt household debt in the united states is higher now than it was at the height of the prior cycle which has brought dire warnings about leverage and the inevitable comparisons to debt levels in 2008 there are reasons to be circumspect about the composition of household debt and too much leverage was indeed a large part of what went wrong in the lead up to the financial crisis but the hand wringing about reaching all time highs in household debt are misplaced in our view as long as assets income and the broader economy are rising along with it rising debt itself is not disconcerting it is when debt is growing in excess of these measures that it becomes a concern for future consumer spending and more broadly economic growth at 13 54 trillion in q4 2018 total u s household debt is roughly 7 higher than the total level of household indebtedness at its prior peak in q3 2008 household debt amounted to about 86 of total disposable income in the fourth quarter which is down from about 115 right before the 2008 crisis the household debt service ratio and financial obligations ratio remain at or near historic lows suggesting households quarterly debt payments remain relatively small with manageable debt burdens we do not expect debt payments to constrain consumer spending at this time what is potentially more troubling than the rise in household debt is the shifting composition of it almost all of the growth in household debt since 2008 is concentrated in student and auto loans as you might expect younger households tend to experience this in more pronounced ways the youngest households owe more in student loans than they do on a mortgage the growth in auto lending is not particularly disconcerting but student loan debt is rather than seeing elevated household debt levels as an immediate catalyst for recession what we see instead is a shift in the composition of debt toward student loans that will likely weigh on consumer spending for years to come for our

reuters following are five big themes likely to dominate thinking of investors and traders in the coming week and the reuters stories related to them 1 take it easy with the u s federal reserve well and truly doubling down on its dovish guidance this month the global rate hiking cycle is at an end there are exceptions of course but the big central banks of the developed world the fed the european central bank and bank of japan have all reacted decisively to the steady drumbeat of depressing economic data by pushing any policy tightening plans to the backburner but instead of deriving any comfort from the pivot some in the market are interpreting the moves as desperate measures to ward off impending recession that fear is certainly evident on bond markets where the gap between three

slid back below zero percent for the first time since 2016 there are outliers norway has hiked rates while hungary and czech rates may also rise this coming week one could argue norway s economy has

on may 31st we were able to continue growing through our diversified global distribution network and further consolidate our leading position in terms of market share with global demand recovering strongly we remain confident in the future prospects of our business and expect module shipments to grow by approximately 30 in 2019 china s national energy administration recently laid out plans for a bidding system and is expected to again begin granting subsidy approvals for utility scale projects most importantly subsidies will be prepaid by the state grid which means there will be no more delays in payment for new projects the new policies set a clear direction for the country s solar plans and will help to greatly improve sentiment for the solar sector as the country tries to smoothly transition towards grid parity and encourage a more market driven environment based on the new policies we believe domestic installations in 2019 will exceed last year distributed generation projects and projects completed at grid parity will continue to make up a larger portion of overall installations us demand continues to strengthen thanks to the introduction of the solar investment tax credit itc which is expected to generate robust growth during the second half of 2019 our u s manufacturing facility began pilot production in november 2018 and has been steadily ramping up with full production capacity expected to begin during the second quarter of 2019 with such enormous growth potential we will continue to expand our presence in the us by leveraging our strong brand recognition high quality products and best in class customer service following the cancellation of the minimum import price policy demand from solar power purchase agreements and grid parity projects in the european markets is surging especially in some of the biggest markets such as spain the netherlands and germany emerging markets are also booming with jordan kuwait south africa and oman growing rapidly we are also benefiting from our early entry into southeast asian markets such as malaysia thailand and the philippines where demand remained robust throughout 2018 we continue to make progress implementing large scale crystallization furnaces to increase productivity while working to develop technologies to reduce both oxygen content and light induced degradation we are also leading the industry in terms of efficiency improvements on our diamond wire cutting which is continuously reducing our wire consumption our large area n type monocrystalline silicon solar cell reached record high efficiency of 24 2 in january 2019 we are rapidly increasing our capacity to produce high efficiency products by increasing both mono wafer capacity and perc cell capacity and converting our existing non perc capacity to perc capacity to increase output with our production gradually ramping up into the middle of 2019 our expanded capacity will improve the competitiveness of our products and strengthen our cost advantages this and other constant technological developments not only enable us to provide our clients with competitive high efficiency products but also allow us to sustainably cut costs we are confident in our ability to further optimize our cost structure going forward and are fully prepared to enter an era of grid parity in the near future looking out to 2019 we believe chinese and global demand will grow as solar energy becomes more and more competitive we are excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and are confident in our ability to further

initiative but it often takes public action to create the initiative particularly in blighted areas what can or should the city do to ensure affordable accessible housing for all residents the city in

protection of our water resources across the state i have seen firsthand how they add financial and cultural value to communities in the last decade our downtown has seen a renaissance all thanks to

current future business prospects also require a tax burden that allows for an enterprise to flourish in a competitive business location marketplace as policy makers city council decisions must be

the city play in local redevelopment efforts support redevelopment efforts through the private sector through planning zoning variations if appropriate targeting those areas that fit best with the strategic plan of eau claire and or where developers have investment interest public financing of infrastructure in redevelopment must be carefully weighed against the cost of such financing to the

housing will therefore become more affordable job growth economic development will move that needle council can also work with the private sector by implementing appropriate zoning changes to make

role of government to act as an impartial umpire or judge working to assure an even playing field equal opportunity for all participants while i do not think it should be a requirement i think the city should consider giving priority for local services whenever possible or at least not exclude them out of hand what role should the city play in local redevelopment efforts it is certainly within the scope of good city government to support the efforts of existing businesses in our area as well as to attract responsible business and commercial interests by promoting our community as the outstanding city that it in fact has become although i think the recent efforts of public private and higher education working together for our community have been successful and have served as a positive model for other communities we must be more careful about our use of tif districts and the extent to which our public coffers are utilized to subsidize private ventures what can or should the

data has been fairly represented eau claire s housing is more affordable than that in most other cities in our state but incomes are lower encouraging growth in business to allow for higher earnings

other services promoting public health and safety with respect to a specific list of defined services state and county governments have been assigned the responsibility of providing community health and social services and a considerable amount of our tax dollars already go to the county to provide those services many important concerns including affordable housing and environmental sustainability should more properly involve voluntary levels of commitment on the part of private business personal enterprise and existing or new community groups and nonprofits with the support and

the regional and municipal levels are closer to the sources of innovation innovation in the form of start up activity tends to occur in large metropolitan areas initially without the involvement of policymakers while an enabling policy may not be a precondition for seeding entrepreneurial activity it may become more critical when taking entrepreneurial activity to scale to flourish entrepreneurial activity requires a concentration of talent infrastructure capital and networks it s the city s role to provide an infrastructure that is conducive to economic growth what role should the city play in local redevelopment efforts city governments play a pivotal role in helping community developers to revitalize low income neighborhoods cities set local development priorities and allocate public funds to affordable housing and other community development initiatives they decide whether or not to make community development corporations their primary development partners and they oversee the disbursement of land housing and other city owned resources rare is the developer that can move forward in neighborhood development without active city government participation i

accessible housing for all residents when i get on the city council i plan to apply for a grant from the u s department of housing and urban development to build 150 affordable housing units my goal is to place 30 of them in each of the five districts of our city to make it easier for residents to get to work these units will be placed in areas that are easily accessible to public transportation

city in a way that is sustainable and is safe for the environment so i also gave that 13 points along with our recreational and cultural opportunities next on my priority list is maintaining reducing taxes if everything else i previously listed is in tip top shape we should have plenty of revenue to maintain everything so managing the budget to reduce taxes would be something to consider last on

create businesses that will thrive we need to continue to recruit new business and industry and to that end utilize our business and industrial parks to the fullest potential we also need to retain the employers we have and offer support where we can we need to fill vacant retail buildings and continue the revitalization efforts downtown and around the city because quality of life is a main factor in deciding where to locate a business we need to continue to support the arts and recreation what role should the city play in local redevelopment efforts successful redevelopment efforts require planning the process is challenging for example while the city must continue to maintain and update streets sidewalks alleys and utilities we must also prepare to respond to redevelopment efforts like those downtown with policies that meet the needs of all residents successful redevelopment efforts may need zoning changes that reduce minimum lot size decrease residential parking requirements and change building setbacks all of this could better accommodate development within the city to meet future needs in an affordable fashion residents developers neighborhood associations

please specify 0 please explain why you organized your priorities as you did i distributed the money evenly to point out that we don t prioritize one department over the other rather we allocate funds according to what each department needs to provide basic services also not all of these departments are funded in the same way some like the police department rely primarily on the levy others like the health department get about half of its funding from grants still others like recreation depend in part on user fees the proportion of taxpayer funds given to each department can also change over time as new goals and needs arise for example community services will put some additional focus on housing issues however the city s mission is to assure the common good through services essential for a safe sustainable engaged and healthy community to that end all of these departments need to be funded such that they can fulfill the mission andrew werthmann age 36 years in eau claire 19 family

by michael ballanger via streetwise reports after over 40 years in the world of money and markets i have arrived at the conclusion that aging can be a double edged sword where the advantages created by many years of experience are many times odiously offset by innate biases that become ingrained over time it came to me while listening to a fascinating interview with felix zulauf a former money manager and member of the legendary barron s roundtable during the session brilliantly hosted by realvision tv s grant williams felix made reference to a real and present danger looming on the horizons for global financial markets which is the growing influence of government in the future direction of markets all markets sexagenarians such as i were weaned in the very early years of free markets long before central banks took control of everything from foreign exchange to soybean prices we were educated to believe that the really big wins always occur when you feel like the loneliest person on the planet when taking on a new position if you recall the book and movie the big short you felt the pain of people like michael burry whose clients were ready to lynch him in the early days when goldman sachs refused to properly mark his month end bearish positions you were also cheering from the end blues when subprime imploded and burry has the last laugh and payday to deem it magical would be understatement i recall as if it were yesterday the year 2001 sitting in a kitchen with a group of young working mothers who had just found out that i was in the investment business and proceeded to pepper me with questions these were people i had never met before and after a few moments two of them asked me what i thought of nortel networks one of the last companies standing in the latter stages of the tech bubble of 1990 2001 i proceeded to tell them that if i owned it i would sell it before you have your morning coffee because it is going to zero not noticing that the cheers had turned to jeers and the smiles on those hopeful faces had been replaced with scowls of contempt i further added and if you don t own them i would find someone who does borrow them promise to give them back the shares in twelve months and then sell them before you have your morning coffee now most of these nice ladies had grown openly hostile so after a few derogatory remarks the room cleared out except for one bespectacled young mother who asked why so i told her my reasons as plainly as possible after thanking me for the insights she then proceeded to tell me that everyone at the party herself included worked for nortel and had their life savings and 100 of their retirement funds in nortel stock needless to say i was speechless and after being shunned for the entire room for the next hour i departed after apologizing to the host for accidentally attempting to earlier swallow both of my feet well fast forward to a year later and nortel had dropped from 125 per share to under 1 00 before going to zero and being delisted from the tsx and nyse exchanges and as i am walking through the upper canada mall i hear my name being called and lo and behold it is the bespectacled lady from that nortel party she proceeded to thank me about a dozen times because the first thing she did that following monday after our kitchen discussion was to phone her broker and liquidate every nortel share she could find in all of her accounts she even called her mother and father and told them to do the same as well as all of her co workers how did that go over i asked to which she responded not very well they unfortunately held on and three of them have not only lost their jobs but also their homes in the days around 2001 companies with negative cash flow eventually got trashed and if the accounting practices were fraudulent as were nortel s the executives usually not always went to jail however in 2001 with nortel cruising at 125 literally everyone owned it and even the mailroom clerks could recite five reasons why it was going to 500 the moral to the story is this in the era before social media and germ colony progressive cheerleading one could take a contrarian view on a specific company or a specific market and expect to be proven either right or wrong based on veracity of one s investment thesis there was no such beast as a software driven algorithm juicing a specific stock or market in the face of declining performance or economic conditions you were rewarded within a reasonable period of time because you were operating in a free market environment take the example of tesla tsla us a company whose fundamentals according to most of the analysts i have listened to are eroding rapidly amidst growing electric car competition from the big auto makers in both the u s and europe despite the overwhelmingly bearish data i am terrified of shorting tsla because of one major risk social media one tweet from ceo elon musk has been known to advance the stock price 20 in a day despite numerous warnings and sanctions from regulators and yet the poor slob that is short the stock is in need of new knickers and is on specialty blood pressure pills similarly if you have been a holder of precious metals or the companies that explore for or produce them you have been watching for the better part of 30 years a system of government and regulatory collusion in suppressing the prices in an ongoing effort to fortify the u s currency regime one last example of the disappearance of the free market is that very u s dollar and its role as the global reserve currency total government debt for the u s exceeds 22 trillion which is 13 trillion greater than the second most indebted country the u k at 8 trillion in a free market system investors would question the soundness of any country so heavily in debt and unanimously reject its currency however the world appears to be collectively short dollars and are scrambling to own more dollars into every dip and for all of the apparently wrong reasons the reason for this lies in one word debt at the end of the day the american spin machine has convinced the world that it will never default on its debts because after all america is the heart and soul of free market capitalism and the driver of wealth creation the world over however like nortel 17 years ago and tesla 17 minutes ago once you have lifted the hood and start doing compression tests on the cylinders you rapidly realize that the american engine of growth the middle class is in deep trouble and in need of new rings and valves we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us notwithstanding the fact that america is a wonderful country with some of the warmest nicest people on the planet its leaders have been forced to maintain and prolong a massive multi generational ponzi scheme designed to finance the nato war machine spearheaded by the u s military as i have typed for years upon years the only way that changes is when the uss nimitz pulls into gibraltar for a refitting and they refuse the credit card in other words the achilles heel of the u s is the dollar the exact weakness being targeted by those that would seek to eliminate the petrodollar and the swift payments systems make no mistake that is happening as we speak the growing number of sexagenarian money managers who have returned money to investors and opened family offices meaning they run only their own money is a testament to the stark disadvantages of having been trained in a free market environment in today s world of handheld devices and mass communication apps the millennial and genx geny investor class pay little heed to anything that vaguely resembles fundamental analysis and prefers instead to run with their social media brethren to gang attack any form of story stock in a type of group infestation where sheer volume of buyers creates the momentum to promulgate the validity of the prevailing investment thesis that seems to be the prevailing sentiment these days as we have gone from a fed hostile environment to a fed friendly one inside of 90 days with stock traders totally ignoring the bond market s message to have 10 year yields collapse from over 3 25 to 2 60 inside of three months is frightening because 20 drops in yields are what usually occur when administered rates like fed funds are lowered in response to a financial shock like a market crash now the msm is more focused on the distance to all time highs than the yield on the 10 year and there isn t a day that goes by without one of the cnbc commentators mentioning it it is this seasoned veteran s opinion that ignoring sharp changes in bond yields is analogous to ship captains ignoring large shiny white objects floating on the horizon when steaming across the north atlantic not very wise the last trades i put on were the gold silver calls plus jnug nugt call option combo on march 6 and last friday when i decided to be the last standing bear in the world by accumulating calls of the triple bear spxs etf which peaked on december 24th at over 38 and which tuesday hit an intraday all time low at 20 50 before rebounding to 20 91 i am underwater on the spxs trade by a few pennies but with rsi for the s p twice popping today above 70 only to close at 66 98 i smell a downside reversal coming and given the extreme levels of the macd and histograms i can envision a short term pop to 24 into long overdue profit taking from a market five days on the upside and ahead over 17 since christmas eve of course there is ample opportunity to see a sideways consolidation with little downside volatility while the bull catches its breath and while i am not completely ruling out the working group on capital markets who take their orders from the white house pulling off an in your face assault on the all time highs of 2 941 that 2 60 10 year yield keeps flashing its irritating little red light in my rear view mirror reminding me that enormous money flows are seeking the safety of u s treasuries over the upside excitement of the stock market hence i am alone in the room despised by all and attempting to short the market right here and right now and taking a sledgehammer to the locks on the liquor cabinet while i am almost embarrassed to discuss the junior miners be they explorers or developers i have to mention getchell gold corp gtch cse and the recently announced private placement at 0 15 per unit i have to take an effing framing hammer to my forehead to remind myself that it was only three and a half months ago that i was working the deal asking investors to pony up 0 45 per unit to help finance the exploration effort in nevada today i am again working the deal asking investors to pony up more of their hard earned after tax cash to further invest in gtch at one third the price of the november funding at the honest ed s pricing level of fifteen cents per share to my dear friends that actually enjoy reading my work and to the wonderful people that have followed me into the various deals over the last several years getchell gold and the hot springs peaks project represent without argument the best prospect with which i have been involved since the early 1990s the 90s were a period of years during which i made a ton of money and more importantly a ton of like minded friends with whom i still communicate albeit in a far more muted fashion due partly by age but more so by the abysmal state of the junior mining exploration market i am getting to know the man in charge of delivering to us a major gold discovery please forgive the caps project geologist and v p exploration tim masters suffice it to say that getchell has the right man in the field i have been reaching out to my geologist friends for assistance in handicapping this drill program and i was doing so for a number of reasons including my own investible capital which has like the rest of you suffered with the mercilessness of this junior mining debacle the point i make is this in any speculation where risk is involved one must always assess the odds and where one can invest 1 with the possibility however remote that it could return 10 20 from exploration success one must take that risk and make that investment the hot springs project is just that type of project and carries just that type of potential return wednesday is the final day of the fomc meetings with the political class doing its best to maintain the status quo with the professional money managers seriously underweight equities going into end of quarter judgment day if the next few days turn down in a big way i think those overweight will think about paring back with the other side waiting until april to redeploy capital as the chart would indicate it has been a non stop v bottom ramp job engineered and managed by stevie mnuchin s new york fed soldiers designed to enhance the legacy of the trump presidency they want the 2020 electorate to feel good about the trump directives and they will engage any and all tools in an effort to swing sentiment in favor of the current administration however there is a voting bloc of seriously large weight and stroke that is in full disagreement with the notion that all is well and that bloc is called the fixed income investor class whenever they are moving at large and en masse to safety common share ownership is at risk hence i am overweight cash long gold and silver and moderately short u s stocks please deliver the contact

there must be something in the air or water in washington that encourages politicians and their followers to fall in love with what i call fantasy finance also known as making up numbers a while back we had the 2017 tax bill that donald trump and his republican enablers foisted on us claiming that it would stimulate the economy so much that added revenue would offset the cost of cutting taxes for businesses and high income people other than blue state types who pay lots of state and local taxes regular working people would get an average 4 000 annual raise as any reasonably numerate person including me predicted this hasn t worked out we haven t seen the capital spending boom the trumpublicans predicted either nor will we now fantasy finance is being peddled by left wing democrats who are embracing something called modern monetary theory which really should be called magic money theory or the lefties laffer curve the laffer curve you may recall was created by supply side economist arthur laffer it predicted that federal tax cuts would more than pay for themselves by boosting economic activity and goosing government revenue advertisement that didn t happen of course but federal taxes for high income people have remained a lot lower than they were pre laffer okay before i get to mmt let me make two disclosures first i was an english major in college who was also a straight a economics student that s because i took one course got an a and decided to quit while i was ahead i ve learned about business and finance on the job not in the classroom second i tried to read some of the key documents underlying mmt but couldn t finish the job because i found them both dense and nonsensical an interesting combination when mmt first emerged i did a little research and figured it was so silly that it would have a short shelf life that s why i didn t write about it but now that mmt seems to be gaining ground and is getting treated with respect let me offer up a few thoughts on just one aspect of how this theory won t work in the real world these thoughts by the way are based on how the financial world actually works not on how academic ideologues and other true believers would like the world to work advertisement magic money i m sorry modern monetary theory adherents claim that federal budget deficits don t matter why because our government borrows in our own currency the u s dollar so if the federal reserve can create trillions of dollars out of thin air why worry about deficits or the national debt just have the fed print enough dollars for the treasury to meet its obligations piece of cake share this article share therefore the theory goes our government can afford all sorts of expensive stuff rebuilding our infrastructure medicare for all whatever that is a green new deal ditto free college tuition and for all i know putting a chicken in every pot without raising taxes except maybe on the rich whoever they are or causing interest rates or inflation to rise as an example these folks cite japan which has run massive budget deficits without running up interest rates very much or generating much inflation the japanese central bank has printed gazillions of yen and everything is great except for the fact that the japanese economy has been sluggish for about 30 years but even if you disregard other examples of countries printing their own currency to fund deficits can you spell venezuela the united states isn t japan advertisement that s because among other things we derive huge benefits from the dollar being an internationally accepted and respected currency a major reason if not the major reason that the dollar has stayed relatively strong and our interest rates have stayed relatively low is that the dollar is a so called reserve currency that foreign central banks and other institutions are happy to hold because they trust our government foreigners own about 6 3 trillion of our 16 2 trillion of publicly held treasury debt people all over the world happily sell goods and service to u s consumers and businesses in return for dollars which in many cases they prefer to their own currency but if the fed whose mandate includes protecting our currency s value becomes craven enough to print money endlessly the dollar s value relative to other major world currencies will drop probably rather sharply advertisement foreign holders would dump their treasury securities creditors and suppliers from other countries would begin asking for payment in non dollar currencies that we d have to buy with ever shrinking in value dollars costs and prices in the united states would rise good luck with all that i despise the 2017 tax bill for many reasons but primarily because it imposes huge future financial burdens on my kids and grandkids and mortgages our country s future but if we get an mmt government the damage it will do to our country and our future will make the damage the trumpublicans have done look like a rounding error

argentine economy contracted 2 5 in 2018 after shrinking 6 2 in fourth quarter 22nd friday march 2019 09 00 utc full article the economy contracted 6 2 in the fourth quarter of the year in line with analyst forecasts the weakest quarterly performance since 2009 argentina s economy contracted 2 5 in 2018 the official statistics agency said on thursday as the latin american country s leaders struggle to revive growth after being rattled by a currency crisis and steep inflation over the past year the economy also contracted 6 2 in the fourth quarter of the year in line with analyst forecasts the weakest quarterly performance since 2009 that followed a 3 5 dip in the quarter before reviving growth will be key for president mauricio macri ahead of a re election battle in october but the centre right leader has little left in his arsenal to bolster the economy as he firefights stubborn inflation and fears over the peso argentina has pledged tighter monetary policy to rein in inflation and raised interest rates to a sky high 65 to help defend the local currency measures likely to dampen growth in the near term as firms struggle to raise cash tight monetary policy is an impediment to growth in the short term but benefits outweigh the costs said ilya gofshteyn new york based senior emerging markets strategist at standard chartered bank argentina is in dire straits on the growth front and it s not going to turn around overnight gofshteyn said adding growth dynamics should improve in the back half of the year macri s government has pledged for now to rein in spending and cut government debt levels as part of a us 56 3 billion financing deal agreed with the international monetary fund last year giving him less room for economic stimulus macri said last year the country had been battered by endless storms which pulled the country into recession drove steep inflation and saw the local peso currency lose around half its value against the dollar the country s unemployment rate however held steady at 9 1 in the fourth quarter compared with 9 in the previous period government data showed on thursday jobs have been protected by generous local labor laws
by gold money thedailycoin org march 22 2019 note this article is not and must not be construed as investment advice it is analysis based purely on economic theory and empirical evidence the global economic outlook is deteriorating government borrowing in the deficit countries will therefore escalate us treasury tic data confirms foreigners have already begun to liquidate dollar assets adding to the us government s future funding difficulties the next wave of monetary inflation required to fund budget deficits and keep banks solvent will not prevent financial assets suffering a severe bear market because the scale of monetary dilution will be so large that the purchasing power of the dollar and other currencies will be undermined failing fiat currencies suggest the dollar based financial order is coming to an end but with few exceptions investors own nothing but fiat currency dependent investments the only portfolio protection from these potential dangers is to embrace sound money gold the global economy is at a cross road with international trade stalling and undermining domestic economies some central banks notably the european central bank the bank of japan and the bank of england were still reflating their economies by supressing interest rates and the ecb had only stopped quantitative easing in december the fed and the peoples bank of china had been tightening in 2018 the pboc quickly went into stimulation mode in november and the fed has put monetary tightening and interest rates on hold pending further developments it is very likely this new downturn will be substantial the coincidence of the top of the credit cycle with trade protectionism last occurred in 1929 and the subsequent depression was devastating the reason we should be worried today is stalling trade disrupts the capital flows that fund budget deficits particularly in america where savers do not have the free capital to invest in government bonds worse still foreigners are now not only no longer investing in dollars and dollar denominated debt but they are suddenly withdrawing funds according to the most recent us treasury tic data in december and january these outflows totalled 257 2bn at this rate not only will the us treasury need to fund a deficit likely to exceed a trillion dollars in fiscal 2019 but the us markets will need to absorb substantial sales from foreigners as well in short america is going to face a funding crisis to have this funding problem coinciding with the ending of credit expansion at the top of the credit cycle is a lethal combination as yet unrecognised as the most important factor behind both american and global economic prospects the problem is bound to emerge in coming months while today s trade protectionism is less vicious than the smoot hawley tariff act america s drawn out trade threats today are similarly destabilising the top of the credit cycle in 1929 was orthodox its principal effect had been to fuel a speculative stock market frenzy in 1927 29 this time the credit bubble is proportionately far larger and its implosion threatens to be even more violent governments everywhere are up to their necks in debt as are consumers personal savings in america the uk and in some eu nations are practically non existent the potential for a credit economic and systemic crisis is therefore considerably greater today than it was ninety years ago bearing in mind the dow fell just under 90 from its 1929 peak the comparison with these empirical facts suggests we might experience no less than a virtual collapse in financial asset values however there is an important difference between then and now during the wall street crash the dollar was on a gold standard in other words the price effect of the depression was reflected in the rising purchasing power of gold this time no fiat currency is gold backed so a major credit economic and systemic crisis will be reflected in a falling purchasing power of fiat currencies the finances of any government whose unbacked currency is the national pricing medium are central to determining future general price levels just taking the us dollar for example the government s debt to gdp ratio is over 100 in 1929 it was less than 40 at the peak of the cycle the government should have a revenue surplus reflecting underlying full employment and the peak of tax revenues in 1929 the surplus was 0 7 of estimated gdp today it is a deficit of 5 5 of gdp in 1929 the government had minimal legislated welfare commitments the net present value of which was therefore trivial the deficits that arose in the 1930s were due to falling tax revenues and voluntary government schemes enacted by presidents hoover and roosevelt today the present value of future welfare commitments is staggering and estimates for the us alone range up to 220 trillion before adjusting for future currency debasement the rest here

silverdoctors com march 21 2019 there s a voting bloc of seriously large weight stroke that s in full disagreement with the notion that all is well michael explains by michael ballanger via streetwise reports after over 40 years in the world of money and markets i have arrived at the conclusion that aging can be a double edged sword where the advantages created by many years of experience are many times odiously offset by innate biases that become ingrained over time it came to me while listening to a fascinating interview with felix zulauf a former money manager and member of the legendary barron s roundtable during the session brilliantly hosted by realvision tv s grant williams felix made reference to a real and present danger looming on the horizons for global financial markets which is the growing influence of government in the future direction of markets all markets sexagenarians such as i were weaned in the very early years of free markets long before central banks took control of everything from foreign exchange to soybean prices we were educated to believe that the really big wins always occur when you feel like the loneliest person on the planet when taking on a new position if you recall the book and movie the big short you felt the pain of people like michael burry whose clients were ready to lynch him in the early days when goldman sachs refused to properly mark his month end bearish positions you were also cheering from the end blues when subprime imploded and burry has the last laugh and payday to deem it magical would be understatement i recall as if it were yesterday the year 2001 sitting in a kitchen with a group of young working mothers who had just found out that i was in the investment business and proceeded to pepper me with questions these were people i had never met before and after a few moments two of them asked me what i thought of nortel networks one of the last companies standing in the latter stages of the tech bubble of 1990 2001 i proceeded to tell them that if i owned it i would sell it before you have your morning coffee because it is going to zero not noticing that the cheers had turned to jeers and the smiles on those hopeful faces had been replaced with scowls of contempt i further added and if you don t own them i would find someone who does borrow them promise to give them back the shares in twelve months and then sell them before you have your morning coffee now most of these nice ladies had grown openly hostile so after a few derogatory remarks the room cleared out except for one bespectacled young mother who asked why so i told her my reasons as plainly as possible after thanking me for the insights she then proceeded to tell me that everyone at the party herself included worked for nortel and had their life savings and 100 of their retirement funds in nortel stock needless to say i was speechless and after being shunned for the entire room for the next hour i departed after apologizing to the host for accidentally attempting to earlier swallow both of my feet well fast forward to a year later and nortel had dropped from 125 per share to under 1 00 before going to zero and being delisted from the tsx and nyse exchanges and as i am walking through the upper canada mall i hear my name being called and lo and behold it is the bespectacled lady from that nortel party she proceeded to thank me about a dozen times because the first thing she did that following monday after our kitchen discussion was to phone her broker and liquidate every nortel share she could find in all of her accounts she even called her mother and father and told them to do the same as well as all of her co workers how did that go over i asked to which she responded not very well they unfortunately held on and three of them have not only lost their jobs but also their homes in the days around 2001 companies with negative cash flow eventually got trashed and if the accounting practices were fraudulent as were nortel s the executives usually not always went to jail however in 2001 with nortel cruising at 125 literally everyone owned it and even the mailroom clerks could recite five reasons why it was going to 500 the moral to the story is this in the era before social media and germ colony progressive cheerleading one could take a contrarian view on a specific company or a specific market and expect to be proven either right or wrong based on veracity of one s investment thesis there was no such beast as a software driven algorithm juicing a specific stock or market in the face of declining performance or economic conditions you were rewarded within a reasonable period of time because you were operating in a free market environment take the example of tesla tsla us a company whose fundamentals according to most of the analysts i have listened to are eroding rapidly amidst growing electric car competition from the big auto makers in both the u s and europe despite the overwhelmingly bearish data i am terrified of shorting tsla because of one major risk social media one tweet from ceo elon musk has been known to advance the stock price 20 in a day despite numerous warnings and sanctions from regulators and yet the poor slob that is short the stock is in need of new knickers and is on specialty blood pressure pills similarly if you have been a holder of precious metals or the companies that explore for or produce them you have been watching for the better part of 30 years a system of government and regulatory collusion in suppressing the prices in an ongoing effort to fortify the u s currency regime one last example of the disappearance of the free market is that very u s dollar and its role as the global reserve currency total government debt for the u s exceeds 22 trillion which is 13 trillion greater than the second most indebted country the u k at 8 trillion in a free market system investors would question the soundness of any country so heavily in debt and unanimously reject its currency however the world appears to be collectively short dollars and are scrambling to own more dollars into every dip and for all of the apparently wrong reasons the reason for this lies in one word debt at the end of the day the american spin machine has convinced the world that it will never default on its debts because after all america is the heart and soul of free market capitalism and the driver of wealth creation the world over however like nortel 17 years ago and tesla 17 minutes ago once you have lifted the hood and start doing compression tests on the cylinders you rapidly realize that the american engine of growth the middle class is in deep trouble and in need of new rings and valves notwithstanding the fact that america is a wonderful country with some of the warmest nicest people on the planet its leaders have been forced to maintain and prolong a massive multi generational ponzi scheme designed to finance the nato war machine spearheaded by the u s military as i have typed for years upon years the only way that changes is when the uss nimitz pulls into gibraltar for a refitting and they refuse the credit card in other words the achilles heel of the u s is the dollar the exact weakness being targeted by those that would seek to eliminate the petrodollar and the swift payments systems make no

donald trump said he s nominating stephen moore a visiting fellow at the heritage foundation and a longtime supporter of the president for a seat on the federal reserve board trump made the announcement friday to reporters traveling with him to palm beach florida confirming an earlier bloomberg news report the president later said in a tweet that moore is a very respected economist and said he has no doubt he will be an outstanding choice moore has emerged as an ardent critic of the federal reserve board under its current chairman jerome powell who fell out of favor with trump last year after the fed s rate increases placing him on the board may be the president s attempt to check powell and head off further tightening of u s monetary policy that trump believes could slow economic growth before his 2020 re election campaign moore blamed the fed for slowing the economy while championing trump s policies in a march 13 journal column that he co authored trump s chief economic adviser larry kudlow showed the op ed to trump over lunch last week according to two people familiar with the matter trump remarked to kudlow that he should have appointed moore to be fed chairman the people said and directed kudlow to call moore and gauge his interest in a board seat this week trump called moore himself and asked if he d accept a nomination to the board in the op ed moore also suggested the fed stabilize the value of the dollar by adopting a commodity price rule he has harshly criticized powell and the current fed board in other recent public remarks i believe the people on the federal reserve board should be thrown out for economic malpractice moore said dec 22 on red apple group chairman and chief executive john catsimatidis s radio show blaming an end of the year stock market swoon on the fed s rate hikes janet yellen couldn t have been any worse than the guy he s got in there now moore said of powell and his predecessor i always thought he was a bad choice he s been a fed guy for many years donald trump wanted to drain the swamp the fed is the swamp moore who couldn t be reached for comment after the president s announcement was a fierce critic of trump s predecessor barack obama moore predicted rising budget deficits under obama would lead to higher interest rates and inflation but that didn t come true under trump the budget deficit is approaching 1 trillion a year moore is a former trump campaign adviser who helped write its economic agenda and a close friend of kudlow he was a senior economist on the congressional joint economic committee served on the editorial board of the wall street journal and was an economic analyst for cnn also under consideration for the board is herman cain the former pizza company executive who ran for the 2012 republican presidential nomination according to the people who asked not to be identified discussing trump s private deliberations moore advised cain on his so called 9 9 9 tax plan in 2011 which would have replaced much of the u s tax code with a flat 9 percent tax on sales transactions as well as corporate and individual income there are two vacant seats on the fed board bloomberg news previously reported that cain 73 was under consideration yet his nomination would raise the prospect of a senate confirmation hearing focused on the sexual harassment accusations that ended his presidential campaign while he remains in the running there are concerns in the white house about whether he could clear the confirmation process according to a person familiar with the matter cain last september co founded a pro trump super political action committee america fighting back pac which features a photo of the president on its website and says we must protect donald trump and his agenda from impeachment he has had a long corporate career and from 1992 to 1996 he served as a director of the federal reserve bank of kansas city as well as deputy chairman and later chairman he advocated for the u s to return to the gold standard during his presidential campaign and as recently as december 2017 defended higher interest rates a position that contrasts with trump s repeated criticisms of the fed last year
airbus is considering whether or not to shift the assembly process of its latest generation of a330 planes to china as part of a bid to increase its market share in the world s fastest growing civil aviation market the european multinational is following a trend started by boeing which recently opened a new completion plant in china on the face of it the decision by the two companies which dominate the civilian aviation market makes sense build where your biggest customer lives especially as china does not yet have a fully homegrown civil aviation industry ready to compete globally the benefits are many including the goodwill and esteem of the country that would be buying these planes in the long term however that might prove to be a costly miscalculation based on its recent history here and here it won t take long for china to catch up and largely displace both companies domestically in beijing s home aviation market as well as seizing a large chunk of the corporate duopoly s global market share airbus and boeing could therefore be making short term decisions with negative long term consequences for their future profitability given china s formidable economic advancement none of this should come as a surprise to either airbus or boeing nor should it shock western governments the problem is that everybody has historically been guided by the na√Øve assumption that simply admitting china to organizations such as the world trade organization wto would induce beijing to in the words of philip pan eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring china into the fold of democratic nations or the chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot china has unquestionably modernized but its politically illiberal dirigiste polity has if anything massively moved in the opposite direction strengthened by that very modernization process that has done anything but falter furthermore the country has many aims and goals that are antithetical to the long term prosperity of western companies and economies as the european union is beginning to recognize boeing and airbus might simply become the latest western sacrificial lambs beijing has explicitly targeted wide bodied aircrafts as one of its 10 new priority sectors for import substitution in its made in china 2025 document so whatever short term gains airbus and boeing receive in terms of securing additional orders from china could well be undermined longer term the resultant technology transfers and lower labor costs will almost certainly give beijing a quantum leap toward competing directly and ultimately displacing both companies given the merger with mcdonnell douglas boeing will continue its march toward effectively becoming a branch of the u s department of defense as its civilian market share crashes but airbus doesn t really have the luxury of a military alternative given the relative paucity of european defense expenditures as if boeing needed any further problems the 737 fiasco represents the latest in a series of setbacks for the company boeing s 737 global recall coming on the heels of the initial launch problems of the 787 dreamliner some six years ago where the demoduralization of production meant that boeing could not fully account for stress transmission and loading at the system level as gary pisano and willy shih write together illustrate the dangers of spreading manufacturing too far across the globe engineers notes cuny fellow jon rynn need to kick the tires of the new production processes they design so while a market may be global production and the growth of production take place most efficiently in relatively close geographic quarters american companies such as boeing consistently underestimate the value of closely integrating r d and manufacturing while underplaying the risks of separating them as recent events have demonstrated again to the company s cost by deciding to expand its a330 production in china airbus looks poised to repeat boeing s error a potential miscalculation that most european union companies have hitherto largely avoided because the eu has prioritized domestic manufacturing discouraged offshoring more than its u s counterparts in regard to the loss of u s manufacturing jobs attributable to china the american economic review paper by justin r pierce and peter k schott specifically notes that there was no similar reaction in the european union where policy did not change beijing itself has historically balanced its purchases from both major civil aviation manufacturers to ensure that it does not rely too heavily on one aircraft supplier which means that airbus will likely benefit from the void created by the 737 recall all the more reason why the european conglomerate should be wary of following the pied piper like expansion into china the 737 recall also complicates resolution of the u s china trade conflict which had appeared closer to resolution in light of beijing s proposal to buy an additional 1 2tn in u s exports over six years boeing aircraft purchases featured heavily on beijing s shopping list but the longer term challenges relate to china s economic development path and its corresponding move up the high tech curve which have largely been characterized by mercantilist policies of protection and heavy government subsidy in this regard the chinese state has followed a national development strategy first outlined in the mid 19th century by the german economist friedrich list who argued that the national government should play a crucial role in promoting guiding and regulating the process of national economic advancement protectionism list argued should play a role here as well during the country s catch up phase of technological development list wrote the analysis against a historic backdrop where germany was beginning to challenge the dominant economic power of its time the united kingdom so the defenders of beijing might well point to his work to show that there is nothing new about using the state as a principal instrument to accelerate economic development and innovation however list was analyzing two capitalist economies operating within the context of a 19th century gold standard global financial system which invariably circumscribed the scope of state involvement the finite availability of gold reserves limiting fiscal policy options by contrast today the global economy operates under a fiat currency system and what therefore distinguishes china s economic domestic development from its 19th century predecessors is the sheer scale of fiscal resources it can deploy in the furtherance of its economic and military objectives some of these objectives might not be so benign to the west longer term which points to another consideration for the west for all of its supposed embrace of capitalism china is still primarily a state dominated economy which eschews the disciplines of a free market economy this means it has the capacity and ideological predisposition to use the national fiscal policy as a loss leader absorbing losses well beyond what would be tolerated in an economy dominated by private enterprise private companies of course can go bust beijing underwrites its designated national champions by relying on a combination of subsidies some disguised as they flow through state backed investment funds and the financial sectors and buy china preferences to develop chinese products even though these policies are contrary to the rules of wto membership which china eagerly joined in 2001 as the economist brad setser argues various parts of the chinese state compete absorb losses and then consolidat around the successful firms other countries worry about the losses notes setser but not the chinese government which simply socializes the losses at the national level and writes them off in this regard boeing and airbus would do well to consider china s experience in the solar industry designating this as another strategic sector for growth in the 1990s chinese solar companies with the explicit backstop of the state ultimately raised enough funding via debt to build sufficient solar capacity for the world three times over the overinvestment ultimately killed the cash flows of major western competitors and knocked them out of the business leaving the market free for china to dominate commenting on the trend scientific american highlighted that between 2008 and 2013 china s fledgling solar electric panel industry dropped world prices by 80 percent a stunning achievement in a fiercely competitive high tech market china had leapfrogged from nursing a tiny rural oriented solar program in the 1990s to become the globe s leader in what may soon be the world s largest renewable energy source here was a classic case of state guided supported commercial companies receiving benefits that went far beyond anything in say korea or taiwan or even japan in the earlier part of their development now this trend is manifesting itself across the entire spectrum of the chinese guided economy including agricultural equipment industrial machinery telecommunications ai computer chips and civil aviation in another disturbing parallel that boeing and airbus would do well to consider he timeline of china s rise began in the late 1990s when germany overwhelmed by the domestic response to a government incentive program to promote rooftop solar panels provided the capital technology and experts to lure china into making solar panels to meet the german demand according to scientific american much like the german solar companies which shipped valuable manufacturing and technological expertise to china to sustain demand boeing and airbus could well be signing their economic death warrants by agreeing to offshore increasing amounts of production in china to sustain their global market shares aided and abetted by their more market oriented governments which frown on the idea of national industrial policy the same thing is happening in wind power in china which is expected to see offshore wind capacity grow from 2 gigawatts last year to 31 gigawatts in the next decade china s expansion here has already forced siemens and gamesa to merge to cope with the rising competitive challenge as far as aviation itself goes setser makes the point that china may cut into the united states future exports by building its own competitor to the 737 and also cut into europe s future exports if airbus decides to build the a330 in china and china buys made in china rolls royce engines for the c929 and the a330 even if this allows the duopoly to maintain its dominance in global civil aviation it is hard to see how shifting manufacturing production of aircraft components to china to get orders constitutes a win for the u s or european workers who are already being displaced and boeing s weak kneed response to the 737 crisis will likely exacerbate the company s problems going forward the bottom line is that both western governments and western corporations have persistently underestimated the power of china s economic development model and the corresponding economic threat that it poses to the west s own affluence the usual criticism leveled against the chinese growth model is that a country that subsidizes its industries ends up with inefficient industries because heavily protected local firms are shielded from global competition ultimately leaving the country that resorts to protectionism with inferior products the idea of national champions built up via state dirigisme according to classic liberal economic doctrine ultimately ensures that economic efficiency and commercial considerations get squeezed out rent seeking and corruption become institutionalized goes the argument so these national champions ultimately will not be able to compete in the global marketplace that was certainly the assumption of milton friedman who called the chinese communist party s state driven strategy an open invitation to corruption and inefficiency by contrast according to defense and the national interest the governing assumptions of capitalist economies is that he discipline of the marketplace not the state is better suited to choose winners and knock out losers who cannot offer the prices or quality or features of their competitors china represents the ultimate repudiation of these seemingly ironclad economic laws the country s success has come across a slew of industries clean tech notably wind and solar power internet companies despite overwhelming censorship china has corporate behemoths such as alibaba or baidu which rival google in scale and scope and more recently in the telecommunications sector where huawei has clearly benefited from buy china preferences created by the state via its state owned telecommunications enterprises and now is considered to be the global leader in 5g telephony in practice therefore there is no reason why the same model cannot work with regard to civil aviation even as airbus and boeing eagerly provide the rope with which they may hang their respective companies in the future marshall

as alarm bells sound over the advancing destruction of the environment a variety of green new deal proposals have appeared in the u s and europe along with some interesting academic debates about how to fund them monetary policy normally relegated to obscure academic tomes and bureaucratic meetings behind closed doors has suddenly taken center stage the 14 page proposal for a green new deal submitted to the u s house of representatives by congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez does not actually mention modern monetary theory but that is th it s e approach currently capturing the attention of the media and taking most of the heat the concept is good abundance can be ours without worrying about taxes or debt at least until we hit full productive capacity but the devil is in the details mmt advocates say the government does not need to collect taxes before it spends it actually creates new money in the process of spending it and there is plenty of room in the economy for public spending before demand outstrips supply driving up prices critics however say this is not true the government is not allowed to spend before it has the money in its account and the money must come from tax revenues or bond sales in a 2013 treatise called modern monetary theory 101 a reply to critics mmt academics actually concede this point but they write that these constraints do not change the end result and here the argument gets a bit technical their reasoning is that the fed is the monopoly supplier of cb currency treasury spends by using cb currency and since the treasury obtained cb currency by taxing and issuing treasuries cb currency must be injected before taxes and bond offerings can occur the counterargument made by american monetary institute researchers among others is that the central bank is not the monopoly supplier of dollars the vast majority of the dollars circulating in the united states are created not by the government but by private banks when they make loans the fed accommodates this process by supplying central bank currency bank reserves as needed and this bank created money can be taxed or borrowed by the treasury before a single dollar is spent by congress the ami researchers contend all bank reserves are originally created by the fed for banks government expenditure merely transfers previous bank reserves back to banks as the federal reserve bank of st louis puts it federal deficits do not require that the federal reserve purchase more government securities therefore federal deficits per se need not lead to increases in bank reserves or the money supply what federal deficits do increase is the federal debt and while the debt itself can be rolled over from year to year as it virtually always is the exponentially growing interest tab is one of those mandatory budget items that taxpayers must pay predictions are that in the next decade interest alone could add 1 trillion to the annual bill an unsustainable tax burden to fund a project as massive as the green new deal we need a mechanism that involves neither raising taxes nor adding to the federal debt and such a mechanism is actually proposed in the u s green new deal a network of public banks while little discussed in the u s media that alternative is being debated in europe where green new deal proposals have been on the table since 2008 european economists have had more time to think these initiatives through and they are less hampered by labels like socialist and capitalist which have long been integrated into their multiparty systems a decade of gestation in europe the first green new deal proposal was published in 2008 by the new economics foundation on behalf of the green new deal group in the u k the latest debate is between proponents of the democracy in europe movement 2025 diem25 led by former greek finance minister yanis varoufakis and french economist thomas piketty author of the best selling capital in the 21st century piketty recommends funding a european green new deal by raising taxes while varoufakis favors a system of public green banks varoufakis explains that europe needs a new source of investment money that does not involve higher taxes or government deficits diem25 proposes for this purpose an investment led recovery or new deal program to be financed via public bonds issued by europe s public investment banks e g the new investment vehicle foreshadowed in countries like britain the european investment bank and the european investment fund in the european union etc to ensure that these bonds do not lose their value the central banks would stand ready to buy them above a certain yield in summary diem25 is proposing a re calibrated real green investment version of quantitative easing that utilises the central bank public development banks already have a successful track record in europe and their debts are not considered debts of the government they are financed not through taxes but by the borrowers when they repay the loans like other banks development banks are moneymaking institutions that not only don t cost the government money but actually generate a profit for it diem25 collaborator stuart holland observes while piketty is concerned to highlight differences between his proposals and those for a green new deal the real difference between them is that his however well intentioned are a wish list for a new treaty a new institution and taxation of wealth and income a green new deal needs neither treaty revisions nor new institutions and would generate both income and direct and indirect taxation from a recovery of employment it is grounded in the precedent of the success of the bond funded roosevelt new deal which from 1933 to 1941 reduced unemployment from over a fifth to less than a tenth with an average annual fiscal deficit of only 3 per cent roosevelt s new deal was largely funded through the reconstruction finance corporation rfc a public financial institution set up earlier by president hoover its funding source was the sale of bonds but proceeds from the loans repaid the bonds leaving the rfc with a net profit the rfc financed roads bridges dams post offices universities electrical power mortgages farms and much more and it funded all this while generating income for the government a system of public banks and green qe the us green new deal envisions funding with a combination of the federal reserve a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks which could include banks owned locally by cities and states as sylvia chi chair of the legislative committee of the california public banking alliance explains on medium com the green new deal relies on a network of public banks like a decentralized version of the rfc as part of the plan to help finance the contemplated public investments this approach has worked in germany where public banks have been integral in financing renewable energy installations and energy efficiency retrofits local or regional public banks says chi could help pay for the green new deal by making low interest loans for building and upgrading infrastructure deploying clean energy resources transforming our food and transportation systems to be more sustainable and accessible and other projects the federal government can help by for example capitalizing public banks setting environmental or social responsibility standards for loan programs or tying tax incentives to participating in public bank loans u k professor richard murphy adds another role for the central bank as the issuer of new money in the form of green infrastructure quantitative easing murphy who was a member of the original 2008 u k green new deal group explains all qe works by the buying debt issued by the government or other bodies using money that it quite literally creates out of thin air his money creation process is what happens every time a bank makes a loan all that is unusual is that we are suggesting that the funds created by the using this process be used to buy back debt that is due by the government in one of its many forms meaning that it is effectively canceled the invariable objection to that solution is that it would act as an inflationary force driving up prices but as argued in my earlier article here this need not be the case there is a chronic gap between debt and the money available to repay it that actually needs to be filled with new money every year to avoid a balance sheet recession as u k prof mary mellor formulates the problem in debt or democracy 2016 page 42 a major contradiction of tying money supply to debt is that the creators of the money always want more money back than they have issued debt based money must be continually repaid with interest as money is continually being repaid new debt must be being generated if the money supply is to be maintained this builds a growth dynamic into the money supply that would frustrate the aims of those who seek to achieve a more socially and ecologically sustainable economy in addition to interest says mellor there is the problem that bankers and other rich people generally do not return their profits to local economies unlike public banks which must use their profits for local needs the wealthy hoard their money invest it in the speculative markets hide it in offshore tax havens or send it abroad to avoid the cyclical booms and busts that have routinely devastated the u s economy this missing money needs to be replaced and if the new money is used to pay down debt it will be extinguished along with the debt leaving the overall money supply and the inflation rate unchanged if too much money is added to the economy it can always be taxed back but as mmters note we are a long way from the full productive capacity that would overheat the economy today murphy writes of his green qe proposal the qe program that was put in place between 2009 and 2012 had just one central purpose which was to refinance the city of london and its banks what we are suggesting is a smaller program to kickstart the u k economy by investing in all those things that we would wish our children to inherit whilst creating the opportunities for everyone in every city town village and hamlet in the u k to undertake meaningful and appropriately paid work a network of public banks including a central bank operated as a public utility could similarly fund a u s green new deal without raising taxes driving up the federal debt or inflating prices

president hage geingob this week sat down with new era managing editor toivo ndjebela at state house for an interview that touched on his four year presidential journey so far the country s public debt situation and leading the ruling party swapo new era ne mr president you are four years into your presidency how has the journey been so far broadly speaking hage geingob hg thank you very much we are celebrating our 29 years of nationhood twenty nine years after we said we re now independent people our founding father on that day on 21st march 1990 said namibia is now free forever it means we were free to set up our own government and are responsible for our own successes and failures my four years as president is a continuation of a legacy i m not starting from afresh we have always said the legacy must continue so i took over from where my predecessors left you first create and maintain a good governance architecture that is to say we must be transparent and accountable with trust to the people as elected officials we have to be people centered meaning we must address their needs the socio economic architecture has been the most challenging one inequality is still growing poverty is still there but there are also things we have achieved to continue the legacy we re building infrastructure and things like schools our education faces enormous challenges having declared free education schools are now too full so our successes have also become our problems the four years have not been easy when we took over we inherited or we came with massive deficits about n 3 billion so we started off with cash flow problems but we took drastic actions that are helping us to get out of the woods now we also addressed issues of corruption quietly firstly we cancelled the airport project that spiraled from n 3 billion to n 7 billion i said how could the big gap be justified the chinese took us to the court and we lost the first round we fought on and won the second round in the supreme court we also investigated the issue of the oil storage facility which was quoted in us dollars instead of namibian dollars we paid nearly half a billion just in currency fluctuations we came up with the harambee prosperity plan which is an idea and vision of a leader not to replace all existing national development plans but to accelerate them john steytler who has recently resigned has been instrumental in this regard i can confirm that steytler and i definitely did not fall out and i am happy he confirmed that himself unfortunately the world economy went down and it affected us so badly that we couldn t implement the harambee plan to the letter overall we tried our best ne you often refer to the cancellation of airport tender as one of the highlights of your fight against corruption why has no one been held accountable so far in that matter seeing how high accountability ranks on your to do list hg let me take you to waves of leadership the first wave was of leaders was those extraordinary personalities the founding fathers that were like gods then we have the second wave that emerged after the conclusion of the cold war characterised by military coups and so forth then we have a third wave where you talk about processes systems and institutions not individuals the process must be there to deal with those who are doing wrong things then you have institutions like courts acc and so on you cannot say nothing was done if a minister has been removed that s drastic action people think that firing someone is the only way to act look at the swarbooi case for example he said what he said but we were tolerant and we followed a process i called him in and said comrade you re misunderstanding the issue we re not questioning the merits of your argument but the manner you re doing so i asked him if you re so unhappy why don t you go then he stood up and left he even forgot his phone behind we were giving him a second chance you don t just fire then take the situation of comrade jerry and comrade pendukeni they were told they had a right to campaign for positions in swapo there were some attacks of government programs not from comrade jerry so i said to them when you say government is like this and than while you re a member of cabinet how are we going to reconcile all this how are we gonna go ahead now after what you have said about government they were given a chance the principle in government is that we may disagree on principles but once the majority have taken a decision you have to be part of it they just said they had a right to campaign up to now comrade pendukeni is in parliament on my we don t just fire people for the sake of firing but in the end firing will come if you were given a chance to amend or resign ne did you anticipate things to be this tough prior to your takeover hg my brother you re forgetting that i was part and parcel of the first government i was a prime minister tasked to set up the government and i nearly died as president i came in after having worked with senior people that groomed me i was part and parcel of the whole process so this was nothing new this one is tough but i know how to handle it i have colleagues that are helping me it s a collective approach very very tough but we can handle it ne in your fight against corruption we also learned that you had approached the anti corruption commission acc to investigate some of your ministers please enlighten us on that hg yes when we get reports of complaints i like to consult i called the ministers and i said this is what is being said about you some of them got very annoyed and then i followed up with letters one of the issues contained in the ministers performance agreements is good governance and ethical behavior so when something is wrong we ask them i am not targeting them i didn t charge them but i asked them this is what is being said about you what do you have to say they all replied defending themselves but since i am not a judge i handed this information to the acc to investigate further what i did in the meantime is removing them from the ministries they were at and some of them were very angry it s nothing personal but we re in this government to deliver goods if you re accused you must clear your name it doesn t break friendship ne one of your early focus points was around governance what are some of the successes scored on this front so far hg we have done things like changing the names of permanent secretaries as part of improving governance for too long they felt they were untouchable some of them were even telling ministers that ministers come and go but we re here permanently the idea was to change the mindset there s also greater attention to timekeeping cabinet ministers know that if we re starting at 09h00 they have to be there by exactly that time we also consult a lot collective responsibility the world over politicians do not enjoy much trust to get more trusted you have to be transparent that s why i coined the slogan that accountability plus transparency equals trust we try to be accountable and transparent unfortunately with the current economic headwinds perpetuated by the current droughts some of our plans cannot be fully achieved we took cuts and contained wastage international trips have been cut too it was necessary to take these steps ne speaking of headwinds what is government s plan to get the economy out of the current doldrums cutting costs in one thing but what is being done to help the economy grow again hg we have harambee propserity plan and we have been assessing where it failed and where it succeeded for now youth unemployment has been identified as the key and youth are the future of this country at cabinet this week we have directed that the new budget must reserve a stimulus budget targeting youth employment projects we re also talking to business people currently we are trying to call a work economic summit i am going to announce very soon a restructured president s economic advisory council i ve reduced it to senior economists and so on we re going to work with them to work out the stimulus package aimed mainly at agriculture ne how badly are implementations of activities under the harambee prosperity plan and other national development plans affected by the persisting economic slowdown hg i was so hurt when this beautiful plan started getting hit by the economic situation but even the millennium development goals did not meet their deadlines and they had to be reviewed in the harambee plan we re going to look at areas where maybe we were overambitious and make them a bit more realistic as per the current economic conditions ne and how has the economic conditions affect the implementation of duties given to you by swapo in its 2014 election manifesto hg it was very difficult first you don t have money and second investors are not coming those that were coming here to get contracts from us that s not investment real investments are like the husab mine it affected us and it was a setback but we learned from it we cannot be overambitious we have to be practical from that we will adjust and move on ne is there anything that can be done internally to arrest the economic downfall hg the biggest elephant in the room is the government wage bill something has to be done it s not affordable it takes up close to 60 percent of the national budget it s the one area government must tackle also cabinet is too big when you are a new man coming in a younger one a peer group it s always difficult president nujoma had authority of a founding father and liberation hero he enjoyed respect and authority when president pohamba came in you could see the difference it s going more and more relaxed with me i took over at a time when anyone from my peer group could have taken over and therefore pressure was more on me what we did was to create a bit of balance in how you create cabinet to accommodate if you have excluded people it could ve been worse but this is no more affordable one way to cut down on the wage bill is to look at cabinet ne at 43 3 percent of gdp our public debt is above both our national threshold of 35 percent and the world bank s cap for middle income countries what is being done to contain this situation hg that is the problem when you re managing your debts properly people don t realise it firstly our debt stock is about 43 percent while the sadc average is 60 percent so namibia s debt stock is still manageable but we re not used to it america is 100 and something percent of gdp in debt but they can pay what is the composition of our debt basically about 62 percent of our debts is local which is a good thing about 20 percent or so is in bonds only two percent is chinese debt but people think everything is chinese debt we haven t taken any debt from china since i came to office what president nujoma and i did when we came in was to ensure we don t have any debts with imf international monetary fund and the world bank we deliberately avoided them so that we re not told structural adjustments and so forth our debts are manageable we re not playing around we took deep cuts so that we manage this economy ne does government has a repayment plan and can you assure younger people that you re not trapping them into debt by the time they take over hg we re always aware of the future generations and that s why we manage the economy the way we do our debt stock is predominantly local and thus manageable on foreign debts we re looking at favourable terms so that we have a breathing space ne kindly digest for us your declaration of accountability this year in practical terms what are you asking the nation to do hg firstly i want people to appreciate the dreams of a leader during the liberation struggle days president nujoma told us every end of the year at swapo central meetings in the bush that comrades next year we re going to be on the outskirts of windhoek he has been saying that for at least ten years a leader does that a leader has to inspire so you come with concepts this is election year and as leaders we must account to the people at a supreme level those in government must account to me so that i account to the people ministers must account let s look back and say what did we do wrong and what could we have done differently during campaigns people would be asking us to account and we must be ready to answer them i saw some local scholars saying there s nothing for which we must celebrate independence day this year all countries have problems but we certainly have reason to celebrate the freedom we have is not appreciated yes we have poor people but there are also success stories in the past the towns of omuthiya outapi eenhana and others did not exist but now they do people travelling from gobabis to the northern parts of the country no longer have to go through windhoek they can drive straight to grootfontein because of the new road connecting the two towns outsiders appreciate our country but our own people do not we definitely have reason to celebrate independence ne how prepared is swapo for the upcoming national elections this year hg the party is composed of individuals some are using social media to paint a picture that the party is divided but that s not the first time we re hearing this people think swapo has changed yes the swapo that i joined in 1962 in tsumeb and the one i went aboard with and help build is not the same one today it s a movement change is the only constant thing in the world we are entering the fourth industrial revolution so even swapo has to think of how to adjust to these changes swapo has always had fights but we have congress not too long ago we ve had congress one of the toughest i ve attended all my life it looked like a campaign for national elections stakes were high but once you re not elected you have to accept that yours truly got 75 percent and that s a mandate people don t realise how democratic this party is it s tolerant and accepts its mistakes too just recently we dealt with the issues of the rundu and okahandja councillors we called them and we resolved the matters and moved on that s swapo swapo will live on we had the shipanga crisis the muyongo crisis the ben ulenga crisis but here we are ne we now hear talks by some swapo members about possibilities of having independent presidential candidates possibly to challenge you this year what s your take hg don t forget i m a political scientist how do you field an independent candidate within swapo the party constitution is very clear that the candidate has to be the president of swapo to be an independent candidate you have to leave swapo even then you have to look at the namibian constitution it s not that simple people have freedom to say things stupid or clever
strong statements by pope francis in recent years have brought renewed attention to the church s teaching regarding the moral limits of markets yet recent essays in america by arthur brooks confessions of a catholic convert to capitalism 2 6 2017 and stephanie slade a libertarian case for the common good 8 6 2018 have argued for the church to more fully embrace potential contributions of market economies to the common good this debate is necessary however both of these essays misunderstand the church s teaching regarding the relationship between markets and the common good to be fruitful this debate must attend to three things the specific definition of the common good in catholic social doctrine the particulars of the church s understanding of markets and the particular historical construction of the market in which we are currently living francis teaching is in continuity with a long tradition of papal social doctrine that has wrestled with the power of markets for good and ill for more than a century as markets continue to evolve so must our moral reflection on them the teaching of pope francis on economics is in continuity with a long tradition of papal social doctrine that has wrestled with the power of markets for good and ill for more than a century the common good the common is good a fundamental principle of catholic social thought the term is as widely supported as it is misunderstood it is frequently equated with the average degree of economic flourishing among the individual members of society and thus reduced to the assumption that economic growth is a sufficient measure of social well being the compendium of the social doctrine of the church the official vatican summary of papal social teaching distinguishes the common good from the simple sum of the particular goods of each member of society the compendium notes that this good is common because it is indivisible and because only together is it possible to attain it 164 it is the specifically social and community dimension of the moral good in david hollenbach s words the common good fulfills needs that individuals cannot fulfill on their own and realizes values that can only be attained in our life together it designates a certain kind of agency working together for the good of the whole the catholic understanding of the common good is indebted to aristotle who thomas smith observes contrasted it with the competitive pursuit of goods such as wealth security and honor the common good concerns the flourishing of the entire community and it is something that increases rather than diminishes when shared this notion of a shared good of the entire community resonates with belief in god as a triune communion of persons the pastoral constitution on the church in the modern world gaudium et spes from the second vatican council roots the common good in jesus prayer to the father in john 17 that all may be one as as we are one the council noted a likeness between the union of divine persons and the unity of humankind this brings theological depth and specificity to the common good the political common good is of interest to the church because it is an incomplete but real fulfillment of the eschatological unity to which we are all called the comparison with the unity of jesus and the father calls attention not simply to outcomes but also to the character of relationships gaudium et spes states that humans cannot fully find themselves except through the sincere gift of themselves 24 finally gaudium et spes challenges limited notions of the common good expanding it beyond the local community or nation making clear that we have rights and duties regarding the whole human race in its treatment of the role of the church in the contemporary world gaudium et spes considers and distinguishes economic and political aspects of society which it discusses in separate chapters as the theologian david cloutier notes each has its own associated good the treatment of economics focuses on the universal destination of goods and the discussion of the political order centers on the common good here we find the oft excerpted definition the common good embraces the sum of those conditions of social life whereby men and women families and associations may more adequately and readily attain their own perfection 74 lifted from its context there is always the danger of reading conditions here as if they are purely external situations in which we pursue individual flourishing but the context in the document makes clear that the common good is the collective work of the community individuals families and groups are aware that they cannot achieve a truly human life by their own unaided efforts they see the need for a wider community within which each one makes his or her specific contribution every day toward an ever broader realization of the common good 74 awareness of this need drives the establishment of various forms of government or political community that exist for the sake of the common good this expresses the ancient catholic judgement that government is not a response to human sinfulness but an essential consequence of our social nature created by god thus catholicism views the common good as a particular kind of good that concerns the whole of society it corresponds with a particular form of agency collective and political action the common good is distinct from the economy but related to it as both address different aspects of social life the political common good is of interest to the church because it is an incomplete but real fulfillment of the eschatological unity to which we are all called catholic social thought and the market catholic social teaching has been concerned with the market since its inception indeed the rise of liberal economics was one of the new things to which pope leo xiii addressed his encyclical rerum novarum in 1891 this teaching has been refined in relationship to the changing face of capitalism over the years a relatively stable core teaching on the relationship between markets and the common good is evident from pius xi in 1931 through pope francis today st john paul ii s centesimus annus provides a concise summary of this core teaching in the wake of the collapse of soviet communism the pope explicitly addressed the question of whether capitalism should now be considered the goal for developing nations he offered a classic catholic sic et non on the positive side if by capitalism is meant an economic system which recognizes the fundamental and positive role of business the market private property and the resulting responsibility for the means of production as well as free human creativity in the economic sector then the answer is certainly in the affirmative john paul immediately balanced this affirmation but if by capitalism is meant a system in which freedom in the economic sector is not circumscribed within a strong juridical framework which places it at the service of human freedom in its totality and which sees it as a particular aspect of that freedom the core of which is ethical and religious then the reply is certainly negative 42 john paul reflected on what markets can and cannot do it would appear that the free market is the most efficient instrument for utilizing resources and effectively responding to needs but this is true only for those needs which are solvent insofar as they are endowed with purchasing power and for those resources which are marketable insofar as they are capable of obtaining a satisfactory price 34 while john paul thought it best that people receive the training they needed to participate fully in economic life he nevertheless held that it is a strict duty of justice and truth not to allow fundamental human needs to remain unsatisfied when they can find no no place on the market daniel k finn notes that with his discussion of the problem of a satisfactory price john paul is addressing the market failure of external costs when the full environmental and social costs of production are not represented in the price seemingly rational market activity leads to exploitation and environmental destruction john paul continued warning of a radical capitalistic ideology which blindly entrusts the solution of to the free development of market forces 42 the catholic church accepts the good that markets can bring in strict economic terms production and distribution and in the specific sorts of freedom they can facilitate but papal social teaching has consistently stressed that markets are limited and imperfect tools with potentially destructive aspects inequality and exclusion environmental degradation erosion of community for this reason they are but one aspect of broader social flourishing one that must be yoked to the common good through other modalities of human freedom namely politics thus contrary to the argument of arthur brooks capitalism is not fundamentally content neutral or amoral the market is a powerful set of practices that can bring many benefits when oriented to the common good and profound disruption and suffering when it overruns its proper limits it is precisely this tension that modern catholic social teaching has responded to over the past century and a half the catholic church accepts the good that markets can bring in strict economic terms and in the specific sorts of freedom they can facilitate but papal social teaching has consistently stressed that markets are limited and imperfect tools with potentially destructive aspects which capitalism those challenging the church s critique of markets often urge that we look to the overall impact of capitalism arthur brooks argues that the spread of free enterprise around the world has pulled billions back from the brink of starvation over the last few hundred years but this timescale glosses over precisely the different relationships between the market and the common good with which catholic social thought is concerned and which were fundamental to the positive effects of the market the laissez faire era that accompanied the industrial revolution brought enormous gains in production along with massive social upheavals and cyclical depressions many of which were nearly as bad as the great depression that depression left the world in such disarray that free market liberalism soviet communism and fascism appeared equally politically plausible at the time what emerged in the postwar reconstruction in the west were various forms of democratic socialism guided by keynesian management of markets that era was marked both by a historically unprecedented period of sustained economic growth and by an equally unprecedented increase in equality it was this social democratic era of capitalism not the laissez faire era that preceded it that created the middle class societies that we consider normal figures as diverse as michael novak and then cardinal joseph ratzinger have identified this form of capitalism as the implicit ideal of catholic social doctrine in an address to the italian senate cardinal ratzinger said in many respects democratic socialism was and is close to catholic social doctrine and has in any case made a remarkable contribution to the formation of a social consciousness in this era the market was oriented toward the common good through strong government regulation and very substantial tax funded public investment these positive outcomes were also driven by strong unions and a concord between business labor and government to cooperate in the national common good in the late 1960s postwar capitalism entered into a sustained crisis the growth of these mass production economies depended on the demand provided by expanding national markets internal demand began to stagnate once large portions of the population already owned homes large appliances and cars the 1970s oil crisis further pushed the u s economy into stagnation keynesian economics had no tools to address a simultaneous combination of high unemployment and high inflation into this crisis stepped neoliberal economists and allied foundations and institutes long opposed to the new deal who proposed that the answer was to abandon macroeconomic attempts to manage the economy and to allow microeconomic forces to steer the economy to efficiency and growth the outcomes of this approach are abundantly clear decades of low inflation but also a fundamental disconnect between economic growth and equity in the united states inflation adjusted income has stagnated for 90 percent of earners since 1978 and economic inequality has returned to the levels that preceded the great depression these market focused ideas are no longer new for five decades neoliberal ideas have been the dominant inspiration for economic policy individualized market based structures have replaced the collective social insurance and public funding mechanisms of the new deal to take but one example we have moved from state subsidized universities and grants to individual student loans this policy shift communicates to us that yes we are free to choose our own path as we were in state funded systems but it also communicates the neoliberal belief of the policy shift s architect the university of chicago economist gary becker that human capital is primarily an individual concern this neoliberal freedom comes with a literal price we must choose a career that will enable us to pay back those loans the common good may need more grade school teachers and rural doctors but those positions will not pay off high loan balances neoliberalism often presents itself as a project of deregulation but as notre dame economist philip mirowski observes like any market system neoliberalism is a massive exercise in policy construction in a lecture in 1951 milton friedman proposed that what is new about neoliberalism is that it goes beyond the idea of laissez faire rather than letting the market be it seeks to promote competitive market action wherever possible but in caritas in veritate pope benedict xvi offered a sobering catalogue of the world these new market focused policies have created new forms of competition between states have led to a downsizing of social security systems as the price to be paid for seeking greater competitive advantage in the global market with consequent grave danger for the rights of workers for fundamental human rights and for the solidarity associated with the traditional forms of the social state 25 neoliberalism often presents itself as a project of deregulation but as notre dame economist philip mirowski observes like any market system neoliberalism is a massive exercise in policy construction market effects beyond the economy the effects of neoliberalism extend beyond purely economic matters in two ways first market logic has heavily influenced the design of what we call social media and its impacts on our social lives and civil society second living in this world of cultivated competition has a profound influence on how we experience relationships with others and thus how we understand ourselves and society social media has become such an unavoidable part of social life that we easily forget how it differs from other forms of social relations unlike families workplaces and local communities social media platforms offer complete consumer freedom to choose with whom we associate these media platforms have a market like structure young people now grow up in a world where their social status is quantified before their eyes where each thought or pose is immediately judged and evaluated in real time social media platforms construct a world where attention friends and dating are experienced within a market framework to a degree unimaginable to previous generations our personal lives provide no refuge from market competition milton friedman proposed that adam smith s invisible hand was relevant to any dimension of human life where large numbers of individuals pursue their own self interest while interacting with others but it is f a hayek s idea of the market as an information processor more powerful than democratic deliberation or expert synthesis that inspired the very algorithms that structure our social and civil lives indeed one of the founders of wikipedia cited hayek s idea as his inspiration in an interview in reason magazine social media has more or less absorbed contemporary civil society venerable institutions from previous eras newspapers journals of opinion and broadcast news networks receive much of their traffic through social networks such as facebook twitter and reddit these platforms create a marketplace of ideas where sourced journalism and considered opinion writing compete directly with shock news sites and conspiracy theories truth becomes an expression of subjective market preference not an objective to be pursued collectively our division and incivility are not simply the result of moral weakness they are the effects of these systemic market structures the market has an impact on broader society for a second reason the more society is influenced by market logic the more we experience ourselves as individuals in competition with others and the less we are able to imagine ourselves working with others in shared action for the common good libertarians and other pro market thinkers emphasize the social dimensions of market relationships as stephanie slade argues capitalism provides a framework for people to interact peacefully and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes commercial exchange elicits an instinctive thankfulness between parties labor abuse and monopoly behaviors are common enough to show this is far from a universal outcome it is true that market exchange can elicit relationships that go beyond mere material benefit but in contemporary market settings these aspects of the relationship are always subordinate to the profit principle as an entrepreneur i may develop deep personal connections to my suppliers and employees but my entire enterprise is constrained by the need to make a profit i can pay them at all only if i clear a profit and thus i am forced to pay them as little as possible we can propose alternative forms of market relations such as the economy of communion movement highlighted by benedict in caritas in veritate but these do not describe the day to day working of the capitalism we currently have neoliberals and libertarians often point beyond individual relationships to a broader spontaneous order that emerges from myriad interactions in the market but whatever the projected harmony of this broader order a fundamental component of the daily experience of relationship by members of market societies involves competition with others the more society is influenced by market logic the more we experience ourselves as individuals in competition with others and the less we are able to imagine ourselves working with others in shared action for the common good the theologian meghan clark notes that one of benedict s central critiques of market relations in caritas in veritate concerns their anthropological impact or how they form us in a way of being human that falls short of the fulness of communion to which humankind is called to share in the triune god it is not that market societies do not promote relationships but that the kinds of relationships they encourage are constrained and limited individual and competitive the political scientist martijn konings argues that there is a connection between the emotional burden of living in a neoliberal society and the more heartless aspects of contemporary politics in a competitive market society no one rich or poor is secure and everyone is a potential competitor people deal with the anxieties this produces by embracing the proffered vision that everyone gets what they deserve and deserves what they get every success is described as the result of personal virtue and hard work this provides comfort that the abyss that threatens is not really random or capricious rather it is what happens to others who unlike ourselves lack discipline and initiative this vision exacerbates racial ethnic and class divisions by ascribing the suffering of minority and underprivileged communities not to historic and present day injustices but to deficient culture and poor choices in this vision safety nets are perceived as a moral hazard a temptation to weakness at lampedusa pope francis spoke movingly of the globalization of indifference i have argued here that ours is a world made indifferent without a lived experience of the common good and access to the forms of action that achieve it we become isolated vulnerable and cruel market economies have much to offer society when oriented toward the common good for catholic social thought it is the task of politics to promote and set limits to the market so that it can serve the common good this position can seem shocking in an era that has been dominated by neoliberal thought for five decades but the postwar era of unprecedented market growth and equity took place when the market was allied with strong state support and oversight economic conditions change we cannot simply reproduce that era but we can seek to find a new balance in our changed circumstances in order to get this balance right we have to first recognize the distinct political and collective nature of the common good
remember when japan was set to become the world s top economy the risks of such forecasts have been highlighted by this and other fearless predictions including more recently that china would continue its double digit growth rate forever and that india would quickly become the new china however asia s rise to global prominence is no fantasy with many arguing that the recent emergence of china and india merely reflects a return to the historical economic norm after the postwar dominance of the united states halfway through the twentieth century the continent accounted for only 20 percent of global gdp but spearheaded by japan and south korea s economic miracles the rise of the asian tiger economies of southeast asia and china s subsequent economic boom asia now contributes 40 percent of global gdp according to the international monetary fund it will deliver nearly two thirds of global growth in the next few years looking into the crystal ball by 2030 asia s top economies are expected to comprise china india japan indonesia and south korea however the risks are many including the potential for a geopolitical or economic shock including disease revolution terrorism or war that could cause a nation or the region to veer off course for example how might china s growth prospects look if a democratic uprising unseats the communist government or if war breaks out in the south china sea could south korea unite with the north will japan finally decide to lower the barriers to mass immigration and the risks to india could include further terror attacks or even nuclear war nevertheless on the balance of possibilities these five nations are expected to lead in asia by the end of the next decade 1 china when deng xiaoping became the paramount leader of china in 1978 the country s economy was faltering beneath the burden of decades of maoist economic policy the radical economic reforms that followed opened communist china up to foreign investment decollectivized agriculture and privatized state owned industry propelling china to decades of unprecedented growth that saw it overtake japan to become the world s second largest economy in 2010 while last year s 6 9 percent gdp growth rate was china s slowest in twenty five years and may have been overinflated according to some analysts the figure still dwarfed that of every major economy in the world other than india the halcyon days of almost 10 percent average gdp growth per annum which the nation had experienced since the 1978 reforms are over but the economic growth spurts of the world s most populous country are far from finished backed by an economic restructuring from exports to domestic demand and from manufacturing and industry to services and consumption the u s department of agriculture s latest projections forecast that the chinese economy will grow at an average of 5 2 percent per annum until 2030 whether china can achieve these forecasts will depend on beijing s success in managing the inevitable slowdown in growth and tackling skyrocketing debt levels and industrial overcapacity as it slowly restructures from an investment led to a consumption driven economy for now the sentiment among economists is that beijing will rise to these challenges if that is the case china s economy will close the gap on the united states which according to the usda is expected to experience growth closer to 2 4 percent per annum through to 2030 although on those projections china would narrowly miss out on becoming the world s largest economy by 2030 it would comfortably remain the dominant economic force in asia 2 india if the last few decades have been the story of china s rise to prominence in the global economy the decades ahead are seen as belonging to india india displaced china as the world s fastest growing major economy in 2014 and with 7 7 percent annual gdp growth forecast by the usda until 2030 the south asian giant is universally regarded as the next global economic powerhouse the imf has even predicted that india will rise from seventh largest to become the world s third largest economy as early as 2019 aided by its reformist government and its young population that is delivering a demographic dividend while low commodity prices have hit the other bric economies of brazil russia and china india s status as a net commodity importer and consumer has placed the world s largest democracy in pole position to capitalise from current global market conditions as low oil coal and iron ore prices persist india s trade deficit continues to shrink and consumer spending power is on the rise while its major economic obstacle inflation is at its lowest level in a decade that is not to say india does not face challenges managing the demands of its impatient populace but the world bank sees india maintaining its status as the world s fastest growing major economy on the back of public sector investment and positive regulatory reforms making india a reasonably safe bet to continue as asia s rising star 3 japan not too long ago japan was the symbol of asian economic resurgence u s analysts flocked to tokyo to learn the secrets of japanese industry government bureaucrats were praised for their success in guiding the private sector and the hardworking japanese salaryman was seen driving the world s new economic leader given that japan s economy grew an average of 16 percent per annum between 1960 and 1990 to become the world s second largest economy such predictions were not as radical as they appear now but after a massive economic bubble that saw asset prices soar to ridiculous heights at one stage the grounds under tokyo s imperial palace were valued at more than the entire state of california the party ended in the early 1990s fast forward through two lost decades to the present day and the economic forecasts tell a very different story while prime minister shinzo abe has sought to stimulate growth through his abenomics policies his administration has battled headwinds including the world s most elderly population a shrinking workforce and faltering productivity along with a growing public debt burden between now and 2030 japan is expected to experience the largest decrease in its labor force with the oecd urging policies to improve government finances while restructuring the economy and encouraging more women and elderly workers whether japan can meet the significant economic and demographic challenges it faces remains to be seen however the usda predicts that while india will overtake japan in the next few years it will cling onto the title of the world s fourth largest economy by 2030 4 indonesia the world s most populous muslim nation is already a heavyweight in asean and according to forecasters it is set for further gains in coming decades according to mckinsey ninety million people will join indonesia s consuming class people able to buy items that satisfy their basic needs by 2030 a larger increase than any nation outside of china and india jpmorgan believes asean will become the fourth largest economic region in the world by 2030 after the european union united states and china and indonesia is expected to account for 40 percent of this growth yet while the rise of indonesia s consumer demand and household consumption is promising for its economic growth over the coming decades it faces numerous hurdles including the need to revitalize infrastructure overcome corruption and reduce its dependence on resource exports to china nevertheless the usda appears confident in indonesia s ability to reform projecting it will average 5 1 percent gdp growth until 2030 which would see indonesia surpass south korea as the fourth largest economy in asia 5 south korea south korea is the second most export driven major economy in the world barely trailing chief exporter germany given that a quarter of the peninsular nation s exports travel to the slowing chinese economy it is little surprise that growth is stalling the hyundai research institute reports sliding exports and waning global demand is damaging domestic consumption and corporate investment coupled with news of widespread job cuts in the manufacturing industry and high household debt the korean economy faces its share of problems including an aging population and shrinking workforce however the oecd believes seoul is taking the right actions in increasing spending cutting red tape signing various free trade agreements and incentivizing women to enter the workforce which korea hopes will be sufficient to improve its lagging productivity the usda appears confident enough in korea s response to its problems too forecasting a modest but respectable average gdp growth rate of 2 8 percent per annum until 2030 leaving the economy comfortably the fifth largest in asia and should the south eventually reunite with the north it would gain access to millions of extra workers if it can cope with the budgetary cost of unifying the poor north with the richer south predicting the future of one of the world s most turbulent regions is always subject to error as an old joke about economists suggests they were only created to make weather forecasters look good but while the nature and speed of asia s rise can still be debated its further economic expansion appears

by marshall auerback this article originally appeared on alternet airbus is considering whether or not to shift the assembly process of its latest generation of a330 planes to china as part of a bid to increase its market share in the world s fastest growing civil aviation market the european multinational is following a trend started by boeing which recently opened a new completion plant in china on the face of it the decision by the two companies which dominate the civilian aviation market makes sense build where your biggest customer lives especially as china does not yet have a fully homegrown civil aviation industry ready to compete globally the benefits are many including the goodwill and esteem of the country that would be buying these planes in the long term however that might prove to be a costly miscalculation based on its recent history here and here it won t take long for china to catch up and largely displace both companies domestically in beijing s home aviation market as well as seizing a large chunk of the corporate duopoly s global market share airbus and boeing could therefore be making short term decisions with negative long term consequences for their future profitability given china s formidable economic advancement none of this should come as a surprise to either airbus or boeing nor should it shock western governments the problem is that everybody has historically been guided by the na√Øve assumption that simply admitting china to organizations such as the world trade organization wto would induce beijing to in the words of philip pan eventually bend to what were considered the established rules of modernization prosperity would fuel popular demands for political freedom and bring china into the fold of democratic nations or the chinese economy would falter under the weight of authoritarian rule and bureaucratic rot china has unquestionably modernized but its politically illiberal dirigiste polity has if anything massively moved in the opposite direction strengthened by that very modernization process that has done anything but falter furthermore the country has many aims and goals that are antithetical to the long term prosperity of western companies and economies as the european union is beginning to recognize boeing and airbus might simply become the latest western sacrificial lambs beijing has explicitly targeted wide bodied aircrafts as one of its 10 new priority sectors for import substitution in its made in china 2025 document so whatever short term gains airbus and boeing receive in terms of securing additional orders from china could well be undermined longer term the resultant technology transfers and lower labor costs will almost certainly give beijing a quantum leap toward competing directly and ultimately displacing both companies given the merger with mcdonnell douglas boeing will continue its march toward effectively becoming a branch of the u s department of defense as its civilian market share crashes but airbus doesn t really have the luxury of a military alternative given the relative paucity of european defense expenditures as if boeing needed any further problems the 737 fiasco represents the latest in a series of setbacks for the company boeing s 737 global recall coming on the heels of the initial launch problems of the 787 dreamliner some six years ago where the demoduralization of production meant that boeing could not fully account for stress transmission and loading at the system level as gary pisano and willy shih write together illustrate the dangers of spreading manufacturing too far across the globe engineers notes cuny fellow jon rynn need to kick the tires of the new production processes they design so while a market may be global production and the growth of production take place most efficiently in relatively close geographic quarters american companies such as boeing consistently underestimate the value of closely integrating r d and manufacturing while underplaying the risks of separating them as recent events have demonstrated again to the company s cost by deciding to expand its a330 production in china airbus looks poised to repeat boeing s error a potential miscalculation that most european union companies have hitherto largely avoided because the eu has prioritized domestic manufacturing discouraged offshoring more than its u s counterparts in regard to the loss of u s manufacturing jobs attributable to china the american economic review paper by justin r pierce and peter k schott specifically notes that there was no similar reaction in the european union where policy did not change beijing itself has historically balanced its purchases from both major civil aviation manufacturers to ensure that it does not rely too heavily on one aircraft supplier which means that airbus will likely benefit from the void created by the 737 recall all the more reason why the european conglomerate should be wary of following the pied piper like expansion into china the 737 recall also complicates resolution of the u s china trade conflict which had appeared closer to resolution in light of beijing s proposal to buy an additional 1 2tn in u s exports over six years boeing aircraft purchases featured heavily on beijing s shopping list but the longer term challenges relate to china s economic development path and its corresponding move up the high tech curve which have largely been characterized by mercantilist policies of protection and heavy government subsidy in this regard the chinese state has followed a national development strategy first outlined in the mid 19th century by the german economist friedrich list who argued that the national government should play a crucial role in promoting guiding and regulating the process of national economic advancement protectionism list argued should play a role here as well during the country s catch up phase of technological development list wrote the analysis against a historic backdrop where germany was beginning to challenge the dominant economic power of its time the united kingdom so the defenders of beijing might well point to his work to show that there is nothing new about using the state as a principal instrument to accelerate economic development and innovation however list was analyzing two capitalist economies operating within the context of a 19th century gold standard global financial system which invariably circumscribed the scope of state involvement the finite availability of gold reserves limiting fiscal policy options by contrast today the global economy operates under a fiat currency system and what therefore distinguishes china s economic domestic development from its 19th century predecessors is the sheer scale of fiscal resources it can deploy in the furtherance of its economic and military objectives some of these objectives might not be so benign to the west longer term which points to another consideration for the west for all of its supposed embrace of capitalism china is still primarily a state dominated economy which eschews the disciplines of a free market economy this means it has the capacity and ideological predisposition to use the national fiscal policy as a loss leader absorbing losses well beyond what would be tolerated in an economy dominated by private enterprise private companies of course can go bust beijing underwrites its designated national champions by relying on a combination of subsidies some disguised as they flow through state backed investment funds and the financial sectors and buy china preferences to develop chinese products even though these policies are contrary to the rules of wto membership which china eagerly joined in 2001 as the economist brad setser argues various parts of the chinese state compete absorb losses and then consolidat around the successful firms other countries worry about the losses notes setser but not the chinese government which simply socializes the losses at the national level and writes them off in this regard boeing and airbus would do well to consider china s experience in the solar industry designating this as another strategic sector for growth in the 1990s chinese solar companies with the explicit backstop of the state ultimately raised enough funding via debt to build sufficient solar capacity for the world three times over the overinvestment ultimately killed the cash flows of major western competitors and knocked them out of the business leaving the market free for china to dominate commenting on the trend scientific american highlighted that between 2008 and 2013 china s fledgling solar electric panel industry dropped world prices by 80 percent a stunning achievement in a fiercely competitive high tech market china had leapfrogged from nursing a tiny rural oriented solar program in the 1990s to become the globe s leader in what may soon be the world s largest renewable energy source here was a classic case of state guided supported commercial companies receiving benefits that went far beyond anything in say korea or taiwan or even japan in the earlier part of their development now this trend is manifesting itself across the entire spectrum of the chinese guided economy including agricultural equipment industrial machinery telecommunications ai computer chips and civil aviation in another disturbing parallel that boeing and airbus would do well to consider he timeline of china s rise began in the late 1990s when germany overwhelmed by the domestic response to a government incentive program to promote rooftop solar panels provided the capital technology and experts to lure china into making solar panels to meet the german demand according to scientific american much like the german solar companies which shipped valuable manufacturing and technological expertise to china to sustain demand boeing and airbus could well be signing their economic death warrants by agreeing to offshore increasing amounts of production in china to sustain their global market shares aided and abetted by their more market oriented governments which frown on the idea of national industrial policy the same thing is happening in wind power in china which is expected to see offshore wind capacity grow from 2 gigawatts last year to 31 gigawatts in the next decade china s expansion here has already forced siemens and gamesa to merge to cope with the rising competitive challenge as far as aviation itself goes setser makes the point that china may cut into the united states future exports by building its own competitor to the 737 and also cut into europe s future exports if airbus decides to build the a330 in china and china buys made in china rolls royce engines for the c929 and the a330 even if this allows the duopoly to maintain its dominance in global civil aviation it is hard to see how shifting manufacturing production of aircraft components to china to get orders constitutes a win for the u s or european workers who are already being displaced and boeing s weak kneed response to the 737 crisis will likely exacerbate the company s problems going forward the bottom line is that both western governments and western corporations have persistently underestimated the power of china s economic development model and the corresponding economic threat that it poses to the west s own affluence the usual criticism leveled against the chinese growth model is that a country that subsidizes its industries ends up with inefficient industries because heavily protected local firms are shielded from global competition ultimately leaving the country that resorts to protectionism with inferior products the idea of national champions built up via state dirigisme according to classic liberal economic doctrine ultimately ensures that economic efficiency and commercial considerations get squeezed out rent seeking and corruption become institutionalized goes the argument so these national champions ultimately will not be able to compete in the global marketplace that was certainly the assumption of milton friedman who called the chinese communist party s state driven strategy an open invitation to corruption and inefficiency by contrast according to defense and the national interest the governing assumptions of capitalist economies is that he discipline of the marketplace not the state is better suited to choose winners and knock out losers who cannot offer the prices or quality or features of their competitors china represents the ultimate repudiation of these seemingly ironclad economic laws the country s success has come across a slew of industries clean tech notably wind and solar power internet companies despite overwhelming censorship china has corporate behemoths such as alibaba or baidu which rival google in scale and scope and more recently in the telecommunications sector where huawei has clearly benefited from buy china preferences created by the state via its state owned telecommunications enterprises and now is considered to be the global leader in 5g telephony in practice therefore there is no reason why the same model cannot work with regard to civil aviation even as airbus and boeing eagerly provide the rope with which they may hang their respective companies in the future marshall

returns as of march 1 2019 revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 1 68 billion an increase of 5 9 over last year s third quarter the organic growth rate which adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations was 6 in the third quarter of fiscal 19 the organic growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 6 2 and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services operating segment was 8 6 the organic growth rates of both segments were negatively impacted by a greater number of customers being closed for business in this year s third quarter compared to last year s third quarter due to severe winter weather and the timing of the holidays christmas eve and new year s eve fell on a monday this year compared to on a sunday in the prior year gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal 19 of 755 2 million increased 7 8 gross margin as a percentage of revenue was 44 9 for the third quarter of fiscal 19 compared to 44 1 in the third quarter of fiscal 19 uniform rental and facility services operating segment gross margin as a percentage of revenue improved 80 basis points from last year s third quarter to 44 9 and the first aid and safety services operating segment gross margin percentage improved 130 basis points to 48 2 reported operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 19 of 278 3 million increased 39 1 operating income margin was 16 5 in the third quarter of fiscal 19 compared to 12 6 in fiscal 18 operating income was negatively impacted by integration expenses related to the g k acquisition by 800 000 in the third quarter of fiscal 19 and 9 8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 18 operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 18 was also reduced 39 7 million by a one time cash payment to cintas employees following the enactment of the tax cuts and jobs act signed into legislation on december 22nd 2017 excluding the integration expenses related to the g k acquisition and the one time cash payment to employees operating income increased 11 8 and operating income margin improved 90 basis points to 16 6 in the third quarter of fiscal 19 compared to 15 7 in the third quarter of fiscal 18 reported net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 19 was 200 9 million and reported earnings per diluted share from continuing operations from the third quarter of fiscal 19 were 1 83 please note that there were a few items impacting the comparability of reported financial results first g k acquisition integration expenses negatively impacted reported eps in the third quarter of fiscal 19 and 18 by 0 01 and 0 06 respectively also reported eps in the third quarter of fiscal 18 included a negative impact of 0 24 from the one time cash payment to employees finally reported eps in the third quarter of fiscal 18 included a positive impact of 1 59 from benefits under the tax app primarily due to a one time reevaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities excluding these items net income dollars increased 31 7 and net income margin was 12 compared to 9 6 last year eps increased 34 3 as scott farmer our chairman and ceo stated in today s press release we re pleased with our third quarter financial performance our employee partners are working diligently to exceed customer expectations while also making significant progress on integrating the g k acquisition and converting more operations to our new enterprise resource planning system and while our employee partners are focusing on getting customers ready for the workday we remain committed to efforts to increase shareholder value in this year s third quarter we paid an annual dividend totaling 220 8 million the dividend of 2 05 per share was an increase of 26 5 over last year s dividend also in the quarter we purchased 100 million of cintas stock under our buybacks program as of february 28th we have now purchased 546 6 million of cintas stock during fiscal 19 and the amount remaining under our buyback program is 863 4 million we updated our annual guidance for fiscal 19 we expect revenue to be in the range of 6 87 billion to 6 885 billion this implies a strong finish to our fiscal 19 year with fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 6 to 7 and operating income margin in the range of 17 to 17 5 we expect eps from continuing operations excluding certain items to be in the range of 7 42 to 7 48 note the following regarding the eps guidance it assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal 19 of 20 6 this implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24 5 the reported effective tax rate in last year s fourth quarter was 21 5 the higher tax rate expected in the fourth quarter of this year will have a negative impact of 0 07 to 0 08 keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period based on discreet events including the amount of stock compensation benefits our guidance that assumes that diluted share count for competing eps of 111 5 million shares it does not assume any further g k integration expenses and it does not assume any future share buybacks i ll now turn the call over to paul paul adler vice president and treasurer thank you mike please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year third quarter additionally there will be no work day differences in our fiscal fourth quarter looking ahead to fiscal 2020 please note that there will be one less work day than in fiscal 19 each quarter of fiscal 20 will contain 65 work days one less day will negatively impact fiscal 20 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points to illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal 19 s third quarter revenue one work day is about 26 million one less work day also has a negative impact on operating margin fiscal 20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 19 the negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses please keep these headwinds in mind when modeling our fiscal 20 results we have two reportable operating segments uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services the remainder of our business is included in all other all other consists of fire protection services and our uniform direct sale business first aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement uniform rental and facility services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services the segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route uniform rental and facilities services revenue was 1 358 billion an increase of 5 7 excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes the organic growth rate was 6 2 as mike mentioned earlier the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by customer closures caused by the severe weather and the holiday calendar our uniform rental and facilities services segment gross margin was 44 9 for the third quarter compared to 44 1 in last year s third quarter an improvement of 80 basis points energy expenses as a percentage of revenue was 2 4 compared to 2 5 in the prior year quarter we are pleased with the gross margin expansion and our ability to overcome the weather and holiday challenges as well as continued wage pressures increased commodity costs such as for hangers which are sourced mostly from china and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an erp system implementation our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products safety products and training this segment s revenue for the third quarter was 149 2 million the organic growth rate for the segment was 8 6 this segment too was negatively impacted by severe weather and the timing of the holidays the first aid segment gross margin was 48 2 in the third quarter compared to 46 9 in last year s third quarter an increase of 130 basis points note that first aid segment gross margins are at record levels and have been marching higher since the acquisition of zee medical three and a half years ago national account new business continues to help drive high single digit organic growth penetration of existing customers with more products and services is also a major contributor to topline growth and it results in above average gross margins our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi million dollar account uniform direct sale however is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from other business units all other revenue was 174 8 million an increase of 4 5 the organic growth rate was 2 3 and was driven by 11 3 organic growth in the fire business all other gross margin was 42 3 for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41 7 for last year s third quarter selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28 3 in the third quarter compared to 30 9 in last year s third quarter note that the one time cash payment to employees in last year s third quarter that mike mentioned earlier was recorded in selling and administrative expenses excluding this payment last year s selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue was 28 4 compared to 28 3 in this year s third quarter our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 19 was 20 1 in the third quarter of fiscal 18 we realized the significant tax benefit from the tax act primarily due to a one time revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities our fiscal 19 eps guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 20 6 this implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24 5 the effective tax rate in last year s fourth quarter was 21 5 as mike stated previously the higher expected tax rate will have a negative impact on fourth quarter eps of 0 07 to 0 08 our cash and equivalence balance as of february 28th was 80 9 million operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 19 increased 15 7 from the amount of operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 18 capital expenditures in the third quarter were 70 2 million our capex by operating segment was as follows 55 8 million in uniform rental and facilities services 8 1 million in first aid and safety and 6 3 million in all other we expect fiscal 19 capex to be in the range of 270 million to 285 million as of february 28th total debt was 2 754 billion 2 537 billion is fixed interest rate debt and 217 5 million is variable rate commercial paper at february 28th we are at our targeted leverage of two times debt to ebitda that concludes our prepared remarks we are happy to answer your questions questions and answers operator thank you the floor is now open for questions if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing 1 on your telephone keypad if you are using a speakerphone please make sure that your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again press 1 to ask a question our first question comes from toni kaplan with morgan stanley toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst hi good afternoon uniform rental was a bit below what we d expected this quarter could you just give us the organic growth ex the holiday shift and ex the weather closure is it possible that any sales were bumped into the fourth quarter mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer we expect that the impact was about 60 basis points to the growth of both rental and the total company i would say that we don t expect much to be bumped to the fourth quarter that s why you see the guidance coming down from a revenue perspective a little bit greater than the 60 basis points for the third quarter 60 basis points is roughly 10 million in the quarter when we think about that quarter this is the first year since fiscal 15 that the holidays weren t either on a friday the weekend or a monday we just found many of our customers not only took off the holiday but took off the monday before the holiday took off a day or so after the holidays as well when that happened it just created a lot of disruption to for example our new business effort where appointment setting for our sales reps became very difficult and the momentum they had going into the holidays was really stopped and they had to regain that momentum with the decision maker meetings etc after the holidays the other thing was the weather if you think about the polar vortex for example we had customer shutdowns from minnesota all the way to the east coast again that creates real challenges for our sales people to get continued momentum of meeting with decision makers etc it also has an impact on our drivers our drivers we call them service sales reps or ssrs when our customers close our ssrs have to squeeze more stops into fewer number of days when it happens our ssrs have last time to look for revenue opportunities because the customers are closed there s less customer traffic to use our restroom products for example it certainly did have an impact on the quarter toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst okay great then i wanted to understand all other a little bit better it sounds like fire was really strong with 11 organic growth so i m guessing that means that direct sales were sort of weaker was it fire that drove the strong margins in that segment i know that they jump around but given last quarter was a little bit on the weaker side was this sort of a catch up or was this the mix shift i just want to understand all other margin a little bit better paul adler vice president and treasurer toni it s paul you re right fire had a very strong quarter organically so then the corollary is that uniform direct sale did not perform as well you know that direct sale business it s non recurring revenue so it s a little harder to forecast it s lumpier it depends on rollouts it s tougher to forecast and the sales cycle is longer as well uds the uniform direct sale business did come in lighter than we expected of course that suppressed margins as well the fire business overall still continues to perform very well high single digit organic growth is the expectations those margins will continue to improve as the organic growth continues to pick up toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thank you operator our next question comes from manav patnaik with barclays capital manav patnaik barclays analyst good evening guys i just wanted to see if i reconciled this right you said the impact in the quarter from both weather and the two less days was 10 million but then for 2020 one less work day impacts you 26 million for the full year so is it just because it was in the holiday period maybe and it was less of an impact mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer manav when we have customers close our goal is to reschedule the visit to them it s not like we completely lose one full day of revenue we will still get the rental revenue we just have to reschedule the stop so that we can pick up for example dirty uniforms dropped off clean we will still generate revenue because of that but when we are doing that it s the things like continuing to look for the penetration opportunities that suffer a bit it s the new business that suffers a little bit we don t lose all of the days revenue because we have to still visit and serve the customer it s just that the penetration opportunities and the new business productivity was challenged a bit despite all of that a 6 2 organic growth rate is still a pretty good performance by our rental business despite the challenges we have you re right though as we think about 2020 that s a full day that we lose and don t get back in terms of the revenue within that fiscal year that 26 million that paul referenced that s just an example of if you take our total revenue divided by the number of work days this past quarter that s effectively the impact that it would have next year manav patnaik barclays analyst okay got it then maybe just the latest on the g k integration what are the next milestones we should be looking to hear from you guys paul adler vice president and treasurer manav the integration continues to progress very nicely it doesn t mean though that there s no heavy lifting going on in our operations still that heavy lifting is typically now in the form of rerouting we expect that to continue into fiscal 20 what we re really trying to do manav is in certain markets minimize the disruption sync up the rerouting for the g k acquisition with the sap conversion so minimize disruption to the operation to the customers handle all that change management at one time so yeah still some inefficiencies exist in those markets where they re going through that as i mention that will continue into 20 but the operations are doing a very nice job of taking care of the customer and i think the solid financial results are kind of a testament to that fact manav patnaik barclays analyst got it thanks operator thank you our next question comes from andrew steinerman with jp morgan securities andrew steinerman jp morgan managing director hi guys you re going to hate this question but i m going to try it when you look at the legacy g k portfolio of business how fast do you think it s growing relative to the 6 organic overall and if you can talk about salesforce productivity again in that g k legacy business cross selling etc mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer so you re right andrew that s a really tough question i would say that the growth isn t quite near the legacy cintas levels yet we are seeing some nice performance in things like our hygiene penetration so we really do like the direction but i would say we re likely not where legacy cintas locations are just yet but it s really hard to tell because we have transferred so much volume from closed locations to cintas locations as we optimize routes we are moving g k volume into cintas and cintas into g k it s very muddy when you try to parse that out as it relates to the sales rep productivity we have one sales team let s make sure we re clear on that the productivity is still very good it s better than a year ago it s not quite as high as it was in the second quarter because of some of the challenges that i mentioned a few minutes ago but we re still very pleased with that performance andrew steinerman jp morgan managing director any milestones ahead on cross selling that you can talk about into that g k legacy business mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say because the business is so blended andrew our goal is just continuing to manage the business location by location but we ll be reporting on it in total because it s so difficult we ll do our best to give some color like we have in the last couple quarters that we like the revenue performance in former g k customers there s going to be a little bit more anecdotal as we go forward because of the blending of that but if you think about the impact that i mentioned in terms of the weather and holidays that kind of turns a 6 2 into a 6 8 that performance we really like and certainly there is some help compared to where we were a year ago in terms of penetration at legacy g k customers pretty hard to give a specific number but we know there certainly are signs of success andrew steinerman jp morgan managing director okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from gary bisbee with bank of america merrill lynch gary bisbee bank of america merrill lynch managing director hey guys good afternoon this is a question i think we all get all the time about the cross sell you ve never really provided any disclosure of any metrics consistently that would help people think about it i know you ve historically said competitive reasons you didn t want to give too much but have you thought about potentially at some point introducing some metrics to help us track the success that you re having whether it s customer accounts that we could revenue per customer or any other metric it seems to me it would be helpful to your investor base if you were to provide something mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer well i certainly can appreciate that gary as you said for competitive reasons we don t like to give too much of that information but i will tell you practically if you think about what we ve had going on over the last few years we re talking about the largest integration that we ve had in our rental business the largest integration we ve ever had in our first aid business and an sap conversion there s a lot going on to try to get the kind of data that we would be comfortable enough providing externally out of the three different systems we ve been on that would be very very challenging i understand your request and as we get fully on to sap we will certainly give that some hard fought but gosh we re in the midst of a lot of things going on that would make that kind of reporting pretty challenging gary bisbee bank of america merrill lynch managing director fair point i ll ask again once sap is fully up and running that s a good point mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll expect that question in a couple years gary bisbee bank of america merrill lynch managing director fair enough a couple of other ones a quarter ago you said fairly strongly that you were seeing no signs of economic weakness from the customer base in the us and canada do you have the same level of conviction or does that same statement ring true today or has the trade impact or some of the other things that have been out there have you noticed any other impact in the last three months that would change that kind of statement thanks mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer gary we still like the environment that we re operating in aside from the weather challenges we like the environment and our customers seem to be very healthy they re investing there are lots of job openings gdp is still at a level today and expected for the rest of the calendar year where we like to operate we haven t seen a lot of change other than the weather disruption which was certainly real gary bisbee bank of america merrill lynch managing director thank you one last one the amount of sg a leverage if we back out the one time payment a year ago it s still positive but narrow relatively to the last few quarters i would guess the revenue impact this quarter was part of the reason but is there anything from your perspective changing in the ability to deliver operating leverage in the near term or was that anything else to explain that mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer the weather that we ve talked about the revenue challenge that we ve talked about probably took 20 basis points of additional leverage in sg a so we probably would have been 30 basis points better than last year in total no there are ups and downs we re self insured we get some things that go up and down we invest for example in our first aid and safety business where we ve been growing so nicely but there s nothing that i would look at as a challenge as we move forward to continue to see that number tweak down gary bisbee bank of america merrill lynch managing director thanks a lot operator our next question comes from justin hawk with r w baird justin hawk robert w baird company analyst two questions here i guess one the positive that we could take away from this is the margins were pretty good consideration the revenue shortfall you called out some of the factors that are still out there the inflation rate costs and whatnot but i guess i was curious on the labor costs specifically if you could just comment on where that s trending where net pricing is trending and how those have changed from three or six months ago mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer labor pressures i would say are about the same as we ve seen in the first two quarters of this fiscal year i wouldn t call it any worse but they still remain and as we ve talked about in the past we work diligently to deal with those first of all we want to retain our partners so we do as much as we can to keep our partners engaged and satisfy it in terms of working with us we want to pay them the right wages for sure so that we can again help keep them engaged that partner retention which remains high for us is such an important part of managing our labor but in addition to that we look for opportunities for process improvement we look for automation and other types of efficiencies and we ve been doing a pretty good job of that so far not to mention the fact that the synergies that we re getting off of the g k integration certainly help and are timely but they remain our goal is to continue to perform well despite them as it relates to the pricing environment we haven t seen a lot of change from quarter to quarter in that environment either i don t look for that to change a whole lot as we move forward at least in the next quarter or so justin hawk robert w baird company analyst okay great second one here just maybe more numerical but the g k integration expense was pretty light your guidance the 0 09 looks like it s probably going to say fairly light in the fourth quarter as well from the i think you were saying 18 million to 22 million was the total for the year so is it because you re just ahead of schedule and there s not more expense or are those moving into 2020 how should we think about the level of integration expense that remains paul adler vice president and treasurer yes justin i mentioned earlier about the integration activities it s largely rerouting and our supply chain is still hard at work realizing synergies as well rerouting does not really drive significant costs the purpose of the rerouting is to get those routes more dense that lowers energy costs provides us with more time to spend with the customers it s the smallest bucket of the synergies the fact is that the larger expenses related to the integration came when the plant closings occurred closing the plants decommissioning them severing we just don t have any of that left so we would expect another maybe 2 million to 3 million of integration expenses in the fourth quarter so we ll probably end the year at about 16 million in total then looking ahead to fiscal 20 it s going to be very small a very nominal amount of integration expenses but again we re not finished with the integration activities we re still rerouting a lot of challenges out there for our operations but it just doesn t drive the significant expenses that the other activities did mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer just to be clear there are still expenses and inefficiencies for example duplicate routing training overtime and temps but the expenses paul s talking about are those that are identifiable that can really called out into that integration line the heavy lifting in the route optimization remains and the inefficiencies and the costs associated with it also remain they re just really hard to call out so for example when we re training ssrs on new routes we ve got a little bit of duplicate labor going on when we re training and pulling them off of their routes there s a little bit of inefficiency and duplicate labor when we ve got overtime it s hard to tell how much of that is the day to day and how much of that is the true integration work there are expenses and inefficiencies that remain they re just much harder to call out specifically justin hawk robert w baird company analyst that makes sense that s helpful thank you very much operator our next question comes from dan dolev with nomura securities international dan dolev nomura instinet analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question appreciate it sorry to harp on this but if i think about the organic growth even ex the impact of weather etc it s about a 20 basis point acceleration if i look back your comp was getting about 80 basis points easier if i m not wrong is there anything to read into that what is driving that as far as i remember back in like 2017 you put out like 8 comp quarters what are the odds of us getting back to those rates and what s driving the meager acceleration ex weather thanks mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah dan the 8 that you re referring to they were strong and they were without any g k in them that was prior to g k becoming inorganic so i had the question from andrew a little bit ago about how much is the legacy g k business growing while it s very very difficult to tell it s also pretty clear that they are not growing quite at the legacy cintas levels yet we certainly believe that they can get there over time but that doesn t happen overnight as we look to the fourth quarter the range of revenue that we ve given is at 6 to 7 we think it s a very healthy range at the midpoint there s some acceleration there so we re very very pleased with the progress that we ve made we got a little bit of a hiccup with the weather and holiday challenges customer closure challenges but we re right where we wanted to be dan dolev nomura instinet analyst got it just overall mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer 6 to 7 overall yes dan dolev nomura instinet analyst got it i was going to ask about the synergies in the quarter i think last time you had 25 million paul adler vice president and treasurer yeah dan the synergies we began the fiscal year and we guided to 90 million to 95 million in total for the year and we re on track to achieving that we ll actually wind up a bit above the top end of that range then next fiscal year think about incremental synergies of maybe 30 million to 35 million so the bottom line is that we continue to track very nicely to what we committed to in the beginning which was the 130 million to 140 million of synergies within those four years operator our next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs george tong goldman sachs analyst good afternoon you ve previously indicated that ancillary products such as first aid and fire safety has less than 20 penetration among uniform rental customers can you help frame where that number can go as cross selling increases not only at g k but also the broader cintas customer base paul adler vice president and treasurer we haven t really talked about that a lot publicly the reason is that s a difficult thing to specifically target we certainly think about that in the different verticals some verticals are better than others for that penetration but george we re really not really ready to give goals and targets i would say this the stand alone businesses are still growing very very nicely we think there s a lot of runway in just simply growing each business on their own but there s no question there s more penetration opportunity available i m really hesitant to put us in a box and say there s a goal there just yet george tong goldman sachs analyst got it drilling down into the sap integration can you give us an update on how many branches have undergone a conversion and when you would expect to start seeing margin benefits paul adler vice president and treasurer george we are about 57 now through the conversion that s about 202 operations that are now on sap this time last quarter we were at 48 converted so a lot of good activity in this past quarter as far as the margin benefits we haven t quantified any of the benefits we ve talked about and given examples in terms of the power of the system what it can do for our route people with a satellite based type of handheld device the efficiencies that that brings opportunities in our stock rooms with managing inventory and sharing it and having visibility but then there s also a lot of benefits in terms of opportunities to cross sell and look into the system of first aid and safety to better understand national accounts and a lot of opportunities around big data and being able to do profitability analysis price reviews and that type of stuff we ll have more commentary on that as we continue to get through the roll out a lot of those benefits for the system especially as they relate to the topline and some profitability improvements you need the entire network to be in and we re just over half of the way so nothing we can quantify at this point in time in terms of the benefits operator thank you our next question comes from hamzah mazari with macquarie capital mario cortellacci macquarie group analyst hey guys this is actually mario cortellacci filling in for hamzah could you give us any color on your net add stops during the quarter i m curious how relevant that metric is today compared to history because i guess the portfolio has changed with time i wanted to see if that s actually relevant anymore paul adler vice president and treasurer yeah the add stops metric is a real we consider it a very old legacy uniform rental type of metric we used decades ago when we were predominately providing uniforms and entrance mats it might be meaningful to some of our comp competitors it s not as meaningful to us because we have such a huge breadth of products and services that we have more to offer the customers than just uniforms and mats we are not also dependent upon the customer base just adding jobs and going along with gdp and being propelled or held back by employment you look back at our results and we have grown consistently in multiples of excess of gdp and jobs so the add stops metrics which is more about same store sales how is that particular customer growing are they adding or subtracting it s not as meaningful for us we re trying to drive the growth through penetration and through attacking new verticals like scrub rental with new products and services so long winded answer to say it s not meaningful to us there wasn t anything significant to note in add stops i would say that to mike s point earlier we rely on penetration of our existing customers and it was clear in looking at our operational data that the weather and holidays did impact our ability to penetrate and that s part of that 60 basis point headwind that we had this quarter operator got it one more and i ll turn it over given the portfolio changes since the last major slowdown could you give us a sense of how cintas might perform in a decelerating macro environment i m sure a piece of your business could be considered late cycle i assume that first aid would be a little more resilient obviously a piece of the business is still levered to the employment cycle what would that look like if there was a slowdown mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer mario i typically answer those questions starting out with it depends on how deep and how broad that next slowdown would be we have a very diverse customer base we ve got customers of all types in all types of verticals customers of all sizes so we ve got a very diverse customer base and that helps us when things like a few years ago the oil and gas customers really were suffering with low oil prices helped us a few years ago when there were some measurements of an industrial recession and we still grew those kinds of things but it really depends on how deep and how broad if we can hit our revenue guidance and our eps guidance it will be 48 out of the last 50 years where we have grown sales and grown profits and that would be growing through 6 out of the last 7 recessions so how do we stand in the next one it depends on how deep and how broad we have done some things since the great recession that we think are beneficial to our performance through the next slowdown and that would be a broader product line so that we have more things to offer to our prospects our existing customers we have a sales team that is a little bit more sophisticated than it was prior to the great recession where we specifically attacked certain verticals and we sell to existing customers a little bit more proactively so we look to drive more revenue that way and we have probably even more diverse customers today and we have prior to the last recession where we ve really targeted things like healthcare and education which are a little bit more recession resistant so we ve made some changes since the great recession but we ve also performed very well over the last 50 years in all kinds of economic cycles but i would always go back to it depends on how deep and how broad mario cortellacci macquarie group analyst got it thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer scott schneeberger oppenheimer company analyst good evening guys you just gave synergy guidance for next year on an earlier question i found it interesting because it sounds like you re trending really well on the 90 to 95 then the incremental guide 30 to 35 the high end of that gets you to the 130 the low end of the total i m just curious might you finish a year earlier than anticipated or might there be incremental upside that we see in this if so where are the areas sourcing routing you touched on a little bit but where are the areas that you re progressing ahead of that are worth addressing at this juncture thanks mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer great question scott i would say this we have some sourcing synergies that we are still working on as we ve talked about they come a little longer because we had to burn through g k inventory and then we have to source from either our new supply chains or put the volume the greater volume into our existing supply chains we have to get then get the inventory to our locations and put it in service where it begins to amortize there will be synergies in our fiscal 21 that still are from that global supply chain effort it s hard to pull those forward so getting back to your question i think there may be a little bit of upside and i think that upside you may have heard me say a few times in the past i think the biggest bucket for the upside is that sourcing and supply chain where we kind of built that opportunity off of the g k inventory and supply chain and the opportunity the upside opportunity might be does that impact the cintas sourcing and supply chain in other words does the combined volume then help even the cintas pricing to drive lower as well i m not ready to give any kind of numbers but i think that s where the opportunity lies and as you suggested we expect to be at the low end of that range next fiscal year and driving toward the high end and possibly through the high end in fiscal 21 scott schneeberger oppenheimer company analyst thanks that s good progress more a housekeeping question for my follow up tax rate has been jumping around just for our benefit and modeling how would you think about it for the annual and quarterly as we model out ahead just some rules of thumb because i think without a little guidance that can be all over the place mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah you re right about that scott with the change in the stock compensation a few years ago this tax rate has really been bouncing around because we can t control the exercises of options and we can t control the stock price we talked a little bit about a 24 5 in the fourth quarter that is our expectation there as we look to finish this year if we do that 24 5 in the fourth quarter that would put us at a 20 6 for the full fiscal 19 year that s lower than we would expect our typical run rate to be with our stock performance we had a tremendous amount of exercises this year and it s hard to say that those are going to repeat next year so i would expect that our tax rate would be right in the range of 22 next year with a fairly low tax rate in the first quarter because we generally get more stock comp benefit followed by a higher rate in q s two through four i would suggest maybe using fiscal 19 s quarterly rates that we talked about as maybe a bit of a guide for the rate to get you there i would say for the full year a 22 type of a number would be right where i would say that s currently our expectation obviously then if we are at a 22 next year and a 20 6 this year that puts a little bit of pressure on us with that increase scott schneeberger oppenheimer company analyst thanks i appreciate that incremental color operator thank you our next question comes from tim mulrooney with william blair tim mulrooney william blair company analyst good afternoon guys i ll talk about the balance sheet two times leverage it seems like a good point to check in your capital allocation priorities how should we think about capital deployment after capex between the dividend share repurchase and m a mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer our cash flow remains healthy it was very good in the third quarter and we expect it to continue to perform well into the future that creates opportunities obviously we want to continue to invest in the business we will do that by growing the business via things like adding routes adding sales people and doing advertising and r d those things will run through the p l just like they have but those are very important pieces for us our capex i would expect to continue kind of in that 4 to 4 5 range and that s very important to us we want to make sure we are creating the capacity for growth those are our two highest priorities aside from that we certainly love the tuck in acquisitions and we ll continue to look for opportunities there as best we can in our rental first aid and fire businesses we will also look if there are larger opportunities particularly in our existing businesses we would love to take a look at those we ll be as aggressive as we can be on looking for great value out of small and larger types of acquisitions particularly within our businesses that s going to leave us though with some cash so we certainly love to increase the dividend we ve done so every year since 1983 i would expect the board will continue to look very strongly at that and then there may be buyback opportunity as we ve shown so far this fiscal year where we ve acquired almost 550 million through our first three quarters we like that program we like the momentum of the business and i would expect that we ll continue to look at that opportunistically in addition to all of that our ebitda continues to grow and we like that two times leverage neighborhood we are there right now our expectation is we ll continue to be in that range tim mulrooney william blair company analyst thanks mike on the m a front are there still areas in the us where you feel there may be more room to grow through m a in your rental business also what s your position with respect to expanding internationally thanks for your time mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer from a us perspective it s more about the opportunity than it is the geography we are in almost all geographies in the us and canada but there are still 600 or so independent operators out there and so the opportunity really is more about the location of those independent operators and having a dialogue with them and understanding if we can team up and create long term value together we ll continue to look for those opportunities no matter the geography in the us and canada from an international perspective i would say this we love the us and canadian opportunities we think there are a lot there we will continue to invest heavily in those businesses i think there may be a time in our future where we get into other international geographies it s not our highest priority but i think that s something that we ll keep our eyes on i would say that in our business start ups are pretty difficult and so it would likely be through some sort of m a but it would have to be with the right partner in the right geography and one in which we felt like we could operate successfully operator our next question comes from seth webber with rbc capital markets seth weber rbc capital markets analyst good afternoon thanks for keeping the call going here going back to the capex commentary for a second i think earlier this year you had brought the capex number down a little bit because you had messaged you were able to extract some benefits from the g k business so how should we be thinking about capex going forward is it brick and mortar do you feel like you need more capacity here is there anything you can point to that you ll be spending money on specifically mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer you re absolutely right seth we did get some benefit from the g k acquisition in terms of capacity and it allowed us to delay certainly some capex related to new capacity both in plants and in our routes but we re continuing to grow and continuing to grow well capacity is really a local thing so there are certainly still geographies where there may not have been a g k presence where we re growing well where we need capacity we ll continue to look for or we will have capex related to laundry capacity and routing capacity i would say from a growth perspective most of our capex growth will be in that form laundry facility capacity and routes i e trucks same goes for our first aid and hire businesses as well we are growing very nicely and the growth will come primarily in the way of additional trucks we ll certainly have some maintenance capex too from a growth perspective yes bricks and mortar and trucks operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference to mr mike hansen for any closing remarks mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you again for joining us tonight we will issue our fourth quarter financial results in july and look forward to speaking with you again at that time thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference you may now disconnect duration 62

following circumstances cause material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt regarding eagle s ability to continue as a going concern eagle had a working capital deficiency of 40 0 million eagle s estimate of future cash flows from operating activities over the next twelve months is not sufficient to repay the loan principal which is classified as a current liability eagle was in default of one of its four financial covenants under the four year secured term loan from its u s based lender the loan agreement violation of any financial covenant constitutes an immediate event of

42 857 notes 1 field netback is a non ifrs financial measure see advisories non ifrs financial measures 2 includes one time disposition costs of 0 7 million relating to the twining disposition 3 includes one time disposition costs of 3 4 million relating to the salt flat disposition during the fourth quarter of 2018 sales volumes decreased 5 when compared to the third quarter production from the north texas properties increased by 176 boe d due to the third well of the 2018 drilling program starting production production from the canadian properties decreased by 282 boe d primarily due to the disposition of the twining properties at the end of august as well as the selective well shut in process that was initiated in dixonville in response to the low commodity price environment during the fourth quarter of 2018 field netback decreased 44 when compared to the third quarter due to lower production and a 35 decrease in realized prices net of royalties which was consistent with the wti price decrease and the dramatically wider price differentials on canadian oil when compared to the third quarter the negative effect on field netback of lower prices was partially offset by a 31 decrease in operating transportation and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter as eagle raised production from one well in north texas and initiated a selective well shut in program in dixonville for the dixonville properties in canada the realized price in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 26 74 per boe as compared to 52 86 per boe in the fourth quarter of 2017 this 49 quarter over quarter realized price decrease occurred despite an 8 wti price increase and was due to wider canadian oil price differentials for the full year of 2018 the realized price averaged 55 39 per boe as compared to 48 61 per boe for the prior year the wider canadian oil price differentials held this year over year realized price increase to only 14 versus a 31 increase in the wti price during the latter part of the fourth quarter an unprecedented widening in oil price differentials caused a significant decrease in field netbacks in the dixonville area the differential between ca wti and eagle s received price was 58 86 per barrel in december resulting in a december realized oil price of 4 60 per barrel as a result of the low pricing in december eagle proactively initiated a selective well shut in program which reduced workover expenditures this in turn lowered production but resulted in dixonville being cash flow positive at a field level during the fourth quarter of 2018 funds flow from operations decreased 35 from the third quarter of 2018 this was primarily due to 44 lower fourth quarter field netbacks being partially offset by a realized risk management gain of 1 3 million in the fourth quarter loss earnings on a quarterly basis often do not move directionally or by the same amounts as funds flow from operations this is due to items of a non cash nature that factor into the calculation of loss earnings and those that are required to be fair valued at each quarter end fourth quarter 2018 funds flow from operations decreased by 35 from the third quarter of 2018 yet the fourth quarter net income was 214 less than the third quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of a 5 3 million impairment expense realized in the fourth quarter relating to dixonville current assets decreased quarter over quarter due to a lower december revenue forming part of the december accounts receivable balance at year end while september revenue which formed part of the september accounts receivable balance was higher due to stronger september oil prices current liabilities increased in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter due to the reclassification of eagle s debt

madam speaker and members of the united states congress today liberians have gathered under the banner march for justice and accountability in liberia on capitol hill before the united states congress to express their firm support for house resolution 1055 unanimously passed by the house of representatives in 2018 and currently awaiting the concurrence of the senate and subsequent signing into law by president donald j trump special thanks to former representative daniel m donovan jr of district 11 new york state who introduced the resolution similar appreciation goes to all of the sponsors of the resolution the house s committee on foreign affairs for its adoption and the entire membership of the house of representatives for the unanimous passage of the resolution absolutely liberians have no doubt that the united states senate will concur with the house of representatives for the passage into law of this vital piece of legislation which seeks to address liberia s entrenched culture of corruption and impunity today s assembly was jointly organized by liberia justice advocacy groups and individuals based in the united states to include but not limited to the movement for justice in liberia international justice group the hard truth grassroot alternative movement for economic freedom coalition for justice liberia and some members of the then truth and reconciliation commission of liberia house resolution 1055 among other things seeks to affirm strong united states liberia ties and support for democratic principles the resolution also calls for the full implementation of the truth and reconciliation commission recommendations including the establishment of an extraordinary criminal tribunal for liberia in other words the resolution urges the government and people of liberia to support the full implementation of the truth and reconciliation commission recommendations it recognizes and further support efforts by the department of state and the united states agency for international development usaid to advance liberia s national reconciliation through continued support for the rule of law effective governance and the robust role of civil society madam speaker and members of congress the move by the united states government to reaffirm its unflinching support to liberia s recovery and development process in the framework of resolution 1055 is reflective of the longstanding traditional relationship that subsists between the two countries born out of the united states during the closing stages of the infamous slave trade in the 1800s liberia truly enjoys a special relationship with the united states it is in the spirit of this bond that we have assembled here today on the historic grounds of the united states congress on behalf of all liberians both at home and in the diaspora to express gratitude to the government and people of the united states for the immeasurable contributions they continue to make towards liberia s growth and development in particular liberians are exceptionally grateful for the post war reconciliation and recovery support efforts the country is benefitting from the united states through its agency for international development usaid by all accounts usaid remains liberia s largest and trusted bilateral donor since 1961 usaid continues to play a pivotal role in many aspects of liberia s development including the sustenance of the country s nascent democracy governance reform rights protection economic growth education healthcare and disaster management thanks to us taxpayers for their indefatigable benevolence madam speaker and distinguished members of congress it has been more than 15 years now since the devastating civil war in liberia ended the war remains the bloodiest ever in the history of the country which spread to neighboring guinea sierra leone and cote d ivoire thereby destabilizing the entire mano river union basin women and girls were raped children conscripted by various rebel groups as fighters mass murder took place across the country with wanton destruction of properties about 250 000 lives were destroyed with massive looting of the economy rebel groups with the support of their benefactors committed heinous crimes against humanity violated international humanitarian and human rights laws and protocols according to the rome statute these crimes fall directly under the jurisdiction of the international criminal court icc and therefore require the investigation and prosecution by the icc unfortunately these crimes committed predominantly against armless civilians have never been investigated by the icc as required except the crime of aggression committed by charles taylor in sierra leone for which he was prosecuted and now sentenced through the special court that was set up by the icc for sierra leone interestingly the common article 3 and protocol ii of the geneva convention was ratified by the government of liberia and are applicable to liberia these too must be enforced by all members and be accountable thereof the violations of international criminal laws international human rights laws and international humanitarian laws including war crimes should never be swept under carpet the facts are preponderant and evidentiary all factions that were engaged in the armed conflict in liberia one way or the other violated degraded abused denigrated and committed sexual and gender based violence against women and girls including rape sexual slavery forced marriages and other dehumanizing forms of violations massacres economic crimes and extra judicial killings were also committed sadly these carnages onslaughts and atrocities committed up to today s date continue to hunt the citizens of liberia because justice continues to be delayed and eventually would be denied if left unattended unfortunately some of those who bear the greatest responsibilities for these heinous war and economic crimes continue to walk sky free most unfortunately some of these very individuals are being rewarded with state power and have therefore become rulers of their victims at will and at their detriment displeasure and dissatisfaction this has created a tormenting and viciously traumatic cycle for the civilian population this is wrong unacceptable and unjust only justice can correct these unthinkable crimes and engender genuine reconciliation and healing madam speaker and members of congress the liberian civil conflict also witnessed numerous massacres including but not limited to those of sinje in grand cape mount county st peter s lutheran church on 14th street in sinkor and the st thomas episcopal church on camp johnson road delivering justice for these uncivilized and barbaric crimes is the only way to correct the wrongs reconcile the country and its people and eventually end the culture of impunity in liberia it is and will be unfortunate for the world to let these levels of atrocities go into the books of history without any form of accountability it will be saddened and mistaken for such crimes to go unpunished these terrible crimes must be investigated and the required legal measures taken to serve as the best deterrent madam speaker and members of congress another dimension of this most heart wrecking chapter of our history was the killing of five american catholic nuns as we have consistently underscored in our advocacy we want to emphasize again today that every well meaning liberian condemned this barbaric act and demand justice for their cruel murder in cold blood it was utterly wronged and perpetrators deserve an equal measure of justice for their insane actions it was even reported that these women were raped before being killed by the perpetrators to cover up the horrendous act only a special criminal tribunal will establish who raped and gruesomely murdered those humanitarians those women were on humanitarian mission and should have been exempted and not targeted every decent human being should and must demand answers for these acts like you members of congress we re seeking answers to the following questions 1 who killed the american catholic nuns 2 why has this human mystery remained unresolved for so long 3 why has nobody been held responsible or accountable 4 who will stand and speak for those americans when they can t for themselves 5 who will deliver justice for those sisters 6 when will the world stand up to give them justice in our candid opinion a special criminal tribune such as the one unambiguously considered in resolution 1055 will resoundingly answer these critical questions so let s do what is right let justice be served for the five catholic nuns and every liberian who paid the ultimate price for that brutal civil war let all of us who share this believe of delivering justice with equal measure demand an answer today and it should be now that s the only way these crimes can never happen again we sincerely believe that it is the responsibility of the world community to act and the united states through congress is on the right path as it has always done while commending the united states for the bold step taken evidenced by house resolution 1055 we would like to entreat the icc not to turn a blind eye to those acts of savagery against humanity all because they happened years ago the court needs to act and the time is now obviously now is the time for accountability responsibility and leadership oh yes now is the time for all perpetrators to answer all of the questions for the evil acts against their fellow human beings of course now is the time to deliver justice to those brutes who murdered the american catholic nuns certainly now is the time for all those human killing machines and looters of the liberian economy to pay for their actions it is our hope that all of us are mindful of the maxim that says injustice somewhere is injustice everywhere and that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere the death of a quarter million of people is completely out of the ordinary and we think it is time for action we have no doubt that house resolution 1055 is the appropriate mechanism based on the outcome of the truth and reconciliation process for liberia to prosecute crimes against humanity that were committed during the liberian civil war as it was in the cases of rwanda and sierra leone respectively madam speaker and members of congress it is also important to note that the civil war was launched because of corruption nepotism political marginalization and the abuse of power by previous governments in liberia sadly these vices remain deep seated in liberia today and the current government is yet to demonstrated commitment to address the situation these are uniquely worrisome recipes for economic instability and continuous poverty these too must be given serious consideration and urgent attention for so many reasons today credible reports such as the ones from the us state department the international monitory fund imf assessment and those from the investigation conducted into the reported missing 16 billion liberian dollar banknotes scandal by kroll a reputable us based financial crimes investigator under the auspices of usaid and the liberian government itself speak highly of the worsening economic situation under the watch of the footballing president george oppong manneh weah evidenced by extreme poverty and hardship currently endured by citizens of liberia these credible reports to a large extent indicate limited or no prospects for functional recovery and growth in liberia which has implications for the stability of an already wearied country in transition for example the imf in its just ended assessment report on the state of the economy puts liberia s growth forecast at 0 4 this speaks directly to the level of the rapid crashing of the already economy also the us state department in its 2018 report asserts that impunity for individuals who committed atrocities during the civil wars as well as for those responsible for current and continuing crimes remained a serious problem the government made intermittent but limited attempts to investigate and prosecute officials accused of current abuses whether in the security forces or elsewhere in the government corruption at all levels of government continued to undermine public trust in state institutions these reports point directly to gross inefficiencies in key government functionaries wastes and abuse of power the culture of corruption and impunity has emboldened president weah s administration to the extent that they are consumed by the irrational and unpatriotic belief that siphoning state resources too can go unpunished just as the cases of the killings rapes and massacres that others committed during the war the deteriorating economic situation in liberia is rapidly brewing apprehension and acrimony this needs urgent attention because it has the propensity to degenerate into chaos today the prices of basic commodities in the country have skyrocketed and many homes can hardly afford daily meals healthcare institutions are said to be on the verge of shutting down due to the lack of medical supplies and needed logistics for their various operations the quality of education has significantly diminished and if nothing is done to improve content and infrastructure illiteracy will remain an impediment to recovery and development so recovery of the education and healthcare sectors remain non negotiable priorities if liberia should recover from the current state of degradation unfortunately the weah administration has no credible implementation strategy to address this national imperative there are fears that unemployment is soaring and companies are threatening to lay off employees the latest which is making everyone nervous is the plan by the largest employer in the private sector the firestone rubber plantation company to lay off 800 of its employees which is 13 of the company s workforce in few months from now one can only imagine how many families will be out of food shelter and clothing if this plan is effectuated liberians are in troubling times madam speaker and members of congress the government s lack of demonstrated will to implement the trc recommendations coupled with its intolerance to critical voices labeling them as enemies of the state muscling the press as well as the reported killings of key individuals believed to have credible information about the reported disappearance of the missing billions of newly printed liberian dollar banknotes and misapplication of the us 25 million intended to mop up excess liquidity in stabilizing the exchange rate are all indications of the return to the dark days the recent murder of matthew innis of the department of regulation and supervision of the central bank of liberia is a bad omen mr innis was believed to have detailed information on the disappearance of billions of the newly printed liberian dollar banknotes and misapplication of us 25 million respectively currently there is a credible indication that a death squad is being organized involving former notorious rebel generals under the canopy of a private security for the president on the instruction of the minister of state for presidential affairs this is worrisome and everyone is panicking because liberians have experienced these dictatorial tenets for so long and are today victims of lies torture and killings the video covering some of the recruitment sessions are on display on various social media platforms this undertaking is absolutely wrong because it is not based on need as liberia is not at war neither is she expected to do so besides increasing the strength of the security is not a priority for a wearied country is already in deep economic crisis the motive is sinister and has to stop madam speaker distinguished members of congress liberia needs your urgent attention and that is exactly why we wish to call on the united states senate to please concur with the house of representatives on resolution 1055 which will facilitate the full and speedy implementation of the recommendations of the truth and reconciliation commission as the best deterrent that will put liberia on a trajectory of sustainable peace and stability liberians deserve a better life and a better image at this juncture we would like to seize this great opportunity to add our voice to those of our fellow compatriots and congressional members in spotlighting the deferred enforced departure ded status for liberians which is expected to expire on the 31st of march 2019 it is no doubt that liberians on ded have equally played by the rules they fled the protracted civil war came over to the united states through lawful means for three decades they lived in the us and established families many of whom in particular their children are american citizens sending back to liberia more than 11 000 families who have never been to that country for over 30 years especially in the current harsh and unbearable economy with an unemployment rate of 86 6 and dramatically declined growth rate of 0 4 amounts to economic catastrophe no this is not what america stands for this is not in the reputation of the greatest land of possibilities on earth we strongly believe that this impending catastrophe can be averted so let s do it to save humanity and to further protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of these families towards this end we are optimistic that congressional members will swiftly act on a bill or resolution to give these liberian families permanent status we are of the conviction that such action by congress will unite these families and keep them together instead of separating them doing so will further reflect the fundamental ideals of fair play equality and justice which this great union the united states of america represents finally we wish to unequivocally underscore here that our motivation to gather here today and present to you this statement of support was drawn from your historic magnanimity of standing with and for liberia in almost all aspects of her national existence in good times and in bad times you have demonstrated true friendship by deploying your financial human and material resources to keep our nation going today we are equally optimistic that resolution 1055 will be a reality war and economic crimes court for liberia will be a success story and corruption and impunity will become history it is only when we achieve these milestones will we become an economically socially and politically vibrant nation done on this ______ day of march ad 2019 in the city of washington dc the united states of america

in february 2019 kazakhstan saw a wave of protests triggered by various social and economic grievances rallies burst through the country in multiple locations indicating that popular distress is strong and unlikely to fade soon in an attempt to placate social discontent president nursultan nazarbayev fired the government citing its inability to improve living standards and announced his own plan to provide social relief for the families kazakhstan s hydrocarbon dependent economy is struggling to recover after the 2014 plunge in oil prices and the spillover effects of western sanctions against its largest trade partner russia on march 19 president nazarbayev announced his immediate resignation after ruling kazakhstan for thirty years background the death of five children from a single family in a house fire caused outrage in social media and triggered women led protests in kazakhstan s capital astana and multiple other locations across the country a unifying theme of the protesters is that that parents working low wage jobs struggle to make ends meet and to give their children proper childcare and housing the tragic deaths channeled widespread criticism of the government which has long encouraged families to have more children but failed to provide them with an adequate social safety net the rallies demanded that the authorities address the most pressing problems and provide better social allowances more places for children in kindergartens and proper housing additional protests took place in the city of zhanaozen located in western kazakhstan against high unemployment rates and low wages in the region in late february activists staged a protest in front of the ruling nur otan party headquarters in astana the february protests are not isolated incidents a creeping mood of social discontent triggered by socioeconomic hardship has been apparent in kazakhstan for several years while the authorities applied familiar practices of intimidating and suppressing the protesters the reactions were visibly anxious over the public upheaval in late february president nazarbayev harshly criticized cabinet members and local governors for failing to address basic social needs and the country s poor economic performance and then dismissed the entire government the reshuffle also included the head of the central bank after nazarbayev criticized the poor condition of kazakhstan s banks moreover the president put forward his own plan to allocate additional funds for low income large families and raise salaries in the public sector the unprecedented government reshuffle and surge in social benefits appears to be a political maneuver to defuse the protest mood nazarbayev intended to signal resolve and to improve his popular standing vis a vis the inept cabinet although his own electoral promises to diversify the economy and improve socioeconomic conditions remain to be fulfilled in a surprise move only weeks after the cabinet reshuffle nazarbayev himself tendered his resignation implications nazarbayev s resignation announced in a televised address to the nation on march 19 with immediate effect adds to the uncertainty regarding kazakhstan s future political and economic landscape after stepping down the former president will retain a considerable degree of authority as leader of the nation chairman of the security council and of the nur otan party the senate speaker kassym jomart tokayev will be the acting head of state until the next scheduled presidential elections in 2020 tokayev is a close associate of the former president he has substantial experience in the senior ranks of diplomacy and government and is a former prime minister and foreign minister while the timing may have been surprising the president s resignation itself was not unexpected in the past few months speculations over an impending succession have been frequent given nazarbayev s advanced age and frequent government reshuffles whereas the president dismissed talk of snap elections or resignation many analysts pointed out that the frequent changes within the government in 2018 and early 2019 suggest that the positions of various factions in kazakhstan s political elite have been in flux and that nazarbayev is preparing for succession other steps taken by nazarbayev such as requesting clarification from the constitutional court regarding an article of the main law that covers the length of the presidential term only added to the speculations in mid 2018 nazarbayev also became chairman of the security council immediately after it was transformed into an influential body designed to draft and implement state policies which would allow him to retain an important position in kazakhstan s political system after stepping down as president these changes at the top come at a very inopportune moment the popular unrest that kazakhstan currently experiences is a direct consequence of the deeper crisis in its commodity dependent economy thanks to its vast hydrocarbon resources kazakhstan has over the past twenty years been able to improve its economic performance raise state revenues and sharply reduce poverty however the oil fueled growth had its flip side hydrocarbon wealth was unevenly distributed creating a widening gap between the low income underclass and wealthy urban elites which accumulated a large part of the hydrocarbon revenues moreover public funding derived from hydrocarbon exports were not managed efficiently mainly due to pervasive corruption and a lack of proper oversight state resources were spent on prestigious projects aiming to enhance kazakhstan s international image but were less available to the population at large overreliance on hydrocarbon based growth made it harder to diversify the economy and boost growth in the non oil sector which is particularly important for hydrocarbon dependent economies vulnerable to external shocks the vulnerability of kazakhstan s economy was exposed in 2014 when the country was hit by the sharp plunge in oil prices and the western sanctions against russia a key trading partner kazakhstan s gdp growth which reached 10 percent annually in 2000 2007 has slowed considerably since 2014 to 1 2 percent in 2015 and 1 percent in 2016 unemployment started to rise while the sharp drop in hydrocarbon revenues necessitated cuts to the funding of social and infrastructure projects several devaluation rounds of the kazakh tenge ordered by the authorities to keep exports competitive hit the country s population especially hard a large share of private savings was wiped out and soaring prices undermined the purchasing power of households decreasing private consumption to counter the negative effects of the crisis the government had to implement costly economic measures financed by the sovereign oil fund and additional credits after 2016 economic growth has slowly started to pick up yet despite the ongoing rise in oil prices kazakhstan s economy still struggles to fully recover the current problems can be attributed to the weakness of the russian ruble which in 2018 lost 20 percent of its value against the u s dollar russia remains kazakhstan s key trading partner thus ruble depreciation had spillover effects on the tenge which has also lost value against the dollar another factor is the volatility in russia s financial market caused by additional u s sanctions against russia in 2017 kazakhstan s authorities are now concerned over the possible implementation of even more punitive sanctions under the defending american security from kremlin aggression act daskaa which is currently under consideration in the u s senate in the past year the government has undertaken several measures to counter the negative financial and economic trends including large scale privatization of state assets boosting non extractive industries and encouraging foreign investment particularly from china s belt and road initiative yet the prospects for putting these ambitious programs fully into practice are rather limited since even in the oil boom years implementation of economic reforms was hampered by a lack of good management habits in public institutions and state owned companies as well as corruption conclusions the government reshuffle and the hike in benefits could be a quick political fix to defuse the protest mood in kazakhstan however the country s core economic and social problems can be solved only through carefully implemented reforms the recent course of events suggests that as pointed out by several analysts the frequent government reshuffles have had more to do with the impending presidential succession than with ineffective economic policy several factors indicate that the succession was carefully planned to ensure a smooth transition of power however it came at a very tense moment raising concerns over the ability of top officials to ensure that political changes will not exacerbate uncertainty among kazakhs and tackle the mounting socioeconomic problems while neighboring uzbekistan provides a recent example that smooth political transition is possible in central asia the situation in kazakhstan is complicated by rising popular discontent and a challenging economic situation author s bios natalia konarzewska

the third quarter of fiscal 19 the organic growth rate for the uniform rental and facility services operating segment was 6 2 and the organic growth rate for the first aid and safety services operating segment was 8 6 the organic growth rates of both segments were negatively impacted by a greater number of customers being closed for business in this year s third quarter compared to last

fiscal 19 and 9 8 million in the third quarter of fiscal 18 advertisement advertisement operating income in the third quarter of fiscal 18 was also reduced 39 7 million by a one time cash payment to

finally reported eps in the third quarter of fiscal 18 included a positive impact of 1 59 from benefits under the tax app primarily due to a one time reevaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities excluding these items net income dollars increased 31 7 and net income margin was 12 compared to 9 6 last year eps increased 34 3 advertisement advertisement as scott farmer our chairman and ceo stated in today s press release we re pleased with our third quarter financial performance our employee partners are working diligently to exceed customer expectations while also making significant progress on integrating the g k acquisition and converting more operations to our new enterprise resource planning system and while our employee partners are focusing on getting customers ready for the workday we remain committed to efforts to increase shareholder value in this year s third quarter we paid an annual dividend totaling 220 8 million the dividend of 2 05 per share was an increase of 26 5 over last year s dividend also in the quarter we purchased 100 million of cintas stock under our buybacks program as of february 28th we have now purchased 546 6 million of cintas stock during fiscal 19 and the amount remaining under our buyback program is 863 4 million we updated our annual guidance for fiscal 19 we expect revenue to be in the range of 6 87 billion to 6 885 billion this implies a strong finish to our fiscal 19 year with fourth quarter revenue growth in the range of 6 to 7 and operating income margin in the range of 17 to 17 5 we expect eps from continuing operations excluding certain items to be in the range of 7 42 to 7 48 note the following regarding the eps guidance it assumes an effective tax rate for fiscal 19 of 20 6 this implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24 5 the reported effective tax rate in last year s fourth quarter was 21 5 the higher tax rate expected in the fourth quarter of this year will have a negative impact of 0 07 to 0 08 keep in mind that the tax rate can move up or down from period to period based on discreet events including the amount of stock compensation benefits advertisement advertisement our guidance that assumes that diluted share count for competing eps of 111 5 million shares it does not assume any further g k integration expenses and it does not assume any future share buybacks i ll now turn the call over to paul paul adler vice president and treasurer thank you mike please note that our fiscal third quarter contained the same number of work days as the prior year third quarter additionally there will be no work day differences in our fiscal fourth quarter looking ahead to fiscal 2020 please note that there will be one less work day than in fiscal 19 each quarter of fiscal 20 will contain 65 work days one less day will negatively impact fiscal 20 total revenue growth by about 40 to 50 basis points to illustrate the magnitude of the headwind using fiscal 19 s third quarter revenue one work day is about 26 million advertisement advertisement one less work day also has a negative impact on operating margin fiscal 20 operating income margin will be reduced by about 10 to 15 basis points in comparison to fiscal 19 the negative impact on the margin occurs because certain expenses like amortization of uniforms and entrance mats are expensed on a monthly basis as opposed to on a daily basis we will have one less day of revenue to cover the expenses please keep these headwinds in mind when modeling our fiscal 20 results we have two reportable operating segments uniform rental and facility services and first aid and safety services the remainder of our business is included in all other all other consists of fire protection services and our uniform direct sale business first aid and safety services and all other are combined and presented as other services on the income statement uniform rental and facility services operating segments includes the rental and servicing of uniforms mats and towels and the provision of restroom supplies and other facility products and services the segment also includes the sale of items from our catalogs to our customers en route uniform rental and facilities services revenue was 1 358 billion an increase of 5 7 excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate changes the organic growth rate was 6 2 as mike mentioned earlier the organic growth rate was negatively impacted by customer closures caused by the severe weather and the holiday calendar our uniform rental and facilities services segment gross margin was 44 9 for the third quarter compared to 44 1 in last year s third quarter an improvement of 80 basis points advertisement advertisement energy expenses as a percentage of revenue was 2 4 compared to 2 5 in the prior year quarter we are pleased with the gross margin expansion and our ability to overcome the weather and holiday challenges as well as continued wage pressures increased commodity costs such as for hangers which are sourced mostly from china and the inefficiencies that are customary with an acquisition integration and an erp system implementation our first aid and safety services operating segment includes revenue from the sale and servicing of first aid products safety products and training this segment s revenue for the third quarter was 149 2 million the organic growth rate for the segment was 8 6 this segment too was negatively impacted by severe weather and the timing of the holidays the first aid segment gross margin was 48 2 in the third quarter compared to 46 9 in last year s third quarter an increase of 130 basis points note that first aid segment gross margins are at record levels and have been marching higher since the acquisition of zee medical three and a half years ago national account new business continues to help drive high single digit organic growth penetration of existing customers with more products and services is also a major contributor to topline growth and it results in above average gross margins advertisement advertisement our fire protection services and uniform direct sale businesses are reported in the all other category our fire business continues to grow each year at a strong pace uniform direct sale business growth rates are generally low single digits and are subject to volatility such as when we install a multi million dollar account uniform direct sale however is a key business for us and its customers are often significant opportunities to cross sell and provide products and services from other business units all other revenue was 174 8 million an increase of 4 5 the organic growth rate was 2 3 and was driven by 11 3 organic growth in the fire business all other gross margin was 42 3 for the third quarter of this fiscal year compared to 41 7 for last year s third quarter selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were 28 3 in the third quarter compared to 30 9 in last year s third quarter note that the one time cash payment to employees in last year s third quarter that mike mentioned earlier was recorded in selling and administrative expenses excluding this payment last year s selling and administrative expense as a percent of revenue was 28 4 compared to 28 3 in this year s third quarter our effective tax rate on continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 19 was 20 1 in the third quarter of fiscal 18 we realized the significant tax benefit from the tax act primarily due to a one time revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities our fiscal 19 eps guidance assumes an effective tax rate of 20 6 this implies a fourth quarter effective tax rate of 24 5 the effective tax rate in last year s fourth quarter was 21 5 as mike stated previously the higher expected tax rate will have a negative impact on fourth quarter eps of 0 07 to 0 08 advertisement advertisement our cash and equivalence balance as of february 28th was 80 9 million operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 19 increased 15 7 from the amount of operating cash flow in the third quarter of fiscal 18 capital expenditures in the third quarter were 70 2 million our capex by operating segment was as follows 55 8 million in uniform rental and facilities services 8 1 million in first aid and safety and 6 3 million in all other we expect fiscal 19 capex to be in the range of 270 million to 285 million as of february 28th total debt was 2 754 billion 2 537 billion is fixed interest rate debt and 217 5 million is variable rate commercial paper at february 28th we are at our targeted leverage of two times debt to ebitda that concludes our prepared remarks we are happy to answer your questions questions and answers operator thank you the floor is now open for questions if you would like to ask a question please signal by pressing 1 on your telephone keypad if you are using a speakerphone please make sure that your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again press 1 to ask a question our first question comes from toni kaplan with morgan stanley toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst hi good afternoon uniform rental was a bit below what we d expected this quarter could you just give us the organic growth ex the holiday shift and ex the weather closure is it possible that any sales were bumped into the fourth quarter mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer we expect that the impact was about 60 basis points to the growth of both rental and the total company i would say that we don t expect much to be bumped to the fourth quarter that s why you see the guidance coming down from a revenue perspective a little bit greater than the 60 basis points for the third quarter 60 basis points is roughly 10 million in the quarter when we think about that quarter this is the first year since fiscal 15 that the holidays weren t either on a friday the weekend or a monday we just found many of our customers not only took off the holiday but took off the monday before the holiday took off a day or so after the holidays as well when that happened it just created a lot of disruption to for example our new business effort where appointment setting for our sales reps became very difficult and the momentum they had going into the holidays was really stopped and they had to regain that momentum with the decision maker meetings etc after the holidays the other thing was the weather if you think about the polar vortex for example we had customer shutdowns from minnesota all the way to the east coast again that creates real challenges for our sales people to get continued momentum of meeting with decision makers etc it also has an impact on our drivers our drivers we call them service sales reps or ssrs when our customers close our ssrs have to squeeze more stops into fewer number of days when it happens our ssrs have last time to look for revenue opportunities because the customers are closed there s less customer traffic to use our restroom products for example it certainly did have an impact on the quarter toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst okay great then i wanted to understand all other a little bit better it sounds like fire was really strong with 11 organic growth so i m guessing that means that direct sales were sort of weaker was it fire that drove the strong margins in that segment i know that they jump around but given last quarter was a little bit on the weaker side was this sort of a catch up or was this the mix shift i just want to understand all other margin a little bit better paul adler vice president and treasurer toni it s paul you re right fire had a very strong quarter organically so then the corollary is that uniform direct sale did not perform as well you know that direct sale business it s non recurring revenue so it s a little harder to forecast it s lumpier it depends on rollouts it s tougher to forecast and the sales cycle is longer as well uds the uniform direct sale business did come in lighter than we expected of course that suppressed margins as well the fire business overall still continues to perform very well high single digit organic growth is the expectations those margins will continue to improve as the organic growth continues to pick up toni kaplan morgan stanley analyst thank you operator our next question comes from manav patnaik with barclays capital manav patnaik barclays analyst good evening guys i just wanted to see if i reconciled this right you said the impact in the quarter from both weather and the two less days was 10 million but then for 2020 one less work day impacts you 26 million for the full year so is it just because it was in the holiday period maybe and it was less of an impact mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer manav when we have customers close our goal is to reschedule the visit to them it s not like we completely lose one full day of revenue we will still get the rental revenue we just have to reschedule the stop so that we can pick up for example dirty uniforms dropped off clean we will still generate revenue because of that but when we are doing that it s the things like continuing to look for the penetration opportunities that suffer a bit it s the new business that suffers a little bit we don t lose all of the days revenue because we have to still visit and serve the customer it s just that the penetration opportunities and the new business productivity was challenged a bit despite all of that a 6 2 organic growth rate is still a pretty good performance by our rental business despite the challenges we have you re right though as we think about 2020 that s a full day that we lose and don t get back in terms of the revenue within that fiscal year that 26 million that paul referenced that s just an example of if you take our total revenue divided by the number of work days this past quarter that s effectively the impact that it would have next year manav patnaik barclays analyst okay got it then maybe just the latest on the g k integration what are the next milestones we should be looking to hear from you guys paul adler vice president and treasurer manav the integration continues to progress very nicely it doesn t mean though that there s no heavy lifting going on in our operations still that heavy lifting is typically now in the form of rerouting we expect that to continue into fiscal 20 what we re really trying to do manav is in certain markets minimize the disruption sync up the rerouting for the g k acquisition with the sap conversion so minimize disruption to the operation to the customers handle all that change management at one time so yeah still some inefficiencies exist in those markets where they re going through that as i mention that will continue into 20 but the operations are doing a very nice job of taking care of the customer and i think the solid financial results are kind of a testament to that fact manav patnaik barclays analyst got it thanks operator thank you our next question comes from andrew steinerman with jp morgan securities andrew steinerman jp morgan managing director hi guys you re going to hate this question but i m going to try it when you look at the legacy g k portfolio of business how fast do you think it s growing relative to the 6 organic overall and if you can talk about salesforce productivity again in that g k legacy business cross selling etc mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer so you re right andrew that s a really tough question i would say that the growth isn t quite near the legacy cintas levels yet we are seeing some nice performance in things like our hygiene penetration so we really do like the direction but i would say we re likely not where legacy cintas locations are just yet but it s really hard to tell because we have transferred so much volume from closed locations to cintas locations as we optimize routes we are moving g k volume into cintas and cintas into g k it s very muddy when you try to parse that out as it relates to the sales rep productivity we have one sales team let s make sure we re clear on that the productivity is still very good it s better than a year ago it s not quite as high as it was in the second quarter because of some of the challenges that i mentioned a few minutes ago but we re still very pleased with that performance andrew steinerman jp morgan managing director any milestones ahead on cross selling that you can talk about into that g k legacy business mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer i would say because the business is so blended andrew our goal is just continuing to manage the business location by location but we ll be reporting on it in total because it s so difficult we ll do our best to give some color like we have in the last couple quarters that we like the revenue performance in former g k customers there s going to be a little bit more anecdotal as we go forward because of the blending of that but if you think about the impact that i mentioned in terms of the weather and holidays that kind of turns a 6 2 into a 6 8 that performance we really like and certainly there is some help compared to where we were a year ago in terms of penetration at legacy g k customers pretty hard to give a specific number but we know there certainly are signs of success andrew steinerman jp morgan managing director okay thank you operator thank you our next question comes from gary bisbee with bank of america merrill lynch gary bisbee bank of america merrill lynch managing director hey guys good afternoon this is a question i think we all get all the time about the cross sell you ve never really provided any disclosure of any metrics consistently that would help people think about it i know you ve historically said competitive reasons you didn t want to give too much but have you thought about potentially at some point introducing some metrics to help us track the success that you re having whether it s customer accounts that we could revenue per customer or any other metric it seems to me it would be helpful to your investor base if you were to provide something mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer well i certainly can appreciate that gary as you said for competitive reasons we don t like to give too much of that information but i will tell you practically if you think about what we ve had going on over the last few years we re talking about the largest integration that we ve had in our rental business the largest integration we ve ever had in our first aid business and an sap conversion there s a lot going on to try to get the kind of data that we would be comfortable enough providing externally out of the three different systems we ve been on that would be very very challenging i understand your request and as we get fully on to sap we will certainly give that some hard fought but gosh we re in the midst of a lot of things going on that would make that kind of reporting pretty challenging gary bisbee bank of america merrill lynch managing director fair point i ll ask again once sap is fully up and running that s a good point mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer i ll expect that question in a couple years gary bisbee bank of america merrill lynch managing director fair enough a couple of other ones a quarter ago you said fairly strongly that you were seeing no signs of economic weakness from the customer base in the us and canada do you have the same level of conviction or does that same statement ring true today or has the trade impact or some of the other things that have been out there have you noticed any other impact in the last three months that would change that kind of statement thanks mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer gary we still like the environment that we re operating in aside from the weather challenges we like the environment and our customers seem to be very healthy they re investing there are lots of job openings gdp is still at a level today and expected for the rest of the calendar year where we like to operate we haven t seen a lot of change other than the weather disruption which was certainly real gary bisbee bank of america merrill lynch managing director thank you one last one the amount of sg a leverage if we back out the one time payment a year ago it s still positive but narrow relatively to the last few quarters i would guess the revenue impact this quarter was part of the reason but is there anything from your perspective changing in the ability to deliver operating leverage in the near term or was that anything else to explain that mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer the weather that we ve talked about the revenue challenge that we ve talked about probably took 20 basis points of additional leverage in sg a so we probably would have been 30 basis points better than last year in total no there are ups and downs we re self insured we get some things that go up and down we invest for example in our first aid and safety business where we ve been growing so nicely but there s nothing that i would look at as a challenge as we move forward to continue to see that number tweak down gary bisbee bank of america merrill lynch managing director thanks a lot operator our next question comes from justin hawk with r w baird justin hawk robert w baird company analyst two questions here i guess one the positive that we could take away from this is the margins were pretty good consideration the revenue shortfall you called out some of the factors that are still out there the inflation rate costs and whatnot but i guess i was curious on the labor costs specifically if you could just comment on where that s trending where net pricing is trending and how those have changed from three or six months ago mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer labor pressures i would say are about the same as we ve seen in the first two quarters of this fiscal year i wouldn t call it any worse but they still remain and as we ve talked about in the past we work diligently to deal with those first of all we want to retain our partners so we do as much as we can to keep our partners engaged and satisfy it in terms of working with us we want to pay them the right wages for sure so that we can again help keep them engaged that partner retention which remains high for us is such an important part of managing our labor but in addition to that we look for opportunities for process improvement we look for automation and other types of efficiencies and we ve been doing a pretty good job of that so far not to mention the fact that the synergies that we re getting off of the g k integration certainly help and are timely but they remain our goal is to continue to perform well despite them as it relates to the pricing environment we haven t seen a lot of change from quarter to quarter in that environment either i don t look for that to change a whole lot as we move forward at least in the next quarter or so justin hawk robert w baird company analyst okay great second one here just maybe more numerical but the g k integration expense was pretty light your guidance the 0 09 looks like it s probably going to say fairly light in the fourth quarter as well from the i think you were saying 18 million to 22 million was the total for the year so is it because you re just ahead of schedule and there s not more expense or are those moving into 2020 how should we think about the level of integration expense that remains paul adler vice president and treasurer yes justin i mentioned earlier about the integration activities it s largely rerouting and our supply chain is still hard at work realizing synergies as well rerouting does not really drive significant costs the purpose of the rerouting is to get those routes more dense that lowers energy costs provides us with more time to spend with the customers it s the smallest bucket of the synergies the fact is that the larger expenses related to the integration came when the plant closings occurred closing the plants decommissioning them severing we just don t have any of that left so we would expect another maybe 2 million to 3 million of integration expenses in the fourth quarter so we ll probably end the year at about 16 million in total then looking ahead to fiscal 20 it s going to be very small a very nominal amount of integration expenses but again we re not finished with the integration activities we re still rerouting a lot of challenges out there for our operations but it just doesn t drive the significant expenses that the other activities did mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer just to be clear there are still expenses and inefficiencies for example duplicate routing training overtime and temps but the expenses paul s talking about are those that are identifiable that can really called out into that integration line the heavy lifting in the route optimization remains and the inefficiencies and the costs associated with it also remain they re just really hard to call out so for example when we re training ssrs on new routes we ve got a little bit of duplicate labor going on when we re training and pulling them off of their routes there s a little bit of inefficiency and duplicate labor when we ve got overtime it s hard to tell how much of that is the day to day and how much of that is the true integration work there are expenses and inefficiencies that remain they re just much harder to call out specifically justin hawk robert w baird company analyst that makes sense that s helpful thank you very much operator our next question comes from dan dolev with nomura securities international dan dolev nomura instinet analyst hey guys thanks for taking my question appreciate it sorry to harp on this but if i think about the organic growth even ex the impact of weather etc it s about a 20 basis point acceleration if i look back your comp was getting about 80 basis points easier if i m not wrong is there anything to read into that what is driving that as far as i remember back in like 2017 you put out like 8 comp quarters what are the odds of us getting back to those rates and what s driving the meager acceleration ex weather thanks mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah dan the 8 that you re referring to they were strong and they were without any g k in them that was prior to g k becoming inorganic so i had the question from andrew a little bit ago about how much is the legacy g k business growing while it s very very difficult to tell it s also pretty clear that they are not growing quite at the legacy cintas levels yet we certainly believe that they can get there over time but that doesn t happen overnight as we look to the fourth quarter the range of revenue that we ve given is at 6 to 7 we think it s a very healthy range at the midpoint there s some acceleration there so we re very very pleased with the progress that we ve made we got a little bit of a hiccup with the weather and holiday challenges customer closure challenges but we re right where we wanted to be dan dolev nomura instinet analyst got it just overall mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer 6 to 7 overall yes dan dolev nomura instinet analyst got it i was going to ask about the synergies in the quarter i think last time you had 25 million paul adler vice president and treasurer yeah dan the synergies we began the fiscal year and we guided to 90 million to 95 million in total for the year and we re on track to achieving that we ll actually wind up a bit above the top end of that range then next fiscal year think about incremental synergies of maybe 30 million to 35 million so the bottom line is that we continue to track very nicely to what we committed to in the beginning which was the 130 million to 140 million of synergies within those four years operator our next question comes from george tong with goldman sachs george tong goldman sachs analyst good afternoon you ve previously indicated that ancillary products such as first aid and fire safety has less than 20 penetration among uniform rental customers can you help frame where that number can go as cross selling increases not only at g k but also the broader cintas customer base paul adler vice president and treasurer we haven t really talked about that a lot publicly the reason is that s a difficult thing to specifically target we certainly think about that in the different verticals some verticals are better than others for that penetration but george we re really not really ready to give goals and targets i would say this the stand alone businesses are still growing very very nicely we think there s a lot of runway in just simply growing each business on their own but there s no question there s more penetration opportunity available i m really hesitant to put us in a box and say there s a goal there just yet george tong goldman sachs analyst got it drilling down into the sap integration can you give us an update on how many branches have undergone a conversion and when you would expect to start seeing margin benefits paul adler vice president and treasurer george we are about 57 now through the conversion that s about 202 operations that are now on sap this time last quarter we were at 48 converted so a lot of good activity in this past quarter as far as the margin benefits we haven t quantified any of the benefits we ve talked about and given examples in terms of the power of the system what it can do for our route people with a satellite based type of handheld device the efficiencies that that brings opportunities in our stock rooms with managing inventory and sharing it and having visibility but then there s also a lot of benefits in terms of opportunities to cross sell and look into the system of first aid and safety to better understand national accounts and a lot of opportunities around big data and being able to do profitability analysis price reviews and that type of stuff we ll have more commentary on that as we continue to get through the roll out a lot of those benefits for the system especially as they relate to the topline and some profitability improvements you need the entire network to be in and we re just over half of the way so nothing we can quantify at this point in time in terms of the benefits operator thank you our next question comes from hamzah mazari with macquarie capital mario cortellacci macquarie group analyst hey guys this is actually mario cortellacci filling in for hamzah could you give us any color on your net add stops during the quarter i m curious how relevant that metric is today compared to history because i guess the portfolio has changed with time i wanted to see if that s actually relevant anymore paul adler vice president and treasurer yeah the add stops metric is a real we consider it a very old legacy uniform rental type of metric we used decades ago when we were predominately providing uniforms and entrance mats it might be meaningful to some of our comp competitors it s not as meaningful to us because we have such a huge breadth of products and services that we have more to offer the customers than just uniforms and mats we are not also dependent upon the customer base just adding jobs and going along with gdp and being propelled or held back by employment you look back at our results and we have grown consistently in multiples of excess of gdp and jobs so the add stops metrics which is more about same store sales how is that particular customer growing are they adding or subtracting it s not as meaningful for us we re trying to drive the growth through penetration and through attacking new verticals like scrub rental with new products and services so long winded answer to say it s not meaningful to us there wasn t anything significant to note in add stops i would say that to mike s point earlier we rely on penetration of our existing customers and it was clear in looking at our operational data that the weather and holidays did impact our ability to penetrate and that s part of that 60 basis point headwind that we had this quarter operator got it one more and i ll turn it over given the portfolio changes since the last major slowdown could you give us a sense of how cintas might perform in a decelerating macro environment i m sure a piece of your business could be considered late cycle i assume that first aid would be a little more resilient obviously a piece of the business is still levered to the employment cycle what would that look like if there was a slowdown mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer mario i typically answer those questions starting out with it depends on how deep and how broad that next slowdown would be we have a very diverse customer base we ve got customers of all types in all types of verticals customers of all sizes so we ve got a very diverse customer base and that helps us when things like a few years ago the oil and gas customers really were suffering with low oil prices helped us a few years ago when there were some measurements of an industrial recession and we still grew those kinds of things but it really depends on how deep and how broad if we can hit our revenue guidance and our eps guidance it will be 48 out of the last 50 years where we have grown sales and grown profits and that would be growing through 6 out of the last 7 recessions so how do we stand in the next one it depends on how deep and how broad we have done some things since the great recession that we think are beneficial to our performance through the next slowdown and that would be a broader product line so that we have more things to offer to our prospects our existing customers we have a sales team that is a little bit more sophisticated than it was prior to the great recession where we specifically attacked certain verticals and we sell to existing customers a little bit more proactively so we look to drive more revenue that way and we have probably even more diverse customers today and we have prior to the last recession where we ve really targeted things like healthcare and education which are a little bit more recession resistant so we ve made some changes since the great recession but we ve also performed very well over the last 50 years in all kinds of economic cycles but i would always go back to it depends on how deep and how broad mario cortellacci macquarie group analyst got it thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from scott schneeberger with oppenheimer scott schneeberger oppenheimer company analyst good evening guys you just gave synergy guidance for next year on an earlier question i found it interesting because it sounds like you re trending really well on the 90 to 95 then the incremental guide 30 to 35 the high end of that gets you to the 130 the low end of the total i m just curious might you finish a year earlier than anticipated or might there be incremental upside that we see in this if so where are the areas sourcing routing you touched on a little bit but where are the areas that you re progressing ahead of that are worth addressing at this juncture thanks mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer great question scott i would say this we have some sourcing synergies that we are still working on as we ve talked about they come a little longer because we had to burn through g k inventory and then we have to source from either our new supply chains or put the volume the greater volume into our existing supply chains we have to get then get the inventory to our locations and put it in service where it begins to amortize there will be synergies in our fiscal 21 that still are from that global supply chain effort it s hard to pull those forward so getting back to your question i think there may be a little bit of upside and i think that upside you may have heard me say a few times in the past i think the biggest bucket for the upside is that sourcing and supply chain where we kind of built that opportunity off of the g k inventory and supply chain and the opportunity the upside opportunity might be does that impact the cintas sourcing and supply chain in other words does the combined volume then help even the cintas pricing to drive lower as well i m not ready to give any kind of numbers but i think that s where the opportunity lies and as you suggested we expect to be at the low end of that range next fiscal year and driving toward the high end and possibly through the high end in fiscal 21 scott schneeberger oppenheimer company analyst thanks that s good progress more a housekeeping question for my follow up tax rate has been jumping around just for our benefit and modeling how would you think about it for the annual and quarterly as we model out ahead just some rules of thumb because i think without a little guidance that can be all over the place mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah you re right about that scott with the change in the stock compensation a few years ago this tax rate has really been bouncing around because we can t control the exercises of options and we can t control the stock price we talked a little bit about a 24 5 in the fourth quarter that is our expectation there as we look to finish this year if we do that 24 5 in the fourth quarter that would put us at a 20 6 for the full fiscal 19 year that s lower than we would expect our typical run rate to be with our stock performance we had a tremendous amount of exercises this year and it s hard to say that those are going to repeat next year so i would expect that our tax rate would be right in the range of 22 next year with a fairly low tax rate in the first quarter because we generally get more stock comp benefit followed by a higher rate in q s two through four i would suggest maybe using fiscal 19 s quarterly rates that we talked about as maybe a bit of a guide for the rate to get you there i would say for the full year a 22 type of a number would be right where i would say that s currently our expectation obviously then if we are at a 22 next year and a 20 6 this year that puts a little bit of pressure on us with that increase scott schneeberger oppenheimer company analyst thanks i appreciate that incremental color operator thank you our next question comes from tim mulrooney with william blair tim mulrooney william blair company analyst good afternoon guys i ll talk about the balance sheet two times leverage it seems like a good point to check in your capital allocation priorities how should we think about capital deployment after capex between the dividend share repurchase and m a mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer our cash flow remains healthy it was very good in the third quarter and we expect it to continue to perform well into the future that creates opportunities obviously we want to continue to invest in the business we will do that by growing the business via things like adding routes adding sales people and doing advertising and r d those things will run through the p l just like they have but those are very important pieces for us our capex i would expect to continue kind of in that 4 to 4 5 range and that s very important to us we want to make sure we are creating the capacity for growth those are our two highest priorities aside from that we certainly love the tuck in acquisitions and we ll continue to look for opportunities there as best we can in our rental first aid and fire businesses we will also look if there are larger opportunities particularly in our existing businesses we would love to take a look at those we ll be as aggressive as we can be on looking for great value out of small and larger types of acquisitions particularly within our businesses that s going to leave us though with some cash so we certainly love to increase the dividend we ve done so every year since 1983 i would expect the board will continue to look very strongly at that and then there may be buyback opportunity as we ve shown so far this fiscal year where we ve acquired almost 550 million through our first three quarters we like that program we like the momentum of the business and i would expect that we ll continue to look at that opportunistically in addition to all of that our ebitda continues to grow and we like that two times leverage neighborhood we are there right now our expectation is we ll continue to be in that range tim mulrooney william blair company analyst thanks mike on the m a front are there still areas in the us where you feel there may be more room to grow through m a in your rental business also what s your position with respect to expanding internationally thanks for your time mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer from a us perspective it s more about the opportunity than it is the geography we are in almost all geographies in the us and canada but there are still 600 or so independent operators out there and so the opportunity really is more about the location of those independent operators and having a dialogue with them and understanding if we can team up and create long term value together we ll continue to look for those opportunities no matter the geography in the us and canada from an international perspective i would say this we love the us and canadian opportunities we think there are a lot there we will continue to invest heavily in those businesses i think there may be a time in our future where we get into other international geographies it s not our highest priority but i think that s something that we ll keep our eyes on i would say that in our business start ups are pretty difficult and so it would likely be through some sort of m a but it would have to be with the right partner in the right geography and one in which we felt like we could operate successfully operator our next question comes from seth webber with rbc capital markets seth weber rbc capital markets analyst good afternoon thanks for keeping the call going here going back to the capex commentary for a second i think earlier this year you had brought the capex number down a little bit because you had messaged you were able to extract some benefits from the g k business so how should we be thinking about capex going forward is it brick and mortar do you feel like you need more capacity here is there anything you can point to that you ll be spending money on specifically mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer you re absolutely right seth we did get some benefit from the g k acquisition in terms of capacity and it allowed us to delay certainly some capex related to new capacity both in plants and in our routes but we re continuing to grow and continuing to grow well capacity is really a local thing so there are certainly still geographies where there may not have been a g k presence where we re growing well where we need capacity we ll continue to look for or we will have capex related to laundry capacity and routing capacity i would say from a growth perspective most of our capex growth will be in that form laundry facility capacity and routes i e trucks same goes for our first aid and hire businesses as well we are growing very nicely and the growth will come primarily in the way of additional trucks we ll certainly have some maintenance capex too from a growth perspective yes bricks and mortar and trucks operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the conference to mr mike hansen for any closing remarks mike hansen executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you again for joining us tonight we will issue our fourth quarter financial results in july and look forward to speaking with you again at that time thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes today s conference you may now disconnect duration 62

pound sterling exchange rates recoup losses overnight after eu 27 offer plan b if uk pm fails to get her brexit deal through parliament next week the pound to euro exchange rate is 0 48 higher 1 15988 today the pound to us dollar exchange rate is 0 03 lower 1 31263 today overnight overnight the eu has agreed to a new delay to the brexit timetable but doesn t guarantee that the uk won t crash out without a deal and further delays are entirely possible in the words of french president it s now up to the british political system to provide a clear answer the brexit b day has now been delayed until april 12 or a later date of may 22nd if uk pm may can get her deal through parliament next week european council president tusk said until that date all options will remain open and the cliff edge date will be delayed the uk government will still have a choice between a deal no deal a long extension or revoking article 50 with reports suggesting the dup remains opposed to pm may s deal theresa may is unlikely to get her deal through next week advertisement so what happens if pm may loses the vote at this point we would either leave with no deal or put forward an alternative plan she said however there doesn t seem to be any alternative plan so far at least not one that everyone would agree on so as far i can see it s either pass the bill or crash out with no agreement it s hard to see what they can accomplish in two weeks that they haven t been able to accomplish in two years perhaps parliament takes hold of the process somehow and comes up with some alternative but will they be able to get a majority for any of them doubtful needless to say i remain bearish on sterling the history of the eu is filled with miracle compromises at the last minute but this time i don t see how unless parliament simply gives up and decides to hold another referendum or a new election either of which might be sufficient cause for a longer delay but could still wind up with the same intractable problem afterwards anyway sterling s move on this do or die news was fairly muted in my view in fact the currency rebounded somewhat after the eu s decision came out it suggests that people are still looking for some good solution to this problem which i think is highly unlikely i think the uncertainty for britain and the pound starts after brexit takes place and that there s plenty more downside for the currency as i laid out in detail recently the pound isn t weak at all right now on the contrary it s pretty fairly valued that means there s a lot more room for it to become undervalued as the trade account worsens further and capital inflows dry up it was a quiet night in financial markets late thursday and into friday as there was little movement in stocks the

proceeded as usual by the reports for germany at 08 30gmt and france at 08 15gmt german manufacturing was particularly weak last month falling to a six year low of 47 6 although that result was tempered by a firmer services report french services also rebounded having been affected by the yellow vest protests in prior months for eurozone pmi as a whole we have pencilled in a slight rise to 49 5 in march from 49 3 for the manufacturing which would be the first increase in eight months services pmi however is forecast to edge down to 52 5 after last month s unexpectedly strong rise to 52 8 overall the pmis are expected to signal eurozone q1 gdp growth of around 0 2 q q which would match the sluggish q4 outturn but would at least provide evidence that activity may be stabilising an eu

after the eu 27 leaders came up with a plan b in case the eu withdrawal agreement is not passed by the house of commons next week said analysts at lloyds the pound to dollar exchange rate gbp usd was hammered down below 1 31 after the bank of england meeting despite some better than expected retail sales data the pair got some traction later in the day as 1 30 continues to provide some substantial buying support in a report from lloyds analysts at the uk bank make it clear that the boe was more dovish and cautious than markets had seen at the last meeting the mpc displayed little change in urgency to hike likely a reflection of the elevated uncertainty around the uk s future relationship with the eu on top of this the bank stressed that the risks to the global backdrop had also risen since february a message that has been evident in communication from other major central banks recently despite the pound squashing caution in the tone lloyds still believe there is potential for the bank to take a hawkish turn however even if its still reliant on a smooth resolution to brexit nevertheless in the event that the brexit negotiations progress in line with the boe s central view we believe that there is scope for the bank s tone to turn more hawkish in response to developments in the domestic economy however this turn is unlikely to occur until the uk s future relationship with the eu becomes clearer volatility is extremely high in the pound but so far nothing has followed through in any direction with the dollar also facing a potential fed shift this has made cable an extremely difficult play particularly for leveraged funds over the last few trading days latest exchange rates 22 03 2019

green bay voters will decide april 2 if brown county executive troy streckenbach deserves a third four year term or if challenger mark berndt will take over both frame the race as a referendum on streckenbach s record with a key disagreement focused on taxes streckenbach 47 says the 0 5 percent sales tax plan he promoted has made it so the county can pay down debt won t have to borrow to fund roughly 147 million worth of work on roads bridges and buildings and will keep property taxes low he said total property tax collections have increased but individual property tax costs have decreased because of significant residential and business growth during his eight years in office berndt 58 says the growth in the total property tax levy and implementation of the sales tax in 2018 means county residents pay more in total taxes than they should berndt supports the sales tax but says proceeds should go directly to reducing property taxes rather than buildings and roads he claims that factoring in the sales tax the county collects 40 percent more in taxes than it did in 2015 when it had a smaller tax base and no sales tax despite overwhelming approval from the county board the sales tax has drawn some criticism the brown county taxpayers association backed by the conservative wisconsin institute for law and liberty sued in 2018 in an effort to stop the sales tax the county has incurred 225 768 in costs to defend the lawsuit which it has asked a judge to throw out that request will be argued next month streckenbach online troyforwi com berndt online berndtforbrowncounty com how they got here streckenbach a small business owner from allouez has been brown s top elected official since 2011 behind a pledge not to increase property taxes for four years he beat county supervisor andy nicholson by almost 10 000 of the 55 000 votes cast in 2015 he beat challenger tim nowak 25 554 9 887 berndt a financial adviser and recruiting and licensing coordinator from wrightstown served a two year term as a county supervisor in the mid 1990s he ran for the county s district 20 seat in 2018 but fell to jim crawford and eventual winner steve deslauriers in a primary berndt has chaired wrightstown s zoning board of appeals since 2001 here s what the candidates say about their experience their record and the job some answers were lightly edited for clarity and style why are you running for this office streckenbach i ran to strengthen our community by bringing fiscal responsibility to county government along with small business common sense that s what we ve done when i was elected our economy was struggling mountains of debt had accumulated and we faced a 3 5 million structural deficit brown county s economy has grown by more than 3 billion we cut expenses by 9 5 million eliminated more than 53 million in debt and provided the largest tax rate cut in a decade and we are still making 147 million in smart investments in infrastructure i want to keep our county headed in the right direction related county board gives first ok to expo center sales tax plan berndt i got angry with this administration angry with how they refused to even consider the legality of how they were going to spend the sales tax revenue the irresponsible way the executive put the taxpayer at risk of losing state shared revenue by spending millions of taxpayer funds on new projects and have not reduced property tax even after i wrote the executive to hold the funds until the lawsuit was completed continued spending was their only response i m running to bring back responsible county government experience government work and life streckenbach as a lifelong resident of brown county i learned the value of faith family and fiscal responsibility at an early age my mother donna worked extremely hard as a single woman raising four children while running a small business i m proud to say i have followed in her footsteps owning six businesses in brown county over the past 20 years my entrepreneurial spirit and small business background enable me to bring fresh ideas and strong management skills to meet our county s challenges berndt i was a brown county supervisor from 1994 to 1996 and a green bay alderman from 1994 to 1998 i have been the town of wrightstown zoning board of appeals chairman since 2001 i am a finra licensed registered representative and an sec registered financial advisor i am a recruiter and licensing coordinator with a national independent broker dealer kcd financial inc my 18 years in the financial service industry include being a vice president for chase bank mortgage broker licensed banker small business advisor and securities and investment advisor these positions demand ethical handling of funds acting in the clients best interest and transparency berndt s top issues sales tax i support the sales tax it s designed to directly reduce the property tax that s the law instead of taxpayers getting a 21 percent property tax reduction for 2019 this executive decided to use this tax as a new project revenue source this excessive taxation will cause the county to forego wisconsin shared revenue for more than eight years at a running total of over 24 million we collect more than 2 million a month in sales tax revenue reinvestment plan the county s infrastructure investment plan resembles a ponzi scheme by giving the appearance of new revenue where there is none please read wis statute 66 0602 4 on local levy limits sales tax revenue legally must offset property tax so there is no new revenue source for these new projects taxpayers must grant approval to exceed our tax levy limit through a passed referendum prior to allowing the county to spend on new projects i value your opinion and your vote streckenbach either was afraid to ask permission to exceed the limit or didn t value your right to vote on it editor s note a referendum would have required county board approval the board rejected holding a referendum 18 8 brown county the employer the current work environment and culture needs to change employees are fearful of executive reprisals these employees are the frontline workers and they need to be allowed speak when they see something wrong and be able to suggest solutions to improve the services they provide by eliminating obstacles and open communication my past employees have outperformed their goals i believe that i can instill this culture throughout the entire county workforce from management to laborer i have performed both jobs and know the value each can bring through developing trust and open transparent communication streckenbach s top issues financial stability i want to keep our county on solid fiscal ground that s why i am implementing our tax relief debt reduction and infrastructure plan under this plan which includes a temporary sales tax we will cut the county s debt in half and reduce the tax levy excluding new construction by 2024 we ll also address the most pressing needs of our aging community infrastructure especially upgrading our county road system seeing this plan through to fruition requires an experienced leader willing to make tough choices i have shown i am up to that challenge continued economic growth the long term success of our county depends on continuing to grow our economy i want brown county to be the best place in the country to start expand or relocate a business that will result in a larger tax base to help pay for needed public services but most importantly it will lead to family supporting jobs for our children and grandchildren to make this a reality i ll continue to hold the line on taxes and keep our county fiscally stable i ll also work with our municipalities through tif support and prioritizing road projects to accommodate business development stronger workforce attracting and retaining talented workers especially young ones is also my priority i was proud to lead the effort to build the science technology engineering and math center on the uw green bay campus the stem center will house key programs including a new engineering school to provide a pipeline our local employers desperately need we ve also made investments in improving access to high speed internet connections on my watch we ve been able to make the new zoo and adventure park a regional destination and we ve made other investments in family friendly attractions best thing the exec did this term streckenbach i am most proud we have been able to strengthen our county s fiscal standing we had to make some tough choices including reducing county expenses nearly 10 million but because we weren t afraid to try new things we ve eliminated more than 50 million in debt delivered a tax rate cut and still made important investments in aging infrastructure a recent success we had was securing 20 million from the federal government for the vv 29 interchange i traveled to washington d c and spoke with the white house about the project it s a safety issue and a business development opportunity berndt the 900 000 economic development funding for the village of denmark was well developed and will have a positive return on investment for the amount the county spent for diversified new businesses and approximately 80 new jobs this investment should be nine times better for the taxpayer than the rushed through green bay packaging project that cost the county over 8 million for the potential of new jobs brown county needs to continue to look for ways to grow while measuring these opportunities against for the best overall return on taxpayer dollars my background is better suited for this related county to pay 2 9m more than projected for green bay packaging worst thing the exec did this term berndt he put taxpayers in a bad situation he took the tax levy from 80 million to over 92 million a 15 percent increase and within 2 million of our levy ceiling if you include the sales tax he increased our county taxes by a whopping 40 percent in four years we likely will lose state shared revenue of about 3 million a year so we will be at levy limit with 1 million of fewer services troy s motives to grow the county were well intentioned but the execution was disastrous we can t afford four more years of his leadership streckenbach i m certainly far from perfect there was only one perfect person but i take ownership of issues and try to fix what needs improvement while i am proud of all we ve accomplished i am asking for your vote again because i know there is more to be done to keep moving our county forward i ll continue to hold the line on taxes and spending i ll continue to work to grow our economy and i ll do all i can to make brown county the best place to live work

civilians or to be suspended from the grouping the tmc took over after president omar al bashir was ousted on april 11 any suspension of sudan s au membership could affect the tmc s efforts to win

includes one time disposition costs of 3 4 million relating to the salt flat disposition during the fourth quarter of 2018 sales volumes decreased 5 when compared to the third quarter production from the north texas properties increased by 176 boe d due to the third well of the 2018 drilling program starting production production from the canadian properties decreased by 282 boe d primarily due to the disposition of the twining properties at the end of august as well as the selective well shut in process that was initiated in dixonville in response to the low commodity price environment during the fourth quarter of 2018 field netback decreased 44 when compared to the third quarter due to lower production and a 35 decrease in realized prices net of royalties which was consistent with the wti price decrease and the dramatically wider price differentials on canadian oil when compared to the third quarter the negative effect on field netback of lower prices was partially offset by a 31 decrease in operating transportation and marketing expenses in the fourth quarter as eagle raised production from one well in north texas and initiated a selective well shut in program in dixonville for the dixonville properties in canada the realized price in the fourth quarter of 2018 was 26 74 per boe as compared to 52 86 per boe in the fourth quarter of 2017 this 49 quarter over quarter realized price decrease occurred despite an 8 wti price increase and was due to wider canadian oil price differentials for the full year of 2018 the realized price averaged 55 39 per boe as compared to 48 61 per boe for the prior year the wider canadian oil price differentials held this year over year realized price increase to only 14 versus a 31 increase in the wti price during the latter part of the fourth quarter an unprecedented widening in oil price differentials caused a significant decrease in field netbacks in the dixonville area the differential between ca wti and eagle s received price was 58 86 per barrel in december resulting in a december realized oil price of 4 60 per barrel as a result of the low pricing in december eagle proactively initiated a selective well shut in program which reduced workover expenditures this in turn lowered production but resulted in dixonville being cash flow positive at a field level during the fourth quarter of 2018 funds flow from operations decreased 35 from the third quarter of 2018 this was primarily due to 44 lower fourth quarter field netbacks being partially offset by a realized risk management gain of 1 3 million in the fourth quarter loss earnings on a quarterly basis often do not move directionally or by the same amounts as funds flow from operations this is due to items of a non cash nature that factor into the calculation of loss earnings and those that are required to be fair valued at each quarter end fourth quarter 2018 funds flow from operations decreased by 35 from the third quarter of 2018 yet the fourth quarter net income was 214 less than the third quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of a 5 3 million impairment expense realized in the fourth quarter relating to dixonville current assets decreased quarter over quarter due to a lower december revenue forming part of the december accounts receivable balance at year end while september revenue which formed part of the september accounts receivable balance was higher due to stronger september oil prices current liabilities increased in the fourth quarter when compared to the third quarter due to the reclassification of eagle s debt from a non current liability to a current liability advisories non ifrs financial measures statements throughout this news release make reference to the terms field netback which is a non ifrs

ecuador s new economic plan explained ecuador has developed a new economic plan designed to put the country s debt on a firm downward path create jobs protect the poor and most vulnerable and bolster the fight against corruption the plan supported by a us 4 2 billion extended fund facility from the imf along with additional financial support from the international community will give ecuador the boost needed to restore sustainable growth that benefits all ecuadorians in the following interview anna ivanova imf s mission chief for ecuador discusses the details of the economic plan ecuador s economy has been one of the most stable in latin america why did the country decide to come to the imf ecuador has enjoyed a healthy economy supported by the dollarization regime the country uses the us dollar for its currency and high oil prices however oil wealth and dollarization are double edged swords over the past decade ecuador s policies were inconsistent with the dollarization regime wage increases outpaced productivity growth and hurt the country s competitiveness the oil price plunge of 2014 and the subsequent us dollar appreciation exposed the underlying weaknesses of the economy to finance growing fiscal imbalances the previous government resorted to central bank financing public debt doubled over the past five years and international reserves fell to very low levels the current government of ecuador decided to proactively come to the imf for support to tackle underlying economic vulnerabilities restore growth and improve social outcomes what does the new economic plan seek to achieve ecuador has committed to a new economic program that seeks to put public debt firmly on a downward path and supports policies that will help lift growth and boost productivity the program strongly supports the government s prosperity plan and is based on four key pillars fortify the institutional foundations of ecuador s dollarization boost competitiveness and create jobs promote shared prosperity and protect the poor and most vulnerable and improve transparency and strengthen the fight against corruption this is an ambitious reform agenda but these reforms are necessary to strengthen the economy and institutions in ecuador as ecuador is a dollarized economy a strong us dollar can raise the price of ecuador s goods thereby hurting the country s competitiveness in the global market how does the plan address this challenge raising ecuador s competitiveness and raising productivity will require a concerted effort since ecuador uses the us dollar as its currency it is not able to use exchange rates as a tool to make its exports more competitive in the global market therefore the country will have to rely on policies that allow for internal devaluation instead first and foremost reigning in government spending particularly through the optimization of the wage bill will be important to make ecuador s exports more attractive moreover allowing for less rigidity in wages and prices could help support external adjustment this can be achieved through policies that remove rigidities in the labor and product markets and in the financial sector how will the program support jobs and more workers in the formal labor market in addition to what i mentioned other reforms to make the country an attractive business destination and to boost growth and more formal employment include reviewing the system of taxation and removing obstacles to business formation and operation other key reforms include taking steps to encourage private investment deepening the capital markets opening international trade and creating better conditions for participation of women in the labor market how does ecuador fare on social indicators and how will the government protect social spending under the plan ecuador has made substantial gains in reducing poverty over the past two decades since the country adopted dollarization the percentage of the population living below the national poverty line has fallen from 64 4 percent in 2000 to 21 5 percent in 2017 and the share of the population living below us 1 90 a day fell from 28 2 percent in 2000 to 3 6 percent in 2016 while these are notable achievements poverty rates among the rural and indigenous populations remain high while social assistance spending is high by regional standards and there is good coverage of those in the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution the authorities see scope to do more therefore the government included measures in the plan to continue protecting the poor and most vulnerable these include increasing spending on social assistance programs such as bono de desarrollo humano bono joaquin gallegos lara as well as extending the coverage of non contributory pensions developing a social registry to improve targeting of social programs and increasing the efficiency and quality of primary education and health spending to improve outcomes and enhance the quality of the labor force and external competitiveness of the economy as you mentioned one of the key priorities of the new plan is to continue to improve transparency and bolster the fight against corruption why does this matter for the economy the government is committed to promoting transparency and fighting corruption in the country because it impacts all corners of the economy these efforts will help improve running businesses lower public financing costs and support private investment and jobs some key measures include
rep bruce hunter house district 34 at 2 4 percent iowa is now slightly ahead of hawaii for the lowest unemployment rate in the country but all is not roses for iowa s jobs report much of iowa s new jobs is a rising mix of low wage jobs and part time and contract work for all of gov kim reynolds ballyhoo middle class iowans have seen little relief for their wages which have been stagnant for decades while dealing with steadily rising prices what hasn t been stagnant over the years however is iowa s widening income gap when adjusted for inflation the bottom fifth of earners saw practically no growth in household income from 2006 to 2016 a des moines register analysis of census data found the poorest 20 percent saw household incomes inch up from 13 798 to 13 848 in 2016 dollars less than one half of 1 percentage point conversely the top 20 percent of iowa households saw their average income shoot up 12 percent in real terms over the same period increasing from 155 764 to 177 612 for the very richest the top 5 percent of households inflation adjusted household incomes improved by 16 percent from 262 251 in 2006 to 311 070 in 2016 and for women it s even worse iowa women earn 10 637 less than men on average one of the nation s wider gaps in pay according to a recently released analysis iowa may have a low unemployment rate and that is good news but it is more than offset by the wage insecurities suffered by iowans every day there is no greater need for iowa today than to have the security of a living wage that has the possibility to afford a better life for a family there should be no greater priority for the iowa legislature than to set in motion the tools to achieve that security as more and more economic power is concentrated in the hands of a few iowans question whether our economic system will continue to work for them they wonder whether their children will have the opportunity for a better life than they themselves enjoyed at a time in which the economy has grown at a slow but steady pace many families continue to experience economic anxiety iowa needs to put in place a comprehensive plan that lifts individual incomes and creates higher paying jobs there are steps we as a legislature can and should put in place right now to achieve these objectives and put in motion economic security for all iowans these are some of the policies that we can put in place right now to minimize income inequality invest in education high school graduates earn on an average 43 percent more that high school drop outs one of the key factors of new companies moving into an area is the level of education divorce rates are lower as education levels rise crime rates drop drug use lowers and there is less need for social services there is a reason that education should be this legislature s no 1 priority it is what will best serve our children and our state for decades to come education is the starting point for raising the quality of life for all of iowa and yet education has been woefully underfunded for the past nine years this must stop raise the minimum wage a job should be a bridge out of poverty an opportunity to make a living from work an opportunity to bring dignity to one s life but for about 300 000 iowans iowans who work hard play by the rules and do what is right there is no dignity for those people working at or around iowa s minimum wage of only 7 25 an hour there is only poverty but if the minimum wage were increased to 12 per hour with annual cost of living increases about 300 000 iowans would receive an hourly wage increase of the workers who would benefit from the increase 75 percent are adults over the age of 20 58 percent are female 42 percent are full time workers and another 34 percent work between 20 and 34 hours per week 40 percent of minimum wage earners are the sole breadwinner in their families 20 percent are parents to some 94 000 children ensure good public jobs two years ago the republican majority took away the basic civil right for over 183 000 public sector employees to have a voice in their job they did their best to take away the right for those employees to make a living to be able to support their family and have time to be there for them and to form and maintain a union this must be reversed immediately we should also oppose privatization of state county and municipal government jobs our objective must be to keep quality public jobs public while emphasizing efficiency make it easier to join a union today the vast majority of iowans are employed at will this means that an employee may be fired for any reason whatsoever or for no reason at all this stifles an employee s ability to negotiate a fair wage to protect their work safety and stability and to have any kind of voice on their job unions continue to serve the same purpose for which they were originally founded ceo and executive compensation is skyrocketing while the middle class suffers from layoffs unemployment and stagnant wages through negotiations and a continued dialogue with the employer unions work for increased wages raising the standard of living for the working class ensuring safe working conditions increasing benefits for both workers and their families and giving the employee a voice in their profession at the same time iowa is making it more difficult to form and participate in unions employers are trying to shed responsibility for providing health insurance good pension coverage reasonable work hours and job safety protections additionally companies are making workers jobs and incomes less secure through downsizing part timing contracting out and sending jobs off shore as the nature of work changes working people need the collective voice and bargaining power unions provide to keep employers from making the workplace look as it did in the early 19th century strengthen apprenticeship programs iowa has a small union trade apprenticeship program that recognizes the necessity to train workers for skilled vocational jobs and we should expand it apprenticeship prepares workers to master occupational skills and undertake productive work for their employer earn a salary receive training primarily through supervised work based learning and take academic instruction that is related to the apprenticeship occupation we can turn around iowa s anemic growth our economic security will be in good hands when all iowans have a chance to earn better wages and keep more of what they earn spend that money in their community s economy and be part of a growing vibrant economy as a result this is just a start but it is a start we as a legislature need to do more than just provide rhetoric that will sound good for the next election what we need to do is take the steps that will actually change the way iowa works and earn back the trust of working middle class families who have come to believe our hearts are elsewhere only then will we have a state that works for all men and women who call iowa home

this time is different these are the four most expensive words in investing that s because whatever seemingly unique situation we re going through is not all that different from what the economy and markets have already experienced in other words most secular trends are just cyclical things that are way above or below the long term trend eventually revert to the mean related stories but really isn t this time different we ve never had anyone like trump before surely brexit is a once in a lifetime disruption and how often do we see the world s biggest trading nations fighting like children our firm is driven by bottom up research company by company rather than macro analysis but we keep a live dashboard of issues that could impact our clients returns going forward valuation is at the core of it but we also monitor a range of cyclical and secular trends i recently talked about two of the most important ones in client presentations across the country surprising to some i didn t focus on trump brexit and trade policy announcements and tweets on these issues still cause markets to jump and they certainly have the potential to impact economic and profit growth but in my view they ve moved into the not different category we will muddle through each of them and their negative impact is waning rather my presentation highlighted two forces that are often overlooked by investors and yet arguably will have a bigger impact on returns debt fatigue we have been living in an over stimulated economy for many years now despite experiencing one of the longest growth cycles in history governments continue to run recession like deficits and our data driven central banks have kept interest rates at levels normally reserved for an economic crisis in a decade of record auto sales rising real estate prices overbooked restaurants and three or four new smartphones per person we continued to binge on debt massive monetary and fiscal stimulation were needed to get us through the debt crisis ten years ago but we got hooked last week it was reported that consumer debt as a percentage of disposable income hit a new high in canada and governments in toronto ottawa and washington continue to run large deficits the world carries a heavier debt load today relative to incomes and size of economy than it did before the 2007 08 debt crisis this factor is flashing on my dashboard because it can t go on indefinitely at some point the pace of debt growth must slow or reverse and with it will come less economic activity and a dramatically different attitude toward consumption and investing expanding middle class while we live in our debt laden cocoon in western countries however we need to remember that there s a big dynamic world out there indeed a vast majority of the 7 5 billion people on the planet live in regions that are growing and more importantly the middle class in india china and other parts of asia is expanding rapidly according to consensus economics 12 per cent of india s population was middle class in 2017 by 2030 the percentage is expected to be close to 80 per cent think about it there will be an additional 350 500 million people in india alone who might buy an appliance subscribe to a streaming service or take a vacation even if the number is 50 to 60 per cent the potential is incredible for global sellers of products and services mysterious markets in recent years many investors have been surprised that stock markets went higher in the face of a chaotic political landscape these two macro trends go a long way to explaining why cheap and plentiful credit pulled future consumption forward to present day and importantly encouraged risk taking in the capital and real estate markets meanwhile countries outside of the western world provided an extra shot of growth one of these trends is likely to come to a jolting end the debt cycle won t be different this time it will end with higher defaults and more restrictive credit policies the other a steady shift of economic power from the west to the east is a more sustainable trend indeed the growing middle class is going to become an even bigger force going forward by tom bradley tom bradley is president of steadyhand investment funds a company that offers individual investors low fee investment funds and clear cut advice he can be reached at copyright postmedia network inc 2019
italian prime minister giuseppe conte signed up his country saturday to china s belt and road initiative bri an ambitious trillion dollar transcontinental trade and infrastructure project the memorandum signing in rome was the centerpiece of chinese president xi jinping s three stop visit to europe and it will make italy the first g 7 nation to participate in china s so called new silk road italy s endorsement of the bri which spans eurasia as well as the middle east and parts of africa has prompted the disquiet not only of the united states but also of european union leaders who have voiced concern about beijing s growing political clout in europe and its use of commerce as a tool of statecraft the u s has been critical of the trillion dollar project and warned about the risks of debt trap diplomacy members of the eu are worried the plan could add to fissures in an already strained coalition they aren t alone in worrying about what the longer term consequences on italy might be if signing up for bri moves from symbolism into full participation matteo salvini head of the populist lega party which represents one half of italy s coalition government is indicating his opposition by staying away from the signing ceremony and won t be present at a scheduled gala dinner afterward salvini an ideological bedfellow of donald trump and friend of the u s president s former adviser steve bannon frets the bri risks turning italy into a chinese colony and will saddle it with more debt he also has publicly indicated his security concerns about allowing the chinese control of critical infrastructure including major ports before allowing someone to invest in the ports of trieste or genoa i would think about it not once but a hundred times salvini said earlier this month some italian officials in the economy and finance ministry have also offered behind the scenes warnings they argue that while engaging with beijing in this manner may help boost italian exports to china a prospect highlighted by xi in marketing bri it will likely result in a bigger boost for cheap chinese exports to italy such a scenario they caution could have a ruinous impact on domestic italian producers and workers if trade does take off significantly it might be a matter of short term gain but long term pain one official told voa despite the warnings as well as u s and eu disapproval of italy s bri endorsement conte and luigi di maio leader of the anti establishment five star movement which makes up half of the country s populist coalition government says chinese investment could kick start italy s sputtering economy several of the eu s smaller cash strapped nations have also signed up in the past two years to china s bri hoping that by doing so their economies will be boosted italy slipped into recession last year and its debt levels are among the highest in europe the populist coalition government came to power in june 2018 with high spending plans promising expensive pension reforms and a living wage for all italians italian ministers favoring bri accuse other large eu countries including france which is critical of the bri of hypocrisy saying they conduct multi million dollar deals anyway with china albeit outside the framework of the new silk road initiative the way we see it it is an opportunity for our companies to take the opportunity of china s growing importance in the world italy s under secretary of state for trade and investment michele geraci told foreign reporters but some italian officials worry that view might be short sighted they say while the bri may offer italy new funding sources the country is still lagging well behind the foreign investment levels it enjoyed before the 2008 global financial crash it could trigger a significant wave of chinese imports which would have long term detrimental consequences for italian industry employment and politics the officials in the country s finance ministry who declined to be identified for this article have been scrutinizing recent academic studies on the impact of chinese imports on local labor markets a series of studies including those by economists david autor david dorn and gordon hanson suggests that western countries and regions exposed to rising chinese import competition see a major jump in unemployment lower labor force participation and lower wages unskilled and manual workers are especially adversely affected the impacts are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow with wages and labor force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the china trade shock commences exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income noted autor dorn and hanson in a paper for the national bureau of economic research an influential u s based nonprofit other recent academic studies have noted that the regions of the u s and europe most impacted by trade with china are the ones which in recent elections and plebiscites have backed populist candidates and nationalist causes like brexit support fueled by anger at the effects of globalization brexit is britain s decision to leave the european union ironically looking to beijing for an economic boost and to alleviate economic deprivation could well hurt the workers and businesses who backed populists in the first place and who the populists want to help salvini gets that but the rest of the coalition doesn t observed an italian official

this time is different these are the four most expensive words in investing that s because whatever seemingly unique situation we re going through is not all that different from what the economy and markets have already experienced in other words most secular trends are just cyclical things that are way above or below the long term trend eventually revert to the mean related stories but really isn t this time different we ve never had anyone like trump before surely brexit is a once in a lifetime disruption and how often do we see the world s biggest trading nations fighting like children our firm is driven by bottom up research company by company rather than macro analysis but we keep a live dashboard of issues that could impact our clients returns going forward valuation is at the core of it but we also monitor a range of cyclical and secular trends i recently talked about two of the most important ones in client presentations across the country surprising to some i didn t focus on trump brexit and trade policy announcements and tweets on these issues still cause markets to jump and they certainly have the potential to impact economic and profit growth but in my view they ve moved into the not different category we will muddle through each of them and their negative impact is waning rather my presentation highlighted two forces that are often overlooked by investors and yet arguably will have a bigger impact on returns debt fatigue we have been living in an over stimulated economy for many years now despite experiencing one of the longest growth cycles in history governments continue to run recession like deficits and our data driven central banks have kept interest rates at levels normally reserved for an economic crisis in a decade of record auto sales rising real estate prices overbooked restaurants and three or four new smartphones per person we continued to binge on debt massive monetary and fiscal stimulation were needed to get us through the debt crisis ten years ago but we got hooked last week it was reported that consumer debt as a percentage of disposable income hit a new high in canada and governments in toronto ottawa and washington continue to run large deficits the world carries a heavier debt load today relative to incomes and size of economy than it did before the 2007 08 debt crisis this factor is flashing on my dashboard because it can t go on indefinitely at some point the pace of debt growth must slow or reverse and with it will come less economic activity and a dramatically different attitude toward consumption and investing expanding middle class while we live in our debt laden cocoon in western countries however we need to remember that there s a big dynamic world out there indeed a vast majority of the 7 5 billion people on the planet live in regions that are growing and more importantly the middle class in india china and other parts of asia is expanding rapidly according to consensus economics 12 per cent of india s population was middle class in 2017 by 2030 the percentage is expected to be close to 80 per cent think about it there will be an additional 350 500 million people in india alone who might buy an appliance subscribe to a streaming service or take a vacation even if the number is 50 to 60 per cent the potential is incredible for global sellers of products and services mysterious markets in recent years many investors have been surprised that stock markets went higher in the face of a chaotic political landscape these two macro trends go a long way to explaining why cheap and plentiful credit pulled future consumption forward to present day and importantly encouraged risk taking in the capital and real estate markets meanwhile countries outside of the western world provided an extra shot of growth one of these trends is likely to come to a jolting end the debt cycle won t be different this time it will end with higher defaults and more restrictive credit policies the other a steady shift of economic power from the west to the east is a more sustainable trend indeed the growing middle class is going to become an even bigger force going forward by tom bradley tom bradley is president of steadyhand investment funds a company that offers individual investors low fee investment funds and clear cut advice he can be reached at copyright postmedia network inc 2019
commentary china s largest news portal sina com recently made this statement in a headline in its financial section for americans blockchain is a technology or a philosophical practice but for chinese blockchain is an opportunity for china to change lanes and surpass competitors undoubtedly the united states is still in the leading position in blockchain technology however in terms of commercial application it is still at the discussion stage in the united states most u s blockchain experts have no idea that the chinese communist party ccp has already highlighted the importance of blockchain development and application to such a level that it is treated as part of the national strategy and as a key step in the future battle between china and the united states for leadership position in the international arena the ccp s ultimate vision in the blockchain development and applications is to create an international government that is the so called community of common destiny for mankind powerful enough to influence every corner of the world the near term goal is to establish a digital currency system to compete with and eventually replace the dollar trading system directly targeting the global financial dominance of the united states blockchain technology jeopardizes the us dollar system a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography each block contains typically a hash pointer as a link to a previous block a timestamp and transaction data the national interest magazine published an article on aug 24 2018 warning that u s technological and financial dominance is at stake as china and russia seek to develop blockchain technology a blockchain is a continuously growing list of records called blocks which are linked and secured using cryptography each block contains typically a hash pointer as a link to a previous block a timestamp and transaction data by design blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data and the data are recorded in a verifiable and permanent way satoshi nakamoto was the first person to propose the concept of blockchain in the 2008 bitcoin white paper and created bitcoin the first type of cryptocurrency later blockchain technology was used to create more cryptocurrencies and was gradually applied to other areas the blockchain based cryptocurrency is characterized by decentralization that is a financial system that doesn t rely on a centralized regulatory system there are many different types of cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges can be found in many countries presently the dollar is still the world s universal currency and half of all global trade is denominated dollars dominating global finance the united states can not only obtain information on financial transactions monitor the flow of funds to terrorist organizations or rogue states but also use the dollar system to impose financial sanctions with ease on foreign companies or countries that violate certain regulations however the dollar trading system especially international remittances requires a dedicated network of banks which is not only time consuming but also involves high processing fees the global peer to peer cryptocurrency based payment network can make up for these shortcomings at present as cryptocurrency has some potential problems such as cybersecurity risks and being exploited by criminals it has not been universally recognized and accepted by the mainstream moreover no single private cryptocurrency can challenge the powerful and well established dollar system however if a totalitarian regime with a large economy comes up with a plan to improve cryptocurrencies and works with a number of other countries to establish a cryptocurrency trading system it will be a completely different story at present alipay a subsidiary of china s internet giant alibaba has successfully used blockchain technology to create a new international remittance system outside the banking network enabling fast secure and convenient remittance via mobile phones or computers alibaba is pushing the alipay business globally through overseas mergers acquisitions and business cooperation including the one belt one road obor initiative which is regarded by the ccp as its largest core project in the 21st century as early as 10 years ago zhou xiaochuan then governor of people s bank of china published an article on march 23 2009 on its website proposing to create an international reserve currency the so called super sovereign currency that is decoupled from any sovereign country it s clear that the ccp had the ambition to challenge the status of the dollar and zhou s proposal had attracted a lot of attention from the international society now it has become a serious threat as the ccp lays out a blockchain strategy in china and abroad the ccp s global blockchain strategy according to china s national intellectual property administration of china cnipa the number of chinese patent applications in 2018 was 1 4 million an increase of 11 6 percent over the previous year however the segment of invention patents in blockchain technology continued to maintain an exponential growth trend increasing by 115 6 percent year over year to 2 913 applications and more than 100 times that of four years ago among the companies with the largest number of applications in blockchain technology in 2018 were china unicom alibaba tencent baidu and jd com some of these companies have also applied for multiple patents at the world intellectual property organization wipo moreover several of them had never applied for blockchain patents until 2018 in contrast in all other countries and regions the total number of blockchain patent applications in 2018 is lower than in 2017 obviously behind the huge increase in blockchain patent applications in china is the strong support from the chinese authorities the development of blockchain technology has long been part of the ccp s development strategy with the ccp s funding and policy support various official organizations have been established to promote the development of blockchain many industry giants have joined the effort and a large number of blockchain start up companies have also come on stage according to data released by the news website supchina in august 2018 from january 2016 to august 2018 the total investment in the blockchain development from various local governments in china reached approximately 3 6 billion among them starting in april 2018 the xiong an global blockchain innovation fund supported by the chinese government provided 1 6 billion to china s blockchain startups the sub institutions of the central bank of china also launched a blockchain registry open platform brop hoping to hire more blockchain experts it must be noted that government sponsored development of blockchain in china clearly doesn t include private cryptocurrencies since 2017 the ccp has banned the sale of cryptocurrencies and the restrictions on domestic cryptocurrency activities have become more and more stringent in april 2018 russian news agency sputnik quoted zhang hua co founder of the daex blockchain group limited as saying that china s central bank is developing china s own digital currency the encrypted renminbi and therefore does not allow any other cryptocurrency to circulate in the country as early as january 2017 the central bank of china officially established the digital currency research institute recognizing the inevitability of the emergence of digital currency and the possibility that it will eventually replace paper currency since then the central bank has published a series of feasibility reports on state issued digital currency in 2018 sina com had a special column in its finance section that claimed that china s central bank had already formed a comprehensive chain structure and was trying to solve the final technical challenge of currency digitization if we pay attention to the development priorities announced by the chinese authorities every time we will find that the blockchain and cryptocurrency are always included in the priority list in recent years it is even more so for china s financial institutions which claimed that cryptocurrency was the top priority in 2018 however such research is obviously limited to serving the chinese authorities rather than developing decentralized private cryptocurrencies the core of the communist totalitarian system is the never ending pursuit to strengthen social control it is only natural that the ccp doesn t welcome any private cryptocurrency free from the control of the central government instead replacing paper currency with the state issued digital currency developed by the government is what the chinese authorities are happy to see as it can take back the only degree of freedom left in private cash transactions and fully grasp and monitor all the capital flows in the entire society this is what the ccp has always dreamed of in october 2018 danny deng chairman of china s blockchain company tai cloud corp mentioned in a public speech that the future megatrend is the issuance of cryptocurrency by the state replacement of the interbank foreign exchange market with cryptocurrency transactions between countries and establishment of a huge global super liquid market tai cloud has been approved and is strongly supported by the chinese government it is the leading company in china responsible for promoting the research and popularization of blockchain deng participated in the davos forum as the head of china s blockchain delegation in 2019 in order to build this new global financial system the ccp is promoting a blockchain financial system through the obor strategy to countries along the route in doing so the ccp is testing the system and at the same time laying the foundation to challenge the dollar system in the future in september 2016 at a discussion forum at beijing university titled blockchain and digital currency deng pointed out that blockchain will usher in greater opportunities in the obor initiative he specifically mentioned that most of the obor projects are in developing countries in asia africa and latin america where financial foundation is relatively weak which provides a good opportunity for the introduction of china s blockchain technology in fact in 2016 the same year when deng delivered this speech tunisia in north africa and seghar in west africa issued digital currency becoming pioneer countries in the issuance of digital currency both countries have joined the obor the mediterranean island of malta which has adopted a very loose policy on cryptocurrency has become the center of cryptocurrency transactions in the world malta is also an obor country deng didn t care to hide his goal in developing blockchain technology using blockchain technology can give the u s hegemony a heavy blow he once said kazakhstan a central asian country is the gateway to the west in the obor economic circle tai cloud also intends to popularize the blockchain financial system in kazakhstan and establish a national digital currency trading platform in order to achieve this goal deng personally went to astana the capital city of kazakhstan and spoke about the achievements he made during his kazakhstan trip in an interview with japan s nhk tv the kazakh oil exporters who hate to be affected by the fluctuation of the dollar are very interested in the vision depicted by deng and actively seek to cooperate with tai cloud the ccp s intense development of the blockchain financial system has alarmed the u s government steve yalik intelligence analyst at the u s department of defense told nhk tv that once the chinese government establishes and dominates a financial system independent of the dollar it will formulate its own blockchain standards and incorporate companies and countries into its own economic circle it will be an awful situation because it will be a china driven structure in which all the rules are set by china blockchain and community of common destiny the ccp has vigorously developed blockchain technology as part of its development strategy not only for the establishment of a financial system that challenges the dollar system but also for many other applications involving all aspects of social life in june 2018 the national center for mathematics and interdisciplinary sciences chinese academy of sciences and tai cloud jointly announced the establishment of the big data and blockchain laboratory on jan 12 2019 the 2019 work conference of china group companies association cgca blockchain submeeting was held in beijing zhang muhan assistant to the cgca president claimed the blockchain submeeting was meant to respond to the national strategy call provide blockchain enterprises with policy information and the latest development of blockchain technology promote resource sharing and collaboration among members and facilitate the integration of new technologies such as big data artificial intelligence and blockchain deng announced at the meeting that he planned to cooperate with the ministry of public security to develop an identity chain and at the same time promote the development of electronic contract filing tai cloud also officially announced that the company s shared passport developed through blockchain technology combines trusted identity verification with a comprehensive application platform it is noteworthy that the technology had already been adopted by the chinese authorities and it s the id card system of the ministry of public security that connects with the tai cloud passport to use this technology and provide id authentication in october 2018 deng delivered a public speech titled why blockchain will change the world he claimed that the widespread use of blockchain technology could greatly enhance the development of artificial intelligence big data internet of things patents storage and computing and even gene editing it has the potential to become the largest global business and social infrastructure ever creating a 24 hour global digital government digital medical education and other social and management systems in his speech deng also mentioned digital citizenship and digital identity as well as the relatively sensitive technology of genetic passport created through dna sequencing deng concluded at the end of his speech that the development of blockchain technology will make it possible to create a so called community of common destiny the concept of community of common destiny first appeared in the ccp s 18th national congress in 2012 it became one of the keywords in the 19th national congress in 2017 what is its specific connotation different countries seem to have different understandings regardless the core idea of the community of common destiny is the same that is the future world will have a new political order a new economic order and a new technical system including the corresponding judicial system and ideology system and the country at the center of this system will be communist china behind the community of common destiny there is always the shadow of the communist totalitarianism and its ultimate goal a world government this isn t just a pretty soap bubble that the ccp touted to put powder on its face in fact the ccp is already building the prototype of this community of common destiny that is the obor in august 2017 chinese state run media xinhua published an interview with an obvious title the ultimate goal of the belt and road initiative building a community of common destiny for the ccp catching up with surpassing and replacing the united states is a never changing strategy for decades in the fields of 5g new energy sources artificial intelligence biotechnology and big data the ccp is determined to and has already become the most powerful opponent of the united states blockchain and cryptocurrency are just another powerful tool in the wave of high tech development that the ccp relies on to surpass competitors at the curve by using blockchain technology to replace the dollar system perhaps someday in the future china and the united states will exchange positions this is no doubt an irresistible temptation for the ccp li jie is a reporter for ntd part of the epoch media group
rome italian prime minister giuseppe conte will sign up his country saturday to china s belt and road initiative bri an ambitious trillion dollar transcontinental trade and infrastructure project the memorandum signing in rome is the centerpiece of chinese president xi jinping s three stop visit to europe and it will make italy the first g 7 nation to participate in china s so called new silk road italy s endorsement of the bri which spans eurasia as well as the middle east and parts of africa has prompted the disquiet not only of the united states but also of european union leaders who have voiced concern about beijing s growing political clout in europe and its use of commerce as a tool of statecraft the u s has been critical of the trillion dollar project and warned about the risks of debt trap diplomacy members of the eu are worried the plan could add to fissures in an already strained coalition they aren t alone in worrying about what the longer term consequences on italy might be if signing up for bri moves from symbolism into full participation matteo salvini head of the populist lega party which represents one half of italy s coalition government is indicating his opposition by staying away from the signing ceremony and won t be present at a scheduled gala dinner afterward salvini an ideological bedfellow of donald trump and friend of the u s president s former adviser steve bannon frets the bri risks turning italy into a chinese colony and will saddle it with more debt he also has publicly indicated his security concerns about allowing the chinese control of critical infrastructure including major ports before allowing someone to invest in the ports of trieste or genoa i would think about it not once but a hundred times salvini said earlier this month some italian officials in the economy and finance ministry have also offered behind the scenes warnings they argue that while engaging with beijing in this manner may help boost italian exports to china a prospect highlighted by xi in marketing bri it will likely result in a bigger boost for cheap chinese exports to italy such a scenario they caution could have a ruinous impact on domestic italian producers and workers if trade does take off significantly it might be a matter of short term gain but long term pain one official told voa despite the warnings as well as u s and eu disapproval of italy s bri endorsement conte and luigi di maio leader of the anti establishment five star movement which makes up half of the country s populist coalition government says chinese investment could kick start italy s sputtering economy several of the eu s smaller cash strapped nations have also signed up in the past two years to china s bri hoping that by doing so their economies will be boosted italy slipped into recession last year and its debt levels are among the highest in europe the populist coalition government came to power in june 2018 with high spending plans promising expensive pension reforms and a living wage for all italians italian ministers favoring bri accuse other large eu countries including france which is critical of the bri of hypocrisy saying they conduct multi million dollar deals anyway with china albeit outside the framework of the new silk road initiative the way we see it it is an opportunity for our companies to take the opportunity of china s growing importance in the world italy s under secretary of state for trade and investment michele geraci told foreign reporters but some italian officials worry that view might be short sighted they say while the bri may offer italy new funding sources the country is still lagging well behind the foreign investment levels it enjoyed before the 2008 global financial crash it could trigger a significant wave of chinese imports which would have long term detrimental consequences for italian industry employment and politics the officials in the country s finance ministry who declined to be identified for this article have been scrutinizing recent academic studies on the impact of chinese imports on local labor markets a series of studies including those by economists david autor david dorn and gordon hanson suggests that western countries and regions exposed to rising chinese import competition see a major jump in unemployment lower labor force participation and lower wages unskilled and manual workers are especially adversely affected the impacts are most visible in the local labor markets in which the industries exposed to foreign competition are concentrated adjustment in local labor markets is remarkably slow with wages and labor force participation rates remaining depressed and unemployment rates remaining elevated for at least a full decade after the china trade shock commences exposed workers experience greater job churning and reduced lifetime income noted autor dorn and hanson in a paper for the national bureau of economic research an influential u s based nonprofit other recent academic studies have noted that the regions of the u s and europe most impacted by trade with china are the ones which in recent elections and plebiscites have backed populist candidates and nationalist causes like brexit support fueled by anger at the effects of globalization brexit is britain s decision to leave the european union ironically looking to beijing for an economic boost and to alleviate economic deprivation could well hurt the workers and businesses who backed populists in the first place and who the populists want to help salvini gets that but the rest of the coalition doesn t observed an italian official
by dennis miller while politicos like to call tax cuts trickle down economics the real culprit is socialism the robin hood theory of steal from the rich and give to the poor sounds noble however in practice it doesn t work that way the political class tax and spend for their benefit first then some may trickle down to the masses margaret thatcher sums up the problem well citizens gladly take government benefits as long as someone else pays for them while politicians of all flavors are happy to oblige the american people will never knowingly adopt socialism but under the name of liberalism they will adopt every fragment of the socialist program until one day america will be a socialist nation without knowing how it happened i no longer need to run as a presidential candidate for the socialist party norman mattoon thomas 1884 1968 six time presidential candidate for the socialist party of america politicos buying votes with tax dollars offer give away programs to the citizens and politically connected only after protecting themselves and millions of government employees high salaries generous health care family leave and pension benefits garner votes and significant campaign contributions from government workers with each election creative politicos invent new and creative ways to grow and maintain their power spending our tax dollars if tax revenues can t cover the costs

states were slow to react continuing with unrealistic funding projections we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us modern day trickle down socialism has several components confiscate wealth from the working class government is first in line grabbing the major portion for themselves take care of those politically connected who help you stay in power trickle down some of the remainder to the citizens never trickle down too much political power depends on a permanent underclass if you run short of money blame the rich and call them greedy citizens are moving out our article if socialism is so good why are people moving away outlines the exodus from the three high tax states citizens see the states scrambling raising taxes and the cost of government services to cover the costs of political promises made to government employees not for the benefit of ordinary workers many seniors are voting with their feet hoping to see their nest egg last in less expensive areas of the country the hidden agenda i was recently asked why are these states promoting sanctuary cities and illegal immigration they are recruiting people who want to live off the welfare system while putting citizens at risk by harboring criminals wouldn t they be better off reducing welfare and encouraging workers and companies to move there difficult questions and difficult answers a looming showdown the obama administration discontinued the long form census questionnaire that asked a citizenship question when the trump administration added back the citizenship question for the 2020 census all hell broke loose the new york times reports supreme court to hear case on census citizenship question critics say that adding the question on citizenship would undermine the accuracy of the census because both legal and unauthorized immigrants might refuse to fill out the forms by one government estimate about 6 5 million people might decide not to participate breitbart explains why the socialist states are battling the question democrats understand that the revised 2010 u s census questionnaire which did not ask about interviewee s citizenship under the penalty of perjury encouraged many of california s approximately 2 35 million illegal aliens and 1 65 million legal aliens to participate improperly in the u s census california is ranked as the 1 recipient for total u s federal spending with 343 7 billion in receipts in 2013 for every dollar that california residents paid in federal taxes the state received 1 18 in federal spending it s all about grabbing other people s money while maintaining a permanent government dependent underclass the new york times nyt article a census question that could change how power is divided in america outlines the battle is this person a citizen the answer could mean less representation for populous states and big cities the question could generate the data necessary to redefine how political power is apportioned in america the census determines each state s membership in the house of representatives their electoral votes and allocation of federal tax dollars the high tax states are doing all they can to grab as much federal money as possible even if it means spending more welfare dollars and putting their citizens at personal risk california 53 illinois 18 and new york 27 represent 22 5 of the total membership in the house of representatives the nyt article tells us if 15 percent of noncitizens went uncounted that would be enough to cost california and new york one congressional seat each to the benefit of colorado and montana if we can remove all noncitizens from state population totals and reapportion congress a more drastic move that would require a constitutional amendment this would cost california four seats will the bankrupt states have enough political power to require the rest of america to bail out their lavish government pension plans if so expect the reckless process to continue at the expense of the middle class my wife jo and oldest son were headed out and i asked her to buy a lottery ticket my son raised his eyebrows i said i m willing to spend a couple dollars if we ever won several generations of our family would be set for life he thought for a second and said yeah if they move out of the country boy i hope it never comes to that a personal note i prefer to avoid political issues however when i see the political class regardless of party moving the country in the direction where our life savings and standard of living are the target i feel i must warn

president donald trump has asked the former economic advisor to his campaign economist and writer stephen moore if he would accept a nomination to the board of governors of the federal reserve there are two openings on the board and moore would fill one of them moore s resume is imressive a graduate of george mason university with a degree in economics moore spent 10 years as a fellow at the libertarian think tank cato institute he founded and served as president of the club for growth resigning from the group in 2004 he was on the editorial board of the wall street journal and then took a position with the heritage foundation as its chief economist he now serves the heritage foundation as a distinguished visiting fellow these positions have given him the opportunity to write frequently for the journal as well as the washington times the weekly standard and national review he has not been kind to the fed when given a chance to write about its recent policy decisions the day that the fed raised interest rates last december moore let fly in an interview with the gateway pundit he unloaded on the fed s board of governors chaired by jerome powell in one of the most remarkable abbott and costello routines in modern times the economic wizards at the fed again raised interest rates on tuesday their cracker jack logic for doing so is to steer america on a course toward recession so they have the tools in hand to end the recession that they themselves created can anyone tell us who s on first worse this fed move doubles down on its blunderous interest rate rise in september president trump turned out to be exactly right the central bank s pull back on money would slow growth and crush the stock market in order to combat nonexistent inflation the fed s policies of raising interest to fight the spectre of incipient inflation and continuing to offload some of its vast holdings of government securities served as a double whammy on trump s economy moore explained the fed had already reduced the monetary thrust that it provides to the economy eight times since december 15 2015 by raising its fed funds interest rate from 0 25 to 2 25 each time the fed claimed that it needed to guard our economic airliner from inflationary overheating as if its job is to prevent too many people from working and making sure that pay checks aren t rising too quickly unfortunately if you cut engine power too far on a jetliner it will stall and drop out of the sky the dow jones industrial average dropped more than 4 000 points as the economy s oxygen hose was being stepped on by the fed s policies led by its chairman chairman powell has been entirely tone deaf to the financial markets he seeks to protect since its peak on october 3 the dow has fallen by more than 3 500 points market fears about his bad judgment have cut the value of all u s stocks by about 4 5 trillion which is enough to buy 16 000 boeing 787 dreamliners moore doubled down two weeks ago while being interviewed at the cats roundtable on 970 radio in new york i m a big believer that the federal reserve is probably the most responsible for the slowdown of the economy in the first quarter we saw how they wrecked the economy before christmas when the stock market fell like 4 000 points and we are still feeling the residual effect of a very very tight money system if you have a booming economy you have to provide the dollar liquidity that will let the economy grow it s like providing the oxygen for the economy and the fed isn t doing that last wednesday moore had another chance to take down the fed over its policies this time in an article published by the wall street journal after touting the trump economy and its success in putting people back to work and raising economic growth to 3 1 over the past four quarters the best performance since 2005 moore excoriated the fed for getting in its way the last major obstacle to staying on this path is the deflationary policy of the federal reserve it s hard to see what the fed didn t like about this economic picture what problem were they trying to solve moore made it clear that the stock market selloff had nothing to do with weakness in the economy it was all the fed s doing he said adding when the fed finally admitted its money tightening mistakes in late december and announced it would forgo its planned rate increases the deflation stopped and the stock market largely recovered in tandem with commodity prices but the damage was done we estimate that the fed s deflation has already chopped 1 to 1 5 percentage points off real growth over the past six months optimists are hopeful that once confirmed moore will add a voice of reason to the conversation that takes place around the table of the board of governors realists are more inclined to suggest his voice will be muted by other voices seeking a more active role for the fed in managing the economy cynics are likely to suggest that the best way to silence one of your sharpest critics is to invite him to join your posse and then assimilate him they are afraid that once moore is confirmed and takes his place at the table no one will be hearing much from him about the fed s manipulations and machinations that are intentionally and deliberately slowing trump s economic miracle image amedved via istock getty images plus an ivy league graduate

this time is different these are the four most expensive words in investing that s because whatever seemingly unique situation we re going through is not all that different from what the economy and markets have already experienced in other words most secular trends are just cyclical things that are way above or below the long term trend eventually revert to the mean related stories but really isn t this time different we ve never had anyone like trump before surely brexit is a once in a lifetime disruption and how often do we see the world s biggest trading nations fighting like children our firm is driven by bottom up research company by company rather than macro analysis but we keep a live dashboard of issues that could impact our clients returns going forward valuation is at the core of it but we also monitor a range of cyclical and secular trends i recently talked about two of the most important ones in client presentations across the country surprising to some i didn t focus on trump brexit and trade policy announcements and tweets on these issues still cause markets to jump and they certainly have the potential to impact economic and profit growth but in my view they ve moved into the not different category we will muddle through each of them and their negative impact is waning rather my presentation highlighted two forces that are often overlooked by investors and yet arguably will have a bigger impact on returns debt fatigue we have been living in an over stimulated economy for many years now despite experiencing one of the longest growth cycles in history governments continue to run recession like deficits and our data driven central banks have kept interest rates at levels normally reserved for an economic crisis in a decade of record auto sales rising real estate prices overbooked restaurants and three or four new smartphones per person we continued to binge on debt massive monetary and fiscal stimulation were needed to get us through the debt crisis ten years ago but we got hooked last week it was reported that consumer debt as a percentage of disposable income hit a new high in canada and governments in toronto ottawa and washington continue to run large deficits the world carries a heavier debt load today relative to incomes and size of economy than it did before the 2007 08 debt crisis this factor is flashing on my dashboard because it can t go on indefinitely at some point the pace of debt growth must slow or reverse and with it will come less economic activity and a dramatically different attitude toward consumption and investing expanding middle class while we live in our debt laden cocoon in western countries however we need to remember that there s a big dynamic world out there indeed a vast majority of the 7 5 billion people on the planet live in regions that are growing and more importantly the middle class in india china and other parts of asia is expanding rapidly according to consensus economics 12 per cent of india s population was middle class in 2017 by 2030 the percentage is expected to be close to 80 per cent think about it there will be an additional 350 500 million people in india alone who might buy an appliance subscribe to a streaming service or take a vacation even if the number is 50 to 60 per cent the potential is incredible for global sellers of products and services mysterious markets in recent years many investors have been surprised that stock markets went higher in the face of a chaotic political landscape these two macro trends go a long way to explaining why cheap and plentiful credit pulled future consumption forward to present day and importantly encouraged risk taking in the capital and real estate markets meanwhile countries outside of the western world provided an extra shot of growth one of these trends is likely to come to a jolting end the debt cycle won t be different this time it will end with higher defaults and more restrictive credit policies the other a steady shift of economic power from the west to the east is a more sustainable trend indeed the growing middle class is going to become an even bigger force going forward by tom bradley tom bradley is president of steadyhand investment funds a company that offers individual investors low fee investment funds and clear cut advice he can be reached at copyright postmedia network inc 2019
