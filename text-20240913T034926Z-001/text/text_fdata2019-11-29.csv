artikel new articles b h unhcr about the crisis in yementhe humanitarian crisis in yemen remains the worst in the world nearly four years of conflict has forced more than 4 3 million people to leave their homes and an estimated 80 percent of the population 24 million people are in dire need of humanitarian assistance since violence broke out in early 2015 conditions in yemen already one of the poorest countries in the middle east have rapidly deteriorated driving the country to the brink of widespread famine and economic collapse extreme shortages of food safe water sanitation and healthcare as well as deadly massive outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria have taken a heavy toll on civilian lives and have deprived families of basic needs despite the backdrop of violence conditions in the surrounding region are so poor that more than 300 000 refugees and asylum seekers have sought refuge in yemen fleeing violence and persecution in somalia and ethiopia am wichtigsten most important b k curating visual documentation for justice and human rightsyemeni archive is an initiative created by a collective of human rights activists technologists and journalists working to securely preserve and verify open source documentation relating to human rights violations and other crimes committed by all sides during the conflict in yemen yemeni archive aims to create an evidence based tool for reporting advocacy and accountability purposes observation databaseverified videos of observations of violationsinvestigationsverification and open source analysis facilities under firemedical facilities and health care in yemen have been systematically targeted by all parties to the conflict as a strategy of war and in clear contravention of international humanitarian law hospitals have been attacked with airstrikes and artillery shells medical workers have been kidnapped and killed and medical facilities have been commandeered for use as military assets in this database yemeni archive has documented 133 attacks on medical facilities and health care in yemen since april 2014 all 133 unique incidents based on 1 755 observations of attacks on medical facilities include violations committed against medical facilities and or other health workers who are specifically offered protections under international humanitarian law this process necessitated archiving and verifying 1 755 videos articles and other reports from 418 sources that documented attacks on hospitals health centers and medical centers 596 facebook posts 526 twitter posts form 342 sources 159 youtube videos from 76 sources and 474 websites and news articles from 164 sources this database has been made available to support justice and accountability efforts for human rights violations in yemen it should be noted that this database may under represent the extent to which medical facilities have been targeted yemeni archive has included only incidents for which documentation has been able to be identified and independently verified this database shows the impact of the attacks on medical facilities as a result of airstrikes and rocket attacks by various parties to the conflict civilian victims of the airstrikes including children and women remnants of ammunition used in the attacks allegedly by the saudi led arab coalition forces and houthi forces witness testimony of attacks on medical facilities in which surviving medical staff and civilians testify through video interviews rescue operations by humanitarian groups to assist the victims of alleged attacks against medical facilities attacks on medical facilities in yemenattacks on medical facilities medical and health workers and patients are prohibited by international humanitarian law and constitute war crimes the geneva conventions of 1949 and the additional protocols of 1977 mandate the protection of health care facilities and health care workers medical facilities are protected by virtue of their function but also because they are run by civilians and civilians are likely to be present in large numbers especially during times of conflict the only exception to this rule is when these medical facilities are used for military purposes for example as weapons storage facilities or military bases from which missiles are launched even then article 19 of the first geneva conventions stipulates that such protection may cease only after due warning has been given naming in all appropriate cases a reasonable time limit and after such warning has remained unheeded trends and patternssince the saudi led coalition began airstrikes hospitals and medical have been targeted regularly with a large increase in facilities attacked between march and december 2015 the frequency of attacks was reduced starting in january 2016 and continuing throughout that same year until december in 2017 airstrikes on medical facilities increased again peaking between october and december however the number of airstrikes on medical facilities did not reach the same frequency as observed in 2015 during 2018 airstrikes were most frequent in june and december in 2019 the number of airstrikes targeting medical facilities was most frequent in in march and august for the attacks on medical facilities identified within this database yemeni archive has determined both alleged perpetrators as well as the area of control in which the medical facility was located of the 133 attacks identified saudi led coalition forces are allegedly responsible for 72 attacks houthis forces are allegedly responsible for 52 attacks al qaeda is allegedly responsible for three attacks and the forces loyal to the saudi led coalition forces are allegedly responsible for three attacks we could not determine the perpetrator in another three attacks medical workers have been killed both by direct attacks from perpetrators or died as a result of bombings on medical facilities they were in the 133 attacks identified by yemeni archive include 129 attacks in which medical facilities were directly hit nine of the incidents in which medical facilities were allegedly directly hit by the saudi led coalition resulted in the death or injury of injured medical workers for example airstrikes in which al dourayhmi rural hospital was hit led to the death of many staff members sixteen of the incidents in which medical facilities were allegedly directly hit by houthi forces resulted in the death or injury of medical workers for example the repeated shelling of al thawra hospital which yemeni archive has conducted an in depth investigation into led to injuries among several staff members in the city of ad dali houthi forces stormed a hospital and directly attacked medical workers inside documentation obtained by yemeni archive indicates additional four attacks in which medical facilities were not directly targeted but medical staff were allegedly killed as a result of alleged targeting this includes three incidents in which ambulances were hit during saudi led coalition airstrikes and one incident in which an ambulance was targeted during a houthi led ground assault in areas controlled by houthi forces 83 medical facilities were targeted in areas controlled by yemeni government forces 17 medical facilities were targeted in areas controlled by the saudi led coalition 31 medical facilities were targeted one medical facility was attacked in al qaeda controlled areas photos evidence dar al shifa specialised medical centre in saadayemeni archive found out that dar al shifa

with several airstrikes when did it happen the attack on al hunud market neighbourhood was part of several airstrikes targeted the area over two hours news networks and activist pages started reporting on the attack of the republican palace at about 7 pm on september 21 2016 the first was a facebook post by ayman ali numan resident in hudaydah at 19 18 local time which pointed to the start of targeting the surroundings of the presidential palace the air defense and the criminal investigation buildings in hudaydah in addition to an airstrike targeted a house in al hunud market

archive not finding open source content indicating the forces allegedly responsible for the attack the coalition led airstrikes and destroying of houthi controlled airports and aircraft strongly indicates that coalition forces are responsible for the attack photos evidence attacks on al thawra hospital in taizby collecting and analysing images and videos published on social media and news networks yemeni archive concluded that al thawra hospital in taiz was attacked on three separate occasions and targeted on each occasion multiple times with rocket propelled grenades and other munitions according to the evidence and sources analysed the vicinity of al thawra hospital was struck by a number of missiles targeting medical departments doctors residences the hospital gate and nearby houses attacks resulted in casualties from civilians patients and medical staff working in the hospital the first attack began at 11 30 pm on june 20 2015 and continued until 2 00 am the

5 38 pm with a number of rocket propelled grenades that killed two people and wounded nine others the attacks partially destroyed some of the vital sections of the hospital forcing them out of service numerous reports alleged that houthi forces were responsible although yemeni archive did not find any open source content attributing responsibility for the attacks however the attacks were carried out with heavy weapons tanks and various mortars and took place after houthi forces took over military bases from the yemeni army which held these heavy weapons at the time houthi forces also controlled all areas of high elevation overlooking the hospital having expanded their control over various yemeni cities including taiz photos evidence hidden truth in the explosion of the houthi warehouse in sawanon april 7 2019 two explosions occurred in the sawan area east of the yemen s capital sana a the explotions coincided with airstrikes around the city by the saudi led arab coalition it was not immediately clear what happened as there were many narratives of the incident yemeni archive went to the impact site inspected it and met with residents in the neighbourhood to gain a better understanding of what happened in addition to field research our team relied on open source content like videos photos and reports found online which we verified based on the available information as well as interviews with eyewitnesses of the event yemeni archive is led to believe that there were two explosions as a result of a houthi controlled warehouse being struck the afternoon of april 7 2019 between approximately 11 40 and 12 10 yemen time the explosions destroyed houses around the warehouse as well as four schools located nearby a number of reports indicate that at least fifteen students were killed and more than 100 students were injured as a result of these explosions based on the available documentation and witness statements yemeni archive was not able to determine the cause of the explosions reports are inconclusive and at times contradictory with the smoke of the first explosion not clearly indicating that the warehouse was targeted in a missile strike photos evidence al mazraq 1 idp camp by air strikes25 civilians killed as a result of airstrikes targeting al mazraq campon 30 march 30 2015 after 11 00 yemen time several news networks and activist pages 1 2 3 4 5 reported that saudi airstrikes targeted the main gate of al mazraq 1 camp and the room where idps were registered resulting in deaths and injuries among the displaced persons

room between 11 00 am and 11 30 am on march 30th 2015 resulting in 29 killed and 42 injured including women and children camp buildings the nearby medical clinic and civilian properties were additionally destroyed coalition forces and houthis have accused each other of responsibility for targeting the camp several reports have indicated coalition forces responsibility for targeting including one by the un high commissioner for human rights despite yemeni archive not finding open source content indicating the forces allegedly responsible for the attack the coalition led airstrikes and destroying of houthi controlled airports and aircrafts several days earlier strongly indicates that coalition forces are responsible for the attack photos evidence b h p riyadh agreement neglects yemen s manmade humanitarian crisisdeliberate targeting of yemen s health care facilities has worsened its civilians dire humanitarian suffering yet even with ongoing peace efforts brokered by saudi arabia it is unlikely that this alone will repair the catastrophic damage and scars that yemen s war has left behind such intentional destruction of yemen s state and infrastructure has created what the united nations has called the world s worst humanitarian crisis which is mostly manmade afrah nasser a yemen researcher at human rights watch told al monitor as long as the warring parties continue violating international humanitarian law in targeting protected medical facilities and civilian sites and as long as the international community fails to pressure the warring parties to respect in yemen unfortunately hospitals and medical facilities will continue being attacked since the nov 5 riyadh agreement designed to unify the saudi backed government of abed rabbo mansour hadi and the united arab emirates backed southern transitional council fighting has decreased for the time being deliberate damage to health care infrastructure should also drop still tensions between the houthi rebels and saudi arabia could erupt into clashes some analysts and yemenis also say tensions still exist between the hadi government and the southern transitional council meanwhile few active measures to rebuild yemen s state have occurred yemenis will therefore endure ongoing suffering the houthis have also often blocked international aid workers from operating in their territories which could continue while the conflict remains unresolved saudi arabia as part of the unification deal has launched development projects across yemen the vehicle for this is the saudi development and reconstruction program for yemen which has scheduled more aid efforts across the country yet jaloud doubts the sincerity of riyadh s efforts particularly due to its past bombing campaign he called for more external efforts to remedy yemen s suffering saudi arabia cannot bomb hospitals on one day then announce an aid project on another he said with the european union praising riyadh as being a peacemaker having brokered the unification agreement and with the saudi led development projects taking place might there be fewer international efforts to provide aid or accountability for warring factions abuses even the international efforts sometimes leave something to be desired the united nations world food program was recently reported to have provided rotten date bars to yemeni civilians many of the saudi development projects are not aimed at improving the circumstances in houthi areas where most of the population lives rather the saudis have tried to shore up areas under nominal hadi government control such saudi development and reconstruction efforts in the past have enabled saudi arabia to expand its control over yemen s logistical hubs and consolidate its own links to yemeni society suggesting it is more about expanding riyadh s influence over the country the deal signed in riyadh is mostly designed to halt tensions between the factions the saudis had supported while consolidating saudi influence nasser said the unification deal has neither addressed humanitarian concerns in southern yemen nor provided justice for victims of abuses the riyadh agreement almost completely ignores the human rights abuses endured by civilians in the south of yemen by the various warring parties she added she said key civilian needs in southern yemen such as the release of arbitrarily held detainees and punishing abusers were not called for in the agreement by jonathan fenton harvey b p east yemen former ruling dynasty calls to revive mahra sultanatesaudi military forces have been deployed to al mahrah officially to crack down on smuggling activities it followed claims by united nations monitors that a missile was likely smuggled to the houthis along the land routes from oman or ghaydah and nishtun in al mahrah governorate for a brief period of time the mahri security committee gave the go ahead to the coalition under certain conditions including humanitarian aid and economic development for the governorate soon violations of the terms led to a turnaround in saudi al mahrah relations highlighted in may 2018 during a confronting public statement read by afar ever since saudi arabia s moves have sparked heated debate among al mahra s mainly tribal population and triggered pro independence thoughts as protests erupted to denounce an invasion of yemen s second largest governorate we were shocked and asked for the reason of their presence since we have no houthis no daesh no al qaeda nobody is here afar said born on the yemeni archipelago of socotra the representant of al mahra s former ruling dynasty believes that the kingdom aims at occupying cities and ports since it never elaborated on its vision for the governorate the chief sheikh of the island of socotra told al monitor in late september the saudi led coalition lost its way in yemen and has become a force for occupation as of october the sanaa center lists five major saudi military bases spread across the governorate as part of a wider network of 16 military positions an estimated 1 500 2 000 saudi troops support thousands of riyadh backed yemeni proxy forces based in al mahrah oil pipeline and salafistsin al mahrah many subscribe to the view that saudi arabia exploits the war in yemen to move forward with plans to construct an oil pipeline through the governorate the project rejected in the 1990s by then president ali abdullah saleh would enable tankers to load saudi hydrocarbons in al mahrah bypassing the straits of hormuz and bab al mandab afar said that he heard about the pipeline but that there is nothing official as the saudi led coalition signed the riyadh agreement the kingdom moves forward with its agenda to shape the future of yemen while afar refuses foreign interferences in local affairs in january 2018 saudi arabia intervened into local politics to allegedly engineer the removal of al mahrah s governor and appoint pro riyadh rajeh saidbakrit saidbakrit takes all his decisions from saudi arabia he does not have freedom afar noted adding not to go along with the governor since their agendas are inconsistent in addition saudi arabia via saidbakrit allegedly planned to foster a salafist movement in the city of qishn in a bid to toughen its politico military campaign the population protested and blocked the project afar said that there are no longer any salafists there we have our culture and traditions we are different from most people in the region he said in reference to a distinctive identity highlighted by the mehri language spoken by 100 000 people the south arabian language is endangered we want to be independent have our own freedom and select who rules us to protect our culture he added violent confrontationsas saudi arabia increases its grip on the easternmost corner of war torn yemen concerns are growing over the risk of violent confrontations in al mahrah governorate as two tribesmen died in march during a violent clash with saudi backed yemeni forces the recent use of apache helicopters by the saudi coalition in al mahra indicates a further step in the militarization of the simmering dispute sewari wrote in this context afar would like to welcome a peace broker to solve this issue beyond calls for independence afar expressed a willingness to make concessions if yemen is united taking the example of the autonomous iraqi kurdistan region he said al mahrah should remain a peaceful land so we can have our own system within the state by sebastian castelier b h k the gendered impact of explosive weapons use in populated areas in yementhe war in yemen especially since the commencement of the intervention by the saudi and uae led coalition has been marked by the use of explosive weapons in populated areas the coalition has used airstrikes on a massive scale houthi forces have routinely shelled urban areas both in yemen and across the border in saudi arabia the conflict has also seen the common use of artillery rockets mortars rocketpropelled grenades and increasingly many types of improvised explosive devices ieds the use of explosive weapons in yemen has a gendered impact affecting men and women differently and serious consequences for all civilians restrictions on delivery of food fuel and medicines by sea and air have also contributed very significantly to civilian harm in the conflict and continue to do so this paper focuses on the use of explosive weapons in populated areas as this causes a huge proportion of the damage to infrastructure and services such as transport power water distribution education and food supply as well as causing the majority of displacements of yemeni people controlling the supply and use of these weapons is the best way to prevent further human suffering in yemen in considering the transfer of explosive weapons some states are obliged by the arms trade treaty to consider the risk of violations of international humanitarian law ihl and all states have a legal obligation not to facilitate breaches of ihl direct attacks on civilians are war crimes indiscriminate attacks where there is no effort to distinguish between civilians and military targets or where such distinction is impossible because of the indiscriminate nature of the weapons being used the size of the explosive yield or the proximity of civilians to military targets can amount to a violation of international law under the arms trade treaty states must also consider the risk of gender based violence gbv this requires a risk assessment that goes beyond violations of international humanitarian law and considers potential uses of explosive weapons which may not constitute illegal attacks but which do constitute or result in serious incidents of gbv the widespread use of explosive weapons with wide area effects in populated areas of yemen even when targeted against military objectives has contributed to high levels of civilian death and injury and damage to civilian infrastructure and services including housing schools hospitals and medical facilities in most cases this will be disproportionate to the military advantage achieved and has contributed to a pattern of harm that has seen the conflict become the world s worst humanitarian disaster all of this runs directly counter to the principle of the protection of civilians in conflict which goes beyond not committing war crimes or other violations of international humanitarian law and international human rights law to require positive action to ensure that all feasible precautions are taken to avoid and minimize civilian harm in the conduct of military operations in yemen this principle is not adhered to primary effects of explosive weapons are defined as those caused directly by the destructive effects that radiate from a point of initiation and include blast overpressure fragmentation heat and light 5 the term blast refers to a high pressure blast wave moving at supersonic speed referred to as the shockwave which is followed by blast winds primary fragmentation comprises fragments that originate directly from the explosive munition the third damage mechanism is the thermal energy released during the detonation of the explosivesecondary effects of explosive weapons derive from the environment in which the munition detonates the most significant secondary effects include secondary fragmentation firebrands ground shock and cratering secondary fragmentation originates from objects that have been affected by the detonation and can include objects such as pieces of masonry or glass from buildings or bone fragments from human or animal targets secondary fragments are generally larger than primary fragments and tend not to travel as fast or as far tertiary effects can be classified as damage to health social and economic infrastructure and services that occur over a longer time scale e g the lack of clean water caused by damage to water mains and sewers or the loss of electrical and gas services added to these long term effects are the dangers posed by unexploded ordnance which can kill or injure people many years after the conflict has ended and prevent use of or access to the areas they contaminate often depriving populations of valuable farming land these longer term effects are increasingly being researched and documented but are not yet well understood additional long term effects on casualties will become apparent as with better understanding of blast injuries and swifter treatment some survivors will live longer and with profound effects that will be lifelong report b k p captives giants patience the prisons of hodeidah mansoura khor maksar and bir ahmed in aden province are inhabited by tales of torture whipping with whips acupuncture burning stun starvation and neglect and its walls are written down the story of a hidden captive and the last died torture and the last released to tell his story in living tombs the liberated prisoner mohammed abdo mohammed saleh al rimi narrates his story of the people of al ginn on the west coast of hodeidah and ended up being held captive in four prisons the last of which was the bir ahmed in aden a 20 year old man from al haymah ad dakhiliyah district west of the capital sanaa 90 km away went to the west coast front in september 2015 to join the ranks of the army and popular committees in the quiet front where the clashes have not yet flared up the journey of captivity began to take its unknown course with mohammed and his 33 fellow prisoners where they were transferred after three months spent in the prison village of al saqiya to a school turned prison in al mansoora city district in aden province his humanitarian conditions were worse than the previous where mohammed and his family companions remained for six months suffered severe beatings hard work and punishment of standing half a full day under the sun constant investigation psychological warfare attempting to change the military doctrine and threatening physical liquidation especially since the prisoners in that prison were forcibly hidden the pains are compounded in the prison solitude where the neglect of hygiene and its tools from prison officials and the lack of clean clothes in addition to the nature of the hot area to the spread of skin diseases among the prisoners and wounds of injured became suppurated while the prison officials deliberately beat them with sticks in their wounds which compounded their poor condition and deterioration their health status to hunger his story where the prison administration disavowed the simplest rights of prisoners to food and provided them with only one meal a day and some food sometimes and mohammed remembers the suffering of prisoners during the three months of ramadan spent in captivity between preventing food hunger and torture in death prisons third station a new station for torture in khormaksar prison and the beginning of suffering from beatings intimidation and selective separation where prisoners were separated from the army and committees in prison and prisoners of the army from the central security in another prison and fighters from the provinces of saada amran and hajjah in another cell in the prison and in the hands of the avenger mercenaries were quick to execute the prisoners whenever the heroes of the army and committees achieved a victory on the ground in the battles where three officers of the central security was dragged by tanks in addition to the slaughter of one of the prisoners for suspecting a related link between him and one of the leaders of the army and committees and the killing of a group of officers by throwing shot they passed from there they settled here in bir ahmed prison where smells of death are known bir ahmed prison monster prison where human rights reports criticized the conditions of prisoners and revealed various methods of torture that end with the death of the prisoner or hindered him psychologically and physically and the prison includes a large number of prisoners from all fronts of the fighting daesh al qaeda prisoners of conscience forcibly hidden opponents and citizens the prison walls surrounded the freedom of muhammad two years in bir ahmed where the torture was different from the previous prisons where the prisoners of the army and popular committees were combined with prisoners of isis militants in one prison which caused quarrels and bloody battles between the two parties until there was a rebellion in the prison on one of the times in which the prisoners of the army and popular committees demanded separated them from isis militants which led prison officials to place the prisoners in solitary confinement for more than two months and then decided to go on hunger strike collectively until they were separated from isis militants by eman al mutawakel am wichtigsten seuchen most important epidemics b h der bedarf an menschlicher hilfe ist riesig im jemen herrscht krieg millionen kinder hungern es gibt eine

cardboard plastic sheets and other scavenged materials despite her impoverished circumstances arwein s 4 month old son abdulrahman is healthy and happy a fact she attributes to the timely tetanus vaccination she received at a unicef supported health care center during her pregnancy ahmed says she has heard several stories from prenatal caregivers about children who died during delivery most of the women who lost babies in childbirth had not been vaccinated against tetanus the world health organization who estimates that 30 848 newborns died from neonatal tetanus worldwide in 2017 the last

muhammad ali luqman and supported by independent diplomat focussing on civil society women s activism and the role of local and international media in current developments in south yemen in particular from a historical and grassroots perspective chaired by thanos petouris of soas university of london the first of two panel sessions featured two academics huda luqman the daughter of muhammad ali luqman the yemeni lawyer journalist social activist and eponym of the berlin based forum and ameen shandhor who serves as the forum s vice chairman according to shandhor international reporting on southern yemen over the past few years can be divided into two stages the first is between 2015 when the saudi led coalition began its military intervention and 2017 and largely concerns the humanitarian crisis arising from the fighting media coverage in this period was weak he argued with the conflict referred to as the forgotten war with frequent stereotyping through the prisms of saudi iranian tensions and sunni shia sectarianism the second stage shandor continued was from 2017 to the present this period of intensified media coverage could also be explained through a plethora of developments with the dire humanitarian crisis being largely responsible for the media attention what the un described as the worst humanitarian crisis of our time however the friction among the many factions in the conflict is also a possible reason such as the so called legitimate government of yemen backed by the saudis and the southern transitional council stc last but not least the 14 september attacks on the saudi oil facilities cannot be discounted they were blamed on iran but claimed by the houthi movement iran s supreme leader has since admitted responsibility for ordering the attacks during this time media reports about yemen increased naturally shandhor noted that there had had been just two reports per month and then there were several reports per week both in english and arabic print media while many mainstream media referred to the houthis as rebels some outlets including reuters referred to them as the houthi movement shandhor argued that the stc was rarely referred to by its official name but was instead referred to consistently as separatists finally rasha obaid works for the peace track initiative a yemeni organisation founded and staffed by women

to expose a network of secret prisons run by foreign governments in yemen since 2015 al sarari has in recent years unveiled the existence of several secret detention centres where the worst violations of human rights were committed torture disappearances or even extrajudicial executions the award organisers said in a statement she collected evidence on more than 250 cases of abuse taking place within the prisons and succeeded in convincing international organisations such as amnesty international and human rights watch to take up the cause they said the lawyer was hailed for pushing on with

treated the houthis as just a ragtag force but under iranian backing the houthis have proven to be anything but the houthis were not only able to claim much of northern yemen which has been their ancestral stronghold for centuries but they have also hit saudi targets with their missiles allegedly supplied or facilitated by tehran saudi failureriyadh s yemen war plans were apparently based on

u s review fundamentals continue to support festive holiday spending despite easing for the fourth consecutive month confidence still remains near its cycle high in november as consumers continue to focus on their own economic prospects while discounting political drama out of washington d c and concerns from abroad the health of the labor market low gasoline prices and a stock market near record highs continue to underpin our expectations for solid consumer spending growth in the fourth quarter albeit at a substantially slower pace than the robust rates seen in the prior two quarters fundamentals continue to support festive holiday spending as the thanksgiving holiday compressed the economic indicator schedule into the first half of the week market attention remained squarely focused on the data performance in order to gauge the overall health of the u s economy during the final months of 2019 in particular this week s consumer related indicators were of keen interest as the unofficial kickoff of the holiday shopping season including black friday and cyber monday is now upon us with regards to the consumer the landscape remains largely positive though we have witnessed some evidence that supports our expectation for an easing in the pace of consumer spending growth in coming quarters consumer confidence as measured by the conference board unexpectedly eased in november to a level of 125 5 while this marks the fourth consecutive month of declines consumer confidence remains in elevated territory top chart in addition to a still healthy labor market low gasoline prices and a stock market running near record high levels continue to suggest that the major drivers of confidence remain supportive of solid consumer spending growth despite the lackluster confidence performance retail sales and other measures of consumer spending remain on track for moderate growth in the current quarter on an inflation adjusted basis consumer spending is running at a 2 5 annualized rate over the past three months middle chart while marking a deceleration from stronger rates of growth recorded in prior months the trend pace still suggests consumer spending growth should hold up reasonably well in the fourth quarter turning to the factory sector the advance reading of october durable goods orders beat expectations rising 0 6 over the month encouragingly core capital goods shipments a proxy for business equipment spending also unexpectedly increased posting the largest monthly gain since january while the october performance offers a glimmer of hope that manufacturing activity could be stabilizing the trend in orders growth remains lackluster and thus likely to limit any potential capex gains collectively this week s indicator performance does little to change our perspective on the near term outlook the dichotomy between the consumer and factory sectors continues with the former still expected to provide the lion s share of support to overall gdp growth for the foreseeable future no doubt the consumer has been the linchpin of growth in extending economic expansion this year especially in light of heighted trade tensions political drama out of washington d c and slowing global growth while we expect consumers resilience to continue we are mindful that the robust rates of spending growth in q2 and q3 will not likely be repeated any time soon while consumer spending growth should remain steady at about a 2 pace in coming quarters we currently project u s real gdp to increase at a more modest 1 2 annualized rate in q4 and maintain a sub 2 0 pace of growth in the first half of next year u s outlook ism manufacturing index monday the ism manufacturing index has been in contraction territory for three straight months however as the chart to the right shows you can have dips below 50 for a few months and still avoid recession the most recent period that looks similar to this one was late 2015 then as now you have some calling what is going on in the factory sector a manufacturing recession given the fact that many businesses are still operating at capacity and having trouble finding skilled labor that may be an overstatement but there are clearly a number of headwinds confronting manufacturing today until the uncertainty surrounding the trade war goes away we do not expect a return to pre trade war highs in the ism index but if there is no further escalation in the trade war in 2020 as we expect then a modest improvement seems likely though we do not expect to see much of a mover here in the november reading next week previous 48 3 wells fargo 48 9 consensus 49 5 international trade thursday speaking of trade next thursday we will get an indication of how trade is shaping up in the fourth quarter the advance goods trade balance reported earlier this week indicated a significant slowing in u s goods imports in october which is the month the latest round of new trade tariffs against china took effect the decline in goods imports combined with a smaller decline in goods exports points to a narrowing in the october trade deficit all else equal an unexpected surge in services exports or a cratering in service imports could soften the blow but our baseline expectation is that the trade deficit will narrow that is a plus for fourth quarter gdp at least in terms of the arithmetic as a smaller deficit means a slight boost even if the big driver behind that narrowing is a steep decline in goods imports previous 52 5b wells fargo 48 2b consensus 51 5b employment friday the job market in the united states remains quite strong though more than 10 years into this expansion it is starting to show its age the u s added over 200k jobs each month in 2017 and 2018 on average in 2019 that average monthly growth rate slowed to 167k layoffs have remained low but an uptick in jobless claims in recent weeks raise a suspicious eyebrow there have also been layoffs the past two months in the manufacturing sector an optimist might point out difficulty finding skilled labor and how that may be holding back the pace of hiring that is certainly true but the 36k manufacturing jobs lost in october throw some cold water on that still after adding just 128k jobs in october some improvement is expected in november a faster pace of job growth would offer some assurance to the fed and the markets that the economy really is in a good place after all previous 128k wells fargo 190k consensus 190k global review boris johnson commands lead in u k polls a series of u k general election polls released this week continue to show boris johnson s conservative party with a significant lead over the opposition labour party the current margin of support points to a parliamentary majority for the conservatives although much can still change over the next two weeks leading into the election it was a quiet start to the week for international data releases sentiment figures from germany rebounded very slightly but still point to especially sluggish economic growth while revisions to mexican gdp figures showed the economy contracted for three straight quarters starting in q4 2018 polls still favor boris johnson in the united kingdom polls continue to suggest boris johnson s conservative party has a commanding lead ahead of the december 12 general election if the election were held today we would be surprised if the conservatives did not win a majority in u k parliament that said there are still about two weeks until the election and polls can still shift meaningfully before then support for the conservatives has already leveled off and ticked lower after a multi month surge this likely reflects the fact that much of the run up that began in october was merely a sign of waning support for the brexit party whose candidates have dropped out of a number of key races in fact combined support for the conservatives and the brexit party has fallen almost back to where it was at the start of october top chart still the conservatives have a comfortable margin over the opposition labour party at this point and our base case is that the conservative party will win a parliamentary majority in the upcoming election allowing it to shepherd through a brexit withdrawal deal and move on to longer term trade talks with the european union it was a quiet start to the week in terms of data releases from major international economies one release that stood out was germany s ifo business confidence index for november which showed a modest recovery in sentiment but not quite as strong as some had expected the overall index ticked higher to 95 0 although that was mainly driven by a rise in expectations as the current assessment was more or less stagnant these sentiment readings are indicative of the broader state of germany s economy at present stagnating but not in a full scale recession there have been some other signs of initial stabilization in germany s economy and the eurozone economy more broadly of late german factory orders appear to have bottomed out while the eurozone manufacturing pmi ticked higher in both october and november albeit modestly these figures are again reflective of the overall story of the eurozone economy which appears to be stabilizing but is unlikely to recover particularly quickly for more detail on this topic please see our recent special report looking beyond the developed world mexico released comprehensive gdp revisions which showed output declined for three straight quarters starting in q4 2018 overall however the revisions did not meaningfully alter the trend in annual real gdp growth in mexico bottom chart and we doubt they will have any real impact on monetary policy meanwhile economic activity data were also released for september which showed a stronger than expected 0 3 sequential rise in output during the month the strength in growth at the end of q3 bodes well for the q4 gdp reading although we would be surprised to see a very strong growth number for one the ongoing softness in the u s economy is likely to keep a lid on mexican economic growth while real interest rates of roughly 5 are also holding back the more interest rate sensitive sectors of mexico s economy including investment spending global outlook brazil gdp tuesday brazil s economy has languished in recent years as real gdp growth has averaged just 1 5 on an annualized basis since the country emerged from recession in 2017 after nearly three years of recovery real gdp is still nearly 5 below its previous peak in 2014 the sluggish pace of recovery is likely owing to a few factors including depressed commodity prices still restrictive monetary policy and domestic political uncertainty that said on the latter issue we note brazil s success in passing landmark pension reform earlier this year the reform may not be a panacea for the country s economy but the government is making efforts to build on its momentum by working toward other comprehensive reforms meanwhile the central bank has already cut rates 150 bps this year and more easing could be on the way none of this changes the reality of low commodity prices and anemic global growth but improving domestic conditions could help lift brazil s gdp growth rate moderately in the coming quarters previous 0 4 consensus 0 5 quarter over quarter eurozone retail sales thursday 2019 has been a year that has pushed manufacturing sectors across the globe to the brink but services sectors have generally been resilient driven by solid consumers nowhere has that been truer than in the eurozone where the gap between manufacturing and services sentiment reached the widest since 2008 last month that is not to say that consumers have been unaffected indeed employment growth has weakened and growth in hours worked has slowed however overall real income gains have been sturdy enough to keep the consumer chugging along for now and the ongoing strength in the retail sales data support that narrative with services sentiment remaining subdued thus far in q4 we would not be surprised if retail sales slowed a bit during october still the available data are not concerning enough to call for a more significant or prolonged slowdown in consumer activity previous 3 1 year over year canada employment report friday canada s labor market has been red hot this year employment growth has averaged around 36 000 jobs per month in 2019 the strongest year for job growth since 2002 a substantial portion of that growth has come from full time jobs as well an encouraging sign while growth in average hourly earnings is up more than 4 on an annual basis we would not be surprised to see some moderation in employment growth in canada in the months ahead it is simply hard for canada to sustain above trend employment gains in an environment of lackluster global growth and low commodity prices while we also note that underlying domestic demand in canada remains fairly soft also of note next week will be the bank of canada monetary policy announcement which we cover in more detail in the interest rate watch section on page 6 previous 1 8k net change in employment point of view interest rate watch boc we re going steady given the close integration of the american and canadian economies it is not surprising that there is a fair degree of correlation between monetary policy rates in the united states and canada top chart indeed the bank of canada boc was following the fed higher throughout most of the fomc s tightening cycle in 2015 2018 so when the fomc started to cut rates earlier this year many observers ourselves included thought that the boc would follow suit at least to some extent real gdp growth in canada has generally slowed this year in line with the economic deceleration that has occurred in the united states middle chart although canadian gdp growth rebounded markedly in the second quarter it seemed that conditions were still ripe enough for policy easing the statement that was released at the conclusion of the last policy meeting on october 30 was widely interpreted as dovish which bolstered expectations for a boc rate cut on december 4 however boc governor poloz threw cold water on those expectations last week poloz said that the boc had monetary conditions about right given the situation the governor went on to say that interest rates at current levels are still stimulative and he also noted that boc officials had considered a rate cut at the october 30 policy meeting but ultimately decided against it given how well the overall economy is performing consequently we now expect that the canadian central bank will maintain its main policy rate at 1 75 for the foreseeable future the value of the canadian dollar has traded in a tight range vis à vis its american counterpart for most of the year bottom chart we look for the fomc to cut rates one more time early in 2020 which should weigh somewhat on the u s dollar versus the canadian dollar in addition we expect that the u s congress will eventually ratify the usmca trade agreement which should remove some uncertainty regarding the canadian economic outlook therefore we forecast that the loonie will appreciate slightly against the greenback in coming quarters credit market insights global debt hits new record global debt increased by 7 5 trillion in the first half of 2019 to 250 9 trillion according to the latest report from the institute of international finance iif the increase was driven by governments and the non financial corporate sector and a majority of the jump came from the two largest economies the united states and china which accounted for more than 60 of the increase meanwhile emerging markets debt hit a new record of 71 4 trillion equal to about 220 of gdp with government debt growing quickly in countries like argentina brazil and south africa as the iif noted countries with high government debt may find it harder to implement fiscal stimulus measures in the future the iif added that it sees no signs of a slowdown in debt accumulation and looks for the total amount to exceed 255 trillion this year the mounting global debt is likely in part a result of central banks around the world such as the european central bank lowering interest rates to record lows making borrowing conditions easier the iif s report suggests markets should be cautious of rising debt levels the rise in global debt could present trouble ahead and central bankers appear to be taking note while the conclusion of the fed s most recent financial stability report was that vulnerabilities to the u s financial system were little changed it did highlight rising levels of corporate debt as a potential vulnerability topic of the week thankful for low food inflation or convenience most readers will already have their thanksgiving grocery run done and may have noticed slightly higher totals at the register this year according to the american farm bureau thanksgiving dinner for 10 this year increased by a penny to 48 91 breaking a three year string in which the cost of a thanksgiving meal declined based on data heading into november however we suspect shoppers may have noticed a heftier price jump unless stores step up their discounting prices for common food items served at thanksgiving were up across the board relative to last year according to the consumer price index top chart moreover prices for many key thanksgiving items including turkey have risen faster than grocery items have generally that said overall price increases for food at home remain relatively tame costs at the grocery store continue to advance more slowly than overall inflation bottom chart as a result the share of household spending devoted to food at home has fallen to 7 which is half the share registered in the late 1970s looking ahead grocery store inflation looks likely to remain fairly benign for the consumer the commodity research bureau food index which leads the cpi food at home index by about six months is down slightly over the past year agriculture prices have been under pressure the past year from chinese tariffs but speculation of a phase i deal that includes significant purchases from china have helped to support prices more recently households heading out to celebrate thanksgiving or ordering pre prepared food will however notice more of a price bump the cost of eating out has increased ahead of both grocery and overall inflation for most of the past seven years as households place more emphasis on convenience bottom chart the tight jobs market especially for lower skilled workers who often start their careers in food services has further fueled costs for eating out which are now rising at their fastest pace of the expansion

remarks by philip r lane member of the executive board of the ecb at the national treasury management agency introduction it is a pleasure to address the annual investee and business leaders dinner organised by the national treasury management agency ntma i plan today to explore some of the factors determining the evolution of the real that is inflation adjusted interest rate over time this is obviously relevant to the ntma in its role as manager of ireland s national debt and also to its other business areas ireland strategic investment fund state claims agency newera national development finance agency and related entities national asset management agency strategic banking corporation of ireland home building finance ireland more generally the real interest rate is at the core of many financial valuation models while simultaneously acting as a fundamental macroeconomic adjustment mechanism by reconciling desired savings and desired investment patterns my primary focus today is on the real interest rate on sovereign bonds which in turn is the baseline for pricing riskier bonds and equities through the addition of various risk premia the real return on government bonds in advanced economies has undergone pronounced shifts over time chart 1 shows that since the 1980s the real return on sovereign debt has registered a steady decline towards levels that are low from a historical perspective looking at the 1970s ex post calculations of the real interest rate were also low during this period since inflation turned out to be unexpectedly high in contrast the current low levels of the real interest rate take the form of low nominal yields since inflation is itself low and stable understanding the root causes of the low level of real interest rates is a high priority for monetary and fiscal policymakers financial sector participants and the wider populations of savers and investors chart 1 real ten year sovereign bond yields percentages per annum sources

no 3 pp 1225 1298 notes real sovereign bond yields are calculated as the difference between the nominal yield in year t and realised inflation in year t the euro area series is based on gdp weighted data for germany france italy and spain data for italy before 1991 for spain before 1980 and for germany france and the united states before 1973 are based on jordà et al 2019 op cit latest observation 2019 the natural rate of interest the falling trend in yields can be interpreted as a decline in the so called natural or neutral rate of interest labelled as r in academic research and policy discussions the natural rate of interest corresponds to the level of the real short term interest rate that defines a neutral policy stance this corresponds to a situation in which the economy is operating at potential and inflation is at its target value such that there is no reason for the central bank to either inject or withdraw stimulus in what follows i will explore the causes of this trend decline in r causes of the persistent low real yield environment i will structure my discussion of the drivers of r around three broad driving forces first the determinants of potential growth rates second demographics and third diverging developments in the returns on risky and safe financial assets these three factors are embedded in the textbook economic growth model which relates the equilibrium rate of interest to economic growth population growth and the discount rate i will primarily focus on common international trends even if cross country differences in these driving forces have important implications for return differentials and international capital flows the potential growth rate one fundamental driver of r is the potential growth rate of the economy in a high growth economy it takes a higher real interest rate to encourage the volume of saving required for the high investment levels needed to sustain a fast growing economy although easier to see with the benefit of hindsight there has been a sustained decline in the potential growth rate of advanced economies in recent decades it is estimated to be less than half of what it was 50 years ago chart 2 this pattern also carries over to expectations about future growth performance the decline in potential output growth in turn can be attributed to a decline in total factor productivity growth chart 3 and a corresponding decline in labour productivity growth chart 4 chart 2 potential output growth and long term growth expectations percentages per annum sources bureau of economic analysis european commission and consensus economics notes the euro area data reflect the changing composition of member states the consensus long term growth estimates are for years t 6 to t 10 the first observation

of inter related structural and technological factors have been advanced to explain the decline in the potential output growth rate assessing the determinants of the rate of technological innovation is beyond the scope of this speech in addition to the pace of frontier innovation aggregate productivity growth also depends on the rate of technology diffusion there are signs that the diffusion rate has slowed for instance the gap between the labour productivity growth of firms operating at the technology frontier in a given sector and that of firms that are lagging behind the technology frontier in that sector non frontier firms has increased over time chart 5 this pattern is even more pronounced in the services sector than in manufacturing chart 5 technology diffusion in manufacturing and services in the oecd and selected euro area countries annual labour productivity growth of frontier and non frontier firms 2003 1 sources ecb staff calculations based on oecd data and the fifth vintage of compnet data notes the oecd frontier and non frontier productivity developments are taken from oecd 2015 the future of productivity the productivity growth of the euro area is proxied as the unweighted average across belgium spain france italy and finland of the median firm in each 1 digit sector using the nace rev 2 classification nace rev 2 1 digit services sectors are then aggregated with value added shares latest observation 2013 this of course raises the question of why technological diffusion has slowed down one candidate is the fall in business dynamism as measured by business churn the rate at which firms exiting the market are replaced by new ones has declined measurably over the last decade chart 6 chart 6 business churn in the euro area and united states sum of the birth and death rates of firms sources eurostat and united states business dynamics statistics note the euro area is represented by belgium germany spain france italy luxembourg the netherlands austria portugal slovenia and finland latest observation 2016 finally shifts in the sectoral distribution of economic activity also play a role employment growth has been concentrated in the services sector in recent years and productivity growth in services has been weaker than in other sectors such as manufacturing and information technology as a result the growing share of services in total employment mechanically implies a drag on productivity growth in the economy as a whole chart 7 assuming that the structural shifts i have just described account for a loss in potential output growth of around 1 percent a back of the envelope calculation suggests that these account for a decline in real equilibrium yields of a similar magnitude looking ahead it is difficult to predict whether these structural trends will be reversed in particular there is a wide range of views about the potential economic impact of digitalisation automation and artificial intelligence which depends on the success rate in converting new technologies into economically successful business applications in turn aggregate investment dynamics will be heavily influenced by this discovery process another open question relates to climate change and the carbon transition on the one side future productivity growth may be further depressed as a consequence of climate change either directly due to natural disasters or indirectly due to required climate change mitigation measures on the other side the carbon transition is also a spur for investment and opens up new opportunities for innovation and

european commission ameco database and ecb staff calculations notes the euro area reflects data for the original 12 member states latest observation 2018 demographics let me now turn to a second driving force for the real interest rate demography over the last 50 years demographics in advanced economies have been characterised by low fertility rates and rising life expectancy chart 8 as a result people now expect to enjoy many more years in retirement than they did in the 1970s as chart 9 shows for the euro area similarly while in the 1970s and 1980s the ratio of the elderly aged 65 and over to the working age population aged 15 64 was around 20 percent the european commission projects the old age dependency ratio will rise to over 50 percent by the middle of this century chart 10 while the ratio of older workers relative to younger workers has trended up significantly over the last decades chart 11 over the same period the annual growth rate of the working age population

observation 2017 for historical data and 2050 for projections but how do these demographic trends which are without precedent affect the equilibrium interest rate a number of mechanisms are at play first the ageing of the population can depress the demand for capital this in turn is due to the fact that the ratio of installed capital relative to the size of the work force increases as the population ages second ageing can lower productivity growth and thereby reduce investment opportunities this materialises if the productivity of older age cohorts is lower than that of younger age cohorts third in relation to savings rates if rising life expectancy implies longer retirement periods then individuals and those responsible for publicly provided pensions face incentives to save more taken together a lower level of desired investment and a higher level of desired saving imply a reduction in the natural rate of interest some observers have conjectured that the negative impact of ageing on the equilibrium real rate will be reversed once the largest age cohorts retire and begin dissaving however the increase in the capital labour ratio associated with a sustained phase of higher saving and a contraction in the workforce will weigh on the level of real interest rates for a considerable time in terms of magnitude a wide range of estimates suggest that the downward impact on equilibrium real rates from slowing population growth and rising life expectancy over the period from 1980 to 2050 amounts to about 1 to 2 percentage points in both the united states and the euro area while demographics constitute a powerful inter generational influence on aggregate savings the intra generational distribution of income also matters chart 13 shows that the share of national income earned by households in the top 1 percent income bracket has increased considerably since the 1980s both in the euro area and even more strongly in the united states assuming that the propensity to consume out of income is lower for rich households than for those with lower income and wealth greater inequality may be associated with an increase in savings and further downward pressure on the real interest rate chart 13 share of national income top 1 percent percentages source world inequality database notes pre tax national income share held by a given percentile group pre tax national income is the sum of all pre tax personal income flows accruing to the owners of the production factors labour and capital before taking into account the operation of the tax transfer system but after taking into account the operation of pension system the central difference between personal factor income and pre tax income is the treatment of pensions which are counted on a contribution basis by factor income and on a distribution basis by pre tax income the population is comprised of individuals over age 20 the base unit is the tax unit defined by national fiscal administrations to measure personal income taxes the first observation is 1970 for japan and the united states and 1980 for the european union latest observation 2017 for european union 2014 for united states and 2010 for japan diverging trends in the return on capital and on safe financial assets a further complication relates to shifts in the relation between the return on so called safe assets such as highly rated sovereign bonds and wider measures of rates of return including equity returns and returns on higher risk debt instruments in related fashion there has also been a shift in the relation between the returns on short term instruments and those on longer term instruments with term premia that are much smaller now than in earlier periods or even negative on the one side we have observed that corporate bond spreads have held up and estimates of the equity risk premium have increased in both the united states and the euro area chart 14 on the other the demand for short term money like instruments has surged and the yield on those instruments has dropped to unprecedented negative values chart 14 corporate bond spreads and equity risk premium percentages sources for

equity risk premium thomson reuters consensus and ecb staff calculations notes corporate bond spreads for the united states before 2010 are based on gilchrist s and e zakrajšek 2012 ibid owing to historical data constraints the equity risk premium is approximated by subtracting the real risk free rate from the earnings yield latest observation october 2019 a vibrant field of research seeks to reconcile the observed divergence in rates of return across asset categories with reference to shifts in mark ups and risk premia this literature also highlights the increasing value attached to safe assets that offer protection against downside risks the premium on safe assets is due to several inter related factors with the relative importance of individual factors shifting over time first ageing may play a role in moving portfolio preferences towards lower risk assets with older savers seeking safer income streams as retirement approaches second at a global level the accumulation of reserve currency low risk assets has been a central strategy for many emerging economies in seeking to limit financial fragilities associated with a lack of foreign currency liquidity however this force has plausibly weakened in recent years due to the strengthening of domestic currency financial systems in many emerging markets and the adoption of more flexible exchange rate regimes third the safety premium also reflects the lingering effects of the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis chart 15 by revealing the harsh costs of exposure to financial disasters such crises tend to shift portfolio preferences in the direction of assets that preserve their value during bad times in a similar vein in recognition of the fact that the pre crisis financial system was not sufficiently capitalised compared with risk exposures and not sufficiently liquid regulatory reforms have also fuelled demand for safe assets since banks have a reduced risk appetite and are also required to hold more liquid assets chart 15 ten year euro area sovereign bond yield to ois spread basis points source bloomberg and ecb staff calculations note daily data latest observation 27

summary the decline in potential growth rates demographic trends and the portfolio shift towards safe assets combine to put downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate of interest this rate is not directly observable at any given point in time temporary factors push the economy away from its underlying steady state so that the measured real interest rate also reflects these shocks and the associated policy responses however analysis by the escb working group on econometric modelling indicates that taking the impact of these driving factors into account the equilibrium real interest rate in the euro area has been around zero or negative in recent years chart 19 similar estimates are reported in the growing literature on the global equilibrium real interest rate while chart 19

estimation of the euro area natural rate of interest ecb draft paper sample period 1999 q1 to 2017 q4 policy issues what are the implications of low equilibrium real rates for policy taking monetary policy first it is important to recognise that the primary determinants of long term equilibrium real rates are non monetary in nature potential growth rates demographics risk preferences in portfolios nonetheless the implications of the level of real interest rates for the formulation of monetary policy are profound in particular monetary policy ultimately has to be calibrated vis à vis the underlying equilibrium rate of interest if for example inflation stabilisation calls for monetary stimulus due to a negative demand shock the central bank is required to engineer an easing of financial conditions relative to the steady state if the prevailing inflation rate falls short of the inflation aim and the equilibrium real rate is low or even negative this may call for a substantially negative policy rate in order to stabilise medium term inflation furthermore if the policy rate is already close to the effective lower bound alternative methods of providing monetary stimulus may be required to substitute for deeper rate cuts for example a 1 percentage point decline in steady state inflation translates into an equivalent loss of capacity to cut the policy rate in the event of an adverse shock this is a large magnitude given standard calculations of the monetary easing required during downturns in order to stabilise inflation over the medium term options to ease monetary policy when the conventional policy space is constrained include forward guidance about the future path of policy rates asset purchase programmes and targeted lending operations since the summer of 2014 the ecb has been active in employing all of these instruments and our assessment is that these unconventional policy measures have been highly effective in easing monetary and financial conditions at the same time to avoid that the effective lower bound constrains monetary policy too frequently and thus to reduce the need for unconventional policy tools it is essential that inflation is centred at its target over the medium term so that the limitations imposed by a low equilibrium real rate are not further compounded by an inflation trend that is also too low in relation to other policy dimensions a low equilibrium real rate reflects as i discussed earlier low expected potential growth rates it follows that growth enhancing structural policies and growth optimising public investment rates would translate into an upward shift in the equilibrium real rate in addition population ageing poses many policy challenges and the policy choices that are made will have significant implications for trend savings and investment rates in addition in the event of negative shocks the speed of convergence back to steady state can be accelerated if macroeconomic stabilisation is supported by counter cyclical fiscal policies where feasible in addition to the stabilisation policies of central banks in addressing the safe asset premium policies that reduce negative tail risk are essential much has been done in the aftermath of the crisis to mitigate tail risks especially in relation to the financial system bank capitalisation levels have been increased reinforced by an additional layer of loss absorbing debt instruments supervisory oversight has been enhanced including through the creation of the single supervisory mechanism macroprudential policy frameworks have been initiated macro financial imbalances are more contained and the european stability mechanism is a source of stability in the sovereign debt market still it is also clear that the current system for bearing risk remains far from optimal with the completion of banking union and the deepening of capital markets union offering much potential for risk sharing in turn a greater degree of risk sharing reduces the need for individual entities to self insure through the accumulation of safe assets on the supply side the sustained through the cycle maintenance of fiscal discipline in combination with an active role for counter cyclical fiscal stabilisation policies which can help maintain the equilibrium real rate at a higher level will over time lead to an improvement in the risk assessments of the national sovereign debt of euro area countries in addition the supply of safe assets could be boosted at the euro area level through a range of innovations even if some of these proposals require a significant deepening of fiscal union at the area wide level
ben bernanke s wild ride and ours from 2009 i begin with a video it is the most persuasive low cost home brew video that i can remember if you do nothing else today watch this video i wish i had produced it conceptually it is a stroke of genius it sets forth the current banking crisis admirably the remainder of my report rests on this video if you watched it you now know the nature of the problem as well as its magnitude to say that we are in uncharted waters does not begin to get across the idea of the magnitude of our current situation america is in a canoe floating down a river that has never been explored most of the passengers are trying to listen to the tour guide but there is a noise that interferes it is the sound of a waterfall ahead the noise is getting louder the tour guide is new it is a new career for him his first day on the job january 20 he is a good talker although it s clear that he is improvising the guys with the paddles are also new on the job this is their first trip down this particular river you and i are along for the ride we were assured that this would be a scenic trip back when the excursion company ben bernanke s slow boat to china sold us tickets so far we have gone through two sets of rapids the first in august 2007 which seemed to end by september and the other beginning a year later in august 2008 since then the rapids have gotten wilder and the canoe more obviously not under control by the first crew with the paddles who left on january 20 and handed the paddles over the to the new crew the canoe seems out of control each set of rapids is worse than the last we got through one set the other crew kept telling us that everything was under control after the first set then we hit the second set they abandoned ship assuming you would call this canoe a ship the crew has handed out life jackets but has told us that we don t have to put them on yet but they have put on theirs the excursion company s owner dr bernanke has said almost nothing since august 2007 his assistant hank bailout paulson has bailed out his replacement tim turbo geithner has just been handed a paddle because he was paid 398 000 last year as captain of a cruise ship the s s foia proof no one is sure why he signed up for this low paying assignment two maps turbo tim will have to decide which branch of the river to follow he has a map it lists three branches two of them mentions the possibility of falls there is some hope that the third route will avoid the falls the first set of falls is marked inflationary falls the second set is marked deflationary falls there is a hoped for third branch of this river conventional creek dr bernanke has bet his future and ours on this one sadly for us the map is torn at this point it is a matter of guesswork as to where this creek connects with the main branch of the river the video presents the graphic reality of dr bernanke s strategy to negotiate the rapids the increase in the federal reserve system s lending to american and some foreign banks in 2008 as of november was a staggering 700 billion this increase in lending to banks was accomplished by an increase in the federal reserve s adjusted monetary base from 850 billion 2007 to 1 8 trillion see the graph here here is our problem as well as dr bernanke s this increase in the monetary base was produced by fiat money the money spent by the fed to purchase assets the money was spent into circulation as all increases in the fed s balance sheet are this money has entered the banking system there are two things the banks can do with this money 1 keep some or all of it on deposit with the fed where the public cannot get its hands on it 2 purchase investment assets from the public which means that the fractional reserve banking process will take over and turn the monetary base into spendable money if the banks do the second the money supply will more than double prices will then more than double we will go over inflation falls if the banks keep the money on deposit at the fed because the fed started paying interest on deposits last october three years earlier than previous legislation had authorized then the increase in excess reserves will have the same effect as would the doubling of the legal reserve requirement by the fed it will offset the increase in the monetary base dr bernanke is betting his future and ours that this will get us onto conventional creek the intricate route through the rapids to conventional creek assuming conventional creek actually exists involves trusting commercial bankers not to do what bankers have always done lend every dime the banks can get their hands on banks make money by making loans there is no other way for banks to make a profit always before except possibly in 1929 33 banks have lent every dime that was deposited to sit on unused reserves is to avoid getting paid bankers enjoy getting paid they fear not getting paid so dr bernanke seems to be betting the canoe on bankers doing what bankers never do sit on reserves he is luring bankers to lend to the federal reserve which does not face the wrath of shareholders or the fdic it does not have to make a profit it gets to decide each year how much money to return to the treasury as its donation it keeps enough to pay its bills to lure bank deposits into the fed s digital vault the fed started paying interest last october but interest was low 1 5 until the second week of october and 1 thereafter this is the federal funds rate the rate at which banks lend overnight to each other to meet reserve requirements this fall in the fedfunds rate has now created a problem for dr bernanke s journey to conventional creek the fed has announced a target rate for fedfunds of 0 in recent weeks the rate has fallen to about one tenth of 1 i post this on my site in the department federal reserve charts the link is free market federal funds rate here was the fedfunds rate as of the week of january 19 inauguration week you can see that it was close to one tenth of 1 basically this was no interest payment at all here is the situation facing banks they can keep their money on deposit at the fed for free or they can buy 90 day treasury bills also for one tenth of 1 this is how they avoid all risk of default but they cannot make a profit they cannot avoid losses meanwhile anyone who receives digital money who decides to keep digital money has his money in a bank banks must pay interest on most accounts for as long as depositors demand a rate of interest above 90 day t bills banks have a major cash flow problem more money is going out the door in interest than is coming in from t bills and reserves at the fed what s a banker to do he can pay less to depositors that means depositors hopes of ever retiring and living off of their capital is doomed unless they find a way to beat the stock market or the commodities market they must become entrepreneurs they do not want to do this it was not that they had any legitimate hope before they were paid maybe 3 price inflation was at 3 they were taxed at ordinary rates in his interest payments they were going into the hole but the illusion of hope was still there if they are paid nothing on their deposits they know they are doomed to working until age 85 unless prices fall by 3 a year which would be a great thing it has not happened since 1932 banks are paying depositors well above 0 these days to find out how much visit this site for the best rates nationally so for every dollar that a bank keeps at the fed or in t bills it is losing money what is the incentive for banks to lose money only this the terror of losing even more money terrified bankers ever since september 2008 m 1 has taken off like a skyrocket inflationary falls in contrast the m 1 money multiplier has fallen like a stone deflationary falls i post links to these charts in my department federal reserve charts you can see both charts on one page here my explanation for the m 1 money multiplier s reversion to an m 1 money divisor is that the fed began paying interest on bank reserves this has kept most of the increase in the adjusted monetary base from creating an inflationary disaster the bankers have now run out of profitable options they must accept one of these painful alternatives first they accept the slow draining away of profits that will come as a result of the freeze on the interest rate income on their excess reserves money they could legally lend second they accept the risk technically uncertainty of lending to corporations in the middle of the longest recession since the end of world war ii these corporations may go bankrupt third they can lend to the u s treasury to buy long t bonds which pay above 3 their principal is then at risk rising long rates due to monetary inflation and then price inflation could raise yields thereby lowering the market value of the t bonds if bankers keep their banks money at the fed this means that their terror is extreme they would rather suffer the slow losses of money paid to depositors a sure loss is better than the potential losses of lending to corporations of the u s treasury this means that they think the canoe is going to go over deflationary falls if bankers are this pessimistic about the economy then we really are in uncharted waters the people who americans paid to manage their money mis invested hundreds of billions and it may turn out close to 4 trillion during greenspan s bubble and the carry over under bernanke s attempted slowing of the monetary base 2006 2007 these people were lured into a trap by greenspan s monetary and interest rate policies those austrian school economists and forecasters who warned that this would happen were ignored then and are ignored now crackpots lucky guessers now these same people in shell shock because of what the market has done to their investments are paralyzed in fear we are now being told by the so called experts who told us not to sell our stocks let alone sell short i recommended both in november 2007 that the stock market is close to the bottom yet they cannot tell us when this economy will recover then how do they know the stock market is at the bottom we are told the market has discounted all the bad news to come did the market forecast this in october 2007 no so why are the ex genius stock fund managers any better informed now than then if the banks will not shift those excess reserves to t bonds or corporate bonds or corporate loans then there is not going to be a recovery for years banks are still failing corporations are still failing the fed is still pumping in fiat money to re capitalize banks before long it will be doing the same with t bonds for the federal government s expected deficit is 1 2 trillion if bankers think this economy is too risky to lend any money then this economy will continue to decline will we get mass deflation no mass deflation is a theory suggested by keynesians they call this a zero bound economy this is what bernanke has worried about all along in his now infamous helicopter speech in 2002 he said this however a deflationary recession may differ in one respect from normal recessions in which the inflation rate is at least modestly positive deflation of sufficient magnitude may result in the nominal interest rate declining to zero or very close to zero 2 once the nominal interest rate is at zero no further downward adjustment in the rate can occur since lenders generally will not accept a negative nominal interest rate when it is possible instead to hold cash at this point the nominal interest rate is said to have hit the zero bound we are now at this point the consumer price index actually fell in december the median cpi was flat deflation great enough to bring the nominal interest rate close to zero poses special problems for the economy and for policy first when the nominal interest rate has been reduced to zero the real interest rate paid by borrowers equals the expected rate of deflation however large that may be although deflation and the zero bound on nominal interest rates create a significant problem for those seeking to borrow they impose an even greater burden on households and firms that had accumulated substantial debt before the onset of the deflation this burden arises because even if debtors are able to refinance their existing obligations at low nominal interest rates with prices falling they must still repay the principal in dollars of increasing perhaps rapidly increasing real value this is bad for consumers he said what can be done about this in short what s a central banker to do this beyond its adverse effects in financial markets and on borrowers the zero bound on the nominal interest rate raises another concern the limitation that it places on conventional monetary policy under normal conditions the fed and most other central banks implement policy by setting a target for a short term interest rate the overnight federal funds rate in the united states and enforcing that target by buying and selling securities in open capital markets when the short term interest rate hits zero the central bank can no longer ease policy by lowering its usual interest rate target we are now at that place that bernanke feared was theoretically possible it has happened on his watch some people still believe that the central bank in his words then has run out of ammunition he assured us that a central bank never runs out of ammunition however a principal message of my talk today is that a central bank whose accustomed policy rate has been forced down to zero has most definitely not run out of ammunition as i will discuss a central bank either alone or in cooperation with other parts of the government retains considerable power to expand aggregate demand and economic activity even when its accustomed policy rate is at zero what the video on fed lending showed is bernanke s desperate attempt not to run out of ammunition unless this ammunition is nothing but blanks he will hit his target the economy it is best to avoid a zero bound condition he said as with all keynesians all chicago school monetarists and all supply side economists bernanke hates the thought of price deflation as i have already emphasized deflation is generally the result of low and falling aggregate demand the basic prescription for preventing deflation is therefore straightforward at least in principle use monetary and fiscal policy as needed to support aggregate spending in a manner as nearly consistent as possible with full utilization of economic resources and low and stable inflation in other words the best way to get out of trouble is not to get into it in the first place tough luck ben we are there within the hard money camp most of us think mass inflation will be the result if present policies are followed by the fed the banks will eventually have to buy t bonds and other interest paying assets if they don t the red ink of payments to depositors will bankrupt them they are like wounded men on a battlefield they will bleed to death the fdic will intervene or the fed will before this happens american banking is now nationalized congress is in a position to force banks to lend no loans no more bailout money before we go over deflation falls congress will do just that there are deflationists in the hard money camp they are in fact the true hard money people they think the dollar is true hard money they think prices will fall they trust the dollar not gold the ones who trust gold and the dollar are not deflationists they are confused they think we will go over deflation falls i don t mean that they predict a japan like economy japan had a few years in the 1990 s in which price deflation of 1 occurred a rate of deflation that low is subject to statistical error no one really knows what prices in general there are no known prices in general only statistical indexes did or did not do when we are talking about a change of 1 i am talking about someone who thinks the 1930 s are coming back bernanke described this scenario massive financial problems including defaults bankruptcies and bank failures were endemic in america s worst encounter with deflation in the years 1930 33 a period in which as i mentioned the u s price level fell about 10 percent per year i make the following prediction this is not going to happen conventional creek what about muddling through what about a reversal of the zero bound economy but without mass price deflation what about a reversal of fed policy once the economy reverses first why should it reverse second how soon third what can the fed do to reverse its policy can it unload the toxic waste assets it swapped for treasury debt on whom at what discounted price forget about it the fed is stuck forever with this junk can the fed stop buying t bonds and t bills with a 1 2 trillion deficit forecast this year president obama has said this will not be the last such year if the fed stops buying rates will climb if rates climb the recession reappears no exit there more monetary base increases fourth the fed can hike the reserve requirement for banks convert today s excess reserves into legal reserves this is exactly what it should do move toward 100 reserve banking but then the banks will bleed again more payments to depositors than income from lending they cannot lend because the reserve rate is at 20 or whatever the fed decides the fdic then gets stuck with more busted banks it is below 25 billion in reserves now and that is in treasury debt it must sell treasury debt in order to raise cash to cover deposits no exit conclusion i am all for muddling through but at this point i don t see conventional creek on my copy of the map the monetary base has been doubled the only thing keeping banks from lending to the limit of their legal reserves is fear if bankers are so afraid to lend despite returns of one tenth of 1 we are not heading toward conventional creek we are headed for the falls inflation falls dollar falls gold rises ___________________________

could be enough to bring the market close to balance in 2020 although deeper cuts are probably needed to prevent sentiment from turning more negative next week s opec meeting is expected to see

economy in the third quarter as growth slowed markedly from the second gross domestic product expanded at an annual pace of 1 3 per cent in the quarter statistics canada said pumped by stronger business investment and higher consumer spending the third quarter pace was far slower than the second quarter s 3 5 per cent and just about what was expected by some economists among the notable tidbits in the statistics canada report is that housing investment climbed 3 2 per cent which marked the fastest since early 2012 this was pushed by construction of new homes primarily single detached

columnist rob carrick examines the issue
that s an easy go energy is the amount of on my electricity bill or maybe of on my natural gas bill if i am very concentrated i might add that it is also the money i spend at the gasoline pump and if i am even more concentrated i will suggest that it might have something to do with the filling up of my domestic fuel oil tank next question the economist might add that energy represents 7 of the spendings of households in france in other oecd countries the percentage is probably close and therefore that if the price of electricity increases it is annoying because it hurts a little the purchasing power but nobody should die from it but with such an approach that is bringing everything back to money we will miss the biggest part because in industrialized countries energy plays a physical role far more important than its share in our spendings physical is that connected in any way with physics indeed before being an amount on a bill energy has a definition in physics it is the notion that characterizes a change of state in a system woaw this seems awfully complicated actually it s very simple it just says that as soon as the world that surrounds us a system changes energy plays a role and the amount of energy invoplved measures the magnitude of the changeof the system between before and after if we look around us we will witness that indeed as soon as something happens there is energy playing a role a change of temperature uses or yields energy it s this energy that we use to heat or cool a room food water for a shower actually we seldom cool that one etc all industrial machines that cook sterilize heat cool or freeze therefore need or use energy a change of state of matter going from solid to liquid or liquid to gaseous what physicists call a change of phase uses or yields energy called latent heat our body uses that energy to cool down when it s too hot its perspiration which basically consists in evaporating water coming from our serum which is why it makes the skin salted cooling machines fridges freezers and machines that use the reverse process heat pumps use the latent heat of evaporation or condensation to transfer heat all industrial processes that melt about any process of production of raw materials melts something at some time or evaporate use that kind of energy a change of speed of an object uses or yields energy putting cars trucks trains planes and boats in motion uses about 20 or the overall energy consumption of the world a change of chemical composition uses or yields energy a combustion for example is a chemical transformation that yields energy through associating oxygen to the atoms of the initial coumpound and symetrically reduction the fact of removing oxygen from a molecule that has some for example a metal oxide requires energy 10 to 15 of the world energy consumption is used to modify a chemical composition 7 to 8 is used in chemical industries that transform various natural resources air water minerals oil products etc into other molécules hundreds of thousands 5 is used to reduce metal oxides first of all iron oxides to produce metals creating or absorbing electromagnetic radiation is also a process involving energy for example the energy released by fusing nucleus in the sun is transformed into radiation that carries energy to the earth where it is absorbed and heats the surface and the atmosphere and puts in motion the climate system and plant growth almost 100 of renewable energy we can access except geothermal energy is therefore coming from radiation transformation and even oil coal and gas are remote remains of past radiation it is also energy enclosed in radiation that carries the information allowing the radio the tv cellular phones and wifi device to operate even if the amounts of energy associated are not considerable the laser that cuts tissues in a cloth plant uses that energy also changing a shape involves energy a stamp mill and a potato peeler both change a shape crushing ore in the first case and separatig a potato from its peel in the second and energy is required in both cases our arm is enough in the second case all industrial machines or sometimes domestic ones that crush expand add or remove matter flatten elongate saw cut and modifiy the shape in whatever other way therefore require energy moving a mass in a gravitational field involves energy when the gravitational field is that of the earth we are talking about weight it is against that energy that we are struggling during a mountain hike and it is that energy that pulls us down when we ride a bike down the slope each time we use the weight of an object it is actually gravitational energy that we use and there are a number of devices that use weights from lifts to cranes any interaction between an electric current and a magnetic field involves energy when a current in brought inside a magnetic field to get some motion we are talking of an electric engine which is now found everywhere around us from water supply to sewers from computer hard drives to freezers from trains to vacuum cleaners from industrial lines to gasoline pumps from compressors to automatic doors and from cable cars to air con when it is motion that is brought to get some electricity out it is an alternator that can be found in any car and any power plant changing an atom s nucleus involves energy it is nuclear energy it is associated to radioactivity fusion and fission as nuclear energy is extremely intense there is a much energy released by the fission of one gram of uranimum than by the burning of a ton of oil men have limited its domestication to about three cases electricity generation bombs alas and radiotherapy cobalt 60 a radioactive source is used to irradiate tumor cells again nothing can happen in the physical world without energy interveining the larger the change and the more by definition energy is involved as a logical consequence if we carefully look at the way occidentals increased their material consumption we will find energy everywhere humanity has used more and more energy to extract mechanical energy transform chemical energy work on mechanical energy and displace kinetic energy mineral or biological resources that compose the innumerable amount of objects we now have at our disposal including large objects such as buildings cars and trains plants infrastructure etc we have used more and more energy to put in motion machines that transport goods or ourselves automobiles trucks trains planes boats we have used more and more energy to heat or cool spaces that we have separated from the outside world that is buildings of all kind it is therefore logical that the average consumption per capita has strongly risen during the course of industrialization evolution of the average energy consumption per capita in the world since 1880 wood included estimated the vertical axis is graduated in kwh 1 kwh 0 003 mbtu an inhabitant of the planet therefore uses on average a little more than 20 000 kwh per year the above diagram clearly outlines three distinctive periods since the beginning of the industrial revolution for more than a century 1860 to 1979 the amount ef energy per capita has been rising strongly and after the second oil shock in 1979 it remained almost constant until the beginning of the 2000 decade there has been again a rise during the 2000 s corresponding to a strong growth in the emerging countries fueled by coal mostly china where it is the first energy used author s compilation of the following primary sources shilling et al bp statistical review energy information agency united nations because of what is exposed above it is easy to understand that our productive system and therefore the economy depends strongly on energy our economy is only a large system to transform resources taking into the environment all kind of things to turn them into products and services as any transformation goes along with the use of energy it seems logical that the output of the economy is strongly coupled to the amount of energy injected in the system this energy can either come from our muscles or from machines but a quick calculation shows that using its arms and legs a human organism can yield at most 150 kwh of mechanical output per year what the above graph says therefore is that oil gas and coal have enabled men to multiply by several hundreds their physical action on the environment in europe where the energy consumption is rather around 60 000 kwh per person and per year including the energy used to manufacture imported goods the multiple is more something like 500 simplified representation of the physical flows that sustain our productive system which is nothing else than a tremendous organization to transform natural resources that are free in conventional economics and therefore can never lack with work thus energy work a from of energy comes from a marginal fraction from our muscles that use the energy of food and for the most from machines that eat energy oil products electricity and therefore coal and gas etc on average the energy coming from machines is worth 200 times that coming from our muscles and it amounts to 500 times for an european and almost 1000 times for an american productivity of work is therefore a direct function of the number and size of machines we have per capita capital formation is an internal loop of the system it is formed with past resources and work i did not invent anything it is exactely how it was dealt with in the work of meadows et al one easily understands then that if we have plenty of workers and plenty of capital but no energy examples a caterpillar with no oil a plant with no electricity we won t get any significant production in other words what creates the industrial output in the world is first of all the energy we use far ahead the work of people as the tertiary sector depends on the industrial output and does not exist independently it means that energy is the true engine of the industrial civilisation office work included our arms and legs are only there to manipulate switches and valves that unleash the power of energy respective year on year changes since 1965 of the world gdp blue curve and the world energy consumption excluding wood green curve it is easy to see that the two evolve almost the same way besides in 1980 1989 1997 and 2005 the drop in energy supply preceded the drop of the gdp that came shortly after author s calculation on primary information coming from bp statistical review 2015 and world bank 2015 gdp world gdp in constant dollars vertical axis plotted against the world energy consumption in million tonnes oil equivalent horizontal axis from 1965 to 2014 the correlation between the two variables is clear author s calculation on primary information coming from bp statistical review 2015 and world bank 2015 gdp one should note that if we try to correlate the world gdp to oil price than we get no clear pattern world gdp in constant dollars vertical axis plotted against the price per barrel of oil in constant dollars horizontal axis from 1960 to 2014 there is no obvious correlation the gdp can increase with a decreasing oil price but also with a rising oil price and from 2008 to 2009 we also had a decreasing gdp with a decreasing price let s recall that the world trade in general and that of oil in particular is a balanced system when the importer pays more the exporter earns more and the net effect on the world gdp is nil author s calculation on primary information coming from bp statistical review energy information agency energy and world bank gdp what counts for the world economy is actually not the price of oil but the volume of oil produced anyone will then say that if there is less oil the price will increase and vice versa but it happens that there is no such long term relation if we look at past statistics world oil consumption horizontal axis plotted against the price per barrel of oil in constant dollars from 1921 to 2014 there is no such thing as an elasticity between price and volume actually there rather seems to be only two stable regimes a constant or almost constant price with a highly variable consumption 1921 to 1973 and 1986 to 2001 or an almost constant consumption with a highly variable price 1973 to 1986 and 2002 to 2014 author s calculation on primary information coming from bp statistical review shillig et al on the opposite there is a very strong link between oil in volume and the world gdp a simple explanation can be put forward oil is king in transportation and transportation is indispensable to any economic activity the red curve gives a 3 year running mean for the variation of the volume of oil produced worldwide the blue one gives the 3 year running mean for the variation of the world average of the gdp per capita it is easy to see that the two curves behave about the same way after 1986 with the change on the gdp per capita following the change on oil production and not the opposite it is also easy to seen that before 1986 the magnitude of the variation was greater for oil production than for gdp per capita when after they became of the same magnitude this suggest that the dependancy of our economic system on oil has increased and not decreased which is consistent with the development of globalization that heavily relies on international transportation sources bp statistical review volume of oil and world bank average gdp gdp per capita world average in constant 2012 dollars vertical axis plotted against the world oil consumption in million tonnes oil equivalent horizontal axis from 1965 to 2014 green data from 1965 to 1982 red data from 1983 to 2014 the correlation is better for recent years which shows that the world economy is not less dependent on oil the dependency has increased even though we get more gdp per barrel today than before author s calculation on primary information coming from bp statistical review shilling et al energy and world bank gdp this obviously brings in a question what is the economy going to become with less oil can i use more and more energy all that has been stated above is indeed absolutely fascinating and even breathtaking but if energy is available without any limit it will mainly be useful for desperate attemps to draw attention during a diner with friends the economy relies on energy so be it and all we have to do is use more and more energy to have more and more economy and that will settle any issue with pension funds and the popularity of prime ministers but energy has a major characteristic well known by physicists in a closed system it can neither be created nor be destroyed but only be transformed the energy used by a system has thus to come from outside the system because it is absolutely forbidden that more energy appears spontaneously in this system an engine does not create mechanical energy it transforms in mechanical energy and in heat a previously existing chemical energy that of the fuel that comes from the outside in the same respect gasoline did not spontaneously appear in the ground but comes from the conversion of old solar energy incidentally the expression energy producer should not be used to mention the operator of a power plant or sometimes an oil producer the proper expression should be energy transformer for a power plant and energy miner for an oil company because no human activity can create an energy that did not previously exist incidentally when anyone claims to have discovered a machine that yields more energy than it receives from the environment it is a variation of perpetual move impossible even the heat pump that seems to perform this apparent miracle as the heat it yields represents more energy than the electricity used actually gives back the energy it receives from the grid electricity and from the outside calories what changes each time energy is used is the grade of this energy characterized by a notion which is called entropy which measures the degree of disorder of the energy each transformation increases the entropy mechanical energy has the lowest entropy low temperature heat the highest this is why any use of energy ends with low temperature heat as physics forbid to create energy humanity will never be able to do anything else than taking advantage of energies that already exists in the environment matter able to burn wood and biomass fossil fuels fissile nucleus uranium existing radiation sun existing movement waterfalls wind tides etc and of course we are limited to consuming no more energy than the amounts available in the environment any energy that does not exist in the environment electricity hydrogen it cannot be considered as an energy source it is just a way to use an energy that has to be drawn from the environment in the first place a second limitation is often a major one that of available power our industrial uses not only need a lot of energy but they need even more a lot of power that is the delivery of energy over a very short period of time a car weighting one ton that travels at 100 km h represents a kinetic energy of about 0 1 kwh it is not tremendous a man that cycles like mad can yield that energy in a couple hours but what we want is our car to get to its cruising speed in a matter of tens of seconds not in a few hours it s another way to say that the energy sources that are of some interest for our modern uses are those able to yield a lot of power and the whole debate on renewables is there because the sun can very well send us each hour the energy that we use in a year this energy is scattered on the full surface of the earth with a low power per surface unit getting that energy concentrated to bring it to the level of fossil fuels will often be the difficult part and then now that the physical flows that generate the economic output are put in motion by an energy hundreds of times more powerful than that of our muscles a reasonable hypothesis is to consider that our economy will not be able to grow faster than the energy supply with a little relief granted by energy efficiency but that is far from being massive when examined for previous decades it is pretty coherent with the fact that the evolution of oil production that dominates by far the energy supply oil represents 42 of the final energy consumption in the world is the best indicator of the future evolution of the gdp if we go back to the graph above that gives the average energy consumption per capita we see that there have been two very different stages since the beginning of industry for everyone until the two oil shocks the supply per capita is following a steady growth of 2 5 per year on average since 1980 and even with the growth of the last 10 years the increase is only 0 4 per year on average annual variation of the average energy consumption per capita in the world since 1860 the blue curve gives the annual change the horizontal red line on the left gives the mean for the 1860 1980 period the horizontal red line on the right gives the mean for the 1981 2014 period it is easy to see that the two oil shocks correspond to a sharp drop in the average rate of increase of the energy consumption per capita before it was 2 4 per year on average after it fell to 0 4 per year on average author s calculations on primary data from shilling et al bp statistical review energy information agency energy and united nations population it happens that the economic evolution of the 20th century and the early 21st also comprises two very different episodes from 1880 to 1975 when energy per capita is strongly growing the world undergoes just one major economic crisis in 1929 since 1975 after the rate of growth dramatically decreased there has been a crisis every 5 to 10 years 1975 1980 1991 2000 2008 2012 and it would be no surprise to have a new one in the coming years as the role of energy is to help transforming things all this is logical less energy a lower transformation capacity less gdp that only measures the amount of transformation we can even go further in this direction with the simple maths that follows and we will begin with an equation than anyone should agree on which is that the world gdp is equal to itself gdp gdp so far we should all agree then we will multiply and divide on the right hand side by the world energy consumption called nrj gdp frac gdp nrj times nrj we have just written that text scriptsize world gdp text scriptsize gdp per energy unit times text scriptsize energy consumption the term gdp per energy unit is nothing else than the energy efficiency of the economy the more efficient the economic system is the more gdp is produced with the same amount of energy in other words when this term increases it means that for the same amount of kwh or btu we can have more furniture glasses cars frozen peas buildings or coffee machines we will then bring that equality to amounts per capita by dividing on both sides by the world population named pop frac gdp pop frac gdp nrj times frac nrj pop we have now written that text scriptsize gdp per capita world average text scriptsize gdp per energy unit times text scriptsize energy consumption per capita we will now shift from the terms to their increase or decrease over time indeed when two terms are equal then their variation over time is also equal and in doing so we will benefit from a little help from maths when each of the righ hand side terms varies slowly over time the variation of their product is equal on the first order to the sum of their variations in other words il we have a b c then the change of a year on year noted a is basically equal to b c for b and c that remain small several per year is ok on that respect if the world population increases by 2 per year and the energy consumption per capita increases by 4 per year the global energy consumption which is the multiplication of the 2 previous terms increases by 6 per year 4 2 and not 4 2 with this information we can then write frac gdp pop frac gdp nrj times frac nrj pop the left term is nothing else than growth per capita this equation therefore means that text scriptsize growth of gdp per capita text scriptsize growth of gdp per energy unit times text scriptsize growth of energy consumption per capita then the first graph on this page shows that the term nrj pop abruptely shifted from a 2 yearly growth that had been sustained for more than a century to zero meanwhile the term gdp nrj went on growing by a little less than 1 per year since 1970 and this rythm has not been modified much by the oil shocks constant dollars of gdp produced per kwh of primary energy consumed since 1965 what this curve shows is that to get a dollar of gdp in 2014 in the world it requires 30 less energy than in 1965 the term gdp nrj therefore gained a little less than 1 per year since 1965 0 8 per year to be precise but we notice that for the last decade it has been flat source bp statistical review 2015 for energy world bank 2015 for gdp in the past this simple equation explains why the gdp per capita in world average abruptely went from a growth of 3 per year before 1980 a little less than 1 per year for gdp nrj 2 per year for nrj pop to a little above 1 per year right after 1980 still a little less than 1 per year for gdp nrj but 0 4 per year for nrj pop all the rest growing debt unemployement impossible to get rid of repetitive speculative bubbles can quite logically be linked to this abrupt change evolution of the gdp per capita since 1960 blue line and average per decade red line the decrease after the first oil shock is clearly visible as is the fact that since 1980 the increase is a little above 1 per year when the energy per capita is going to decrease significantly that will happen sooner or later the gdp per capita is probably going to decrease accordingly source world bank 2015 for the primary data average calculated by the author and what for the future if the future is strongly constrained on energy and it will particularly on oil and gas then the term nrj pop will become negative and recurring recessions will become something normal in our economic system this is fully consistent with the physical reality less energy less transformation capacity less gdp that only measures a transformation decoupling energy and the gdp is much faster said than done
the international monetary fund has a checkered past on giving asia advice ask officials from jakarta to seoul about this and you ll get an earful now it s japan s turn to get some dubious guidance from the washington based institution that advice handed out by imf managing director kristalina georgieva at a press conference on monday is to raise japan s consumption tax in fact tokyo had just done exactly that to disastrous effect last month it hiked consumption tax to 10 and promptly saw the dangers of tightening fiscal policy amid a global trade war a 14 4 plunge in retail sales in october and a heightened recession risk demographic cloud still the imf bigger picture warning is prudent a fast graying population and among major economies the world s biggest debt burden two and a half times economic output is a dangerous combination it is the stuff of credit downgrades and surging debt yields yet given how highly taxed workers salaries in japan already are the imf s suggested hikes to 15 and then 20 over time are well nuts japan needs to deal with this issue in ways that don t penalize the consumption needed to hasten gross domestic product tokyo s plight matters for two reasons one a debt reckoning in the world s third biggest economy would reverberate everywhere two japan s experience will soon enough be shared by other major economies including south korea hong kong and eventually china korea for example just recorded for the third quarter the lowest ever fertility rate anywhere 0 88 kids per woman seoul home to one in five south koreans had the country s lowest rate 0 69 in japan s case there s an argument that increased productivity and automation can save the day the earth s balance is fragile enough today never mind in 2050 when 9 7 billion people are expected to walk the planet japan really is humankind s laboratory for figuring out how to produce greater output and wealth with fewer people indeed some thinkers see the glass as half full in a world of rapidly expanding automation potential demographic shrinkage is largely a boon not a threat says adair turner a senior fellow at the new york based institute for new economic thinking our expanding ability to automate human work across all sectors agriculture industry and services makes an ever growing workforce increasingly irrelevant to improvements in human welfare conversely automation makes it impossible to achieve full employment in countries still facing rapid population growth labor consumer pools dry up the imf differs it warns that a rapidly aging population and shrinking labor force are hampering growth its economists say that the aging workforce could knock 1 percentage point off annual gdp for the next three decades the number of working age japanese in the labor force is now the highest since the 1960s as of 2018 the ratio of open jobs per applicant was 1 6 meaning it s about to surpass an all time record reached in 1963 japan it follows is literally running out of even moderately skilled labor denting productivity and top line gdp japan s population began contracting in 2010 since then it s lost more than 1 4 million people between 2010 and 2011 alone the us added 2 3 million bodies to its future workforce looking ahead things look even more dire by 2040 more than a third of japanese will be over 65 the worst old to young ratio in the world today japan is home to roughly 126 million people by 2065 the united nations reckons there will be at least 28 million fewer inhabitants it means that over time japan will have fewer people making goods and performing services and fewer people buying them in the last year there were nearly 68 000 fewer high schools around the nation than 12 months earlier fewer houses are being built as demand drops as moody s investors service pointed out this week demographic dynamics are stretching local government budgets for schools and social welfare programs fewer babies meantime are making this a secular trend not just a cyclical one in 2018 the number of newborns fell to a record low of 918 397 the third straight year of sub 1 million births what this describes is an economic doomsday machine warns us economist robert samuelson author of untruth why the conventional wisdom is almost always wrong the increasing number of older japanese has already put enormous pressure on the government s budget since 1991 he says public social spending mainly for retirement pensions health care and long term care has doubled as a share of gross domestic product from 11 of gdp to 22 of gdp in 2018 japan s debt burden might seem less dire if there were enough young workers taking over for retirees what economists call the replacement rate but there aren t in light of this japan s 10 year government bond yield is at an impossibly low 0 11 compare to 1 8 in the us this is odd considering japan s debt to gdp ratio is approaching 250 while america s is 106 and considering that japan is bleeding workers while the us is comparatively stable read us birthrate falls to lowest point in decades japan shaky solutions prime minister shinzo abe s government has sought to fill the gaps by importing more foreign labor he s nearly doubled the inflows in the last five years yet the 1 45 million foreign workers in japan right now are a drop in the proverbial bucket of what s needed to deepen the labor pool japan also is having a hard time wooing talent put off by inflexible labor laws long work hours and high living costs abe s liberal democratic party also is relying on sale tax hikes to stabilize the national balance sheet this too has been a bit of a wash a 2014 increase to 8 from 5 resulted in a mild recession prodding tokyo to draw up fiscal stimulus packages in plain english that means a step aimed at reducing debt ended up increasing it will last month s hike to 10 require a similarly costly response likely yes given that real wages fell in eight of the first nine months of 2019 exports plunged 9 2 in october from a year ago as us president donald trump s china tariffs upended asian supply chains south korea is in a similarly precarious place both in the short and long runs trump s trade assault on china is slamming south korea s all important export engine the bigger problem is how south korea risks following japan down a demographic rabbit hole korea s standing as the world s 11th biggest economy is being jeopardized by declines in the working age population just as in japan this impedes growth imperils innovation and leads to spiraling health care costs what makes korea s record low fertility rate so worrisome is how hard seoul is working to stabilize things it s spending billions of dollars a year free nurseries subsidized childcare leave cash stipends but still there is no baby boom but for now japan s economic scale and massive debt load take precedence as the imf s special attention attests it s time for tokyo to find a way to raise tax revenues via growth and new job creation preferably from a new generation of scrappy startups that create jobs and new wealth big tax increases are the wrong idea at a moment when japan needs economic tailwinds not headwinds the imf erred terribly in the 1990s when it advised indonesia thailand and south korea to hit the fiscal brakes amid a financial crisis tokyo is hardly there yet but japan would be wise to go its own way incentivizing new growth areas rather than killing demand with ill timed tax increases
let s start by returning to what now seems to be a distant memory the revolutionary shockwave that swept the arab world in 2011 you argued in your book the people want a radical exploration of the arab uprising that these events were only the beginning of a protracted revolutionary process owing to the specific nature of capitalism in the middle east could you explain these dynamics of political economy in the arab world and their relationship to forms of authoritarian rule to begin with a general consideration it is obvious now that we are witnessing a severe global crisis of the neoliberal stage of capitalism neoliberalism developed as a full fledged capitalist stage since the enforcement of its economic paradigm in the 1980s this stage has gone into crisis since the great recession a decade ago the crisis is unfolding under our eyes resulting in ever increasing social upheavals if you look today at what is occurring in chile ecuador lebanon iraq iran hong kong and several other countries it looks like the boiling point is reached by more and more countries the events in the arab region fit into that general global crisis to be sure but there is something specific about that regional upheaval there the neoliberal reforms were carried out in a context dominated by a specific type of capitalism a type determined by the specific nature of the regional state system that is characterised by a combination in various proportions of rentierism and patrimonialism or neopatrimonialism what is mostly specific to the region is the high concentration of fully patrimonial states a concentration unequalled in any other part of the world patrimonialism means that ruling families own the state whether they own it by law under absolutist conditions or just in fact these families regard the state as their private property and the armed forces especially the elite armed apparatuses as their private guard these features explain why the neoliberal reforms got their worst economic results in the arab region of all parts of the world neoliberal inspired changes achieved in the region resulted in the slowest rates of economic growth of any part of the developing world and consequently the highest rates of unemployment in the world specifically youth unemployment the reason for this is not difficult to understand the neoliberal dogma is based on the primacy of the private sector the idea that the private sector should be the driving force of development while the state s social and economic functions must be curtailed the dogma says in a nutshell introduce austerity measures trim the state down cut social expenditure privatise state enterprises and leave the door wide open to private enterprise and free trade and miracles will happen now in a context lacking the prerequisites of ideal typical capitalism starting with the rule of law and predictability without which long term developmental private investment cannot happen what you end up getting is most of private investment going into quick profit and speculation especially in real estate along with construction but not in manufacturing or agriculture not in the key productive sectors this created a structural blockage of development thus the general crisis of the global neoliberal order goes in the arab region beyond a crisis of neoliberalism into a structural crisis of the type of capitalism prevailing there there is therefore no way out of the crisis in the region by a mere change of economic policies within the continued framework of the existing kind of states a radical mutation of the whole social and political structure is indispensable short of which there will be no end in sight to the acute social economic crisis and destabilisation that affects the whole region that s why such an impressive revolutionary shockwave rocked the whole region in 2011 rather than just mass protests the prospect was truly insurrectionary with people chanting the people want to overthrow the regime the slogan that has become ubiquitous in the region since 2011 the first revolutionary shockwave of that year forcefully shook the regional system of states revealing that it had entered a terminal crisis the old system is irreversibly dying but the new cannot be born yet i m referring here of course to gramsci s famous sentence and that s when morbid symptoms start appearing i used that phrase in the title of the 2016 sequel to my 2013 the people want is it true to say that neoliberal measures in the arab world have accelerated despite the revolutionary surge egypt s food prices are rising along with electricity and fuel prices and the conservative estimates of the world bank say about 60 percent of egyptians were either poor or vulnerable all this while the regime has renewed its crackdown on street protesters can you talk about the relationship between counter revolution and accelerated neoliberalism egypt provides a very good example of this indeed when the great recession hit in 2008 many believed that it heralded the end of neoliberalism and that the pendulum would swing back towards the keynesian paradigm that was a huge illusion however for the simple reason that economic policies are not determined by intellectual and empirical considerations they are determined instead and above all by the balance of class forces the neoliberal turn has been steered since the 1980s by fractions of the capitalist class those with a vested interest in financialisation in order to bring a new shift away from that there needs to be a change in the social balance of forces impacting the balance between fractions of the capitalist class itself a change equivalent at least to that which took place in the 1970s and 1980s this did not happen yet and the progressive forces opposed to neoliberalism have not yet proved strong enough to impose change the neoliberals are still running the show they claim that the reason of the global crisis is not neoliberalism but the lack of a thorough implementation of its recipes although they resorted massively in 2008 9 to measures contradicting their own dogma such as the huge bailout of the financial sector by means of state funds they quickly reverted to more and more of the same neoliberal policies pushed further and further that s exactly what we ve got in the arab region despite the gigantic revolutionary shockwave that shook the whole region in 2011 almost every single arabic speaking country saw a massive rise of social protest in 2011 six of the region s countries that is more than a quarter of them witnessed massive uprisings and yet the lesson according to the imf the world bank those guardians of the neoliberal order is that all this happened because their neoliberal recipes hadn t been implemented thoroughly enough the crisis they claimed was due to insufficient dismantling of remnants of yesterday s state capitalist economies they asserted that the solution is to end all forms of social subsidies even more radically than what had already occurred however the reason that governments of the region did not do more of that indeed was because they were afraid to do so this isn t eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall when people swallowed the very bitter pill of massive neoliberal changes in the hope that it would bring them capitalist prosperity in the arab world people are not willing to pay the price for that because they have no illusions that their countries will turn out like western europe as the eastern europeans were brought to believe therefore in order to impose further neoliberal measures on the people brutal force is required egypt is hence a very clear illustration of the fact that the implementation of neoliberalism does not go hand in hand with democracy as fukuyama s end of history fantasy claimed thirty years ago egypt clearly shows that in order to implement thoroughly the neoliberal program in the global south dictatorships are needed the first such implementation was in pinochet s chile of course in egypt it is now the post 2013 dictatorship led by field marshal sisi the most brutally repressive regime that the egyptians have endured in many decades it has gone the furthest in implementing the full neoliberal program advocated by the imf at a huge cost to the population with a steep rise in the cost of living food prices transport prices everything people have been completely devastated the reason why their anger did not explode in the streets on a massive scale is that they are deterred by state terror but the full implementation of the imf s neoliberal recipes has not and will not produce an economic miracle tensions are thus building up and sooner or later the country will erupt again there was already some limited explosion of popular anger last september sooner or later there will be a much bigger one though contexts differ and specificity is always important why did barbarism maintain its head start over the workers and democratic movements throughout the arab world what and why were the turning points of defeat in the region since 2011 what is the state of the egyptian left and the workers movement in the face of sisi s ultra neoliberalism and his authoritarian brutality unfortunately both the left and the workers movement in egypt are in bad shape they have suffered a painful defeat not only due to the brutal comeback of the repressive state but also because of their own contradictions and illusions the major part of the egyptian left has pursued a politically erratic trajectory switching from one misconceived alliance to another from the muslim brotherhood to the military in 2013 most of the left and the independent workers movement supported sisi s coup very short sightedly subscribing to the illusion that the army would put the democratic process back on track they thought that getting rid of morsi and the muslim brotherhood after their year in power would reopen the way to furthering the revolutionary process even though it was brought about by the military it sounds rather silly but they did genuinely hold this illusion which the military fostered in the initial post coup phase the military even co opted the head of the independent workers movement into their first post coup government this terrible blunder discredited the left as well as the independent workers movement as a result the left wing opposition is much weakened and marginalised in today s egypt i m not speaking here of the marxist radical left which has always been marginal although it played a disproportionate role at times during the revolutionary upheaval of 2011 13 i m speaking of the broader left the one that used to appeal to large masses this broader left has lost much of its credibility after 2013 this is actually one crucial reason why people have not mobilised massively against the new neoliberal onslaught when there is no credible alternative people tend to assimilate the regime s discourse that says it s us or chaos us or a syria like tragedy you must accept our iron heel it will be tough but at the end of the day you will find prosperity the egyptians do not really buy the last promise prosperity but they are still paralysed by the fear of falling into a situation much worse still than what they are enduring linked to all that is another specificity of the regional revolutionary process of which syria is the most tragic illustration we already discussed a first specificity the structural crisis that is peculiar to the arab world in the context of the general crisis of neoliberalism the other specificity is that this region has experienced the development over several decades of a reactionary oppositional current which was promoted for many years by the united states alongside its oldest ally in the region the saudi kingdom i mean islamic fundamentalism of course the whole spectrum of this current whose most prominent component is the muslim brotherhood and whose most radical fringe includes al qaeda and the so called islamic state aka isis islamic fundamentalism was sponsored by washington as a main antidote to communism and left wing nationalism in the muslim world during the cold war during the 1970s islamic fundamentalists were green lighted by almost all arab governments as a counterweight to left wing youth radicalisation with the subsequent ebb of the left wing wave they became the most prominent opposition forces tolerated in some countries such as egypt or jordan and crushed in others such as syria or tunisia they were however present everywhere when the 2011 uprisings started muslim brotherhood s branches jumped on the revolutionary bandwagon and tried to hijack it to serve their own political purposes they were much stronger than whatever left wing forces remained in the region very much weakened by the collapse of the ussr while the fundamentalists enjoyed financial and media backing from gulf oil monarchies as a result what evolved in the region was not the classical binary opposition of revolution and counter revolution it was a triangular situation in which you had on the one hand a progressive pole those groups parties and networks who initiated the uprisings and represented their dominant aspirations this pole was organisationally weak except for tunisia where a powerful workers movement compensated for the weakness of the political left and allowed the uprising in this country to score the first victory in bringing down a president thus setting off the regional shockwave on the other hand there were two counter revolutionary deeply reactionary poles the old regimes classically representing the main counter revolutionary force but also islamic fundamentalist forces competing with the old regimes and striving to seize power in this triangular contest the progressive pole the revolutionary current was soon marginalised not or not only due to organisational and material weakness but also and primarily because of political weakness of the lack of strategic vision the situation became dominated therefore by the clash between the two counter revolutionary poles which escalated into a clash of barbarisms as i call it of which syria is the most tragic illustration with a most barbaric syrian regime confronting barbaric islamic fundamentalist forces the huge progressive potential that was represented by the young people who initiated the uprising in syria in march 2011 got completely crushed many of these young people left the country because they couldn t survive either in regime held territories or in territories held by islamic fundamentalist forces much of the syrian progressive potential was thus scattered in europe turkey lebanon and jordan some of it survives inside the country but as long as the war situation lingers on it will be difficult for it to re emerge the kurdish situation in syria is a different story the kurdish pyd ypg in north east syria is undoubtedly the most progressive of all the armed forces active on the ground in syria if not the only progressive force they managed to develop and extend the territory under their control with us backing because washington under obama saw them as efficient foot soldiers in the fight against isis they had their own stake in fighting isis of course since it is a deadly enemy for them their first direct cooperation with the us was indeed in the battle of kobane in 2014 when us air support including airdrops of weapons was decisive in allowing the kurdish fighters to roll back isis s offensive there was thus a convergence of interests between the us providing air support as well as other means and resources and the ypg providing troops on the ground that is what donald trump has let down stabbing the kurds in the back and opening the way to turkey s colonial nationalist and racist onslaught against them their situation has become extremely precarious as they are now caught between turkey s hammer and the syrian regime s anvil between turkish chauvinism and arab chauvinism two projects of ethnic cleansing converging on the project to replace kurds with arabs in syria s border areas with turkey moscow is helping both in this endeavour but the pyd ypg failed to join up consistently with the rest of the struggle against assad s murderous regime i wouldn t put the main blame on them none of the syrian armed opposition forces was open to a true recognition of the kurds democratic and national rights to be sure the pyd ypg are not some reiteration of the paris commune as some tend to portray them quite naively and yet with all their limitations and without fostering illusions about them they represent the most progressive significant organised force on the ground in syria if we take the status of women as our main criterion and it should always be a crucial criterion for progressives there is no match for the pyd ypg add to this that their co thinkers in turkey lead the peoples democratic party hpd the only progressive and feminist major political force in that country what were the most significant theoretical and political lessons to draw out of the previous cycle of revolutionary struggle for marxists we often hear the argument that marxism is orientalist and is thus unsuited to non western societies michel foucault s attitude towards the iranian revolution 1979 was an example of the attempt to find salvation in a non western religious otherness declaring an end to universal visions of human emancipation class politics and marxian theoretical instruments to understand the world so why do you believe that marxist theory is better equipped to make sense of the revolutions and counter revolutions throughout the middle east and north africa what are the prospects for a new generation of arabic speaking marxists activists to develop since 2011 and to what extent has this started taking place the orientalist vision of the region is that it is doomed to be eternally stuck in religion as part of its cultural essence and that religion explains everything and has always been the key motivation of the region s populations that is a completely flawed vision of course which is also very impressionistic in that it ignores the past and believes that the present is going to last forever looking at the middle east and north africa in recent years one may get indeed the impression that islamic fundamentalist forces are prominent everywhere however that wasn t the case a few decades ago especially in the 1950s and 1960s when these forces were marginalised by much stronger left wing forces i was asked to write a preface to the re edition of maxime rodinson s marxism and the muslim world a few years ago this collection of articles most of which were written in the 1960s discusses a part of the world where left wing currents were dominant i had therefore to inform or remind the readers of this historical fact lest they be bewildered in reading the book few realise today that in the 1950s and 1960s it was widely assumed that the arab region was under communist ideological hegemony a moroccan author published in 1967 in french a book entitled contemporary arab ideology where he discussed what he called objective marxism as an ideology that was diffuse in the region by this phrase he meant that people used marxist categories and ideas most of them without even being aware of their origin or take a country like iraq a good example today clerics and mullahs dominate the political scene especially among the shiites but if you fast backward to the late 1950s you ll find that the major struggle in the country opposed communists to baathists the latter subscribing to a nationalist ideology that described itself as socialist the communists were particularly influential among the shiites and were able to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people in demonstrations so think of that iraq and of today s iraq a wide gulf is separating them but it proves that there is nothing in the genes of the region s populations that dooms them to abide by the political guidance of religious forces the most popular political leader in modern arab history was indisputably gamal abdel nasser egypt s president between 1956 and his untimely death in 1970 he went as far to the left as possible within the boundaries of bourgeois nationalism implementing a sweeping nationalisation of the economy along with successive agrarian reforms promoting state led industrial development and bringing a substantial improvement in labour conditions all this on an anti imperialist and anti zionist backdrop although it occurred under harsh dictatorial conditions this was a very progressive phase in egypt s history and it was emulated in several arab countries when you contemplate that history you realise that the role of islamic fundamentalism in recent decades is not rooted in some cultural essence as the orientalist view would have it it is rather the product of specific historical developments as we discussed already it is partly the product of washington s protracted and intensive use of islamic fundamentalism in cahoots with the most reactionary state on earth the saudi kingdom in fighting nasser and the ussr s influence in the arab region and the muslim world when the arab spring as the uprisings were called in 2011 blossomed a new generation entered the struggle on a mass scale the bulk of this new generation aspires to a radical progressive transformation they aspire to better social conditions freedom democracy social justice equality including gender emancipation they reject neoliberal policies and dream of a society in sharp contrast with the programmatic views of those islamic fundamentalist forces that hijacked or tried to hijack the uprisings and lead them towards their own goals there is a huge progressive potential in the region and we have seen it coming back to the fore in the second revolutionary shockwave that is presently unfolding it started in december 2018 with the sudanese uprising followed since last february by the algerian uprising and since october by massive social and political protests in iraq and in lebanon sudan algeria iraq and lebanon are boiling and all other countries of the region are on the brink of explosion what about the role of stalinism in the arab world the soviet union and the communist parties under its leadership have represented the dominant form of marxism in the region for decades there have been several important communist parties in the region all narrowly linked to moscow this meant that the self described marxist literature was heavily dominated by stalinism in the region in the 1950s and 1960s with the global emergence of the new left in the late 1960s and the 1970s new translations allowed access to critical marxist and anti stalinist marxist authors in arabic the rise of a new left in the arab region was boosted by the june 1967 defeat of the arab armies in the so called six day war which dealt a major blow to nasser and his regime a large section of the youth got radicalised beyond both nasserism and stalinism into what often was radical nationalism in a marxist garb rather than plain marxism the arab new left grew significantly in the late 1960s and early 1970s but it failed in building an alternative to the old left let alone an alternative to the powers that be that is the period when the regimes used islamic fundamentalism to nip the new left in the bud most if not all arab governments unleashed and helped islamic fundamentalist groups in the 1970s especially in the universities as an antidote to the new left wing radicalisation they thus contributed significantly to the failure of the radical left of course the latter bears the main responsibility for its own defeat it lacked political maturity and strategic acumen the new radicalisation did not go far beyond previously dominant superficial and dogmatic marxism heavily influenced by stalinism marxism was generally reduced to a few clichés there were exceptions of course but overall original marxist intellectual production in arabic remained very limited leaving aside contributions by marxist thinkers from the region who lived abroad and wrote in european languages such as the late samir amin the most prominent exception was hassan hamdan know under the pen name of mahdi amel he was the most sophisticated intellectual of the lebanese communist party and was assassinated by hezbollah in 1987 an anthology of his writings will come out soon in english translation let s return to the present the algerian uprising and sudan s revolution reignited hope as have the courageous protests in egyptian streets and lebanon s assemblies in riad al solh square calling to topple the current regime at the risk of asking an impossible question to what extent have ordinary people in the region learnt political lessons from the earlier wave of struggle what kind of mass dynamic is involved here how have the oppressed and exploited learnt through the experience of mass struggle have they learnt they have definitely learnt protracted revolutionary processes are cumulative in terms of experience and know how they are learning curves the peoples learn the mass movements learn the revolutionaries learn and the reactionaries learn as well of course everybody learns a long term revolutionary process is a succession of waves of upsurges and counter revolutionary backlashes but they are not mere repetitions of similar patterns the process is not circular it has to move forward or else it degenerates people grasp the lessons of previous experiences and do their best not to repeat the same errors or fall into the same traps this is very clear in the case of sudan but also for algeria and now for iraq and lebanon too sudan and algeria along with egypt are the three countries of the region where the armed forces constitute the central institution of political rule of course armed apparatuses are the backbones of states in general but it is direct military rule that is peculiar to these three countries in the arab region their regimes are not patrimonial no family owns the state to the point of making whatever they wish of it the state is rather dominated collegially by the armed forces command these are neo patrimonial regimes this means that they are characterised by nepotism cronyism and corruption but no single family is in full control of the state which remains institutionally separate from the persons of the rulers that explains why in the three countries the military ended up getting rid of the president and his entourage in order to safeguard the military regime that s what happened in egypt in 2011 with the dismissal of mubarak and this year in algeria with the termination of bouteflika s presidency followed by the overthrow of bashir in sudan all three carried out by the military however when it happened in egypt there were huge popular illusions in the military which were renewed in 2013 when the military deposed muslim brotherhood president morsi these illusions were not reiterated in sudan or algeria in 2019 on the contrary the popular movement in the two countries has been acutely aware that the military constitute the central pillar of the regime that they wish to get rid of the movement in both countries understands very well that when they chant the people want to overthrow the regime they mean military rule as a whole not the presidential tip of the iceberg alone they grasp this very clearly in both algeria and sudan unlike what happened in egypt previously but in sudan there is more than that difference there is a leadership that embodies the awareness of the lessons drawn from all previous regional experiences this is mainly due to the foundation of the sudanese professionals association spa which started in 2016 with teachers journalists doctors and other professionals organising an underground network as the uprising that started in december 2018 unfolded the association developed into a much larger network involving workers unions of all key sectors of the working class it has been playing the central role in the events on the side of the popular movement the spa was also instrumental in the constitution of a broad political coalition involving several parties and groups they are presently engaged in a political tug of war with the military they agreed temporarily on a compromise that instituted what can be described as a situation of dual power the country is ruled by a council in which the leadership of the people s movement is represented alongside the military command this is an uneasy transitional period that can t last very long sooner or later one of the two powers will have to prevail over the other but the key point here is that the sudanese experience represents a massive step forward compared with everything we have seen since 2011 and this is thanks to the existence of a politically astute leadership the spa didn t foster any illusions about the military they are as radically opposed to military rule as they are to islamic fundamentalism especially that both were represented in the regime under omar al bashir they uphold a very progressive program including a remarkable feminist dimension this is a very important experience which is very closely observed all over the region the popular movement in algeria is amazing for having been staging huge mass demonstrations every week for several months now but it has no recognised and legitimate leadership nobody can claim to speak in its name this is an obvious weakness in stark contrast with sudan the forms of leadership naturally change over time but we haven t entered some postmodern age of leaderless revolutions as some want us to believe the lack of leadership is a crucial impediment a recognised leadership is crucial in order to channel the strength of the mass movement towards a political goal this they have in sudan but not in algeria and not yet in iraq or lebanon in both iraq and lebanon however people inspired by the sudanese example are trying to set up something like the spa there are beginnings in that direction involving university teachers along with various professionals in lebanon they created an association of professional women and men clearly inspired by the sudanese model that clearly shows how learning from experience functions at the regional level could you further elaborate about the most significant aspects of the mass movements in iraq and lebanon both movements share a remarkable particularity in that both countries iraq and lebanon are characterised by a sectarian political system in lebanon it has been institutionalised by french colonialism after world war i in a form close to the country s present political system in iraq it was established by the us occupation much more recently such sectarian political regimes thrive off sectarian divisions naturally in their context religious sectarian divisions become the defining feature of political life and government sectarianism is a very pernicious and effective tool in diverting class struggle into religious strife it s an old recipe a version of divide and rule thwart any horizontal solidarity of class versus class by turning it into a vertical clash between sects bourgeois sectarian nepotistic leaderships secure the allegiance of members of the popular classes belonging to their sectarian community by stoking sectarian divisions and rivalries in both iraq and lebanon the accumulation of social grievances resulting from a very wild form of capitalism that crushes ordinary people and deteriorates their standard of living has created a huge resentment the social explosion was triggered by a political measure in iraq the dismissal of a popular military figure and an economic one in lebanon a projected tax on voip communications these measures provoked a formidable outburst of popular anger in lebanon to everybody s surprise the outburst covered the whole country and involved people belonging to all sects in iraq it has been mostly confined to the arab shiite majority but this is equally significant since the ruling clique itself is shiite the movement in both countries has thus strongly repudiated sectarianism in favour of a renewed sense of popular national belonging in lebanon sectarianism was so entrenched historically that it appeared as a very difficult barrier to break it was therefore very amazing to see people belonging to all religious communities participate in an uprising whose key slogan has become the arabic equivalent of the spanish language que se vayan todos all of them must go which was the key slogan of the december 2001 popular revolt in argentina the lebanese version says all of them means all of them a way of insisting on the repudiation of all ruling class members with no exceptions us vs them shifted from sect vs sect to a revolt of the people from below against all members of the ruling caste at the top whichever religious political sect they belong to whether shiite sunni christian or druze hezbollah was not spared and that is even more striking since a sort of taboo regarding the party and particularly its leader had been enforced until then it was astounding to see that people went into the streets in the regions under hezbollah s control despite the party s clear stance against the popular movement since then there have been successive attempts to intimidate the popular movement by thugs belonging to hezbollah and its close ally amal the two shiite sectarian groups in iraq parties and militias linked to the iranian regime engaged in repressing the popular revolt at a much higher scale with much killing that is because tehran s tutelage over iraq s government is a major target of the popular revolt the recent explosion of anger within iran itself was likewise met with brutal repression iran s theocratic regime thus confirms that it is one of the main reactionary forces in the region on a par with its regional rival the saudi kingdom this was already clear from its brutal repression of the democratic popular movement within iran in 2009 as well as from its massive contribution to the syrian regime s counter revolutionary drive starting in 2013 and from its heavy handed repression of the social protests that flared up again in iran at the end of 2017 and early 2018 the role of women in the second wave of the revolutionary process in the arab region is another very important feature and a further indication of the higher degree of maturity achieved by the popular movements in sudan algeria and lebanon women have participated massively and very visibly in the demonstrations and mass rallies as well as in heading them in the three countries feminists have been a crucial component of the groups involved in the uprisings even in iraq where women were hardly visible in the initial stage of the protests they are getting increasingly involved especially since the students joined the mobilisation the big question now is will the popular movements in algeria iraq and lebanon succeed in finding ways to organise like their sudanese brothers and sisters did in order to amplify their struggles impact and achieve major steps towards the fulfilment of their goals or will the ruling classes manage to quell each of these three uprisings and defuse it without being optimistic due the very vicious nature of the regimes that govern this part of the world i have a lot of hope my hope however is based on the knowledge that a huge progressive potential exists while i am perfectly aware that in order to be realised a lot of struggle organisation and political acumen are needed source marxist

a cheaper greenback would boost us exporters image credit sami sert a puzzle is preoccupying the world s currency dealing rooms says john authers on bloomberg the global economy is beset by tariff wars and political instability yet we are living through unusually low foreign exchange volatility the us dollar has not had a weekly swing of more than 2 against other developed market currencies for two years the last time this happened was in the mid 1970s a market truism is that financial stability generates instability this period of curious tranquillity might portend a new long term trend the arrival of a weaker us dollar the end of the trend the stars are aligning for a weaker dollar agrees louis vincent gave of gavekal research the federal reserve is back in easing mode a us china trade truce could stoke risk appetite and encourage investors to venture out of dollar assets in america the bursting of the start up unicorn bubble and talk of a left wing democratic presidential candidate are also bearish for the greenback a weaker dollar would be good news for the world economy it would mean cheaper financing costs for companies in emerging markets it would also help us exporters and boost corporate earnings time to take out insurance de dollarisation is already afoot says rana foroohar in the financial times china is doing more business in euros and recently issued euro denominated bonds deglobalisation is upon us and history shows that asset price collapses in the country associated with the old order usually follow no wonder gold bugs abound see page 14
central bank meetings and the us jobs report will kick off the final month of 2019 next week energising the markets as many traders return from the thanksgiving break in the united states the nonfarm payrolls report will of course be the main highlight as a positive print there could further add to the improving picture for the us economy fuelling the dollar but the ism manufacturing and non manufacturing pmis will also be key in directing the greenback in the coming days elsewhere both the reserve bank of australia and the bank of canada are expected to stand pat gdp figures out of australia will also be watched making it a busy week for aussie traders meanwhile in commodities major oil producers will be meeting in vienna to decide what output quotas to set rba meeting and q3 gdp in focus for aussie the risk sensitive australian dollar has been unable to capitalize on the trade deal optimism as the australian economy appears too caught up in the us china trade dispute for the outlook to brighten anytime soon talk of quantitative easing isn t helping the aussie either even though rba governor philip lowe has suggested the country is a fair way from it lowe will get another chance to set the record straight next week when the rba meets on tuesday for its final gathering of the year interest rate futures currently point to a 90 probability that the cash rate will be kept at 0 75 in december but investors are in no doubt the rba will ease again next year the question is how soon will the next cut arrive the clues will lie not only in the rba s policy statement but also in a batch of q3 data due from australia next week third quarter numbers on business inventories next exports contribution and gross domestic product gdp are released on monday tuesday and wednesday respectively gdp is forecast to have expanded by 0 5 quarter on quarter in the three months to september the same pace as in the second quarter in addition october data on building approvals monday and retail sales thursday will be monitored as well as the caixin ihs markit manufacturing pmi out of china on monday japanese household spending likely slumped in october after japan s worse than expected retail sales figures for october this week all eyes will be on household spending numbers next friday which should provide a broader look at how consumption held up following the sales tax hike on october 1 household spending is expected to have plunged by 9 8 month on month in october somewhat better than the 14 drop recorded in april 2014 when the sales tax last went up wage growth figures will also be published on the same day total cash earnings growth turned positive in september having declined for most of the year a further pick up in wage growth in october could ease concerns about a sustained drop in consumption if the household spending data is dismal ahead of friday s releases the third quarter estimate for capital expenditure will be watched on monday which is usually a good indicator as to whether the initial gdp growth reading is prone to a revision however unless there is a shockingly big decline in household consumption next week s data is unlikely to stir much of a reaction in the yen as the bank of japan has set the bar high for further monetary easing final pmis to be european highlight it will be a relatively quiet week in the eurozone and the united kingdom with the main attraction being ihs markit s final pmi prints as well as german industrial orders and output numbers the final manufacturing pmi is up first on monday with the services pmi coming up on wednesday the uk will also get the construction pmi due on tuesday both the euro and the pound came under pressure from last week s flash releases for november which showed unexpected weakness in the services sector the two currencies therefore stand to make some gains if there s any upward revisions to the final readings particularly in the services pmis perhaps of more significance for the euro though are german industrial indicators for october any sign that the manufacturing downturn in europe s largest economy is bottoming out could help lift the single currency out of the doldrums industrial orders are due on thursday while industrial output is out on friday other data worth observing are revised eurozone gdp estimates for the third quarter and october retail sales figures on thursday bank of canada expected to hold rates steady market odds of a december rate cut by the bank of canada shot up after governor stephen poloz revealed that the governing council discussed the merits of an insurance cut at their october 30 meeting however those expectations quickly reversed after poloz changed his tune three weeks later sounding a more neutral tone investors currently see less than a 5 chance of a rate cut on wednesday when the boc holds its last policy meeting of the year a rate cut in 2020 is also not looking as certain as it did just a few weeks ago nevertheless poloz will likely reiterate at the meeting that the risks remain tilted to the downside as the trade war rumbles on unusually however those shifting expectations have not been reflected in the dollar loonie pair with the canadian dollar maintaining its post october meeting losses as us data since then has been dollar supportive while canadian indicators have been on the weak side pressuring the loonie if poloz fails to clarify the boc s stance traders may be able to take their cues from canada s employment report for november on friday more dollar upside from nfp the us dollar has been crawling higher over the past week as positive trade headlines and encouraging economic pointers from the us have delivered a double boost for the currency the run of upbeat releases could continue next week with the ism pmis and the all important jobs report the ism manufacturing pmi is out on monday and is forecast to rise from 48 3 to 49 4 in november which would confirm other recent data suggesting that the sector may be starting to recover the adp private employment survey on wednesday should provide a clue as to what to anticipate from friday s government report more importantly on wednesday the ism non manufacturing pmi will be viewed closely the ism s composite index which measures services and other non manufacturing activity is forecast to ease slightly to 54 5 in november after jumping to 54 7 in the prior month more data will follow on thursday with october trade numbers and factory orders but the market focus will really be on friday s nonfarm payrolls report the headline nfp figure for november is expected at 183k an improvement on the previous month s gain of 128k jobs no change is forecast in the unemployment rate of 3 6 while average earnings are projected to have risen by 0 3 m m accelerating slightly from the prior month last but not least the university of michigan s preliminary consumer sentiment survey will also be doing the rounds on friday if next week s numbers are broadly positive the dollar is likely to extend its gains though the bulls may struggle to overcome key resistance points its facing versus the euro and the yen at 1 10 per euro and 109 60 yen respectively opec meeting a downside risk for oil prices opec russia and other major producers are scheduled to meet next thursday and friday to decide whether to extend the current output cap deal beyond march 2020 the consensus view is that the opec led alliance will agree to extend the deal until june though a longer extension until the end of 2020 is possible saudi arabia has been calling for even deeper cuts as it tries to boost prices ahead of the initial public offering of the state owned oil giant saudi aramco however others like russia are against further production cuts that s not to say a surprise announcement of bigger cuts to the existing quotas should be discounted but most reports suggest there isn t enough support for tighter output restrictions and with many industry analysts predicting a supply glut in the early parts of 2020 it s looking unlikely that oil prices will be able to extend their bullish phase into next year
the euro hovered around its lowest levels for this month on friday as the dollar held its poise on hopes that the united states and china would be able defuse their damaging tariff war with a preliminary trade deal the u s currency also gained from data showing the world s biggest economy is on a firm footing which prompted investors to scale back their rate cut bets u s economic growth picked up slightly in the third quarter data showed on wednesday in contrast to other indicators pointing to a slowdown in global activity the federal reserve also flagged an upbeat outlook amid signs of labour market strength and a possible turnaround in business investment that prompted a pullback on rate cut bets for this year and next with the market now pricing in a 5 chance the fed will hike rates next month and most expecting it to hold steady traders will be watching the release of the flash euro zone inflation data at 1000 gmt economists polled by reuters are expecting the year on year harmonised index of consumer prices to rise to 0 9 in november from 0 7 in october which could steer investors towards growth opportunities outside of the united states too still any euphoria related to this is likely to be limited said thu lan nguyen a currency analyst at commerzbank noting that the rise is due to the change in the calculation methodology members of the european central bank are discussing the potential for a new definition of the inflation target which now stands at below but close to 2 the euro was last trading neutral at 1 1009 having climbed back from the two week low of below 1 10 it dropped to this week the dollar was flat against the safe haven japanese yen at 109 52 though very close to breaking another six month high the chinese yuan the most sensitive currency to the trade war was also flat and inside recent ranges as most other major currencies nerves persisted within markets as traders navigated a blizzard of trade war headlines that offered few clues as to when or how a truce might be agreed between washington and beijing china has vowed to impose firm countermeasures after u s president donald trump s approval of a bill backing hong kong s pro democracy protesters on wednesday but is yet to indicate whether they would have any bearing on trade talks negotiators between the world two biggest economies have been trying for weeks to hammer out a phase 1 trade deal with markets hoping an agreement could be signed before year end there seems to be pretty good optimism around the trade talks going on between u s and china said william o loughlin a portfolio manager at rivkin securities in sydney though as we know that can change on a dime the rally doesn t feel like a euphoric super bullish rally it does feel like climbing the wall of worry
nicole laframboise an international monetary fund imf economist didn t mince her words on monday when she wrapped up the fund s latest review of the state of haiti the poorest country in the americas the political economic and social crisis confronting haiti is without precedent said laframboise head of the imf mission to a nation that has been hit by violent protests in the past year against its president jovenel moise amid anger over fuel and food shortages and allegations of economic mismanagement and general political corruption the unrest forcing schools public offices and businesses to close for weeks at a time has pushed inflation up towards an annual rate of 20 per cent and is likely to tip haiti where more than half of the population live below the poverty line on less than 2 41 a day into recession this year for the first time since it was struck by a devastating earthquake in 2010 it s also driven a more than 30 per cent slump in the value of the local currency the gourde against the dollar over the past 12 months that creates an additional headache for irish businessman denis o brien whose digicel phone company is one of haiti s biggest outside investors at just about the worst possible time read more digicel is currently weighing options on how to deal with 1 3 billion of company debt that falls due in april 2021 the odds are stacked against it according to fitch one of the world s main credit ratings firms it warned last week that digicel s wider debt structure with almost 7 billion of borrowings is unsustainable digicel s rapid growth over the past 18 years into a business with 13 3 million customers spanning 32 markets across the caribbean central america and asia pacific region has been built on the back of o brien flogging a particular type of debt junk bonds these are deemed by credit ratings firms to be below what they call investment grade and command high market interest rates or yields fitch now says the company will struggle to refinance the 2021 bond and is likely to seek a debt restructuring arrangement with holders of the notes this in turn could trigger a restructuring of other debt including 3 8 billion of bonds that would ordinarily be due to mature between 2022 and 2024 fitch analyst sul ahmad told the irish times debt market investors left with a sour taste in their mouths after an aggressive debt restructuring that concluded in january will be waiting in the long grass denis s previous love affair with the bond market has soured said a us based manager of a fund that holds digicel bonds who declined to be identified he kicked the can down the road last time round in a way that was not very friendly to bondholders next time will be much harder for him disclosed dividends the junk rated borrowings have helped the group to invest more than 5 billion developing its networks since o brien set it up in jamaica in 2001 after netting about 200 million from his sale of esat telecom to bt group the previous year they also allowed o brien take at least 1 9 billion of disclosed dividends out of the group between 2007 and 2015 luck had long been on his side like when digicel sold 1 4 billion of high cost debt in february 2007 just days before financial markets tumbled some 800 million of the amount raised was used to fund dividends mainly to o brien the entrepreneur boasted at the time to forbes that he could have sold the bonds five times over look when the ducks are hungry you have got to feed them he said you feed them with pieces of paper in more recent times the ducks have felt more like the sitting kind against the backdrop of falling sales and earnings o brien last year went about restructuring 3 billion of digicel debt that was due to be repaid in 2020 and 2022 to give the group breathing space following months of negotiations digicel managed in january to convince owners of most of these bonds to put off getting their money back for a further two years it involved bondholders swapping the notes for longer dated paper in a deal that was classified as a distressed debt exchange by ratings firms o brien refused demands during those negotiations from groups of bondholders represented by us law firms akin gump and milbank tweed hadley mccloy to inject fresh equity into the business according to sources close to the negotiations the prospect of a debt for equity swap was not on the table at the time they said discount the bondholders have paid the price most of the new securities handed out in the exchange rank towards the back of the queue in terms of recovery should digicel run into financial trouble the 937 million of new 2022 subordinated debt started trading in january at a 50 per cent discount they are currently changing hands at about 25 cents on the dollar the 979 million of new 2024 notes are currently trading at a little over 16 cents on the dollar reflecting a market perception of the risk of bondholders not recovering in full what they are owed the price of the bonds is telling you clearly that the market believes there s no equity cushion in the business said the fund manager digicel s chief executive of less than a year belgian telecoms veteran jean yves charlier told bondholders on a call on tuesday that haiti one of the group s three top earnings contributors alongside jamaica and papua new guinea stands out as the biggest external risk facing the company according to sources this took away from an underlying improvement in the company s sales and revenues in the three months to the end of september its second financial quarter the previous day digicel revealed to creditors that the gourde s decline lay behind a 26 million currency hit to its results for the quarter it turned an underlying 4 per cent increase in revenues for the period into a 1 per cent decline to 554 million and led to a 1 per cent decrease in earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortisation ebitda to 249 million underlying sales were helped by the fact that digicel which like phone companies globally had been battling with declining mobile voice revenues in recent years has seen a surge in mobile data sales in the past year as it continues to roll out fourth generation or 4g networks across the caribbean and pacific islands data revenues jumped 15 per cent in the second quarter to 233 million making up more than half of total mobile revenues which stood at 430 million voice revenues continued to decline during the period ten years ago digicel could go into a country undercut the incumbent usually a sleepy former state monopoly and build up a share of the more than 50 per cent share of the mobile market within 18 months or two years said the fund manager but over time its competitors have gotten better and it now has to do a lot more work to make money while revenue from digicel s business solutions and home entertainment covering fibre and broadband have been growing strongly in recent years these areas still only make up about a quarter of group sales on the call management emphasised progress made on underlying revenues in mobile especially data business solutions and home and entertainment said one source while the data figures are encouraging they are still not enough to fully offset lower voice revenues adverse impact and high leverage bondholders took some comfort in the fact that the company which saw stabilisation in its business in the first quarter after years of decline has maintained its full year forecasts for revenue to grow by a low to mid single digit percentage and earnings to expand by a mid single digit still gross borrowings are set to amount to an unsustainably high seven times ebitda cash burn too remains an issue the group s cash position fell to 180 million in september from 214 million three months earlier and 279 million in march the general view among analysts and investors is that o brien has long regretted pulling a planned initial public offering ipo of the business four years ago it was a deal that aimed to raise 2 billion mainly to pay down debt but the businessman baulked at the 11th hour when it became clear that investors were looking for an equity stake of more than 50 per cent liquidity remains weak by the company s own admission said a source on the earnings call adding that management vaguely highlighted the possibility of raising money from asset sales headroom fitch highlighted that digicel international finance ltd difl a company within the group s corporate web has some headroom to issue debt secured against its assets but any significant additional borrowings incurred at difl would strain overall finances it said investors on the conference call hoping for some insight on how digicel plans to handle the 2021 bonds were left disappointed o brien knows that these notes will need to be dealt with in the coming months to avoid a cliff edge crisis when the debt actually falls due management only offered that they were evaluating financing options and were not complacent about the upcoming debt maturities two of the sources said the operations are showing indications of improvement but the headwinds continue and the growth may not be enough to stabilise the company s capital structure one of the sources said dropped hints as the markets eye a round of tougher debt restructuring negotiations within the next six months o brien has dropped hints elsewhere that he may strike a more conciliatory tone this time around than during the last round when asked at a deutsche bank debt conference in arizona in recent months whether he would be prepared to inject equity into the business the malta tax resident said all options were on the table according to one source who was present i took that as significant in the restructuring talks last year he just said no the source said the us fund manager said o brien would need to pump as much as 500 million into digicel there is a strong view in the markets that the businessman has access to the funds even if he is better known in ireland for the estimated loss of at least 450 million he made on an investment in newspaper group independent news media inm new equity could be used to offer to buy back a chunk of digicel s 1 9 billion of those restructured subordinated bonds that are due in 2022 and 2024 which are trading at between 16 and 25 cents on the dollar according to the fund manager buying all that debt back at current market rates would cost less than 400 million it s difficult to see a favourable outcome without an injection of fresh equity said an analyst that follows digicel orange meanwhile digicel has its eye on 346 million that french telecoms giant orange has sitting in an escrow account a paris court ruled in 2017 that orange owed digicel the money after it was found to have abused a dominant position between 2000 and 2005 in the french west indies an appeal is due to be heard early next year it is understood that part of any final award would have to be shared with french phone company buoygues telecom which sold its french west indies business to digicel in 2006 if digicel secured enough take up on a buyback offer as well as a favourable ruling from the paris court it may clear the way for o brien to refinance the 1 3 billion of 2021 notes through a straightforward bond sale according to analysts however they cautioned digicel would also have to show continued underlying improvement in its business haiti where the company has over 4 5 million customers stands out as the biggest obvious risk aside from the impact of a depreciating gourde on digicel s earnings company executives highlighted on the bondholder call how power outages have hit mobile users ability to charge their phones at times for the moment subscribers in haiti remain loyal helping to deliver a 11 per cent increase in underlying revenue in the market in the second financial quarter to 88 million but the country remains on a knife edge according to the imf it is important to note that a continuation of the current political crisis would have devastating consequences for the country over the longer term owing to the likely losses of physical and human capital said laframboise we sincerely hope that political stability will return o brien and his digicel creditors do too

the imf is reviewing its approach to unorthodox central bank tools such as currency intervention and capital flow management as it looks to create a modern policy framework that better reflects the needs of developing economies in a more integrated global market system the move marks a departure from its traditional role as an advocate of conventional monetary policy the fund is in talks with a number of countries finance ministers and central banks to devise a new integrated policy framework david lipton first deputy managing director of the imf tells euromoney our aim is that over time we will be able to have a more complete playbook to help he says our advice will be to countries that are free sailing in choppy waters which is different to a programme or a crisis a lot of the work we are doing is focused on macro prudential tools and capital flow measures to modulate the breadth of the likely outcomes and avoid extreme booms and busts these markets are so big that even a sizeable intervention won t make a huge difference david lipton imf free markets a liberalized exchange rate and an open economy have been central tenets of the imf s advice on monetary policy since the fund was formed in 1945 but greater dollarization and integration of financial markets has meant that smaller economies are now more exposed than ever to global market forces prompting a re think on its advice
let s start by returning to what now seems to be a distant memory the revolutionary shockwave that swept the arab world in 2011 you argued in your book the people want a radical exploration of the arab uprising that these events were only the beginning of a protracted revolutionary process owing to the specific nature of capitalism in the middle east could you explain these dynamics of political economy in the arab world and their relationship to forms of authoritarian rule to begin with a general consideration it is obvious now that we are witnessing a severe global crisis of the neoliberal stage of capitalism neoliberalism developed as a full fledged capitalist stage since the enforcement of its economic paradigm in the 1980s this stage has gone into crisis since the great recession a decade ago the crisis is unfolding under our eyes resulting in ever increasing social upheavals if you look today at what is occurring in chile ecuador lebanon iraq iran hong kong and several other countries it looks like the boiling point is reached by more and more countries the events in the arab region fit into that general global crisis to be sure but there is something specific about that regional upheaval there the neoliberal reforms were carried out in a context dominated by a specific type of capitalism a type determined by the specific nature of the regional state system that is characterised by a combination in various proportions of rentierism and patrimonialism or neopatrimonialism what is mostly specific to the region is the high concentration of fully patrimonial states a concentration unequalled in any other part of the world patrimonialism means that ruling families own the state whether they own it by law under absolutist conditions or just in fact these families regard the state as their private property and the armed forces especially the elite armed apparatuses as their private guard these features explain why the neoliberal reforms got their worst economic results in the arab region of all parts of the world neoliberal inspired changes achieved in the region resulted in the slowest rates of economic growth of any part of the developing world and consequently the highest rates of unemployment in the world specifically youth unemployment the reason for this is not difficult to understand the neoliberal dogma is based on the primacy of the private sector the idea that the private sector should be the driving force of development while the state s social and economic functions must be curtailed the dogma says in a nutshell introduce austerity measures trim the state down cut social expenditure privatise state enterprises and leave the door wide open to private enterprise and free trade and miracles will happen now in a context lacking the prerequisites of ideal typical capitalism starting with the rule of law and predictability without which long term developmental private investment cannot happen what you end up getting is most of private investment going into quick profit and speculation especially in real estate along with construction but not in manufacturing or agriculture not in the key productive sectors this created a structural blockage of development thus the general crisis of the global neoliberal order goes in the arab region beyond a crisis of neoliberalism into a structural crisis of the type of capitalism prevailing there there is therefore no way out of the crisis in the region by a mere change of economic policies within the continued framework of the existing kind of states a radical mutation of the whole social and political structure is indispensable short of which there will be no end in sight to the acute social economic crisis and destabilisation that affects the whole region that s why such an impressive revolutionary shockwave rocked the whole region in 2011 rather than just mass protests the prospect was truly insurrectionary with people chanting the people want to overthrow the regime the slogan that has become ubiquitous in the region since 2011 the first revolutionary shockwave of that year forcefully shook the regional system of states revealing that it had entered a terminal crisis the old system is irreversibly dying but the new cannot be born yet i m referring here of course to gramsci s famous sentence and that s when morbid symptoms start appearing i used that phrase in the title of the 2016 sequel to my 2013 the people want is it true to say that neoliberal measures in the arab world have accelerated despite the revolutionary surge egypt s food prices are rising along with electricity and fuel prices and the conservative estimates of the world bank say about 60 percent of egyptians were either poor or vulnerable all this while the regime has renewed its crackdown on street protesters can you talk about the relationship between counter revolution and accelerated neoliberalism egypt provides a very good example of this indeed when the great recession hit in 2008 many believed that it heralded the end of neoliberalism and that the pendulum would swing back towards the keynesian paradigm that was a huge illusion however for the simple reason that economic policies are not determined by intellectual and empirical considerations they are determined instead and above all by the balance of class forces the neoliberal turn has been steered since the 1980s by fractions of the capitalist class those with a vested interest in financialisation in order to bring a new shift away from that there needs to be a change in the social balance of forces impacting the balance between fractions of the capitalist class itself a change equivalent at least to that which took place in the 1970s and 1980s this did not happen yet and the progressive forces opposed to neoliberalism have not yet proved strong enough to impose change the neoliberals are still running the show they claim that the reason of the global crisis is not neoliberalism but the lack of a thorough implementation of its recipes although they resorted massively in 2008 9 to measures contradicting their own dogma such as the huge bailout of the financial sector by means of state funds they quickly reverted to more and more of the same neoliberal policies pushed further and further that s exactly what we ve got in the arab region despite the gigantic revolutionary shockwave that shook the whole region in 2011 almost every single arabic speaking country saw a massive rise of social protest in 2011 six of the region s countries that is more than a quarter of them witnessed massive uprisings and yet the lesson according to the imf the world bank those guardians of the neoliberal order is that all this happened because their neoliberal recipes hadn t been implemented thoroughly enough the crisis they claimed was due to insufficient dismantling of remnants of yesterday s state capitalist economies they asserted that the solution is to end all forms of social subsidies even more radically than what had already occurred however the reason that governments of the region did not do more of that indeed was because they were afraid to do so this isn t eastern europe after the fall of the berlin wall when people swallowed the very bitter pill of massive neoliberal changes in the hope that it would bring them capitalist prosperity in the arab world people are not willing to pay the price for that because they have no illusions that their countries will turn out like western europe as the eastern europeans were brought to believe therefore in order to impose further neoliberal measures on the people brutal force is required egypt is hence a very clear illustration of the fact that the implementation of neoliberalism does not go hand in hand with democracy as fukuyama s end of history fantasy claimed thirty years ago egypt clearly shows that in order to implement thoroughly the neoliberal program in the global south dictatorships are needed the first such implementation was in pinochet s chile of course in egypt it is now the post 2013 dictatorship led by field marshal sisi the most brutally repressive regime that the egyptians have endured in many decades it has gone the furthest in implementing the full neoliberal program advocated by the imf at a huge cost to the population with a steep rise in the cost of living food prices transport prices everything people have been completely devastated the reason why their anger did not explode in the streets on a massive scale is that they are deterred by state terror but the full implementation of the imf s neoliberal recipes has not and will not produce an economic miracle tensions are thus building up and sooner or later the country will erupt again there was already some limited explosion of popular anger last september sooner or later there will be a much bigger one though contexts differ and specificity is always important why did barbarism maintain its head start over the workers and democratic movements throughout the arab world what and why were the turning points of defeat in the region since 2011 what is the state of the egyptian left and the workers movement in the face of sisi s ultra neoliberalism and his authoritarian brutality unfortunately both the left and the workers movement in egypt are in bad shape they have suffered a painful defeat not only due to the brutal comeback of the repressive state but also because of their own contradictions and illusions the major part of the egyptian left has pursued a politically erratic trajectory switching from one misconceived alliance to another from the muslim brotherhood to the military in 2013 most of the left and the independent workers movement supported sisi s coup very short sightedly subscribing to the illusion that the army would put the democratic process back on track they thought that getting rid of morsi and the muslim brotherhood after their year in power would reopen the way to furthering the revolutionary process even though it was brought about by the military it sounds rather silly but they did genuinely hold this illusion which the military fostered in the initial post coup phase the military even co opted the head of the independent workers movement into their first post coup government this terrible blunder discredited the left as well as the independent workers movement as a result the left wing opposition is much weakened and marginalised in today s egypt i m not speaking here of the marxist radical left which has always been marginal although it played a disproportionate role at times during the revolutionary upheaval of 2011 13 i m speaking of the broader left the one that used to appeal to large masses this broader left has lost much of its credibility after 2013 this is actually one crucial reason why people have not mobilised massively against the new neoliberal onslaught when there is no credible alternative people tend to assimilate the regime s discourse that says it s us or chaos us or a syria like tragedy you must accept our iron heel it will be tough but at the end of the day you will find prosperity the egyptians do not really buy the last promise prosperity but they are still paralysed by the fear of falling into a situation much worse still than what they are enduring linked to all that is another specificity of the regional revolutionary process of which syria is the most tragic illustration we already discussed a first specificity the structural crisis that is peculiar to the arab world in the context of the general crisis of neoliberalism the other specificity is that this region has experienced the development over several decades of a reactionary oppositional current which was promoted for many years by the united states alongside its oldest ally in the region the saudi kingdom i mean islamic fundamentalism of course the whole spectrum of this current whose most prominent component is the muslim brotherhood and whose most radical fringe includes al qaeda and the so called islamic state aka isis islamic fundamentalism was sponsored by washington as a main antidote to communism and left wing nationalism in the muslim world during the cold war during the 1970s islamic fundamentalists were green lighted by almost all arab governments as a counterweight to left wing youth radicalisation with the subsequent ebb of the left wing wave they became the most prominent opposition forces tolerated in some countries such as egypt or jordan and crushed in others such as syria or tunisia they were however present everywhere when the 2011 uprisings started muslim brotherhood s branches jumped on the revolutionary bandwagon and tried to hijack it to serve their own political purposes they were much stronger than whatever left wing forces remained in the region very much weakened by the collapse of the ussr while the fundamentalists enjoyed financial and media backing from gulf oil monarchies as a result what evolved in the region was not the classical binary opposition of revolution and counter revolution it was a triangular situation in which you had on the one hand a progressive pole those groups parties and networks who initiated the uprisings and represented their dominant aspirations this pole was organisationally weak except for tunisia where a powerful workers movement compensated for the weakness of the political left and allowed the uprising in this country to score the first victory in bringing down a president thus setting off the regional shockwave on the other hand there were two counter revolutionary deeply reactionary poles the old regimes classically representing the main counter revolutionary force but also islamic fundamentalist forces competing with the old regimes and striving to seize power in this triangular contest the progressive pole the revolutionary current was soon marginalised not or not only due to organisational and material weakness but also and primarily because of political weakness of the lack of strategic vision the situation became dominated therefore by the clash between the two counter revolutionary poles which escalated into a clash of barbarisms as i call it of which syria is the most tragic illustration with a most barbaric syrian regime confronting barbaric islamic fundamentalist forces the huge progressive potential that was represented by the young people who initiated the uprising in syria in march 2011 got completely crushed many of these young people left the country because they couldn t survive either in regime held territories or in territories held by islamic fundamentalist forces much of the syrian progressive potential was thus scattered in europe turkey lebanon and jordan some of it survives inside the country but as long as the war situation lingers on it will be difficult for it to re emerge the kurdish situation in syria is a different story the kurdish pyd ypg in north east syria is undoubtedly the most progressive of all the armed forces active on the ground in syria if not the only progressive force they managed to develop and extend the territory under their control with us backing because washington under obama saw them as efficient foot soldiers in the fight against isis they had their own stake in fighting isis of course since it is a deadly enemy for them their first direct cooperation with the us was indeed in the battle of kobane in 2014 when us air support including airdrops of weapons was decisive in allowing the kurdish fighters to roll back isis s offensive there was thus a convergence of interests between the us providing air support as well as other means and resources and the ypg providing troops on the ground that is what donald trump has let down stabbing the kurds in the back and opening the way to turkey s colonial nationalist and racist onslaught against them their situation has become extremely precarious as they are now caught between turkey s hammer and the syrian regime s anvil between turkish chauvinism and arab chauvinism two projects of ethnic cleansing converging on the project to replace kurds with arabs in syria s border areas with turkey moscow is helping both in this endeavour but the pyd ypg failed to join up consistently with the rest of the struggle against assad s murderous regime i wouldn t put the main blame on them none of the syrian armed opposition forces was open to a true recognition of the kurds democratic and national rights to be sure the pyd ypg are not some reiteration of the paris commune as some tend to portray them quite naively and yet with all their limitations and without fostering illusions about them they represent the most progressive significant organised force on the ground in syria if we take the status of women as our main criterion and it should always be a crucial criterion for progressives there is no match for the pyd ypg add to this that their co thinkers in turkey lead the peoples democratic party hpd the only progressive and feminist major political force in that country what were the most significant theoretical and political lessons to draw out of the previous cycle of revolutionary struggle for marxists we often hear the argument that marxism is orientalist and is thus unsuited to non western societies michel foucault s attitude towards the iranian revolution 1979 was an example of the attempt to find salvation in a non western religious otherness declaring an end to universal visions of human emancipation class politics and marxian theoretical instruments to understand the world so why do you believe that marxist theory is better equipped to make sense of the revolutions and counter revolutions throughout the middle east and north africa what are the prospects for a new generation of arabic speaking marxists activists to develop since 2011 and to what extent has this started taking place the orientalist vision of the region is that it is doomed to be eternally stuck in religion as part of its cultural essence and that religion explains everything and has always been the key motivation of the region s populations that is a completely flawed vision of course which is also very impressionistic in that it ignores the past and believes that the present is going to last forever looking at the middle east and north africa in recent years one may get indeed the impression that islamic fundamentalist forces are prominent everywhere however that wasn t the case a few decades ago especially in the 1950s and 1960s when these forces were marginalised by much stronger left wing forces i was asked to write a preface to the re edition of maxime rodinson s marxism and the muslim world a few years ago this collection of articles most of which were written in the 1960s discusses a part of the world where left wing currents were dominant i had therefore to inform or remind the readers of this historical fact lest they be bewildered in reading the book few realise today that in the 1950s and 1960s it was widely assumed that the arab region was under communist ideological hegemony a moroccan author published in 1967 in french a book entitled contemporary arab ideology where he discussed what he called objective marxism as an ideology that was diffuse in the region by this phrase he meant that people used marxist categories and ideas most of them without even being aware of their origin or take a country like iraq a good example today clerics and mullahs dominate the political scene especially among the shiites but if you fast backward to the late 1950s you ll find that the major struggle in the country opposed communists to baathists the latter subscribing to a nationalist ideology that described itself as socialist the communists were particularly influential among the shiites and were able to mobilise hundreds of thousands of people in demonstrations so think of that iraq and of today s iraq a wide gulf is separating them but it proves that there is nothing in the genes of the region s populations that dooms them to abide by the political guidance of religious forces the most popular political leader in modern arab history was indisputably gamal abdel nasser egypt s president between 1956 and his untimely death in 1970 he went as far to the left as possible within the boundaries of bourgeois nationalism implementing a sweeping nationalisation of the economy along with successive agrarian reforms promoting state led industrial development and bringing a substantial improvement in labour conditions all this on an anti imperialist and anti zionist backdrop although it occurred under harsh dictatorial conditions this was a very progressive phase in egypt s history and it was emulated in several arab countries when you contemplate that history you realise that the role of islamic fundamentalism in recent decades is not rooted in some cultural essence as the orientalist view would have it it is rather the product of specific historical developments as we discussed already it is partly the product of washington s protracted and intensive use of islamic fundamentalism in cahoots with the most reactionary state on earth the saudi kingdom in fighting nasser and the ussr s influence in the arab region and the muslim world when the arab spring as the uprisings were called in 2011 blossomed a new generation entered the struggle on a mass scale the bulk of this new generation aspires to a radical progressive transformation they aspire to better social conditions freedom democracy social justice equality including gender emancipation they reject neoliberal policies and dream of a society in sharp contrast with the programmatic views of those islamic fundamentalist forces that hijacked or tried to hijack the uprisings and lead them towards their own goals there is a huge progressive potential in the region and we have seen it coming back to the fore in the second revolutionary shockwave that is presently unfolding it started in december 2018 with the sudanese uprising followed since last february by the algerian uprising and since october by massive social and political protests in iraq and in lebanon sudan algeria iraq and lebanon are boiling and all other countries of the region are on the brink of explosion what about the role of stalinism in the arab world the soviet union and the communist parties under its leadership have represented the dominant form of marxism in the region for decades there have been several important communist parties in the region all narrowly linked to moscow this meant that the self described marxist literature was heavily dominated by stalinism in the region in the 1950s and 1960s with the global emergence of the new left in the late 1960s and the 1970s new translations allowed access to critical marxist and anti stalinist marxist authors in arabic the rise of a new left in the arab region was boosted by the june 1967 defeat of the arab armies in the so called six day war which dealt a major blow to nasser and his regime a large section of the youth got radicalised beyond both nasserism and stalinism into what often was radical nationalism in a marxist garb rather than plain marxism the arab new left grew significantly in the late 1960s and early 1970s but it failed in building an alternative to the old left let alone an alternative to the powers that be that is the period when the regimes used islamic fundamentalism to nip the new left in the bud most if not all arab governments unleashed and helped islamic fundamentalist groups in the 1970s especially in the universities as an antidote to the new left wing radicalisation they thus contributed significantly to the failure of the radical left of course the latter bears the main responsibility for its own defeat it lacked political maturity and strategic acumen the new radicalisation did not go far beyond previously dominant superficial and dogmatic marxism heavily influenced by stalinism marxism was generally reduced to a few clichés there were exceptions of course but overall original marxist intellectual production in arabic remained very limited leaving aside contributions by marxist thinkers from the region who lived abroad and wrote in european languages such as the late samir amin the most prominent exception was hassan hamdan know under the pen name of mahdi amel he was the most sophisticated intellectual of the lebanese communist party and was assassinated by hezbollah in 1987 an anthology of his writings will come out soon in english translation let s return to the present the algerian uprising and sudan s revolution reignited hope as have the courageous protests in egyptian streets and lebanon s assemblies in riad al solh square calling to topple the current regime at the risk of asking an impossible question to what extent have ordinary people in the region learnt political lessons from the earlier wave of struggle what kind of mass dynamic is involved here how have the oppressed and exploited learnt through the experience of mass struggle have they learnt they have definitely learnt protracted revolutionary processes are cumulative in terms of experience and know how they are learning curves the peoples learn the mass movements learn the revolutionaries learn and the reactionaries learn as well of course everybody learns a long term revolutionary process is a succession of waves of upsurges and counter revolutionary backlashes but they are not mere repetitions of similar patterns the process is not circular it has to move forward or else it degenerates people grasp the lessons of previous experiences and do their best not to repeat the same errors or fall into the same traps this is very clear in the case of sudan but also for algeria and now for iraq and lebanon too sudan and algeria along with egypt are the three countries of the region where the armed forces constitute the central institution of political rule of course armed apparatuses are the backbones of states in general but it is direct military rule that is peculiar to these three countries in the arab region their regimes are not patrimonial no family owns the state to the point of making whatever they wish of it the state is rather dominated collegially by the armed forces command these are neo patrimonial regimes this means that they are characterised by nepotism cronyism and corruption but no single family is in full control of the state which remains institutionally separate from the persons of the rulers that explains why in the three countries the military ended up getting rid of the president and his entourage in order to safeguard the military regime that s what happened in egypt in 2011 with the dismissal of mubarak and this year in algeria with the termination of bouteflika s presidency followed by the overthrow of bashir in sudan all three carried out by the military however when it happened in egypt there were huge popular illusions in the military which were renewed in 2013 when the military deposed muslim brotherhood president morsi these illusions were not reiterated in sudan or algeria in 2019 on the contrary the popular movement in the two countries has been acutely aware that the military constitute the central pillar of the regime that they wish to get rid of the movement in both countries understands very well that when they chant the people want to overthrow the regime they mean military rule as a whole not the presidential tip of the iceberg alone they grasp this very clearly in both algeria and sudan unlike what happened in egypt previously but in sudan there is more than that difference there is a leadership that embodies the awareness of the lessons drawn from all previous regional experiences this is mainly due to the foundation of the sudanese professionals association spa which started in 2016 with teachers journalists doctors and other professionals organising an underground network as the uprising that started in december 2018 unfolded the association developed into a much larger network involving workers unions of all key sectors of the working class it has been playing the central role in the events on the side of the popular movement the spa was also instrumental in the constitution of a broad political coalition involving several parties and groups they are presently engaged in a political tug of war with the military they agreed temporarily on a compromise that instituted what can be described as a situation of dual power the country is ruled by a council in which the leadership of the people s movement is represented alongside the military command this is an uneasy transitional period that can t last very long sooner or later one of the two powers will have to prevail over the other but the key point here is that the sudanese experience represents a massive step forward compared with everything we have seen since 2011 and this is thanks to the existence of a politically astute leadership the spa didn t foster any illusions about the military they are as radically opposed to military rule as they are to islamic fundamentalism especially that both were represented in the regime under omar al bashir they uphold a very progressive program including a remarkable feminist dimension this is a very important experience which is very closely observed all over the region the popular movement in algeria is amazing for having been staging huge mass demonstrations every week for several months now but it has no recognised and legitimate leadership nobody can claim to speak in its name this is an obvious weakness in stark contrast with sudan the forms of leadership naturally change over time but we haven t entered some postmodern age of leaderless revolutions as some want us to believe the lack of leadership is a crucial impediment a recognised leadership is crucial in order to channel the strength of the mass movement towards a political goal this they have in sudan but not in algeria and not yet in iraq or lebanon in both iraq and lebanon however people inspired by the sudanese example are trying to set up something like the spa there are beginnings in that direction involving university teachers along with various professionals in lebanon they created an association of professional women and men clearly inspired by the sudanese model that clearly shows how learning from experience functions at the regional level could you further elaborate about the most significant aspects of the mass movements in iraq and lebanon both movements share a remarkable particularity in that both countries iraq and lebanon are characterised by a sectarian political system in lebanon it has been institutionalised by french colonialism after world war i in a form close to the country s present political system in iraq it was established by the us occupation much more recently such sectarian political regimes thrive off sectarian divisions naturally in their context religious sectarian divisions become the defining feature of political life and government sectarianism is a very pernicious and effective tool in diverting class struggle into religious strife it s an old recipe a version of divide and rule thwart any horizontal solidarity of class versus class by turning it into a vertical clash between sects bourgeois sectarian nepotistic leaderships secure the allegiance of members of the popular classes belonging to their sectarian community by stoking sectarian divisions and rivalries in both iraq and lebanon the accumulation of social grievances resulting from a very wild form of capitalism that crushes ordinary people and deteriorates their standard of living has created a huge resentment the social explosion was triggered by a political measure in iraq the dismissal of a popular military figure and an economic one in lebanon a projected tax on voip communications these measures provoked a formidable outburst of popular anger in lebanon to everybody s surprise the outburst covered the whole country and involved people belonging to all sects in iraq it has been mostly confined to the arab shiite majority but this is equally significant since the ruling clique itself is shiite the movement in both countries has thus strongly repudiated sectarianism in favour of a renewed sense of popular national belonging in lebanon sectarianism was so entrenched historically that it appeared as a very difficult barrier to break it was therefore very amazing to see people belonging to all religious communities participate in an uprising whose key slogan has become the arabic equivalent of the spanish language que se vayan todos all of them must go which was the key slogan of the december 2001 popular revolt in argentina the lebanese version says all of them means all of them a way of insisting on the repudiation of all ruling class members with no exceptions us vs them shifted from sect vs sect to a revolt of the people from below against all members of the ruling caste at the top whichever religious political sect they belong to whether shiite sunni christian or druze hezbollah was not spared and that is even more striking since a sort of taboo regarding the party and particularly its leader had been enforced until then it was astounding to see that people went into the streets in the regions under hezbollah s control despite the party s clear stance against the popular movement since then there have been successive attempts to intimidate the popular movement by thugs belonging to hezbollah and its close ally amal the two shiite sectarian groups in iraq parties and militias linked to the iranian regime engaged in repressing the popular revolt at a much higher scale with much killing that is because tehran s tutelage over iraq s government is a major target of the popular revolt the recent explosion of anger within iran itself was likewise met with brutal repression iran s theocratic regime thus confirms that it is one of the main reactionary forces in the region on a par with its regional rival the saudi kingdom this was already clear from its brutal repression of the democratic popular movement within iran in 2009 as well as from its massive contribution to the syrian regime s counter revolutionary drive starting in 2013 and from its heavy handed repression of the social protests that flared up again in iran at the end of 2017 and early 2018 the role of women in the second wave of the revolutionary process in the arab region is another very important feature and a further indication of the higher degree of maturity achieved by the popular movements in sudan algeria and lebanon women have participated massively and very visibly in the demonstrations and mass rallies as well as in heading them in the three countries feminists have been a crucial component of the groups involved in the uprisings even in iraq where women were hardly visible in the initial stage of the protests they are getting increasingly involved especially since the students joined the mobilisation the big question now is will the popular movements in algeria iraq and lebanon succeed in finding ways to organise like their sudanese brothers and sisters did in order to amplify their struggles impact and achieve major steps towards the fulfilment of their goals or will the ruling classes manage to quell each of these three uprisings and defuse it without being optimistic due the very vicious nature of the regimes that govern this part of the world i have a lot of hope my hope however is based on the knowledge that a huge progressive potential exists while i am perfectly aware that in order to be realised a lot of struggle organisation and political acumen are needed source marxist

elekta ab publ otcpk ektaf q3 2019 earnings conference call november 28 2019 4 00 am et company representatives richard hausmann president chief executive officer gustaf salford chief financial officer cecilia ketels head of investor relations conference call participants michael jungling morgan stanley sebastian walker ubs johan unnerus pareto securities patrick wood bank of america kit lee jefferies veronika dubajova goldman sachs david adlington jpmorgan oliver reinberg kepler cheuvreux cecilia ketels good morning everyone a warm welcome to the presentation of elekta s second quarter in the fiscal year 2019 and 20 my name is cecilia ketels and i m head of investor relations at elekta with me here today in the slide presentation i have dr richard hausmann elekta s president and ceo and gustaf salford our cfo and on the screen you can see the agenda of today richard will start by explaining the development and some highlights in the quarter then gustaf will take you through more details on the financials and at the end richard will summarize the key findings and the outlook for the coming quarters and of course there will be a q a session at the end with questions both from the audience here in stockholm and from the conference call but before we start let me remind you that the information discussed here today including our projections on the revenue on the operating profit cash flow project and product development include forward looking statements and these statements include uncertainties and risks and therefore the actual results may differ materially from what is set out in the statements here and with that i hand over to you richard richard hausmann thank you very much cecilia good morning everybody here in the room and good morning everybody on the phones and the screens q2 performance as we already know as you already know because of our interim report two weeks ago it was a mixed quarter let me go into that in a bit more detail but before i do that what i would like to reiterate what elekta is really standing for and we are standing for precision radiation medicine actually we are precision radiation medicine and it means that we want to provide everyone in need for cancer care with the most precise and the most personalized therapy possible that s our mission that s what we are standing for the precession gives the ability to really target the tumor only and save as much healthy tissue as possible i think that s why we have the best solutions for that one not only with our unity but also with our existing systems even starting with the gamma knifes and the brachy systems for example and then the personalization comes of course and precision comes of course also with our software tools which gives the right information about the patient at the right point in time to the clinicians to the technician to anybody who is involved in the process of treatment but we are standing for radiation that s our core competence that s what we are really good our engineers their ability to target to really focus the radiation beam to the spot where it s needed that s our core competence thatâ s what we are standing for that one and want to bring to everybody around the world even in the emerging countries and the world medicine stands for the idea that our software tools really not only managed the radiation therapy but also other treatment methods like medical oncology or chemotherapy immunotherapy as well as surgery because we all know that cancer treatment is not a one way street into radiation therapy it is a combination of a lot of efforts and methods and we bring software tools to our clients which really help to manage this complexity very well so i just got an email this morning by chance from australia a customer thanking us personally right for the installation of a mosaiqâ plaza system on st vincent s hospital and chain in australia which ran so seamless that he really sent me a personalized letter yeah that s not happened often and i m really happy about that it came right in time so that s what we are standing for now just a few highlights off the quarter in terms of our presence astro chicago 2019 few weeks ago enormous response on our booth user meeting with 700 plus people attending doubling the leads compared to the years before i m not saying that every lead leads to a final order but it gives a tendency of interest into our products and itâ s not only unity it was the whole spectrum for mosaiqâ plaza our new tps version of monaco and our linac coming off etcetera so itâ s a complete spectrum which grabbed attention in the context of precision radiation medicine the same happened just a week ago actually the beginning of this week in japan on jastro which is japanese astro if you will in nagoya where there the first jastro where we officially where able so to say to offer unity because unity got released in japan in may this year and the interest was also enormous we see japan as one of the major markets for unity because as we all know japan is a very high tech very advanced radiotherapy market one of our strong holds for example was with the gamma knife as you know and that is the tier 1 hospitals in this country it will definitely have a lot of interest and shows a lot of interest in our unity so that is so to say another stone in the mosaiq of where we get our unity now going and the paradigm shift in radiation therapy so jastro and just also recently last week as well the ciie this is the chinese international input exhibition itâ s interesting you know that chinaâ s the most exporting but they also want to show that they are importing and they do of course and radiation therapy equipment is one of the major topics they are importing because the local competition is rather moderate in that aspect so i was personally there last year this year ioannis our head of sales and marketing was there signing around about 30 tendered different purchase agreements as you know chine is not black and white itâ s more always on a gray side but these are really interesting agreements not only related to purchasing but also to collaborations with the academy of science in china etcetera and universities which is very important and a very big success factor of us as elekta in china a huge connection to the education and training efforts of the country to promote radiation therapy and the surrounding softer tools so that was a quite positive event as well and then last but not the least i had the pleasure to sign a collaboration contract with a russia company rusatom they will actually produce for us in russian in moscow our infinity product for the russian market localization of the product to that extern to harvest also the quite massive investment plans which are existing with the new oncology program in russia you see the numbers of linac they a planning now to implement in the country 2020 60 and then totally the next five years around 137 linac of course there is a need for localization thatâ s a typical thing our main competitor also went that way before earlier bit and i think that s an enabler for us also in the country to participate in those tenders even more successfully so that is a thing which we signed interesting enough in germany for whatever reason between russia and our swedish company elekta that is a little bit marketing in a sense of awards we are pretty proud and i think our team should be proud about those various awards i just want to highlight a few of them the tsia award is actually an award for our service innovations technical service innovations like the preventative maintenance the artificial intelligence support behind those topics etcetera which i m very proud about because that is something which clears uptime and it s seen there were lot of design awards which were more related to the unity and the user interface and the whole setup of unity for patient friendliness and user friendliness and there is one on the upper right side which is the iop the institute of physics award for business innovation on the unity side for the paradigm shifting idea of adapting based on high quality high field mri images and through the treatment planning as well as adoption with that so thatâ s just a little bit of summary of what is happening which i think is a good feedback for our employees all over the world participating in our product development and our service coming to the numbers i would like to say that our quarter was in a context you know our business is not â is a volatile business in the sense of quarters but if you look at the overall trend on our growth both on orders and net sales i think over the last three or four years itâ s quite significant we also on the ebitda margin side we re on a different level again if you want to say that but we came from a level of under 10 we are now â after a little bit of this tweak with the change of our revenue recognition system so to speak in 2018 2019 it was a little bit artificial you should iâ ll show the real number but you should be little bit inter polite between that but we now have done 18 average 12 months average level with the perspective which weâ ll come to later to increase it even further coming now to the quarter two this was a mixed quarter i think you remember what i said two weeks ago mixed quarter in the sense that we had good growth but we also had one off effects on foreign exchange rate and delayed installations which affected our profitability negatively and iâ m not happy about that thatâ s what i clearly said the organic order intake was plus 5 this is a growth but also that could be higher but that s the quarterly changes i will come to that in a second the organic net sales growth was 7 good delivery good start of installations don t forget that we have in our different systematic but we are more dependent on delays because we are depending on the fact that the customer really starts installation or we start installation at the customer and that we ship it to the â we ship it off the factories this is easy to control this is not so easy to control them i m pretty proud about the 7 we are guiding for 8 to 10 for this year that is in line with that and we have always typically a stronger second half of the year as you know gross margin development was pretty stable 41 ebitda margin was a real disappointing thing that s why we also went out and did this interim report of 14 5 3 5 percentage points lower than expected mostly affected by foreign exchange rate 200 basis points and 150 basis points were related to some shifts in installation so the installation readiness start off installations mostly on the gamma knife side but also a few linac which of course are only shifts and will come back in the future so â but if you now take this quarter and relate that to the first half here the same number on the left side but now look at the first half here we have a total organic order growth of 17 which i think is quite as satisfactory weâ re getting that sales growth of plus 8 in line with our guidance the gross margin increased by 1 5 percentage points roughly compared to last year and the ebitda margin is of course because of the second quarter and also not to optimize the first quarter as usual on a low level but will recover in the quarters to come not fully and that s why we re guided from the 19 to the 18 okay for the full year if i look at the regions order income wise we have pretty good order growth in north and south america as a combined region very strong development in canada mexico and colombia we had also 3 growth in the u s we have not published that number but there probably comes questions anyway 3 growth thatâ s not what i would really look for and maybe look for more but it was still growth in the u s only market we had an agreement with premier in q2 which is a large independent purchasing organization which is a very good basis starting point for future business we had two new elekta unity orders in the quarter so overall quite a good and strong development in this region going to asia pacific good order intake overall good development in india singapore malaysia taiwan south east asia weâ re not talking too much about it but iâ m always more and more convinced that we have real good management in that area and good dynamics and see that it was 23 we had three new elekta unity orders in this region and we continue gaining market share and china have strong market share leadership with independent sources so iâ m not doing only marketing but are we looking at independent ipsos data in china what was not satisfactory was emea so the middle of our few of the world and that is most â was mostly driven by a weak europe middle east africa was quite strong and the dynamics with the new management as i expressed last time already is very very positive but europe itself was a weak quarter but thatâ s seasonal it s not a systemic thing itâ s a seasonal thing we lost a few orders now here and there but there are other tenders going on where we have high chances of winning in the quarters to come there was only one new elekta unity order in turkey so also northern europe so weâ re expecting a few â quite a few more elekta unity orders projects running which are â should ve been decided a few of them already in q2 but they are now going into q3 so that was also missing that made europe not the greatest performing region this quarter this last quarter but as i said its volatility of this project business which shouldn t astonish us too much but doesn t make us happy in terms of first half it looks different yeah we have 17 in north and south america 12 in middle east africa and europe 26 so overall strong growth adding to this 17 which i mentioned before if you look at unity the number which we are always tracking 75 orders in mid of 2020 we are right now at 64 in total we added two in north america one only in turkey as i said three in asia pacific you see the distribution very confident about our 75 in the middle of next year i think we will make the 75 ready at the end of the fiscal year to be honest so that s a good dynamic in the overall unity order income but what makes me even more happy is our customers are happy with the unity yeah and more and more customers are happy with the unity and more and more customers say this is a new way of treating it s a unique method for strong therapy for german this is actually easy to translate the swedish statement has a unique method for radiation therapy there was this â it was set by zahra taheri kadkhoda chief medical â section chief at uppsala university hospital where we went live now a few weeks ago but that was not the only one we actually have now added in total five new clinical installations iâ ll come to that slide in a second in the quarter five new clinical unity s which is quite a bit this is a slide which i got from my team because i asked for a slide which explains why unity is a paradigm shift and they gave me that slide and this slide really tells you a story because that is a rather straightforward application usually for radiations therapy namely prostate so sorry it s not gender neutral now itâ s just men and from that point of view what you see here is the prostate changes the size the shape actually everything location every single day of treatment and what happen here and that is a case from negrar verona who got the system actually only a few weeks ago also but they are doing this paradigm shifting way of treatment already five fractions only for a prostate think about it in the united states in the payment model of today there are 30 to 40 fractions done on a prostate with the same plan the whole time yeah the whole time and they are now incentivized with the new payment models to reduce the fraction which is very good for the patients and for the payers by the way this is five fractions one week treatment compared to four or five weeks treatment think about going back and forth to radiation therapy this makes a difference needless to say that you can only do that because you adapt every time the treatment volume to the particular situation of the prostate tumor and in that way you can enhance increase the dose and you save so much healthy tissue and reduce side effects this is the story this is the story it s not even esoteric applications it s just the prostate and that is also the reason why the second system in utrecht the second unit in utrecht does only prostates only prostates thatâ s the whole load off the system because it does it so much better so much faster so much less fractions and so much less costs that s the story and i think this is really tells you the story needless to say that this also tells you the story that on our system we basically have 16 beams so we really optimize the field itâ s basically a remapped equivalent for the so many different directions of beams that it s more or less continuous so that also shows how we optimize the treatment these were the 18 installed unityâ s which were â these are actually the 11 installed unityâ s before the quarter these are the ones which are now installed after the quarter plus the two which are installed already in the first month of this quarter and you see the team is getting extremely international people have now done roughly 510 520 patients already on the systems so continuous growth installation speed is really outpacing our competition on that side and the feedback is really very very positive so â and this itâ s a routine system now for all these customers i just wanted to stop here and give the microphone to gustaf for the more financial details you saw that i m getting quite excited when i talk about unity so let s talk about numbers first and then iâ ll tell you a little bit about our future gustaf gustaf salford thank you richard so iâ ll briefly take you through the financials and i will focus a bit on revenue of course but also what happened down to the ebitda margin and then based on working capital and cash flow aspects of it so if you look on the p l perspective as richard mentioned 7 growth and if you break it down into solutions and service that i think is a very important way of looking at our business you see a strong service number 8 being driven by the increase in our installed base that s growing with around 8 on a rolling 12 month basis north and south america came in at 1 we saw good growth in u s and we saw good growth in mexico and we saw good growth in brazil if you look at europe middle east africa it was 8 up and drivers were accounts like turkey south africa and egypt to more the emerging markets in that region and then asia pacific 13 a strong number especially from china they had 20 revenue growth in the quarter and india as well and then if you go further down the p l we come down to the ebitda of 14 5 and it was really about this negative impact from fx and the delayed installations and if you look at the fx effect i just want to take this opportunity to explain it a bit i bet there was a lot of a question around this of course after the release of the preliminary results and there were a couple of key drivers explaining it and if we start with the currency movements in q2 you see euro sek was 0 8 up u s dollars 0 7 but you see a big increase in the pound versus the swedish krona that was of course because of the stabilization of the brexit discussions in october so october explains a lot of this change as well if you then think about the share revenue and the share costs we have around 25 in europe of revenue 50 in dollars in the u s but also in many parts of the world but only 5 in pounds of course only to the u k but if you look at the share cost perspective the euro is 22 dollars is around 20 from our organization in the u s but we have a lot of cost 25 in pounds relating to our crawley facility with effect and increase of the 7 of the pound we got negative ebitda impact from these changes but it was not only that it was also balance sheets effects so if you go through the p l effect of the currencies weâ ve got a positive impact on revenue because the sek is weak compared to the dollar and the euros but then you get the negative effect on comps and expenses and that was primarily the strengthening of the pound as you see here you go further down in the p l and you get the fx differences in the p l what you see in the statements and that was a big number in the quarter minus 120 and that was really about the cash flow and balance sheet hedges but you also have some smaller currencies like turkish lira indian rupee south african rand that can be difficult to hedge and that was a big move in the quarter as well in order to get to the ebitda effect in the quarter you also reverse lost years fx effect in the p l so on the ebida impact in the quarter it was around minus 50 but you should have expected it to be around plus 20 so that s the 70 million to 75 million sek that explains the 200 basis points in the quarter impacting ebitda if we move onto expenses you see that selling expenses increased by 7 versus last year in the quarter and driven by more investments in capturing market growth a bit relating to astro as well and more elekta digital resources and elekta unity resources out in the regions admin expenses sticks out a bit in the quarter 18 of up but we have a couple of one offs there and kick off of it related products when it comes to operational excellence in our procurement divisions but also inventory management and so on and itâ s also partly litigation costs for humediq litigation that was ongoing in the last couple of weeks and months here so thatâ s the key drivers for admin if you look at r d net r d and what you find in the p l it s minus 3 in the quarter and the explanation is really in the graph to the right where you see that capitalization increased from the one in q1 to 135 in the quarter whereas the amortization is quite flat between the quarters because we re amortizing on the unity project primarily and we expect that the capitalization will increase a bit as we go along when we launch more projects like around elekta digital but also our linac platforms but most r d in relation to sales the kpi for us is still at the 10 level coming down to working capital and its impact on the cash flow because it is the key driver in the quarter for the cash also the ebidta bridge iâ ll come back to the working capital so if you look at the ebitda bridge and see versus last year half year now we came in at 16 last year but if you adjust for the main divesture or main business in q1 last year you know its 14 9 and then you see the very positive volume and product mix impact on the underlying business we have additional costs for â and like the unity and digital and some additional admin costs but it s really about the fx rate differences that i talked about previously you put back the amortizing and then you come to 14 2 in ebitda if i then come to the working capital bridge and the drivers for the cash flow there s two corresponding effect i would say you see that the net working capital as a percentage of sales is flat at minus 7 versus a last quarter you see a big increase in brexit inventory the 270 million relating to our brexit mitigation plan because end of october was the height on that mitigation plan when it comes to inventory and now we re focusing on driving that down during the next couple of quarters due to the stabilization on the brexit discussions but at the same time we were able to reduce accrued income reduce accounts receivable a bit i would have liked to see a bit more but also so customer advances is coming back so those three effects i would say are offsetting each other so going forward looking to the next two quarters we re focusing a lot of course to bring down the brexit inventory to zero and then also to continue to work with our invoicing and collection process that we have seen and lot of good developments in during the second quarter so with that i would like to hand it over to richard again for the outlook richard hausmann thank you yeah and i pick up immediately what gustaf just said so in principle these are the two major drivers for the rest of the year as i said we are pretty booked in the second half of the year so we want to drive our profitability forward and we want to get our cash flow in particular this brexit thing is in order on the profitability drivers we see â we expect and see already in the second half of the year some of our cost of goods sold initiatives kicking in so that improvements will â can start to be harvested in the second half we will drive strong installation pipelines we cannot completely compensate the misses probably but we are trying on the cash flow side we will get rid of the brexit inventory we have been outdone twice so to say the brexit mitigation and nothing happened so in other words we think that it s now kind of hard brexit will not come is our assumption and even if so we still have some inventory but we work it down till the end of the fiscal year which will reduce quite some cash we had kind of 50 linac pre produced i mean to be safe to be on the safe side but we will now of course install them and ship them and we will as gustaf already said weâ ll continue to improve our invoicing collection process because i can tell you we still have a lot of work to do there we re centralizing a lot in our business center in warsaw which i think is the right way to go forward but there are some glitches and so happening which weâ ll sort out and then overall i just wanted to mention one other thing which we did in the last two quarter more or less in the background without talking too much about it we have changed our internal organization at elekta towards a business line focused organization so five different business lines and are driving our business forward into the regions where basically we do the real business with our customer but this generates much more accountability much more identification with the individual business lines â business lines iâ ll come to that and also make us faster and more customer focused that s quite a cultural change to be honest because we go from what call it a big ship a big boat going in a direction to five speed boats going maybe a little off because we want to try out something but drive the boats fast and effective these are the five business lines oncology informatics solutions mr linac solutions driving the paradigm shifts and donâ t get excited now again but you know what i m talking about linac solutions have a lot of good things coming out of the linac side you remember the value of linac and other things that is also very important because this is the neuro solution the gamma knife ms verena leading it and the brachy solutions and interesting enough these are small businesses compared to the linac business and are sometimes a little bit under estimated in the regions now with this more personalized focus and team focus on individual products we already see that for example the brachy business gets a totally different attention now by our own sales force in the regions highly profitable business and we see good momentum there already and so from that point view we empower the ownership with really good leaders as well clear indication of the people with the products and the solutions including service by the way increased customer focus being closer to the customer to get the input what is necessarily how to improve how to optimize and be more agile thatâ s a cultural change in elekta which i think is necessary to enable us for future growth profitable growth and that brings me to the guidance which we have changed for this year but we have not changed for the out scenario we are guiding for 18 as i said not fully seen to be compensating but we have missed in the second quarter we continue the success of electra unity very optimistic about that one to be very clear in particular because of the customer feedback and the speed up which we see recently in our installations going clinical etcetera harvesting the mosaiq plaza platform introduction which we have done at various shows and we are really â we have now basically completing the user interphase and slickness in the system execution of our cogs reduction program as i mentioned before secured installation pipeline and continue our cost control which we are quite good at with this continuous attention so in that sense we are basically guiding for the same numbers in the years to come and in summary i think we are accelerating the mr linac paradigm shifts right now it s really a true paradigm shift it s more than just another product believe me and i think our major competitor will also at some point realize that we have a very good order growth in emerging markets which i think is a very important enabler for additional installed base and the additional service profitability profitability is impacted by one offs that is an unfortunate thing and we do have a lot of things to do to omit this to get rid of this one offs in the future but there is a very good underlying business with strong outlook for the total product portfolio at elekta and with that i just wanted to mention that maybe some of you will join us tomorrow but tomorrow we will go to tã¼bingen to one of our elekta unity installations which have benefited on a lot of patients a lot of reflections already and we will be able to watch a live patient treatment there with that i ll give it back to you cecilia ketels yeah then we open up for the q a session and we ll start with questions here in the audience but while we are handing out the microphone operator can you state how to ask the questions through the conference call please question and answer session operator so cecilia back to you cecilia ketels thank you unidentified analyst yes a question regarding your installation capacity and since that seems to an issue in this quarter could you elaborate a little bit on what youâ re doing how to increase your installation capacity as we are facing longer installation times for unity than for other linear accelerators i mean is it difficult to find people to do it is it the question of time or education of these people richard hausmann yeah okay good question it s actually we have to differentiate between the different products i mean the one delay which we had was on the gamma knife on the gamma knife we have a long term higher again on our orders and sales we have for example there there is a lot of machinery necessarily a loading system to get the sources in etcetera we additionally have already now a group to ourselves with an additional loading machine so we can install more people are not an issue but it has to be scheduled on the linac side we are working down our â there are two things we are working down our installation times now quite significantly by optimizing the processes and we installed more of linac than we ever did frankly and we shouldn t underestimate that we are on a really high there but it s not the people so we have good people working more efficiently on the mr linac it s a learning curve i would say and that s not unusual you know first of all we changed our principle of installations that we bring together basically the components of the mr linac at the customer side which is i think the right way to do it but still if you had to learn a bit but you see in the growing clinical sites now seven and four months two months in a way thatâ s quite moving and that pace we keep and we try more and more people now â weâ re getting more and more people to be either linac or mr linac the business lines will also help a bit because they were focused on the individual business installations so i think it s not an overall restriction we have but we are on a high pace right now unidentified analyst anything about how long time it takes to install unity and how much people needs to be committed from your side to do it a richard hausmann at the moment i would say we are probably around 18 weeks or something to completely do unity and there are different people onsite in different phases for example there is a logistics company doing â bringing the stuff in etcetera then our pre installers come then the magnet people come then our tuning team comes so to say that one or two persons are typically on site in this phase unidentified analyst and if its 18 weeks now what would you be satisfied with going forward richard hausmann that s an interesting question for me to be honest because i would say i would go below ten realistically i think between 13 and 15 will be a good time it is a complex system thereâ s no question unidentified analyst thank you unidentified analyst yeah two questions first to gustaf could you expand why total receivable is somewhat improving more sequentially after that increase we saw in the first quarter and secondly on u s orders only growing 3 i know two total americas were down quite significantly in the second quarter last year but how would you describe the year over year comparison in the u s isolated thank you a gustaf salford okay so if i start with accounts receivable i think it s always important to look at the asset percentage of revenue to start there if you look at in the quarter we collected a lot we ve worked a lot through the process i mentioned on previous quarter the u s i think we have fixed that however there are some more collections to be done there we had one challenge in italy that i mentioned in the first quarter we fixed that â itâ s this e invoicing and databases that you have around europe that you need to get the invoices correctly into the system we fixed that but itâ s also about collecting those volumes so i think we have seen good progress there but more to come in the next two quarters richard hausmann in particular also i mean if i recall the automated â the more automating and centralized invoicing into the united states customers was also paired with little things which were incorrect and then the customers didn t feel the necessity to pay those kinds of things and this we fixed now in the time of course it just comes from the centralization also which i think is the right way to do it and automization digitalization and the robots also kind of robots behind that to make it less manual less prone for error but still we have to kind of get the child sickness out a little bit a gustaf salford and i think the way to go is to really look at digital platforms and there are a couple of good ones that we are working with right now to implement across the business to have to connect the customers and suppliers to have that clarity because still itâ s quite a lot of paper based invoicing around the world itâ s not an efficient process so something we are working on unidentified analyst what do you think for when we end the year that you could be back at working capital that s minus 10 of sales is that realistic gustaf salford i mean there are these two big factors that is brexit and thatâ s around 400 million and then its ar and accrued income i would say and that could be an additional say 200 million that will take you below the minus 10 that we have been talking about but i think minus 10 is a level where we should be able to operate under the current circumstances gustaf salford for the future i think i will say we have an â as elekta we have to learn to get more even through the year itâ s not only we make you nervous but also we are nervous always at the beginning because our cash flow is behind everything is behind no reason for that because we have a very constant operative mode now with revenue being taken steadily and more and more steadily so i think that s something which we need to â which weâ re working on and need to fix cecilia ketels operator i think weâ ll take questions from two persons and then weâ ll come back to the audience unidentified analyst what about the u s orders richard hausmann yeah so the question was isolatedâ unidentified analyst how was u s orders doing in the second quarter last year was that also a really bad quarter because total americas was down some 40 i think a richard hausmann if you remember last q2 u s is primarily the services service was very weak but the underlying solutions part of the orders were growing but it was a poor quarter in q2 in isolation yes order wise unidentified analyst and the 3 you talked about now is that total orders or solution orders orâ a richard hausmann total orders total orders unidentified analyst solution was that up as well in the quarter in the u s a richard hausmann yes solution was up yes cecilia ketels okay now we hand over to the operator operator thank you very much we have the first question is line of michael jungling at morgan stanley please go ahead hello mr jungling please go ahead with your question your line is now open can you hear me at all michael jungling hello itâ s michael can you hear me operator yes we can hear you now thank you very much michael jungling great great thank you so i have three questions firstly on the guidance for the ebitda margin of around 18 can you give me the specific amount that you are looking into for fx differences in operations so the amounts that is backing up that 18 margin guidance question number two is can you give us an update on the u s proposed new payment model it appears that may have been delayed for next year but i would like to get some more details off you if i can and then question number three is slide 25 the ebitda bridge i can t get the math to work and i was wondering whether you could let me know what â what iâ m doing anything wrong in terms of getting from one side on the left hand side to the right hand side it didn t seem to quite match up if you could perhaps provide some clarity thank you a richard hausmann okay maybe you start with the fx and i can take the slide out gustaf salford yeah so if you look at the fx where we mentioned minus 50 ebitda effect in the second quarter if you look ahead michael you know that you can reverse the effect from last year s fx impact in the p l and there you will see a positive impact compared to last year in the second half so overall i would say we are â we have stopped kind of guide for number for the full year but it is a positive number that is similar to what we saw in the beginning of the year so expect positive ebitda impacts in both q3 and q4 and i advise you to start with these reversals of last year s p l effect if you lookedâ michael jungling so like a bit concerned then it does concern then so your saying that the line fx difference and operation for q3 and q4 that those will be positive amounts a gustaf salford no iâ m not saying that your question was more on the ebitda effect and i tried to give you what is visible already when it comes to the fx and it s kind of last yearâ s p l effects those were negative in q3 and q4 and you can find it in the reports and those will be done reverse so to say in this year itâ s very difficult to see what the revenue impact is on expenseâ michael jungling i was specifically after the fx differences in operation what is in that 18 margin guidance for the full year is it 150 million minus the 200 million what are you thinking please with respect to that line item gustaf salford so we see it as a positive number in the end of the year we see positive effects in both q3 and q4 from that so q3 and q4 should offset the negative effect we have seen in the first half michael jungling thank you richard hausmann maybe taking this u s payment model michael before gustav goes into the ebida bridge yeah you re right i mean there is some headwind from different lobbies including the proton therapy lobby about these new payment models and even others and it seems to be a bit delayed or more discussions needed i think overall we â as i said it in the other calls we as elekta are pushing the envelope on reduction of fractions etcetera anywhere with our products and in particular also with unity as i pointed out before with the prostate case we see the overall movement positive and we just have to see how quick itâ ll now be implemented but i think it favors advanced technologies like mr linac and similar ones michael jungling alright but itâ s your understanding that it s likely now to be pushed out to 2022 the alternative payment model is that your understanding richard hausmann i have to say michael i cannot judge what it will be now there are discussions ongoing i cannot say more on that one it will be only guessing okay coming to theâ gustaf salford and then the question on the bridge michael can take that one again on the overall adding up of the number or was it on the fx rate difference michael jungling on slide 25 we start off with 917 and if i sort of add the positives the 318 the 97 and then it seems that as we move to the right the negatives we â you then get to 987 i m just curious whether i m doing something wrong or whether there is perhaps something wrong with the calculation richard hausmann the greys are also negative i meanâ gustaf salford i need to double check that one it seems it could be some error standing in one of the boxes but let me check that one michael michael jungling okay thank you operator okay we are not over to the line of sebastian walker from ubs please go ahead your line is open sebastian walker thanks for taking my questions i ve got three if i could as well so firstly can you maybe just comment on the lost orders in europe what are those and why did you lose them is that just a timing impact or have you lost those to a competitor the second question is on china verena in the last quarter mentioned that they re starting to see incremental licenses come online from the quotas are you seeing the same thing there and then finally just on the gamma knife delays have i understood correctly that the part of the reason we ve also seen delays is since q2 you no longer begin installation before you have letters of credit secured and if that is the case then why should we expect that headwind to continue for the remainder of the year thank you richard hausmann okay so let me take them one by one lost orders in europe so there was â there were two or three one was in russia frankly where obviously the aspect of local manufacturing was playing a role for our competitor and as it was one of the reason why they got this order i think it was russia as well as ukraine i think the other one i recall is â was in the netherland in amsterdam where i think amc acquired or was acquired actually one hospital acquired another one and we were so as to say competitive hospitals in the sense of using us and the competitor the one which had the decision to make was the one which use the competitor and they change basically the other hospital to the competitive systems these things happen there was no other biggest thing which happened we are in tenders on other sides right now we see positive momentum there so that s a normal way of business but china as i said we see good dynamics in china it is a little bit hard for us to judge which of our deals which we get as orders is part of the â quote â but i think as i said in the my previous presentations as well these quotas will be materializing we donâ t have an indication yet that itâ s massive but maybe one of the other of those deals which we have gotten as orders are from the quota the gamma knife ah the letter of credit â actually letter of credits we need already for the order right gustaf salford it depends on customer by customer but it s often related to emerging markets like china middle east africa and south america richard hausmann and the delays typically not coming from the finance short situation more comes from source licenses of the area we are little bit more vulnerable with our new revenue recognition model but we are learning more and more to manage that and these are typically the reasons that the bunkers or the building is not ready it s nothing really which makes us ultimately totally nervous because we can manage it but it happened in the q2 that it was a bit more than normal gustaf salford and then yes coming back on the ebitda bridge here michael itâ s the admin other expenses this shouldn t be 7 it should be 74 so the bar is correct but it s missing a 4 on that one and that should help you to add up the numbers so apologies for that sebastian walker could i just follow up on the last question on quota so i guess â not quotas sorry the delays what gives you confidence that for the remainder of the year this isn t going to be an issue richard hausmann no we looked at â i mean as i said we looked at our projects quite thoroughly overall and we see that they are quite online of course there can be a delay or not but we are also working on getting the ones which have been delayed into it so i think there s quite some â thereâ s a good mix there sort of that we are quite confident that we â the numbers which we are planning for of or we are hitting sebastian walker great thank you cecilia ketels and then weâ ll take some questions here from the audience unidentified analyst hi two questions from me the first one on the cogs reduction program if you could give some more details on what is it that you say will happen in the coming quarters that will realize those improvements and the second one being on â i know that â as i understand it the few more centers opened up for recruiting for the momentum study during the quarter and just if you can update on how many patients you have recruited so far richard hausmann okay well the cost reduction programs are as i said they are typically kicking in after a certain period when you either have changed the component and this is kind of the new supplier which hopefully is a cheaper supplier we have worked on a few of those topics in parallel and for different products and kicking in now towards the end of this fiscal year will be effective partially effective next year full effective i personally am still not totally happy about how much we are doing there so we are reinforcing that more but there s a certain amount of benefit coming in for the second half of the year on the center on the momentum study actually i don t have the number that do you have the numbers cecilia how many patients are now cecilia ketels yeah itâ s approximately 250 patients that s been in the momentum study and all of our seven original consortium members are now in the study but i mean we do expect to have 6 000 patients when it s all done but 250 today richard hausmann yeah yeah unidentified analyst thank you cecilia ketels and then we have another question here from the audience from johan johan unnerus yes indeed first finer thing admin you mention that there was some items that were not sort of recurring but i presume there is some underlying as well could you give us a little bit more insight to that it would be useful gustaf salford absolutely so if you remember the first quarter admin was quite low then we kicked off three or four significant it projects so it s about procurement itâ s also about sales and sales funnel forecasting itâ s also about project installation tracking and so on so thatâ s the three key initiatives to support some of the topics we have been discussing here to improve working capital management and procurement and so on so that s one effect the other effect is litigation costs that s one off in the quarter and thatâ s around 10 million to 15 million coming from litigation richard hausmann by the way talking about the software programs or this processes which we are implemented i think itâ s important for elekta to get a complete digital overview of purchases also for compliance reasons and other thing to be tractable in all these different aspects sub suppliers etcetera and in the different regions different legal entities i think that was very much necessarily to really be on top of that one as well so i think that it makes us in total â it is an effort we have to buy the software etcetera train the people but i think it makes us more transparent it kind of helps us as management also to track things down better i think thatâ s important so it s a process excellence aspect johan unnerus it was part it procurement and perhaps project will continue to be a bit higher than coming quarters are presumably gustaf salford itâ s often when we kick off a product and you get a bit of alarmed but there will be resources of course working on them for a longer period of time litigation costs that was within the quarter johan unnerus yes and they not that we would focus too much on the senior quarter but on the u s side or americas you had a high end margin good margin in the quarter and the first half of the year you showed that you grow the installation base rather impressively 8 i believe and you have good service support as well still the growth in the quarter is quiet low is it possible to give any more insight in the mix and perhaps if there is price pressure on sort of traditional linac and the likes gustaf salford it is important to say the comment around installed base growth of 8 that was globally that was not relating to the u s specifically richard hausmann the margin quality as you pointed out in the gross margin actually is quite stable there s always price pressure there s no question i mean there is always competition there is always price pressure and as you all know all sales people it s always the price why we lose we know that so no but we have with us configuration managed which we have implemented now we have quite a good price stability on our linac and with the new features that are coming now also from the software side and then next time cost reduction also where the value of linac etcetera we find it quite â we have programs ongoing to keep that that way letâ s put it this way cecilia ketels time is flying and i know we have five people that want to ask questions through the conference call and we will try to try to answer those and just extend the time a little bit so please operator go ahead operator thank you so the next one weâ ll go to is patrick wood at bank of america please go ahead your line is open patrick wood perfect thank you three as well from me please the first would be and apologies if i missed this can you give us a sense of how many unity systems existing in the backlog currently you expect to come through into revenues over the next whatever three years just a net number there but itâ s still going to come through into the sales line thatâ s question one question two just curious you know the pushback from the industry because i also say that on the reimbursement change in the u s if the shift to srs and sbrt is a good thing you know why do you feel the industry is pushing back so hard against that i would be interesting to get your views on why you feel others are pushing back so hard on that reform and then final one haven t talked about it much but proknow had quite a lot of feedback from clinics that was a genuinely very good product i m just curious whether that could ever become material to you guys and how you would think about it if you were us thanks richard hausmann okay the backlog we need to calculate quickly i mean we have 64 orders we have how many systems on cecilia ketels installed 21 and two under installation so 23 richard hausmann two under installation so the rest is backlog gustaf salford and then all of them should go out in the next three years so that was your question that was our booking criteria we donâ t book anything on the project side thatâ s further out than three years richard hausmann the payment model i don t think that our main competitor is pushing back so much but ask them yourself it s not that industry in totality is pushing back i think there are some quite massive interests from the customer side which i could see particular maybe also some freestanding or radiation therapy centers in the united states which work on quite old machines that is of course for them a quite substantial issue because they have to either upgrade or change and go to new technologies i think the lots of discussions are related to as i said before proton therapy which is a little bit treated i think that at the moment not special and has a tendency that as it should be or the wish of those industry in that part and users to treat it special i don t want to comment further on that one there was also a little bit of an issue on the brachy side i think which needs the sources etcetera need to be discussed at bit more in detail but the rest of it i think makes quite a lot of sense is also not a thing which is only happening in the united states i know from my home country that as far as i understand in january germany s also going from the reimbursement towards a more case oriented reimbursement scheme other countries have been already there for quite some time i think one has to think more in terms of the patients also at a certain point in time and patients should come into the benefit â have the benefit and new and less burdening treatments these are typically the more precise treatments because then you can do it multiple times and you don t eradiate a lot of healthy tissue from that point of view i think at least we as elekta we are not in any form against these new reimbursement schemes and then what is the last one was patrick wood proknow richard hausmann yeah proknow proknow is a good software thatâ s why we bought them it is actually a software which is even used for global competitions in optimizing treatment plans and itâ s very much cloud based and thatâ s what we also like about this software a lot so we are integrating that software into our offering for treatment planning solutions our monaco product and i think itâ s quite well on the way gustaf salford yeah so we will be a significant part of our product offering i would say on the software side yes thatâ s what we did with and smart clinics thatâ s a good example for how it could be rolled out in our offering richard hausmann one of these applications basically in this flower so to say of a bouquet of different applications on top of mosaiq and i think this it shows more and more than this is the right way to go forward because you need stability on one side on the underlying data structure thatâ s what the customers appreciate not to change the whole database and everything at the same time we would have want to have cloud based ease of use easy using work flow and other applications and thatâ s exactly what we are right now providing good dynamic right now patrick wood thanks for answering the questions operator okay we now go to the line of kit lee at jefferies please go ahead your line is open kit lee thank you i have two please i guess firstly just on your midterm margin outlook you know just given the lessons fromthe last profit warning of what gives you confidence on maintaining that target and do you think this is slightly a scenario now as before maybe just walk us though some of the drivers that will be helpful and then secondly on premier i guess since the announcement have you made progress into competitive accounts as a result of this deal or is this still something that will take a while to look through thank you richard hausmann to start with the premier as far as i understand not yet that we have concrete orders but i think this just takes a bit of a time because premier is an account which of course has other vendors as suppliers as well so one has to work and our team in the united states is working on an individual deals now basically within this network but i haven t seen yet some as far as i know which materialized but thatâ s probably too early also to expect on our mid term guidance question i think that yeah it was a moderate quarter i would say a mixed quarter as you pointed out now several times the same time what makes us confident is that overall underlying dynamics of the market is still very strong the clouds which we saw on the overall economy recently also cleared up a little bit the trade war stuff and etcetera seems to be at least in a form that people get used to manage it kind of yeah it is existing of course this kind of trade war situation but it is managed and from that point of view we see that clouds are a little bit going away we see extremely good dynamics in unity which i think is confirming our strategy on innovation on paradigm shift on moving a market forward of course with another company as well doing the similar idea but that s not bad it s good to have a company also to be convinced about an idea of changing a market so that s one thing then our pipeline our overall innovation pipeline for the years now to come thereâ s a value linac and other things which we have not yet talked about in detail it gives us lots of confidence that rose from our margin side as well as from our growth side we can fulfill this mid term and long term scenario gustaf salford and from a margin perspective elekta did until it was very important thatâ s a well calendared foundation and we maybe said last year builds upon this year and weâ ll continue to do so and that s a very accretive business compared to our other business lines richard hausmann and then don t forget at the moment weâ re selling unityâ s but we are not yet in the service mode yeah so the service contracts the service margins are not yet contributing and they will come now also they are all in warrant still you know for one year so those things are also adding to it and so from that point of view we have not yet seen a reason to change that okay kit lee and i guess just to follow up on that in terms of the timing it s 20 in fiscal year 2021 to feel a realistic target richard hausmann well thatâ s at least the target we are shooting for yeah kit lee okay thank you operator okay we now go to the line of veronika dubajova at goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open veronika dubajova thank you i have two housekeeping questions and then one bigger picture question if i may please on the housekeeping side can i just confirm what was the ifrs 16 impact on ebitda in the quarter and then gustaf i d love to understand to the extent that we do see more gdp strengths which i think is possible at this point in time do you have hedges in place that can mitigate that and how long are those in place for so how should we be thinking about the possibility of that i ll let you answer those and then i ll ask my big picture question if that s okay gustaf salford yes so on the ifrs 16 when we started the year we mentioned that it would be sek 200 million ebitda level and around sek 20 million on ebitda level and we are there in the half of the year in the mid range there so you will see around 50 per quarter on ebitda and you will see around five per quarter when it comes to the ebitda effect and then it gets a bit of a negative effect on the ebitda or net profit impacts so i hope that answered your questions and on the gdp strength its different parts of gdp so we have the organization with our costs in crawley but then of course we have a lot of working capital and sales through that entity as well so we are doing hedges both on the cash flow side and the balance sheet side to mitigate those risks i think what you saw in the last quarter with a very big change in the last weeks and months that resulted in negative balance sheet hedges so it s not so much to cash flow hedge as on the p l so we will work with mitigating that bridge and hedging it going forward and take care of this one may not one off but these balance sheet items there going forward as well veronika dubajova and normally your hedging policy is two to four quarters or are you able to hedge this out further than that gustaf salford no thatâ s in line with our policy yes veronika dubajova okay thank you and then if i can ask a bigger question for richard i know you said on the call a couple of weeks ago you didn t want to look at the business including and excluding unity but even including unity your growth rate is tracking below varian and i am just curious how you re thinking about your competitive positioning and unity has been a tremendous success but i wonder how you feel about the rest of your portfolio and how competitive it is versus the market leader and maybe give us a preview of some of the things that you are excited about from an innovation perspective that you think might help you accelerate growth richard hausmann yeah and i didnâ t change my opinion on that veronika but let me say the following number one every company if itâ s our main competitor or us weâ re doing developments in one area we cannot do everything at the same time we re moving one thing forward and then another one moving forward i think our overall competitiveness is extremely high and we have as i said before was the innovation projects in the pipeline which are related to elekta digital as gustaf said which to the mosaiq plaza and beyond which enabled us to growth that route strong with a new business line which is ois business moving forward you re right the unity is a tremendous success that is our innovation which i m a deep believer in running a business in a forum that you bet on something you drive this and you make the business going and then of course you do other things in parallel and we re doing for example acquired significant developments in the value linac side on our other linac as well which will become visible soon so there is a lot of things in the pipeline which i would say â by the way also on the gamma knife side we have a very interesting automated planning tool now for the gamma knife which makes a real paradigm shift as well and it is under testing right now in five different sites which reduces â not only it increases the quality of the plan but also reduces the time for treatment significantly i mean significant 60 for example in some cases so i think we have a good pipeline of products that makes me confident but yes at the moment we focus a lot on unity and getting that paradigm shift going because that s something which replaces also other treatments by a better one we always said the better is the enemy of the good yeah and thatâ s why we drive it this way cecilia ketels so unfortunately we can only postpone this call another five minutes may i suggest that we have three more callers that want to ask questions if they can reduce the question to only one then i think we can do all three of them i m sorry veronika if you have a follow up question we have to take them after the call richard hausmann yeah give me a call operator okay we ll now go to david adlington at jpmorgan please go ahead david adlington thanks guys just on the european orders again because it s quite a big step down from last year and my calculations roughly you re down 25 30 linac on last year that seems a bit more than the kind of russia and amsterdam you pulled out just any further color you can give on that will be great thank you richard hausmann first of all if you really look in detail the last year was a very good quarter so we are â the second quarter in europe was very good so that was one thing you should note and i don t know if the numbers right i don t think the number is right this 25 linac because one thing which also we were missing in europe and that s what i m really not happy about was unity orders the unity orders didn t materialize in q2 as of that we are â call it four or five yeah very very strong projects which materialized soon but they didnâ t you know so that was another one it was â and by the way it was not russia only as i said it was amsterdam it was russia ukraine i think it s really two and that was it basically i think one in greece as far as i remember the hospital was also acquired by some other hospital chain which changed three or four linac david adlington thank you operator okay well the final question for today is of the line of oliver reinberg at kepler cheuvreux please go ahead your line is open oliver reinberg thanks so much for squeezing me in at the end i just want to come back on u s book of business i mean orders last â in the second quarter last year were minus 41 and the u s was also weak now you only have 3 growth i think this 3 even included two unity orders so can you just talk about how you feel about your book of business in the u s we had a discussion some kind of in to the past a discussion about a change in management and new setups that you were planning so why do we not see this improvement coming through yet and when do you expect to basically book a better say itâ s for the u s book of business thanks so much gustaf salford okay i can take that so i m not saying that i am happy with the u s yet okay but i think we have a good team in place which we re strengthening also i think it is an upward battle in the united states and there s no question about that but we re moving the premier contract is an example we are going more into this larger chains also which we have not done yet it takes time so i see growth opportunity here the unity is coming now also and it gives us in road into sites which we haven t been before that is another very important part of it and that before also the new payment model is actually facilitating our technology also so we need to be a little bit more patient at the same time but yeah we can grow faster it s true richard hausmann and i think u s for us is a market share gain market and unity as shown in the quarters is how we are we doing it in a way also we have launched software installed base in the u s and having products like now mosaiq plaza and proknow enables us to have growth opportunities on the software side in the u s as well cecilia ketels iâ m really sorry to â sorry oliver oliver reinberg sorry this is just a mix and do you expect growth in orders in the u s in the second half richard hausmann we don t guide on specific quarters so to say on order like this cecilia ketels iâ m really sorry but we have to stop for today but i know that weâ ll meet many of you tomorrow in tã¼bingen and there will also be time for questions there so let us save all the remaining question until tomorrow thank you for participating today here in stockholm as well as on the webcast and in the conference call thank you and have a good remaining today richard hausmann thank you thank you bye
the economic basis of the recent protests around the world by romaric godin november december 2019 translation by fred murphy this article is from dollars sense real world economics available at this article is from the november december 2019 issue the current global social tensions have in common the rejection of inequality and the loss of democratic control the engine driving these challenges may well be the fading relevance of neoliberalism which is aggravating its own crisis and opening the door to confrontation the military is in the streets of santiago chile urquinaona square is in flames in barcelona and barricades are bristling in the streets of beirut while political and media circles in france are upset about a veil the world seems to be ablaze in fact the scenes of violent riots that have marked recent days are not isolated they come after similar scenes in ecuador haiti where the popular uprising continues iraq egypt indonesia hong kong and colombia not to mention earlier movements in zimbabwe nicaragua romania serbia and of course the yellow vests movement in france it is of course possible to see in all of these events only local movements responding to specific cases endemic poverty in haiti persisting militarism among the chilean right the partial or total dollarization of the ecuadorian and lebanese economies the refusal by spain to recognize the catalan question and the democratic aspirations of hong kong none of these explanations are wrong but are they sufficient local social or democratic movements have always existed but whether we like it or not the peculiarity of the moment is that they have arisen at the same time inevitably the contemporaneity of revolts on five continents suggests that they are indeed linked in certain ways neoliberalism seeks to survive and aggravates its own crisis the connection could well be found in the great crisis the world entered in 2007 2008 beyond what most observers remember the great crash that followed the collapse of lehman brothers on september 15 2008 the crisis is much deeper and persists to the present day because it is not a simple financial or economic crisis it is rather the crisis of a mode of managing capitalism that is neoliberalism which is based on putting the state at the service of capital the financialization of the economy and the commodification of society like the crises of the 1930s or 1970s the current crisis profoundly challenges the contemporary functioning of capitalism such crises are often long and accompanied by periods of unrest as the historian adam tooze has shown in the deluge 2014 the disruption of capitalism began not with the 1929 crash but rather during the world war i and was not actually resolved until after world war ii as for neoliberalism it only came fully into being in the 1990s 20 years after the previous paradigm had gone into crisis even today s crisis has been prolonged and deepened as neoliberalism struggles to avert its own demise but in seeking to survive it is pushing the world into the abyss of course neoliberalism survived the shock of 2008 and even emerged from 2010 strong enough to present solutions such as global fiscal austerity and structural reforms aimed at destroying any remaining protection for workers and the most precarious but by seeking to remain dominant neoliberalism has further deepened its own crisis the initial salvation of the global economic system was indeed a leap forward in growth led mainly by a chinese regime anxious to continue fueling western demand the lifeblood of china s economic system but this headlong rush has resulted in unprecedented industrial overproduction which in turn plays no small part in brutally exacerbating the climate crisis some figures will show this easily china produces in two years more steel than the united kingdom long the world s largest steelmaker produced in 150 years and more cement than the united states produced during the whole of the 20th century this strategy has failed it has led to retrenchment in the chinese economy that is hitting its emerging suppliers directly from brazil and argentina to ecuador and venezuela all have experienced sharp declines in demand for raw materials and have had to adjust their policies accordingly the other engine for safeguarding neoliberalism has been the use of monetary policy to avoid fiscal stimulus in western countries in fact this has only succeeded in rescuing the financial sector and large multinational groups in other respects the neoliberal rescue plan has failed profoundly global growth has not recovered and productivity growth is stagnant despite the technological revolution the private sector invests too little and often badly in recent months the global economy has entered a phase of further slowdown in these conditions the continued application of neoliberal reforms to safeguard corporate profit margins and the incomes of the wealthiest has also had an aggravating effect as we have seen profits are badly invested or little invested productivity growth continues to slow and the wealth available to be shared is less abundant but since in response to this slowdown priority is still given to the rich and to businesses and inequalities widen even more for those who are investing little or nothing according to this logic as soon as an adjustment becomes necessary the greatest effort is demanded from those who can least afford it through use taxes like that on whatsapp calls in lebanon through the removal of fuel subsidies in ecuador and haiti or through increased charges for public transport in chile all such measures have a direct impact on people s needs for work and income generation even if growth rate differentials should bring emerging economies in closer sync with those of so called advanced countries and thus reduce inequalities at the global level inequalities within nations are widening more than ever this was the conclusion reached by the economist branko milanović in global inequalities 2016 who foresaw the return of the question of social class thus it is a resurgence of class struggle that we are now witnessing at the global level for a long time it was thought that criticizing neoliberalism was a privilege of the rich reserved for those in the most advanced countries who failed to grasp its benefits it was argued that rising inequality was the price to be paid for development and we had to accept it in the name of those people who were being lifted out of poverty but that discourse can no longer work and that is the novelty of the current situation the challenge reaches the emerging countries the first blows were struck in brazil in 2013 with the downturn in the commodities market and an unprecedented social movement against the move to increase the cost of public transport under dilma rousseff seen by some as a turn toward neoliberalism by the partido dos trabalhadores workers party since then the wave has intensified and is now affecting countries like chile that have long been hailed by international institutions as exemplars of success and stability in these emerging countries the hold of neoliberalism is at the breaking point the need for growth and competition leads to a stalemate as growth slackens the reality of inequality becomes evident while past increases in living standards fail to keep up in a context of slowing global trade the mirage that living standards might catch up to those in the most advanced countries the great neoliberal promise disappears with measures like those already mentioned no solution is presented to these populations other than fresh impoverishment return of the social question neoliberalism is helpless locked in its logic of extractivism and fictional growth it clutches onto phantoms the trickle down theory the laffer curve or the coase theorem which holds that issues of distributive justice must be kept separate from economic reality it does so thanks to another of its salient features the management of democracy whereby the economic sphere must not be subjected to democratic decision making but must be preserved from the feelings of the crowd or to use president emmanuel macron s notorious phrase unfortunate passions passions tristes but such segregation is less and less possible as inequalities deepen and the climate crisis becomes more acute after five decades of managed democracy people are demanding that their own emergencies be addressed instead of those of markets or investors the current crisis of neoliberalism has three aspects an ecological crisis a social crisis and a democratic crisis the current economic system is unable to respond to these three profound sources of discontent faced with an ecological emergency it puts forward market solutions and fiscal repression of consumption by the weakest in the face of social and democratic demands its response is indifference in fact responding to such demands would require a profound change in the economic paradigm addressing the climate crisis would require a complete reorientation of investments and an end to basing the economy solely on real estate and financial bubbles this would imply a complete overhaul of the monetary system the seeds of such a transformation are shown in the green new deal that has been proposed in the united states which has struck fear among neoliberal economists because if the legislation is enacted the climate transition would no longer entail weakening the working class but acting in concert with them by ensuring a massive redistribution of resources to the detriment of the richest the more modest classes could achieve better livelihoods without destroying the planet finally greater popular participation could assure that such decisions are not made for the benefit of the richest and for capital but in the common interest this is exactly what neoliberalism has always rejected this ability of democracy to change the economic deal precisely what the world needs today in other words these three emergencies and three requirements are deeply linked resolving the social question is necessarily a democratic and ecological question but since such changes are wholly rejected by neoliberalism and the states that operate under its logic it remains for people in the streets to express their needs this is what is crystallizing today depending on the region the priorities may be different but the same system is being challenged global neoliberalism moreover all movements are undergoing an evolution in terms of these democratic and social questions and in some cases ecological concerns are also coming to the fore everywhere therefore the challenge is profound and touches on the economic social and political systems in a video broadcast on social networks on october 19 spanish police were seen clubbing catalan independence demonstrators in the streets of barcelona on the wall graffiti in catalan can be seen aço és llutta de classe this is class struggle behind the catalan national question has always been the demand for a more just and redistributive society when repression strikes this reality takes over the desire to regain democratic control in catalonia also reflects social and ecological priorities one of those convicted by the spanish courts raül romeva was elected to political office and was a scholar of international relations before joining the independence movement in france the yellow vests movement did not stop with a simple tax revolt nor did a rollback in the carbon tax stop the movement the movement called into question the practice of democracy and the government s anti redistributive policy it has even joined forces with environmentalists as shown by the joint occupation of the italie deux shopping mall by hundreds of yellow vest and extinction rebellion activists in early october anxieties about the end of the month how you re going to pay your bills have begun to converge with anxieties about the end of the world in ecuador the situation is quite similar the fight against the end of fuel subsidies has highlighted the extent of inequalities affecting indigenous populations who have for years been in revolt against the extractivist logic of governments looking to bring in dollars in lebanon where just seven people own wealth equivalent to one quarter of the country s gdp mass protests rejected privatizations and increased taxes measures that were supported by an all party national unity government this link between social movements and democratization is also evident in chile and in hong kong democratic protests against a chinese regime that seeks at all costs to cover up the crisis of its economic model have taken a clear social turn this is only the beginning there is no hope that the crisis of neoliberalism will be resolved quickly quite the contrary to social pressures will be added repeated climate disasters such as those experienced in the caribbean in recent years which will only degrade social conditions further above all states seem unable to find solutions other than those found in the neoliberal playbook admittedly in ecuador or lebanon the protesters have seen some results with the withdrawal of austerity measures and increased taxes on the poor respectively in lebanon a redistributive measure a tax on bank profits was even granted but such victories are fragile and as we have seen they do not resolve either the underlying problems or the democratic demands confronted with this ongoing conflict and the challenge to its effectiveness neoliberalism could harden and take cover behind the legitimate violence of the state to survive like emmanuel macron in france who condones police violence so it was with pedro sánchez in spain who visited only wounded police in barcelona on october 21 or with sebastián piñera the chilean president invited to the g 7 meeting in biarritz in september who made his announcement with military figures standing by as in the days of augusto pinochet piñera openly declared to the demonstrators we are at war the social war thus becomes global and it pits neoliberalism and its defenders against their opponents given the violence of this war and the rulers inability to move beyond neoliberalism state defense of the interests of capital may converge with neo fascist and nationalist movements as has been the case for quite some time in the countries of eastern europe or more recently in english speaking countries and now also in india and china the stability that capital so urgently demands can only be achieved through the militarization of society to accompany its commodification neoliberalism has proved that it is not incompatible with such an evolution its original laboratory was pinochet s chile a country where freedom was locked down but where foreign capital was quite

non ifrs measures two of the benchmarks the company uses to evaluate its performance are funds from operations and ebitda which are measures not defined in ifrs funds from operations represents cash flow provided by operating activities before settlement of decommissioning obligations and changes in non cash working capital ebitda is calculated on a rolling 12 month basis and is defined as net income loss and comprehensive income loss adjusted for interest income taxes depreciation depletion amortization and other similar non recurring or non cash charges the company considers these measures as key measures to demonstrate its ability to generate the cash flow necessary to fund future growth through capital investment pay dividend and to repay its debt these measures should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than cash provided by operating activities or net income loss and comprehensive income loss as determined in accordance with ifrs as an indicator of the company s performance the company s determination of these measures may not be comparable to that reported by other companies the company also presents funds from operations per share whereby per share amounts are calculated using weighted average shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income loss and comprehensive income loss per share working capital and operating netback as presented do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets operating netback is calculated by subtracting operating costs and royalties from revenue oil and gas metrics the term barrel of oil equivalent boe is used in this release boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 000 cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is used in this release this conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 boe is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead
a russian backed bank payment card introduced after western sanctions upended russia s financial system five years ago and prompted visa and mastercard to deny electronic services to some of the country s leading banks is set for its european debut on london wednesday when a pilot project will be launched in collaboration with the dutch global payment company payxpert moscow authorities hoped to get the mir card accepted eventually in foreign markets but progress has been slow outside russia for the mir payment system which operates outside of western controlled international financial systems such as swift which banks use to transfer money the pilot project with payxpert will lay the foundation for new promising trends in the foreign expansion of russian payment cards according to vladimir komlev the head of russia s national card payment system which operates the mir system de dollarization efforts the effort is seen by analysts as part of the kremlin bid to de dollarize the russian economy to lessen the sting of western sanctions a russian finance ministry official this month told reuters that russia will next year diversify its foreign currency holdings in its national wealth fund which supports russia s public pension system aiming to lower the share of dollars in the fund s reserves dmitry dolgin of the dutch banking group ing said in a report this month that de dollarization efforts are now obvious across most sectors including local business loans and bank held international assets although he said the dollar s role has actually increased in company and household savings and cash assets partly because dollar interest rates have been higher than those offered for euros u s authorities have been able advance sanctions by targeting companies that use dollars and the establishment of electronic payment systems not tied to the dollar or largely controlled by u s businesses is one way for the kremlin to reduce the impact of the west s serial punishment of moscow washington and the european union have imposed a wave of sanctions since 2014 to punish russia for the 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula alleged meddling in the 2016 u s elections and the poisoning of a defected russian spy in england komlev told reuters this year that in the next three years we want mir cards to be operational in countries where russians are used to traveling he projected mir cards would be operational at some banks in at least a dozen countries by the end of this year turkish banks started to conduct transactions this year with mir which means both peace and world in russian mir was launched initially as a national payment system with the first cards issued in december 2015 russia s leading bank state owned sberbank started issuing them in october 2016 and by the end of last year more than 70 million mir based cards had been issued by 64 russian banks the kremlin has mandated that state welfare and pension payments must be processed through the system by next year along with salaries paid to civil servants the card has a long way to go before it rivals visa our mastercard internationally it is not accepted by international shopping platforms or major online booking services for airlines and hotels although apexx fintech a british start up global payment company said thursday it would now start working with the mir system among smartphone applications only samsung has concluded an agreement with the mir system meanwhile de dollarization has been moving quickly russia s central bank has currency swap deals in place with iran china and turkey allowing direct trade to be conducted in local currencies instead of u s dollars russia reportedly lost 7 7 billion in its bid to reduce dollars held in its reserves some of the dollars were turned into gold and since january the bank has purchased 96 4 metric tons of gold alexei zabotkin head of the russian central bank s monetary policy department has conceded that it would be impossible to completely empty the country s foreign exchange reserves of dollars as this would be fraught with excessive risks according to central bank data the national wealth fund has 45 5 billion 39 17 billion euros and 7 67 billion british pounds in august the state controlled rosneft oil giant announced it would stop using the u s dollar for its export contracts nonetheless analysts say there are limits on how far russia can de dollarize the ruble is highly volatile and remains unattractive for investors and de dollarization brings additional and sometimes prohibitive trading costs european regulators will be watching the london project closely eu officials have been sympathetic about russia s de dollarization bid suspecting that as a spinoff the euro will be boosted as an international currency in june the european commission concluded that the euro clearly stands out as the only candidate that has all the necessary attributes of a global currency that market participants could use as an alternative to the u s dollar credit voice of america voa

company uses to evaluate its performance are funds from operations and ebitda which are measures not defined in ifrs funds from operations represents cash flow provided by operating activities before settlement of decommissioning obligations and changes in non cash working capital ebitda is calculated on a rolling 12 month basis and is defined as net income loss and comprehensive income loss adjusted for interest income taxes depreciation depletion amortization and other similar non recurring or non cash charges the company considers these measures as key measures to demonstrate its ability to generate the cash flow necessary to fund future growth through capital investment pay dividend and to repay its debt these measures should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than cash provided by operating activities or net income loss and comprehensive income loss as determined in accordance with ifrs as an indicator of the company s performance the company s determination of these measures may not be comparable to that reported by other companies the company also presents funds from operations per share whereby per share amounts are calculated using weighted average shares outstanding consistent with the calculation of net income loss and comprehensive income loss per share working capital and operating netback as presented do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures for other entities working capital is calculated by subtracting current liabilities from current assets operating netback is calculated by subtracting operating costs and royalties from revenue oil and gas metrics the term barrel of oil equivalent boe is used in this release boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 000 cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of oil is used in this release this conversion ratio of 6 mcf 1 boe is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead

further opportunities to hedge the prices received for its production light oil prices have recently been in the us 55 00 to 58 00 range with the canadian light oil differential remaining steady at a reasonable level among other supply demand factors volatility in light oil prices has been influenced by the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and china and its impact on the global demand outlook for crude oil the natural gas price at the aeco hub has strengthened considerably over the past several months with the reinstatement of a minimum level of interruptible transportation service and the ability to deliver excess natural gas into storage aeco prices have increased from an average of cdn 0 58 per gigajoule in september to over 2 60 per gigajoule at the end of november in light of this increase in natural gas prices clearview has brought on stream additional natural gas production which is economic in this higher priced environment realized propane and butane prices

as of the date of this press release and we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking information whether as a result of new information future events or results or otherwise other than as required by applicable securities laws non gaap measures and oil and gas metrics the company s management uses and reports certain measures not prescribed by international financial reporting standards ifrs referred to as non gaap measures in the evaluation of operating and financial performance operating netback is a non gaap measure used by the company to assess its operating results the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook cogeh describes netback as an operations indicator to assess operating priorities and evaluate smaller capital expenditures normally associated with field maintenance and improvement the cogeh provides guidance that the netback calculation takes the price received for a unit of production at a point in time and deducts from it all production costs royalties and production taxes to find the cash netback to the producer from each barrel of oil or mcf of sales gas the company computes the operating netback for the company directly from the applicable amounts on the statements of operations in the financial statements being oil and natural gas sales and processing income less royalties production and transportation costs this amount divided by the associated production volume usually in boe provides a per unit amount corporate netback is the adjusted funds flow amount divided by the total production for the period and represents the cash margin received on each barrel of oil equivalent sold adjusted funds flow is a non gaap measure derived from cash flow from operating activities excluding decommissioning expenditures and changes in non cash working capital the adjusted funds flow amount represents funds available for capital expenditures repayment of net debt or distribution to shareholders readers are directed to review the reconciliation of adjusted funds flow to cash flow provided by operating activities set out in the company s md a for the three months and nine months ended september 30 2019 net debt consists of current assets excluding financial derivatives less current liabilities excluding financial derivatives net debt is used to assess financial strength capacity to finance future development and manage liquidity risk operating netback adjusted funds flow corporate netback and net debt do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of a similar measure for other companies the company uses these terms as an indicator of financial performance because such terms are used internally in managing and governing the company and are often utilized by investors and other financial statement users to evaluate producers in the oil and natural gas industry the net debt to annualized adjusted funds flow ratio is a non gaap measure and is calculated as net debt divided by the most recent quarter s adjusted funds flow multiplied by 4 the ratio is an indicator of how many future year s adjusted funds flow would be required to pay back the company s net debt boe means barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 bbl of oil boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead in addition given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 using a conversion on a 6 1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value source clearview resources ltd

russia s alternative to western credit cards debuts in london by jamie dettmer november 28 2019 a russian backed bank payment card introduced after western sanctions upended russia s financial system five years ago and prompted visa and mastercard to deny electronic services to some of the country s leading banks is set for its european debut on london wednesday when a pilot project will be launched in collaboration with the dutch global payment company payxpert moscow authorities hoped to get the mir card accepted eventually in foreign markets but progress has been slow outside russia for the mir payment system which operates outside of western controlled international financial systems such as swift which banks use to transfer money the pilot project with payxpert will lay the foundation for new promising trends in the foreign expansion of russian payment cards according to vladimir komlev the head of russia s national card payment system which operates the mir system de dollarization efforts the effort is seen by analysts as part of the kremlin bid to de dollarize the russian economy to lessen the sting of western sanctions a russian finance ministry official this month told reuters that russia will next year diversify its foreign currency holdings in its national wealth fund which supports russia s public pension system aiming to lower the share of dollars in the fund s reserves dmitry dolgin of the dutch banking group ing said in a report this month that de dollarization efforts are now obvious across most sectors including local business loans and bank held international assets although he said the dollar s role has actually increased in company and household savings and cash assets partly because dollar interest rates have been higher than those offered for euros u s authorities have been able advance sanctions by targeting companies that use dollars and the establishment of electronic payment systems not tied to the dollar or largely controlled by u s businesses is one way for the kremlin to reduce the impact of the west s serial punishment of moscow washington and the european union have imposed a wave of sanctions since 2014 to punish russia for the 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula alleged meddling in the 2016 u s elections and the poisoning of a defected russian spy in england komlev told reuters this year that in the next three years we want mir cards to be operational in countries where russians are used to traveling he projected mir cards would be operational at some banks in at least a dozen countries by the end of this year turkish banks started to conduct transactions this year with mir which means both peace and world in russian mir was launched initially as a national payment system with the first cards issued in december 2015 russia s leading bank state owned sberbank started issuing them in october 2016 and by the end of last year more than 70 million mir based cards had been issued by 64 russian banks the kremlin has mandated that state welfare and pension payments must be processed through the system by next year along with salaries paid to civil servants the card has a long way to go before it rivals visa our mastercard internationally it is not accepted by international shopping platforms or major online booking services for airlines and hotels although apexx fintech a british start up global payment company said thursday it would now start working with the mir system among smartphone applications only samsung has concluded an agreement with the mir system meanwhile de dollarization has been moving quickly russia s central bank has currency swap deals in place with iran china and turkey allowing direct trade to be conducted in local currencies instead of u s dollars russia reportedly lost 7 7 billion in its bid to reduce dollars held in its reserves some of the dollars were turned into gold and since january the bank has purchased 96 4 metric tons of gold alexei zabotkin head of the russian central bank s monetary policy department has conceded that it would be impossible to completely empty the country s foreign exchange reserves of dollars as this would be fraught with excessive risks according to central bank data the national wealth fund has 45 5 billion 39 17 billion euros and 7 67 billion british pounds in august the state controlled rosneft oil giant announced it would stop using the u s dollar for its export contracts nonetheless analysts say there are limits on how far russia can de dollarize the ruble is highly volatile and remains unattractive for investors and de dollarization brings additional and sometimes prohibitive trading costs european regulators will be watching the london project closely eu officials have been sympathetic about russia s de dollarization bid suspecting that as a spinoff the euro will be boosted as an international currency in june the european commission concluded that the euro clearly stands out as the only candidate that has all the necessary attributes of a global currency that market participants could use as an alternative to the u s dollar news letter join the globalsecurity

open this photo in gallery the globe and mail the twin 1970s brown brick apartment buildings that rise above a supermarket and strip plazas in northwest toronto aren t elegant or even striking but the country club towers both 27 storeys tall and backing onto a golf course are crown jewels of a sort the buildings are two of the largest in a portfolio of 44 dated suburban rental buildings and in early november the collection sold for an astonishing 1 7 billion it was among the steepest valuations in canadian commercial real estate history relative to the properties rental income open this photo in gallery the continuum reit owned country club towers on weston rd toronto was recently sold to starlight investments for 1 7 billion fred lum the globe and mail the sale process was an unusual one the current owner toronto based continuum residential reit had launched a 300 million initial public offering for 40 per cent of its shares in october but after a few weeks of marketing the deal was massively oversubscribed with orders totalling 1 billion the night before the deal was supposed to price privately owned toronto real estate firm starlight investments swooped in and proposed buying the whole portfolio the offer was so good that continuum withdrew its ipo the single transaction solidified a trend that had been brewing for months canadian apartment buildings have become one of the hottest asset classes in the world and institutional buyers desperate to find the next great investment are scrambling to scoop them up starlight insists the purchase was a steal even though the buildings are on average 49 years old portfolios of this nature and composition are few and far between in the canadian multiresidential sector the company said in a statement to the globe and mail at the time of the sale in other words this many apartments rarely hit the market all at once better yet rental supply is extremely tight canada has built hardly any apartment buildings since the 1970s pushing vacancy rates to near historic lows particularly in and around toronto and vancouver across the 44 continuum buildings the average vacancy rate is just 0 3 per cent meanwhile demand for all types of housing is soaring the federal government is welcoming more immigrants to help fuel economic growth and cities such as toronto montreal and vancouver have become hot spots for global tech talent this week the globe reported that amazon com inc is embarking on a major expansion in vancouver that will triple its planned downtown footprint and take up an entire city block amid this demand there simply aren t enough houses being built and the torrid pace of condo construction isn t keeping up either because people still need to live somewhere institutional money is betting that apartment buildings will succumb to the market reality the crux of this said brian kriter an executive managing director at cushman wakefield the global real estate services giant is rising rents these buyers can t exactly run wild many provinces and cities have rent controls that protect existing tenants yet in some markets particularly ontario landlords can readjust rents to market prices when there is tenant turnover in some recent cases rents have jumped 25 per cent to 30 per cent this prospect is enticing because interest rates remain stubbornly low around the world in canada yields on long term government bonds are less than 2 per cent institutional investors are searching for alternative assets such as real estate which provide higher and perhaps rising income global private equity giants blackstone group inc and brookfield asset management have both stated they want in on the rush for canadian rentals and they have huge war chests having just raised new real estate funds worth us 20 billion and us 15 billion respectively while private and institutional money is nothing new in canadian real estate the vast majority of apartment buildings in canada are already privately owned what s changed is the intensity of investor demand as money pours in the key question is where it will flow it all comes down to whether foreign capital boosts supply said riocan reit president jonathan gitlin who has run the company s rental apartment division if investors construct new buildings it could ease pressure on rents but if the money creates bidding wars to acquire decades old buildings existing tenants many of whom are lower income or newcomers to canada will get squeezed new owners will want them gone in order to increase rents but there s hardly anywhere else for them to go the brewing crisis has been decades in the making private developers put up a lot of apartment buildings in the 1960s and 70s fuelled by tax breaks for investors and strong demand for rental units but all that construction came to a halt developers blame several forces for this including the removal of tax incentives for building new rental towers rent controls that were introduced in the mid 1970s and a recession in the early 1980s hardly any new rental buildings have been built since about 80 per cent of canada s entire supply of apartment buildings was constructed at least 35 years ago according to starlight developers however have been busy making money hand over fist through the condominium boom while condos and rentals are broadly speaking the same types of buildings developers almost always choose to build condos for several reasons for one it is far easier for developers to obtain and repay construction financing on condos governments and lenders typically require a developer to presell at least 70 per cent of the units in a condo building before construction begins the developer gets cash deposits up front and once the tower is fully occupied the developer receives the money for all units sold typically more than enough to pay off all the construction loans at the peaks of the many condo booms across canada since the early 1980s newly announced developments sometimes sold out in a flash it was good times baby said david goodman a commercial realtor in vancouver who has been vocal about the city s current rental crisis the profits were immense rental apartments by contrast have a multidecade payback period a developer might spend millions of dollars to construct a building then try to recoup that investment over the long term by collecting rents month after month for many years the saving grace from condo construction booms was that some of the new units became a de facto supply of rental apartments buyers of condos are typically individuals and some would rent the units out treating the condos as investment properties the trouble in toronto and vancouver now is that even condos are too expensive for many buyers and renters demographics geography and government policies have pushed land prices into the stratosphere which pushes up the price of anything built on that land much of vancouver is surrounded by water and mountains and the province introduced an agricultural land reserve in 1973 that prevents the city from sprawling inland in toronto the provincial government set aside a greenbelt around the city in stages in the early 2000s and introduced a restrictive growth plan for the greater golden horseshoe in 2006 while environmentally friendly those measures limited the amount of land available for development and introduced complex new rules for its use the supply crunch is aggravated by soaring demand particularly from newcomers pouring into canada s largest cities in toronto last year the population jumped by 125 298 people but new completions of all housing types rose by 37 750 units amid the shortage the city s vacancy rate for rental apartments is now 1 1 per cent the country club towers are 100 per cent occupied the demand supply mismatch makes for a stellar investment opportunity in rental apartments in a recent white paper starlight uses one of its recent investments in downtown toronto as a case study the company bought a 174 unit rental building and increased average rents by 411 a month over its four year holding period to help generate this profit starlight like a growing number of rental building owners invested money to upgrade suites by refurbishing kitchens and renovating the building s lobby many rental towers haven t had investments in them in decades and by sprucing things up new owners can attract wealthier tenants who can afford market rents by continuum s calculations the average monthly rent across its portfolio is 1 224 but the average monthly market rent it could fetch according to a valuation for its ipo is 1 592 30 per cent higher starlight did not reply to a request for comment for this story but what makes a great investment can hurt tenants who move around or who arrive from abroad although annual wage growth in canada is finally picking up now hovering around 4 per cent the rise is still a fraction of rent increases in many areas canadian apartment properties reit the country s largest publicly traded rental apartment owner reported an average rent increase of 13 9 per cent on apartment turnovers during the first nine months of 2019 if the trend continues where will low wage workers especially those working in downtown cores find affordable apartments no matter where it comes from fresh capital and a lot of it is needed to maintain and upgrade canada s existing rental apartments and to build new ones one of the major reasons the country had such minuscule rental development for three decades was that no one wanted to fund it despite this reality mammoth foreign investors are sometimes demonized as speculators the situation isn t unique to canada blackstone has been active in copenhagen recently and last month the new york based private equity giant was singled out by denmark s newly elected socialist government you can t use the same methods here as you do in new york housing minister kaare dybvad said worried that the country s middle class won t be able to live in denmark s largest cities the government proposed a new law that would limit rent increases even if new landlords upgrade units for its part blackstone has said it owns just 0 5 per cent of the rental apartments in copenhagen and that it will keep investing in the country i understand the stigma of foreign capital said michael waters the chief executive officer of ottawa based minto group a large rental apartment owner and developer but he argues that in any aspect of the canadian economy foreign direct investment is generally a good thing housing is no different any fear mongering would also be hypocritical toronto based brookfield is a global property giant and many large canadian pension funds also have large real estate holdings around the world capital doesn t have any borders any more said mr kriter of cushman wakefield multifamily real estate purchaser breakdown 2018 private canadian investor 31

breakdown 2018 private canadian investor 31 institutional 2 5 reit real estate operating company 10 9 foreign investor 12 9 pension fund adviser 26 2 private equity 16 5 source cbre the more critical issue is where the fresh capital flows to construction of new apartments or to scooping up existing buildings and maybe flipping them after a few years at the moment both types of capital are at work blackstone for instance teamed up with starlight in 2018 to start investing in canadian rentals and in the 18 months since it has announced two acquisitions of existing portfolios at the other end of the spectrum morguard corp one of canada s largest commercial and residential landlords built and opened two towers in midtown toronto five years ago one of the city s first new rental projects in decades other developers are also testing the waters including daniels corp a toronto developer that has announced several partnerships with the city to construct buildings with a mix of market and subsidized units riocan reit one of the country s largest shopping centre owners also has ambitious plans to build rental apartments many of its malls in and around large cities are surrounded by large parking lots offering valuable land it already owns to increase density and riocan has found through its research that younger people in urban markets will pay premium rents for new builds with amenities such as cold storage for their food deliveries the reit s long time ceo ed sonshine has also been one of the few willing to call it like it is he s argued that while it s possible to put lipstick on a pig meaning a 50 year old apartment building it s still a pig when you ve got 50 years of cooking in a building the walls smell he said in an interview with the globe earlier this year and you can t replace anything because then you have to kick people out yet even if every new investment dollar flowed into rental construction it would still take years to fix the demand supply imbalance simply getting the necessary approvals to start building can be maddening for developers mr waters the minto ceo says it took his company six years to get the necessary sign offs for one new toronto development a full year went by getting permission to cut down six non native trees that minto had promised to replant this is in a city that has housing affordability crisis he said such delays are common in vancouver too it s almost as if we need a housing czar said mr goodman the commercial realtor if a project is sitting in limbo for more than a year perhaps a heavy hand should intervene to escort it through the bureaucracy but then there are local residents who also put up roadblocks in vancouver residents routinely complain about potential shadows from new towers or partial blockages of their view of the water or mountains sending developers back to the drawing board the nimbyism is at a level that is so astonishing mr goodman said given the rental market s current trajectory soaring demand and stifled supply the short term outlook is turbulent already rising rents are forcing tenants to reconsider what they have so turnover is starting to slow if the affordability crisis escalates you re going to have tenants who don t want to leave their units riocan s mr gitlin said some frustrated renters have already taken to the streets last year a group of tenants in hamilton were so angry about above guideline rent increases they trekked to ottawa to try to protest at the home of interrent reit s ceo governments are also proceeding cautiously in 2017 former ontario liberal premier kathleen wynne extended rent controls to new builds before that only properties built before 1991 were subject to them last year though newly elected progressive conservative premier doug ford removed them from new builds but kept them on existing units as this plays out demand continues to swell immigration has been a staple of federal liberal and conservative government policies for decades and prime minister justin trudeau is keen on welcoming even more skilled newcomers to boost the economy unlike other global leaders canada remains supportive of immigration as an economic imperative real estate consultancy cbre noted in a recent report adding that immigration accounted for 80 per cent of canada s population growth last year

recently been in the us 55 00 to 58 00 range with the canadian light oil differential remaining steady at a reasonable level among other supply demand factors volatility in light oil prices has been influenced by the ongoing trade dispute between the united states and china and its impact on the global demand outlook for crude oil the natural gas price at the aeco hub has strengthened considerably over the past several months with the reinstatement of a minimum level of interruptible transportation service and the ability to deliver excess natural gas into storage aeco prices have

standards ifrs referred to as non gaap measures in the evaluation of operating and financial performance operating netback is a non gaap measure used by the company to assess its operating results the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook cogeh describes netback as an operations indicator to assess operating priorities and evaluate smaller capital expenditures normally associated with field maintenance and improvement the cogeh provides guidance that the netback calculation takes the price received for a unit of production at a point in time and deducts from it all production costs royalties and production taxes to find the cash netback to the producer from each barrel of oil or mcf of sales gas the company computes the operating netback for the company directly from the applicable amounts on the statements of operations in the financial statements being oil and natural gas sales and processing income less royalties production and transportation costs this amount divided by the associated production volume usually in boe provides a per unit amount corporate netback is the adjusted funds flow amount divided by the total production for the period and represents the cash margin received on each barrel of oil equivalent sold adjusted funds flow is a non gaap measure derived from cash flow from operating activities excluding decommissioning expenditures and changes in non cash working capital the adjusted funds flow amount represents funds available for capital expenditures repayment of net debt or distribution to shareholders readers are directed to review the reconciliation of adjusted funds flow to cash flow provided by operating activities set out in the company s md a for the three months and nine months ended september 30 2019 net debt consists of current assets excluding financial derivatives less current liabilities excluding financial derivatives net debt is used to assess financial strength capacity to finance future development and manage liquidity risk operating netback adjusted funds flow corporate netback and net debt do not have any standardized meanings prescribed by ifrs and therefore may not be comparable with the calculation of a similar measure for other companies the company uses these terms as an indicator of financial performance because such terms are used internally in managing and governing the company and are often utilized by investors and other financial statement users to evaluate producers in the oil and natural gas industry the net debt to annualized adjusted funds flow ratio is a non gaap measure and is calculated as net debt divided by the most recent quarter s adjusted funds flow multiplied by 4 the ratio is an indicator of how many future year s adjusted funds flow would be required to pay back the company s net debt boe means barrel of oil equivalent on the basis of 6 mcf of natural gas to 1 bbl of oil boe may be misleading particularly if used in isolation a boe conversion ratio of 6 mcf to 1 bbl is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead in addition given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6 1 using a conversion on a 6 1 basis may be misleading as an indication of value source clearview resources ltd
a wave of protests by working people is shaking capitalist regimes from chile to ecuador to colombia today and they are a challenge to washington s progress in asserting its imperialist sway in the hemisphere new governments elected in ecuador and brazil in the last two years forced out cuban internationalist medical volunteers from their countries and joined in the u s rulers slander campaign against the cuban revolution in august 2018 president lenin moreno pulled ecuador out of the cuban and venezuelan led alba trade alliance which serves as a counterweight to washington s exploitative free trade pacts and on nov 10 rightist forces in bolivia succeeded in ousting president evo morales opening the door to deeper attacks on working people and indigenous farmers there but the ongoing worldwide capitalist economic crisis is destabilizing governments across latin america the foreign debt of latin american and caribbean governments has nearly doubled since 2010 to some 2 5 trillion there is no end in sight to the crisis that imperialism itself is preparing the government of colombian president iván duque is the latest to be shaken by mass protests hundreds of thousands of union workers students indigenous and farmers took to the streets around the country nov 21 to protest duque s government and its policies for decades the colombian government has been one of washington s closest allies working closely with the pentagon and aiding the u s rulers campaign against the government of nicolás maduro in neighboring venezuela no confidence in colombian gov t the people have no confidence that the president will solve the grave problems we face small coffee farmer rubén dario cifuentes told the militant by phone from cauca province nov 23 official unemployment is nearly 11 in early november defense minister guillermo botero resigned following revelations that the military had covered up the killing of at least eight children when the army attacked a small band of guerrillas colombian labor unions called for the nov 21 protest in october inspired by large anti government actions in ecuador and chile support for the action took off duque responded by ordering the closing of border crossings and deporting 24 venezuelans he claimed were instigating unrest he deployed some 170 000 cops and soldiers around the country but the fear and intimidation campaign didn t work one big issue is so called government pension reform alberto solando cordero a mine worker official of the sintramienergética union told the militant two days after the protest in colombia you have to work 1 200 weeks to qualify for your full pension solando said under the reform if you work less than 40 hours it would no longer be counted as a full week forcing workers to wait longer to retire millions never qualify for even the paltry sums the government currently pays out it s not just the economy the government has not been carrying out the peace accords solando said referring to the 2016 agreement the colombian rulers signed with farc guerrillas in talks mediated by cuba the agreement was hailed by workers and peasants and created greater political space the government has reneged on promises to provide land for former guerrillas aid for farming and housing he said some of the former guerrillas have taken up arms again and are collaborating with drug traffickers the biggest problem we have is that the state is carrying out the demands of the international monetary fund and the world bank with evil consequences césar pachón a leader of dignidad papera an organization of small potato farmers told the militant from boyacá and the free trade pact with the u s has just deepened the crisis peasants don t want to be criminals pachón said but many end up growing illicit coca because they can t survive on the price they get for coffee sugar cane milk or potatoes most of what colombia exports is agricultural produce or raw materials finished products are then imported at high prices sinking the country deeper in debt colombia is one of the top four milk producing countries in latin america and the caribbean but we import powdered milk from the u s because we don t have a factory to produce it pachón said at least 52 indigenous people have been killed in cauca so far this year hundreds of other activists have been killed around the country in cauca they have been killed by drug gangs the indigenous people have their own guards to prevent trafficking because the government authorities do nothing pachón said the protests are going to continue pachón said chile 30 years of abuse chile has been a symbol of the success u s imperialism has had in imposing its will on latin america in 1973 a cia instigated coup overthrew salvador allende elected president three years before at a time of ascending working class struggles and imposed a reign of terror headed by gen augusto pinochet in 1988 pinochet held a referendum to put the stamp of approval on another eight years of his regime but it was defeated leading to new elections successive capitalist governments restored democracy but kept in place or deepened the anti working class economic and social measures initiated under pinochet s regime on oct 25 a series of protests against the government culminated with some 1 2 million people jammed into central santiago the protests began when high school youth took to the streets against a 30 peso 42 cents increase in subway fares it s not about 30 pesos it s about 30 years protesters said highlighting the pent up anger over decades of attacks it was the largest protest since the 1989 return of democracy enrique solar an official of the port workers union of chile told the militant everything exploded it s been 30 years of injustice chileans often denounce the two tier health care system one for working people the other for the better off the public health system is terrible solar said you can die waiting for them to give you an appointment for an operation but if you have money you get attention in 10 minutes at a private clinic when the recent round of protests broke out chilean president sebastián piñera a harvard educated billionaire declared the country was at war the police attacked protesters with tear gas high pressure water streams and rubber bullets which turned out to have less than 20 rubber at least 285 protesters lost an eye or had severe trauma from being shot in the face at close range by the cops more than 20 demonstrators were killed and there ve been disappeared solar said with the repression just fueling anger piñera decided to try economic concessions he announced he would raise pensions for the poorest by 20 increase the minimum wage by 16 cancel a 9 2 hike in

while canadian politicians keep up their parochial posturing a global storm is brewing around the world there is early evidence of a seismic shift capital is moving away from fossil fuels and regions that have let their economies become dependent on oil revenues are showing signs of authoritarian abuses of power sound familiar alberta saudi arabia for example planned to sell up to five per cent of state owned oil company aramco in what was supposed to be the largest ipo in history raising 100 billion to improve services and diversify the economy instead the sale has been scaled back only 1 5 per cent of the company will be sold and the share offering may only raise 25 billion enough to cover the saudi government deficit for about six months the precarious balance in saudi society is maintained through lavish government spending that has relied on oil prices of 85 a barrel to drive revenues but brent oil prices have not been at that level in the last five years saudi arabia is running deficits of around 60 billion a year to maintain services and head off unrest former cia director david petraeus noted ominously it s a fact that saudi arabia is gradually running out of money even though aramco is the most profitable company on the planet with proven reserves of 270 billion barrels of the world s cheapest oil private equity investors so far have taken a pass on the ipo oil is a cyclical business but their reluctance is not due to downturn slump in the sector the reasons investors snubbed the sale seem more existential if saudi arabia is in trouble the rest of the oil producing world should probably start to panic the international energy agency just released its annual energy outlook with sobering news for oil producers even though the iea has consistently underestimated adoption of clean energy this year s report predicted that growth in global oil demand will slow to a crawl by 2025 due to the increased market share of electric vehicles the iea report also warned that any increases in demand will lead u s shale oil and gas producers to ramp up production which will keep oil and gas prices low countries whose economies are exclusively reliant on oil and gas reserves are facing serious challenges the report warned that should be particularly worrying for alberta a recent report from the university of calgary noted that despite premier jason kenney s corporate tax cuts and promises to restore the alberta advantage the province has always relied on high oil prices for prosperity and structural changes in the sector means the days of expensive oil and gas are over the wexit albertans aspiring to create their own petro state are doing so at the very moment in history when that would be a terrible idea before alberta nationalists busy themselves designing new flags and passports it would be wise to notice signs elsewhere that the oil and gas party is winding down the market value of the u s energy sector is down almost nine per cent this year the entire sector is now worth less than apple exxon mobil s credit rating was just downgraded by moody s due to concerns of substantial cash burn fracking giant chesapeake has shed 98 per cent of its stock value since 2008 and recently warned investors it may not be able to make scheduled payments on its crushing 10 billion debt here in canada we hear a lot about the value of pipelines but the economics of oil infrastructure elsewhere are collapsing a recent report predicted the 160 billion global oil tanker fleet could lose 30 per cent of its value as the world shifts away from fossil fuels shipowners and people that finance these ships could see their market is sinking said stuart nicoll a director at maritime strategies that authored the study this just hasn t had any attention an ultra deep water drilling platform worth 683 million in 2011 was just sold for scrap at two cents on the dollar after receiving no bids at auction driven by diving investor interest in expensive offshore projects even the bank of canada recently warned that some global oil reserves will become worthless in the future maintaining the warming below 2 0 degrees celsius implies that some of the existing fossil fuel reserves will become stranded assets wrote bank senior research director miguel molico in a recent report none of this news seems to have penetrated the information bubble in alberta the kenney government just seized control of the 18 billion teachers pension plan and is looking at taking control of another 40 billion by pulling out of the canada pension plan critics worry the pension will be invested in the oil sector an exceedingly unwise investment a report on new york state pension investments found that failing to divest from fossil fuels 10 years ago cost the fund us 22 billion albertans would be wise to ensure politicians don t squander the money they re saving for retirement on a dying industry alberta is not the only province having trouble accepting energy realities last week ontario premier doug ford said he was proud of his government s decision to cancel hundreds of previously approved green energy projects including a fully completed wind farm at a cost to taxpayers of 231 million if we had the chance to get rid of all the windmills we would he said back in the real world the s p renewable energy index was up 24 per cent in the last year the iea predicts the wind industry could be worth 1 trillion by 2040 alberta s history of squandered opportunities read more meanwhile despite prime minister justin trudeau s pledge to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies ottawa and the provinces still shovel 3 3 billion a year at the climate destroying sector this year an additional 320 million was spent propping up the money losing trans mountain pipeline populist rhetoric portraying the past as our future might play well with partisan supporters but it is extraordinarily irresponsible especially when public money is being wasted in the process worse are the anti democratic moves from the alberta government attacking free speech and accountability which will do nothing to respond to global changes to the energy economy can canada still become a global climate leader or will we be just another compromised petro state we ignore the gathering storm at our peril
the following post was written by thomas hall in october the federal reserve cut interest rates for the third time in 2019 with the intention of maintaining the us longest period of economic growth ahead of the 2020 presidential election for the incumbent president those cuts still aren t enough trump has regularly pressured the fed into slashing interest rates throughout his presidency but the fed have remained more moderate amid the us china trade dispute these important themes of 2019 are likely to recur in 2020 exchange rates inflation and politics are all inextricably linked to the fate of the dollar exchange rates the fed hopes that lower interest rates will stimulate economic growth and encourage greater investment by lowering these rates at a slower pace than trump desires the fed aims to prevent any dramatic fluctuations in exchange rates with other key economies the us dollar s status as the world s primary reserve currency ensures that it plays the most significant role of any currency in the global forex markets the usd features in most of the most frequently traded currency pairs including eur usd with the us currently in a period of sustained economic growth and traditionally a provider of a safe investment the usd will remain attractive to traders on the forex market in 2020 some analysts are advising traders to go long on eur usd given that the eurozone has posted an industrial bounce in the last quarter and that germany avoided a recession however the aggressive easing policy set to be introduced by the european central bank could see the dollar regain its usual position of strength compared to the eur inflation in october there were indications that the fed would provide a further cut to interest rates in the opening months of 2020 a response to diminished consumer spending and doggedly low inflation rates the fed measures inflation levels through the core pce index which posted figures of 1 8 in august and 1 7 in september these figures fell short of the 2 0 target set out by the us central bank it now appears that the fed may avoid having to deliver further cuts at least in the short term future a rebound in consumer prices in october subsequently boosted inflation while job growth also surpassed expectations for that month however inflation will ultimately remain below the fed s 2 0 target so a strong october may not be enough to stave off further interest rate cuts later in 2020 market research places the likelihood of two cuts in 2020 at around 56 if the fed can t find a way to bring inflation in line with expected levels then the dollar may struggle or stagnate in 2020 politics the 2020 election campaign will dominate most of the calendar year the usd could fluctuate as election polls indicate who is gaining or losing ground at any given moment depending on each candidate s proposed economic policies even without the election the protracted us china trade dispute makes it difficult to confidently assess the fortune of the usd in 2020 a phase one deal was expected to have been completed by now but beijing have called for greater tariff concessions the white house is reluctant to make further compromises a stance that could actually strengthen the dollar with rumours of a delay to the deal by around six months it could mean that the dollar eventually takes a hit midway through 2020 once the nature of that deal is announced as always in the ever changing world of currency trading it is difficult to make yearly predictions for the fate of the dollar traders will be keenly tracking the economic policies and the us china trade dispute in the hope of determining the shape of the dollar s future
a us china trade deal will not stop supply chains from reconfiguring towards asean as multinationals look to minimise risks from possible future trade tensions between the united states and china a maybank report has suggested a larger proportion of mncs will adopt a china 1 strategy to hedge against the risks of escalating us china trade tension and strategic mistrust maybank economists wrote in the bank s outlook report titled year ahead 2020 asean on friday this was signalled in a a survey by amcham shanghai conducted in mid 2019 with 333 respondents which showed that 26 5 per cent of respondents have redirected investments originally planned for china to other locations in the past year with about half opting for south east asia in addition maybank economists believe more of the rising applications for foreign direct investment fdi in asean in 2019 will translate into actual fdi next year as multinational corporations pull the trigger and kick start their plans to boost capital spending beneficiaries of the reconfiguring supply chain will be vietnam malaysia thailand and possibly the philippines there are however several wild cards that could throw asean off this trajectory one is if us president donald trump and the us begin targeting smaller countries including asean us could charge some asean countries for acting as a backdoor for china exports vietnam cambodia malaysia currency manipulation vietnam malaysia singapore and currency undervaluation thailand singapore the report wrote noting that vietnam came very close to being labelled a currency manipulator in the us treasure report in may 2019 developing countries like indonesia and the philippines may see their trade preferences under the us generalised scheme of preferences programme removed while smaller countries may be forced to take sides against china when it comes to huawei or free trade agreements maybank said the second wild card is the return of inflation on the back of a tight us labour market higher commodity prices and a stronger renminbi a trade and commodity price recovery in the event of a trade deal may reignite inflation risks in the latter part of 2020 this could increase pressure on us long term yields prompt a shift in expectations towards a fed rate hike and strengthen the us dollar the report said adding that this could pressure currencies in emerging markets

we are on the brink of the second great depression you really need to watch this video of a recent conversation between ray dalio and paul tudor jones their part is about the first 40 minutes in this video ray highlights some problematic similarities between our times and the 1930s both feature a large wealth gap the absence of effective monetary policy a change in the world order in this case the rise of china and the potential for trade wars technology wars capital wars he threw in a few quick comments as their time was running out alluding to the potential for the end of the world reserve system and the collapse of fiat monetary regimes maybe it was in his rush to finish as their time is drawing to a close but it certainly sounded a more challenging tone than i have seen in his writings currency wars it brought to mind an essay i read last week from my favorite central banker former bis chief economist william white he was warning about potential currency wars aiming particularly at the us treasury s seeming desire for a weaker dollar ditto for other governments around the world he believes this is a prescription for disaster one possibility is that it might lead to a disorderly end to the current dollar based regime which is already under strain for a variety of both economic and geopolitical reasons to destroy an old admittedly suboptimal regime without having prepared a replacement could prove very costly to trade and economic growth perhaps even worse conducting a currency war implies directing monetary policy to something other than domestic price stability there ceases to be a domestic anchor to constrain the expansion of central bank balance sheets should this lead to growing suspicion of all fiat currencies especially those issued by governments with large sovereign debts a sharp increase in inflationary expectations and interest rates might follow how this might interact with the record high debt ratios both public and private that we see in the world today is not hard to imagine i called bill to ask if he thought this was going to happen basically he said no but it shouldn t even be considered it was his gentlemanly way of issuing a warning currency devaluations against gold were part of the root cause of the great depression coupled with protectionism and tariffs they devastated global economic growth and trade the repeat of the 1930s do i think it will happen in any significant way in the next few years it is not my highest probability scenario but imagine a recession that brings the us deficit to 2 trillion possibly followed by a governmental change that raises taxes and spending this could bring about a second echo recession with even higher deficits this would force the federal reserve to monetize debt in order to keep interest rates from skyrocketing thereby weakening the dollar couple this with a concurrent crisis in europe potentially even a eurozone breakup resulting in countries all over the world trying to weaken their currencies with the potential for higher inflation in many places in such a scenario is it hard to imagine a desperate president and congress toward the latter part of the next decade regardless of which party is in control instructing the us treasury to use its tools to weaken the dollar can you say beggar thy neighbor can you see other countries following that path all as debt is increasing with no realistic exit strategy except to monetize it the great reset the collapse of the biggest bubble in history new york times best seller and renowned financial expert john mauldin predicts an unprecedented financial crisis that could be triggered in the next five years most investors seem completely unaware of the relentless pressure that s building right now learn more here disclaimer the above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice information and analysis above are derived from sources and utilising methods believed to be reliable but we cannot accept responsibility for any losses you may incur as a result of this analysis individuals should consult with their personal financial advisors john mauldin archive 2005 2022 the market oracle is a free daily financial markets analysis forecasting online publication

goodman juan gonzález and i m juan gonzález welcome to all of our listeners and viewers across the country and around the world today we spend the hour looking back at the battle of seattle protester when labor and students and environmentalists and human rights activists stand together we can and did shut down the wto juan gonzález twenty years ago this week tens of thousands of activists gathered in seattle washington to shut down a ministerial meeting of the world trade organization grassroots organizers successfully blocked world leaders government trade ministers and corporate executives from meeting to sign a global trade deal that many called deeply undemocratic and harmful to workers rights the environment and indigenous people globally on november 30th 1999 those activists formed a human chain around the seattle convention center and shut down the city s downtown amy goodman police responded by firing tear gas and rubber bullets into the mostly peaceful crowd the protests went on for five days resulted in over 600 arrests and the eventual collapse of the talks as well as the resignation of seattle s police chief the protests were documented in the film this is what democracy looks like protester you ve got people here from all over you ve got labor you ve got environmentalists you ve got teachers you ve got children you ve got coalitions between people of color and mainstream white americans you ve got middle class you ve got working poor you ve got poor you ve got everybody out here because this hurts people this is bad for people it s bad for our jobs here it s bad for the people over there amy goodman in the documentary this is what democracy looks like organizers hop hopkins and rice baker yeboah talked about the brutality protesters faced in the streets of seattle rice baker yeboah there was so much fear coming out of tuesday i mean we had been shot at we had been gassed people had been beaten and shot people didn t expect that going into tuesday and people had to recommit themselves and reaffirm their position hop hopkins that night we ended up meeting up on the corner of broadway and john and decided about what we could do the next day the next day we d meet up at 6 30 at denny park and then we d try to take back the city protesters hop hopkins we started to weave our way through the route roadblocks that they had set up and i looked around and i could see people were afraid and at that point i said you know that s really not fear in your gut or in your throat that s really your first taste of freedom protesters hop hopkins people were coming out of nowhere i mean it was like a scene from that michael jackson video thriller people were like coming out of manholes people were coming out of cars so we went from like 50 people to like 100 people to like 150 people to like 300 people and then just the numbers just kept growing i don t know where all these people came from and i think the cops were totally surprised by that juan gonzález democracy now was in the streets of seattle 20 years ago doing two hours of daily broadcasting during one broadcast we spoke to two of the leading critics of the wto the indian physicist and activist vandana shiva and lori wallach of public citizen lori wallach the wto constrains every country government about literally the level of food safety it can provide its public or whether or not poor farmers can have access to seeds whether or not workers can be safe from asbestos vandana shiva actually the secrecy through which wto was born is apparent in the fact that most parliaments had no idea what was the content of this treaty until months after it had been ratified and signed in marrakesh the wto wrote the rules it sits in judgment about implementation of the rules and it writes the inquisition amy goodman you are listening to pacifica radio s democracy now broadcasting live from seattle amy goodman that was vandana shiva and lori wallach on democracy now with juan gonzález and i on november 29th 1999 during our live broadcast from the basement of seattle s first united methodist church during the wto protests well they are joining us again today lori wallach is with us from washington d c and vandana shiva is joining us from rome italy welcome back both to democracy now lori let s begin with you you were in the streets of seattle 20 years ago can you explain why what was happening and then take us through to today lori wallach well the wto had announced it was having its ministerial in the u s and we knew it was critical for people around the world to see with protest against wto in africa latin america asia europe that in the u s also we didn t want this one size fits all corporate rule and so as soon as we heard it was seattle we started organizing we opened an office in seattle in march of 1999 and the goal was both to stop the planned wto expansion and also to signal to the whole world the u s was in this fight with everyone else we needed different rules for the global economy juan gonzález and vandana shiva few people in the world had even heard of the wto at that time even in the activist community tell us how you came to be in seattle in november of 1999 vandana shiva i was in seattle as part of the ifg the international forum on globalization which brought together all of us who were questioning gatt which was the precursor of the wto before the marrakesh agreement was signed i was fighting gatt because of the corporations who mentioned gatt first in a meeting in 1987 in geneva and in a resort outside geneva and they were talking about patenting seeds and life they were talking about an international treaty which would make it a requirement for all countries to patent seeds and would make it illegal for farmers to save seeds and that this free trade agreement is what they were going to work on and they talked about five corporations controlling food and health by the year 2000 that conversation of 1987 started me on the path of saving seed working with my government to not allow patenting of seed working with our ambassadors to not allow trips to be designed like monsanto had designed it where they said we were the patient diagnostician and physician all in one but because i come from india to colonize the country east india company was created the first free trade agreement was not nafta or wto the first free trade agreement was imposed on india by the east india company 716 so we were very familiar with the use of so called free trade for corporate rule and having become free after famine killed 60 million people we didn t want to be re colonized again and i am so happy that for that period our former prime minister our former gatt ambassador joined us as the peoples campaign against wto and we passed laws in that window that defended the sovereign entity of the seed the sovereign entity of farms but as the corporate rule continued the monopoly on seeds continued we have lost 400 000 farmers to suicide because of debt permanently a billion people are hungry and when you introduce the protests going on in chile and colombia and other parts of the world i actually see the process of today in every part of the world as a continuation of the fight against neoliberalism a fight against austerity a fight against the permanence of structural adjustment which is what free trade is about it has given us the control of four giants poison cartel over our seed and our food it has given us the billionaires bill gates is a child of wto he got rules written so he wouldn t have to pay taxes in transporter transfer which is why software was outsourced to india jeff bezos shipping goods around paying no taxes anymore these trillionaires are children of the wto rules and even then we said our world is not for sale we said we are writing other rules movements have written other rules another world is possible we are making it but the brutality and limitless greed of the handful of corporations and billionaires is now really reaching ecocidal and genocidal limits so 20 years after seattle we need to make a commitment that in the next 10 years we ve really got to change those rules and get rid of the rule of billionaires amy goodman i want to go to michael moore the oscar winning filmmaker didn t win an oscar at the time speaking to a reporter in the middle of a crowd during the wto demonstrations michael moore the beautiful thing of this is this really wasn t organized by any leader it wasn t organized by any group all right it was organized by monsanto it was organized by exxon and general motors and microsoft and all the other greedy bastards who have spent the last two decades trying to make as much money as they can at the expense of everybody here crowd michael moore so don t go blaming any violence or anything on anybody here the violence is taking place in these companies that have enacted their violence against these people amy goodman so that s michael moore back in the end of november 1999 and juan you and i were in the streets we were covering this for democracy now i make that point and this weekend holding a big forum at the people s forum called media in resistance 20 years after seattle that university of pennsylvania your university rutgers and democracy now helped to sponsor you talked about how here you were working for this major new york newspaper right the new york daily news but it was democracy now that brought you out there juan gonzález right because the paper didn t want to pay my expenses to go out there and they didn t even really know what the wto was about and i assured them that it was going to be a big event and that even bill clinton was going so it was worthwhile covering but amy goodman he ended up having to come in the middle of the night because of the mass protests and madeleine albright couldn t get out of her hotel room the secretary of state because of the tear gas that was coming under her door but if you could read your column since the daily news didn t stop calling you once you got there juan gonzález yeah well once the protests paralyzed the whole city then they wanted to hear as much as i could write and this was the beginning of the column i wrote on december 1st a baptism by tear gas for america s students and i wrote a new generation of rebels came of age in america yesterday thousands of young people paralyzed this city s downtown and delayed the opening ceremony of the world trade organization meeting in a stunning protest that harkened back to the great civil rights marches of the 1960s and in another column on december 3rd i wrote it did not matter to these diehard kids that the city had been turned into an armed camp and was firmly under the control of an army of cops state troopers and national guard they had been stunningly successful in giving a black eye to an obscure international organization and had alerted millions of americans to the enormous power the wto wields in the world and turned it into a household name as i said most people didn t even know about the wto before these protests occurred amy goodman vandana shiva if you can explain you came from india to be part in seattle of the protests but you didn t know really the level of protest you had already been laying a foundation with the ifg the international forum on globalization giving speeches about this and for people to understand the wto the idea that a transnational organization could be used to overturn the laws of democratically elected legislatures say some city council didn t want to have gmos wanted to have them labeled they could be called wto illegal now you have been continuing to speak out about this since but what difference did that seminal moment make were you surprised the wto got shut down vandana shiva i was not surprised because actually it wasn t just the protest outside it was the third world governments inside who were totally celebrating the ending of the bullying power of the rich countries who were working on behalf of the monsantos to push the trips agreement the trade related intellectual property rights agreement the cargills whose vice president was deputed to negotiate the agriculture treaty on behalf of the u s government that s what the agriculture treaty was a cargill agreement and the so called sanitary and phytosanitary agreement was a basically pepsi coke nestle junk food agreement forcing bad food on everyone around the world and criminalizing local regional national governments which worked according to their constitutions to protect their sovereign entities and their rights as i mentioned i woke up to the use of a gatt and wto to establish seed monopolies in 1987 in india we immediately started to mobilize and the first very big rally was a 500 000 farmers rally to say agriculture should not be part of free trade those protests are still carrying on seattle we planned with ifg the teach in and we had been doing teach ins in the lead up to seattle we thought about 30 000 people would turn up thousands turned up and the young people on the streets would come up to me and talk to me about how they were there because of biopiracy they were there to stop privatization of water each of them was there to defend our public goods they were there to defend our commons and everyone was speaking the chorus our world is not for sale our world is now on the verge of destruction and extinction and climate catastrophe because those who make money out of destroying the world want to continue so the difference really is that those who pushed and bullied us into the wto of the corporations now want to dismantle the wto as a multilateral body and they want to have bilateral bullying agreements the end result is the same i think it is important for the workers of the united states to recognize that the unions were on the street in europe right now the corporations are pitting farmers again against the environmentalists as if banning pesticides which are killing the butterflies and birds are not the reason the farmers are in debt it s not the reason that crops are failing not the reason that the soil is dying it is time to stop the divide and rule that has been created again and again by the money machine and the moneymakers and this divide and rule is right now taking very militaristic turns very fascist turns so our movement of 20 years ago is now a movement to defend democracy to defend earth democracy i wrote my book earth democracy because all these journalists would say oh the anti globalizers know what they are against they don t know what they are for we said we know what we are for that s why we are here to defend the earth our work our lives our democracy so i wrote earth democracy and i that is even more urgently the agenda for today what we need to learn from 20 years ago is that when people wake up to the situation and when people are determined in all their diversity the turtles and the teamsters can walk together to defend the rights of the earth and our rights that s the moment we are in today we have to unite for a fight for the planet and a fight for the last person including the last displaced person who is today s refugee juan gonzález lori wallach i wanted to ask you the impact that the protests had and how things have changed i wanted to turn to the cover of foreign policy magazine in the spring of 2000 which featured you lori wallach with the headline why is this woman smiling because she just beat up the wto in seattle that s why_ of course you didn t beat up the wto by yourself there were the thousands of people out there and as vandana shiva has said the third world delegates within the assembly that were also opposed to the bullying of the west i m wondering if you could talk about the impact did you think that was going to happen in november of 1999 and how has the world capitalist system adjusted to those kinds of protests since then lori wallach so what you wrote in your column was my personal experience which is i was awakened by the tear gas i sound like i did today like i did in day five of the protests i saw the power of direct action protests of brave people putting themselves in the way of corporate power and a whole generation even the people who worked to organize who spent a year traveling around the u s educating people about the wto doing seminars and union hall discussions people were really after the first day empowered awakened unified in a way to see what certainly was the aspiration to shut down that meeting to see that people power had effectively overcome the world s most powerful corporations and their goal of expanding the wto s roles even more broadly than they already were and the amazing outcome of that i think was that we had almost an enzymatic effect on what was going on in the negotiating suites because as vandana said people in developing countries had been fighting the wto had been hit by its effects right away who knew what it meant and their governments and their negotiators in geneva at the wto had been pushing back and they were fighting for no wto expansion but instead to fix the existing rules and so seeing all of these people in the streets really had an effect on the negotiators in the suites the developing country negotiators were largely locked out of the decision making rooms so they were in the seattle convention center looking at the protests on tv and that combination of inside and outside maybe provided that last oomph for the negotiators from the caribbean and africa and latin america who had been fighting this agenda for years to in seattle block the wto expansion but the bottom line of that story is after almost 15 years more of protest mass protests at wto ministerial in cancun in hong kong in geneva as well as protests in many developing countries capitals as well as enormous bravery of developing country negotiators in the geneva negotiating center wto expansion was defeated the people won the agenda that was the most horrific extreme version of globalization did not come to fruition and we see the reverberations of that empowerment of that experience of winning of having an alternative of a better world and stopping that corporate power that experience is reflected in people s movements that have had incredible victories around the world so that even as we are living with the catastrophe of the existing wto rules people power stopped that expansion that would have made things even worse and now we basically have to fight as vandana said to change the existing rules and to some degree the wto now is in an amazing crisis it has never regained its legitimacy since seattle and on december 11th its ability to issue its outrageous rulings against countries gmo policies and environmental policies and health policies and development policies will be shut down because at that point the wto s dispute system will no longer have a quorum there s enough of a protest about the systems operations but is the wto paying attention to this existential threat to its own survival no its agenda is to again try and expand its rules this time to constrain governments from regulating the internet giants that are undermining our privacy and monopolizing the world so am i thinking the wto is going to reform no it is going to take a lot more people power butt whomping to actually get the rules we need amy goodman i want to thank you both for being with us lori wallach of public citizen s global trade watch in the streets 20 years ago in seattle and vandana shiva indian scholar environmental activist physicist food sovereignty and seed freedom advocate alternative globalization author you are in rome italy usually in india or i should say you re just a world citizen because you re always traveling the globe what award are you winning today vandana vandana shiva it s called the minerva award minerva is the goddess of knowledge and to return to the recognition that women have knowledge amy goodman well i thank you so much for being with us to these two women of knowledge who have joined us vandana shiva and lori wallach this is democracy now when we come back we look at the movement the independent media movement that grew out of the battle of seattle stay with us

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com overview on the 2nd of december 2015 after almost three years and 14 rounds of negotiations president donald tusk president jean claude juncker and prime minister of vietnam nguyễn tấn dũng announced the conclusion of the negotiations of the eu vietnam free trade agreement evfta the evfta is a new generation free trade agreement between vietnam and the eu on 26 june 2018 the evfta was split into two separate agreement one on trade and one on investment in august 2018 eu and vietnam completed the legal review of the evfta and the eu vietnam investment protection agreement evipa the evfta needs to be ratified by the european commission and european parliament while the evipa must be additionally ratified by the parliament of each eu member countries on 30th june 2019 eu commissioner for trade mrs cecilia malmstrom together with romanian minister in charge of business commerce and business mr stefan radu oprea represented the eu to sign the eu vietnam fta evfta in hanoi both the evfta and evipa are said to bring the best advantages and benefits ever for enterprises employees and consumers in both the eu and vietnam vietnam s gdp is expected to increase by 10 15 per cent and exports are predicted to rise by 30 40 per cent in the next 10 years meanwhile the real wages of skilled labourers could rise up to 12 per cent while the real salaries of common workers could increase 13 per cent once the evfta is ratified and implemented and once government policies and institutional reforms begin to take effect vietnam s business activities will boom however issues still remain in this chapter eurocham s legal sector committee will raise the issues relevant to their particular industries and make specific recommendations in order to address these concerns legal environment general market access for goods and services the evfta is the most comprehensive and ambitious trade and investment agreement that the eu has ever concluded with a developing country in asia it is the second agreement in the asean region after singapore and it will intensify bilateral relations between vietnam and the eu vietnam will have access to a potential market of more than 500 million people and a total gdp of us 15 000 billion accounting for 22 per cent of global gdp meanwhile exporters and investors from the eu will have further opportunities to access one of the largest and fastest growing countries in the region according to a report released in early 2017 covering 134 cities worldwide hanoi and ho chi minh city are ranked among the top 10 most dynamic cities due to their low costs rapid consumer market expansion strong population growth and transition towards activities attracting significant amounts of foreign direct investment fdi according to the world bank vietnam has one of the fastest growing economies in the world 7 1 gdp growth in 2018 and 6 7 at the mid point of 2019 to put that in perspective vietnam s gdp is growing at almost twice the rate of the usa in addition vietnam has the fastest growing middle class in the region it is predicted to almost double in size between 2014 and 2020 from 12 million to 33 million people vietnam s super rich population is also growing faster than anywhere else and there is no doubt that it will continue to rise over the next ten years market access for goods nearly all customs duties over 99 per cent of the tariff lines will be eliminated the small remaining number will be partially liberalised through duty free quotas as vietnam is a developing country it will liberalise 65 per cent of the value of eu exports to vietnam representing around half of the tariff lines at entry into force the remaining duties will be eliminated over the next ten years this is an unprecedented far reaching tariff elimination for a country like vietnam proving its aspiration for deeper integration and trading relations with the eu meanwhile the eu agreed to eliminate duties for 84 per cent of the tariff lines for goods imported from vietnam immediately at the entry into force of the fta within 7 years from the effective date of the fta more than 99 per cent of the tariff lines will have been eliminated for vietnam this is a wider reduction compared with the 95 per cent of the tariff lines that the former tpp countries offer to vietnamese imports in the asean region vietnam is the top country exporting goods to the eu however the market share of vietnam s products in the eu is still small as a result of the evfta the sectors set to benefit most are main export sectors that used to be subject to high tariffs from the eu including textiles footwear and agricultural products the eu is also a good point for vietnam to reach other further markets vietnam will benefit more from the evfta compared with other ftas since vietnam and the eu are considered to be two supporting and complementary markets vietnam exports goods that the eu cannot or does not produce itself i e fishery products tropical fruits etc while the products imported from the eu are also those vietnam does not produce domestically including machinery aircrafts and pharmaceutical products with better market access for goods from the eu vietnamese enterprises could source eu materials technology and equipment at a better quality and price this in turn will improve their own product quality and ease vietnam s burden of over reliance on its other main trading partners the evfta is considered as a template for the eu to further conclude ftas with different countries in the asean region with the aim of concluding a region to region fta once there is a sufficient critical mass of ftas with individual asean countries this process could take between 10 15 years thus vietnam should take advantage of this window of opportunity before ftas with others in the region are concluded and take effect to become a regional hub market access for eu service providers although vietnam s world trade organisation wto commitments are used as a basis for the services commitments vietnam has not only opened additional sub sectors for eu service providers but also made commitments deeper than those outlined in the wto offering the eu the best possible access to vietnam s market sub sectors that are not committed under the wto but under which vietnam has made commitments include interdisciplinary research development r d services nursing services physiotherapists and para medical personnel packaging services trade fairs and exhibitions services and building cleaning services when these services reach international standards vietnam has a chance to export high quality services resulting in not only an increase in export value but also export efficiency thus helping to improve the trade balance government procurement vietnam has one of the highest ratios of public investment to gdp in the world 39 per cent annually from 1995 however until now vietnam has not agreed to its government procurement being covered by the government procurement agreement gpa of the wto now for the first time vietnam has undertaken to do so in the evfta the fta commitments on government procurement mainly deal with the requirement to treat eu bidders or domestic bidders with eu investment capital equally with vietnamese bidders when the government purchases goods or requests a service worth over the specified threshold vietnam undertakes to follow the general principles of national treatment and non discrimination it will publish information on intended procurement and post award information in ba o đâ u thâ u public procurement newspaper and on information on procurement system at muasamcong mpi gov vn and the official gazette in a timely manner allow sufficient time for suppliers to prepare for and submit requests for participation and responsive tenders and maintain the confidentiality of tenders the fta also requires its parties to assess bids based on fair and objective principles evaluate and award bids only based on criteria set out in notices and tender documentation and create an effective regime for complaints and settling disputes these rules require parties to ensure that their bidding procedures match the commitments and protect their own interests thus helping vietnam to solve its problem of bids being won by cheap but low quality service providers government procurement of goods or services or any combination thereof that satisfy the following criteria falls within the scope of the fta government procurement rules criteria fta investment dispute settlement this is now covered in the ipa in disputes regarding investment for example expropriation without compensation or discrimination of investment an investor is allowed to bring the dispute to the investment tribunal for settlement to ensure the fairness and independence of the dispute settlement a permanent tribunal will be comprised of 9 members 3 nationals each appointed from the eu and vietnam together with 3 nationals appointed from third countries cases will be heard by a 3 member tribunal selected by the chairman of the tribunal in a random and unpredictable way this is also to ensure consistent rulings in similar cases thus making the dispute settlement more predictable the ipa also allows a sole tribunal member where the claimant is a small or medium sized enterprise or the compensation of damaged claims is relatively low this is a flexible approach considering that vietnam is still a developing country in case either of the disputing parties disagrees with the decision of the tribunal it can appeal it to the appeal tribunal while this is different from the common arbitration proceeding it is quite similar to the 2 level dispute settlement mechanism in the wto panel and appellate body we believe that this mechanism could save time and cost for the whole proceedings the final settlement is binding and enforceable from the local courts regarding its validity except for a five year period following the entry into force of the fta for vietnam please refer to further comments in the chapter on judicial recourse conclusion the evfta once ratified will create sustainable growth mutual benefits in several sectors and be an effective tool to balance trade relations between the eu and vietnam vietnam is working hard to meet the high standards set out in the fta and is currently offering greater opportunities for foreign businesses in preparation for the fta s finalisation it is now time for foreign investors to start their business plans and grasp the upcoming clear opportunities disclaimer this alert has been prepared and published for informational purposes only and is not offered

you are here zrenjanin serbia nov 29 xinhua in his decades long career enver borogovac used to work away from his hometown where new projects were seen as a rare occurrence but recently the serbian engineer participated in laying the groundwork for one of the biggest foreign direct investment projects that his country ever hosted right here in zrenjanin on the outskirts of zrenjanin 80 km north of serbia s capital belgrade borogovac and his colleagues have erected a 4 km long wall to start building a 130 hectare tire manufacturing plant at an estimated cost of 990 million u s dollars linglong tire a publicly traded company headquartered in east china s shandong province began the construction of the plant in april a milestone project that upon completion would churn out 13 62 million radial tires per year equivalent to an estimated 600 million dollars in revenue it is also one of the latest signals of a deepening economic relationship between china and serbia the all weather friends that have been reaping mutual benefits on the basis of strong and lasting friendship mutual benefits a serbian plant will bring the chinese tire manufacturer which has passed many european automobile makers supplier reviews closer to its main export market notably its german and czech clients wang feng chairman of linglong told xinhua in a written interview apart from slashed logistics cost and delivery time a serbian plant could take advantage of inexpensive local raw materials and skilled workers wang added for zrenjanin linglong brings many jobs many employment opportunities to people mayor cedomir janjic told xinhua noting that the agricultural manufacturing is the dominant industry in zrenjanin and its auto industry needs to be updated janjic said he expects other investors to come and invest in the city for sure this investment of linglong will help us in this drive said janjic the investment has also heightened the need for better infrastructure janjic said thanks to this great investment we are starting to discuss the construction of the highway belgrade zrenjanin this is yet another great benefit that follows this investment and goes together with linglong to produce a vital chemical for the rubber vulcanization process there are ongoing negotiations with a chinese zinc oxide manufacturer over the construction of a factory in the city as well janjic said overall more than 2 000 job posts will open as a result of the chinese investments across serbia chinese investments have poured into such sectors as automobile parts mining steel furniture and others creating thousands of jobs according to the development agency of serbia a government office on investment promotion that includes one of the most successful foreign acquisitions in serbia when a leading chinese steel and iron producer breathed fresh life into the nearly bankrupt smederevo steel factory in 2012 u s steel an american integrated steel producer headquartered in pittsburgh sold the smederevo steel factory to the serbian government for a symbolic 1 dollar leaving the company and its 5 000 plus workers in limbo as serbian president aleksandar vucic explained the steelworks consumed around 12 million euro of state funds of serbia every month and we did not know how to solve this problem no one wanted to help us everybody was silent when the factory was returned to us for 1 usd in 2016 the serbian government signed a deal with hbis group china s largest and the world s second largest steel and iron producer based in northern china to sell smederevo steel factory which was then renamed hesteel serbia with the over 5 000 employees staying on at the new company today it is the most successful factory and biggest exporter in serbia in 2019 vucic said in september two months after the steel plant kicked off a modernization investment worth 120 million dollars from its parent hbis group faith in friendship zhao jun general director of hbis serbia told xinhua that the revival of the plant was based on the localization of three key aspects economic interests staff and culture wang stressed his confidence in government policies and business environment of serbia as the largest western balkan country by landmass and population serbia led the region in 2018 with a record 5 98 billion dollars investment in 105 greenfield projects according to fdi intelligence a specialist service of the britain based financial times in half a decade serbia has surpassed over 40 economies in the world bank s annual doing business report which evaluates the overall business climate in a given country in the most recent 2020 report serbia ranks no 44 globally ahead of such western european union member states as belgium italy and luxembourg for chinese investors what made serbia stand out from other potential investment destinations is the deep trust and friendship between the two peoples china and serbia are all weather friends and important cooperation partners said chinese president xi jinping during a state visit to serbia in 2016 when both sides decided to elevate bilateral ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership efforts should be made to well implement major cooperation projects in production capacity infrastructure development and other fields xi told visiting serbian prime minister ana brnabic earlier this month serbia is also among the first signatories to the belt and road initiative echoing china s blueprint to bring the world closer through infrastructure and other projects in addition to building and investing in factories chinese companies have been constructing bridges and roads in serbia earlier this year the serbian government and china road and bridge corporation signed an investment agreement on the establishment of an industrial park in belgrade with a land area of 3 2 square km it will be a platform for overseas high tech companies to enter serbia and the region this friendship is now at the highest possible level we understand support and help each other and this definitely contributed to strengthening the international reputation of serbia said professor zarko obradovic a member of serbian parliament and president of the friendship group with china enditem
the dollar headed for its highest weekly finish against the safe haven yen since may on friday as data showing the us economy on a firm footing prompted investors to scale back rate cut bets nerves persisted though as other major currencies spent the week rangebound navigating a blizzard of trade war headlines that offered few clues as to when or how an overdue truce might be agreed between washington and beijing there seems to be pretty good optimism around the trade talks going on between us and china said william o loughlin a portfolio manager at rivkin securities in sydney though as we know that can change on a dime the rally doesn t feel like a euphoric super bullish rally it does feel like climbing the wall of worry on friday the dollar was steady at 109 51 japanese yen and if it holds there will post a 0 7 per cent gain for the week and hit its highest weekly close since may 31 overnight trade was light with us desks closed for thanksgiving the british pound has been the week s other main beneficiary adding half a percentage point as prime minister boris johnson s conservative party has firmed in opinion polls ahead of the december 12 election sterling was steady on friday at 1 2910 while the euro held at 1 1012 the market has come to the view that this is johnson s election to lose now said chris weston head of research at melbourne brokerage pepperstone with expectations he can win with a large margin that said should any polls call this margin into question where invariably there will be one or two then gbp could see a sharp sell off although i would be using that weakness to buy the dollar s strength this week has drawn on hopes that the united states and china are indeed in the process of negotiating a ceasefire in their damaging tariff war and strong us economic data china has vowed to impose firm countermeasures after trump s approval of a bill backing hong kong s pro democracy protesters on wednesday but is yet to indicate whether they would have any bearing on trade talks us growth picked up slightly in the third quarter data showed on wednesday in contrast to other indicators showing a slowdown in global activity the fed also flagged an upbeat outlook amid signs of labour market strength and a possible turnaround in business investment that prompted a pullback on rate cut bets for this year and next with the market now pricing in a 5 per cent chance the fed will hike rates next month and mostly expecting it to hold steady the strong greenback has australian dollar slightly weaker for the week but steady on friday ahead of a central bank meeting on tuesday where the market has priced an 11 per cent chance of a cut in interest rates to a record low 0 5 per cent it last traded at 0 6767 not far above a six week low hit on thursday the new zealand dollar was flat on friday at 0 6418 and held its ground for the week buoyed by rebounding business sentiment china s yuan was steady at 7 0287 per dollar in offshore trade
the us was closed overnight for the thanksgiving holiday meaning markets were effectively left with scraps to feast on making for a quiet session while the americans ponder the different ways one can consume left over turkey i made a curry once one significant event did occur overnight having signed the hong kong bill into law on wednesday evening the american president did what any sensible person should do when you have seriously upset china jump on a plane to afghanistan president trump s surprise visit to american troops in kabul was accompanied by the announcement that talks with the taliban had resumed and that they were close to a deal the significance if true could have profound consequences for the 2020 presidential elections if president trump can effectively end america s longest war on paper at least a solution that eluded presidents bush and obama it would potentially play out even better than a sino us trade deal with voters you heard it here first folks with the initial displeasure from china over the us hong kong law torpedoing yesterdays nascent rally on asia equity markets the region was set for a cautiously bullish start today that hope has been clouded as both south korean and japanese industrial production data this morning has come in far below expectations south korean ind prod fell 1 70 mom versus 0 10 expected japanese ind prod fell a huge 4 2 mom versus an expected drop of 2 10 the annual drops 2 50 for south korea and 7 40 for japan make for ugly reading it suggests the us china trade dispute continues taking its toll on asian economies despite signs of some green shoots south korea s official interest rate announcement at 0900 sgt will now assume a more considerable significance officials will be intensely aware that another cut could weaken the korean won potentially drawing president trump s trade ire most likely the central bank will hold preferring to wait and see like so many of its global peers however it will probably signal that it stands ready to ease further if necessary in a coordinated effort with the government from the fiscal side china s threats yesterday to retaliate over the us hong kong law will probably remain just that threats china has its own issues especially around corporate debt and regional bank credit quality it can ill afford to waste any progress so far especially if the us president is freshly emboldened with a policy win in afghanistan pragmatism should overcome anger vietnamese industrial production is released at 1000 sgt today with an expected rise of 9 20 yoy the data should reveal whether vietnam along with thailand continues to be the alleged beneficiaries from the movement of production out of china a weak reading could puncture that balloon and suggest the optimism from earlier in the week the author included was premature after engorging themselves on left over turkey american s head to the shops today for the black friday sales it marks the start of the critical holiday buying season for retailers with the amount of anarchy shown by consumers at shopping malls being closely watched by the markets as an early indicator to the health of the us consumer online shopping data will be monitored closely as well but it is much more fun watching people fight over half price 80 inch flat screen tv and then try to load it into a standard sized shopping trolley a david attenborough wildlife documentary featuring hunting lions has nothing on black friday equities with us markets closed asian equities have made a cautious start after weak industrial production data from south korea and japan the nikkei 225 is higher by 0 25 but the south korean kospi has slipped by 0 15 the australian asx 200 is flat but early indications suggest the hang seng and straits times indices will be slightly negative in early trading trading will be muted in asia as we near the end of the week regional markets enthusiasm is likely to be tempered by worries that china will announce some sort of retaliation over the us hong kong law currencies currency markets went into a deep freeze overnight with the us on holiday they have started in much the same tone in asia this morning the chilean peso hit another record low overnight with the central bank intervening to support it with much of latam under pressure the fall out continues to be localised to that geographical region as emerging markets in asia remain much more sensitive to us china trade the british pound gave back some of its gains overnight falling to 1 2910 in london trading although by far the most volatile g 7 currency at the moment gbp remains locked in a 1 2800 1 3000 range overall oil oil markets were closed in north america with brent crude steady at 64 00 a barrel and wti unchanged around 58 00 a barrel opec overnight signalled its intent to extend their production cuts at their meeting next week but this had no impact on even oil futures markets much like an interim us china trade deal maintaining the opec cuts at present levels merely maintains the status quo and keeps the lights on opec will need to surprise us with an increase in production cuts to spur any short term price increases otherwise black gold remains at the mercy of daily sentiment swings on trade negotiations gold gold rose slightly overnight to 1456 00 an ounce with futures activity muted by the us holiday gold has edged higher to 1456 50 in the early asian session but investors attention appears to be well and truly focused elsewhere the 1445 00 and 1463 00 an ounce regions remain

million or 0 73 per fully diluted shares in the prior year the bank has commenced actions in effort to pursue a recovery of this loan the third quarter and full year results also reflect lower net interest income and a temporary increase in operating expenses associated with the organic build up of the sba lending business expansion of deposit initiatives and significant costs incurred in conjunction with strengthening institutional infrastructure processes controls and documentation to address regulatory requirements and to prepare crossing the 1 billion threshold patriot has prioritized the expansion of its regional retail locations into urban centers across southern connecticut resulting in the bank having a presence in every major i 95 corridor community from downtown

2018 for the year to date period the net interest income was 19 2 million a decrease of 8 from the prior year this decline was due to higher deposit costs the impact of non performing and reduced rate loans lower loan fees and the impact of subordinated debt issued in june of 2018 higher retail deposit rates are primarily the result of increased rate competition in patriot s local retail markets the bank is exploring alternative lower cost funding sources which along with a recent decline in market interest rates is expected to positively impact the aggregate cost of funding in future periods net interest margin was 2 70 for the third quarter of 2019 as compared to 2 93 in the prior quarter and 3 11 for the third quarter of 2018 this decline reflects the higher cost of funding the

2 million as compared to 285 000 for the prior year the 2019 increase was primarily due to a large provision booked in the second quarter of 2019 associated with a single loan relationship non interest income was 571 000 in the third quarter of 2019 31 lower than the prior quarter and 61 higher than the third quarter of 2018 the year to date non interest income was 2 1 million in 2019 95
