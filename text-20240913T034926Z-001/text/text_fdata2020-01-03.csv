introduction governments across south asia face many challenges as they seek to improve the lives of the more than 1 8 billion people that live in the region increasing geopolitical competition especially between and among china russia and the united states is one factor that is affecting progress this great power competition including over the south china sea is intertwined with regional rivalries e g india and pakistan india and china and the united states and iran and has important economic military technological and environmental consequences energy is a key strategic sector in this competition as china pursues its expansive belt and road initiative bri infrastructure and trade vision russia uses arms sales and nuclear energy to expand its regional presence and the united states confronts iran and gears up its free and open indo pacific strategy and asia edge enhancing development and growth through energy initiative this issue brief considers the transformation of the electricity sector in bangladesh it is the fourth country analysis in the atlantic council s transforming the power sector in developing countries series this issue brief applies to bangladesh the analytical framework developed in the first report in the series which presents general challenges and strategic priorities for developing countries in the context of their implementation of electric power policies and reforms following the 2015 paris agreement on climate change bangladesh is a large population of 163 million poor nominal gross domestic product gdp per capita of 1 827 and developing country that has seen a steady gdp growth rate of between 6 and almost 8 percent since 2010 this growth has increased energy and electricity demand and placed pressure on domestic gas resources the development of a viable energy sector and expanding electricity access will be of critical importance to its goal of moving into the ranks of the middle income countries by 2021 but bangladesh has had a history of factious politics and the election year of 2018 saw mounting tensions after the arrest of bangladesh nationalist party bnp chairperson and former prime minister khaleda zia despite protests over election fraud sheikh hasina and her awami league party won a landslide victory in the december 2018 national election and now have an overwhelming majority in the parliament bangladesh also faces severe impacts from climate change including frequent flooding and salinity problems that are displacing a growing number of people from the country s huge ganges river delta and furthering the move to urban areas in 2018 bangladesh was hit by heavy monsoon rains which had an especially devasting impact on the thousands of rohingya refugees at the kutupalong refugee camp in cox s bazar kutupalong is reportedly the largest refugee camp in the world with more than 630 000 residents bangladesh signed and ratified the paris agreement in 2016 and has developed plans for increased mitigation and adaption activities this issue brief explores the linkages between geopolitics poverty and climate change as they relate to the transformation of the power sector and the following five key challenges critical challenges the energy sector is critical to bangladesh s progress in improving standards of living and achieving the united nations sustainable development goals sdgs in this issue brief we consider the five common challenges facing developing countries and their specifics in bangladesh these challenges are 1 meeting growing energy demand and moving to a cleaner energy mix 2 improving governance and transparency 3 increasing affordability and access 4 addressing environmental degradation and climate change and 5 achieving power sector financial viability meeting growing energy demand and moving to a cleaner energy mix developing countries are playing an increasingly important role in global energy markets in 2018 countries that are not part of the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd represented almost 60 percent of global primary energy consumption that share is expected to increase as these countries account for as much as 90 percent of future energy growth to 2040 bangladesh is an example of a country with rapid energy demand growth its primary energy consumption has grown at a rate of 6 4 percent over the 2007 2017 period in 2018 while gdp rose by 7 9 percent primary energy consumption increased by 8 6 percent over 2017 figure 1 shows the dominant position of gas and oil in bangladesh s primary energy mix although bangladesh has considerable domestic natural gas production crude oil production in 2018 was only 3 000 barrels per day b d or less than 2 percent of domestic oil consumption bangladesh has seen crude oil and refined product import costs rise from 3 1 billion or 7 percent of current account imports in fiscal year fy 2017 to 3 67 billion in fy2018 and an estimated 4 85 billion in fy2019 although bangladesh s gas production has increased from 19 3 bcm in 2010 to 27 5 bcm in 2018 consumption has grown from 16 6 bcm to 28 4 bcm over the same period in bangladesh demand for electricity has outpaced the growth in primary energy consumption electricity generation growth over the 2007 2017 period averaged a booming 9 percent although installed capacity has grown to about 21 419 megawatts mw in september 2019 bangladesh s peak electricity generation was only 10 958 mw in 2018 and fell short of the peak electricity demand of 14 014 mw resulting in outages and unserved demand the bangladesh revised master plan prepared by the japan international cooperation agency jica for the government of bangladesh in 2016 projects that electricity demand will more than double over the period to 2041 rising to 236 terawatt hours twh from the 2018 level of 79 twh this forecast is driven by the expectation of a large increase in industrial electricity consumption as shown in figure 2 although gas is the leading fuel for power generation in bangladesh figure 3 the country has significant oil fired capacity that its government added in the 2010 2012 period through contracts with private companies for quick fix rental units to meet the emergency electricity supply gap grid connected renewable generation is only at a very nascent stage this issue brief examines more closely the changing power mix in the strategic priorities section improving governance and transparency the management of the energy and electricity sector in bangladesh is highly centralized in the ministry of power energy and natural resources as well as several state owned corporations sheikh hasina holds this ministry portfolio and her energy adviser dr tawfiq e elahi chowdhury has been quite influential in policy decisions e g to pursue coal and gas imports and nuclear power unlike in pakistan which has major hydro resources the evolution of the energy institutions in bangladesh was different with both the early establishment of a ministry of power energy and mineral resources and the separation of water and power the bangladesh power development board bpdb was established in 1972 as the main body responsible for electric power under the ministry given the large rural population the bangladesh rural electrification board breb was created in 1977 with assistance from the us agency for international development usaid and the us rural electric cooperative system model was adopted partial system unbundling in 1995 led to the establishment of the power grid company of bangladesh in 1996 to manage the high voltage transmission system urban distribution operations are split between the bpdb and several public limited companies dhaka electric supply company ltd the dhaka power distribution company ltd the northern electric supply company ltd and the west zone power distribution company ltd a separate division of the ministry of energy oversees oil and gas while petrobangla established in 1974 is the main state oil and gas operator chevron under contract with petrobangla is the largest gas producer and has been working in bangladesh since 1989 when it was awarded contracts to develop the bibiyana jalalabad and moulavi bazar gas fields bangladesh has established two energy regulatory bodies the bangladesh energy regulatory commission established in 2003 to oversee tariffs and operations in electricity gas and oil and the sustainable and renewable energy development authority sreda established in 2014 to promote renewable energy and energy efficiency both bodies are strongly influenced by the ministry of energy and are working to develop their capabilities and increase their autonomy the ministry of energy has made some progress in increasing transparency of the sector and the government has been generally good at honoring its power purchase agreements with the private sector a major ministry digital media marketing program has started disseminating information about the sector to the public and a common web platform linked to social media sites integrates the various ministry websites increasing affordability and access bangladesh is among the top twenty access deficit countries according to the world bank s 2019 tracking sdg7 report however bangladesh is recognized as a leading developing country in improving access electricity access has increased from 55 percent in 2010 to 88 percent in 2017 with rural areas having 81 percent estimated access bangladeshi officials recently indicated that the overall electricity coverage rate has increased to 93 percent reducing the number of people without electricity to as low as 10 million compared with the 2017 estimate of 20 million the government of bangladesh seeks to achieve 100 percent coverage by 2021 this target is well in advance of sdg 7 which aspires to 100 percent electricity access by 2030 the breb started with about thirteen palli bidyut samities pbs or rural cooperatives as the population has grown the number of rural cooperatives has grown to eighty financial viability and losses have been a problem the world bank has helped breb reduce these losses lack of reliable power from the bpdb has restricted development at the same time the country through the quasi governmental infrastructure development company limited idcol has pursued solar home systems and micro grid programs to serve villages where the pbs system has yet to connect bangladesh is noteworthy in having the world s largest off grid solar program and has increased solar off grid access from 9 percent in 2016 to 14 percent in 2018 addressing environmental degradation and climate change the south asian region faces enormous environmental challenges due to its geographical and ecological situation and growing population and urban pressures bangladesh with its low lying coastal position and large dense population that is projected to grow to 202 million by 2050 has been especially vulnerable bangladesh is situated in the extensive riverine system of the brahmaputra jamuna ganges padma and the surma meghna systems and their many tributaries that occupy 79 percent of the country and flow into the massive delta in the south it relies heavily on irrigation and both diesel and electric pumps for its agricultural and urban economies bangladesh experiences regular flooding and cyclones with parts of the country flooding almost every year the german watch climate risk index ranked bangladesh sixth on its list of countries affected by climate change during 1997 2016 with 187 severe climate events inflicting estimated losses of 2 3 billion although bangladesh experiences these damaging climate events it produces minimal amounts of co2 emissions bp estimates bangladesh s co2 energy emissions in 2018 at 90 4 metric tons mt or only 0 3 percent of global energy related co2 emissions despite its very low overall as well as per capita level of emissions bangladesh did put forward in its 2015 intended national determined contribution indc an unconditional contribution target of 222 mt for power transport and industry in 2030 compared with a business as usual bau projection of 234 mt the power sector component of this unconditional scenario totals 86 mt in 2030 or a 5 percent reduction from the bau number and the 2011 base of 21 mt with external assistance the conditional target in power drops to 75 mt an 18 percent reduction from the base but this scenario still sees power sector emissions growing by 257 percent over the 2011 2030 period we conclude that even meeting the relative reduction targets will require major changes in strategy which will be discussed later in this document achieving power sector financial viability like many other developing countries bangladesh struggles with cost recovery in the power sector inadequate revenue generation by the distribution companies has created difficulties for the bpdb and the government which has had to cover the losses to maintain payments to the private generators especially the rental oil units the gap between total revenues and operating expenses of the bpdb has however narrowed as shown in figure 4 the overall net bpdb loss in fy2016 17 was reported as 44 348 900 000 bangladeshi taka about 528 million which was somewhat less than in the previous year purchases of power from non bpdb domestic generators and from india constituted the largest portion of the bpdb s expenses about 75 percent with purchases from independent power producers ipps representing the largest share of these expenses 27 percent the bpdb s financial position was helped in fy2016 17 by a 23 percent increase in revenue collections and a reduction in distribution system losses from 11 percent to 9 percent increasing revenue generation while ensuring affordability for the poor is a huge challenge but it is critical to mobilizing the resources needed to invest in the expansion and modernization of the distribution system to meet the rapid demand growth the world bank has estimated the cost to bangladesh s economy of the subsidies and weak management performance in the power sector to be about 11 2 billion in fy2016 or 5 percent of gdp in large part due to underpricing of domestic gas direct subsidies are provided to both electricity consumers and electricity generators from the bpdb gas is primarily used in power generation where it provides almost 60 percent of electricity generation domestic gas is underpriced for power generators compared to the opportunity costs a second world bank study concludes ncreasing the 2018 price of domestically produced natural gas to import parity so that the weighted average price equals the import price of lng 8 51 gj would result in almost 7 billion of additional government revenue as bangladesh increases its liquefied natural gas lng imports the weighted average price will increase the government has recognized the need to increase gas prices and the regulator in july 2019 raised the average consumer price by 32 8 percent with the power sector receiving a 40 percent increase strategic priorities the government of bangladesh in grappling with the above challenges has had to make a number of strategic choices that have important long term political economic and environmental consequences these choices have been influenced by both external and domestic factors and interests this section describes some of these choices and suggests possible ways to improve the policy institutional and market framework creating a sound policy legal and regulatory environment strategic priority the government of bangladesh needs to take a hard look at its current energy policies and power market design it should consider how to introduce more competition in the market reduce subsidies improve efficiencies in the state companies strengthen the role and competence of energy regulators and develop a more attractive environment for private investment particularly in domestic gas development and renewable energy discussion the government of bangladesh has received myriad advice from other governments and international financial institutions on its energy approach in the power sector a major influence has come from japanese advisers who played a significant role in developing the revised power sector master plan of 2016 there is reason however given the strong interest of japanese companies in exporting coal plants to question one of its central premises i e coal will be the cheapest primary energy now and in the future a comprehensive analysis of the full costs and benefits of this strategic priority needs to be conducted along with a realistic assessment of viable alternatives as discussed below bangladesh has significant renewable energy resources and its proven natural gas reserves are estimated at 7 3 trillion cubic feet mobilizing private investment in both these resource options should be a high priority increasing private investor access to domestic gas fields as well as offshore areas along with domestic gas well head price reform would be important steps reduced losses and full cost recovery of electricity retail prices together with improved access to land would reduce investor risks in renewable energy projects with the increases in renewable energy the greater complexity in the system with the addition of nuclear and coal and the large investment requirements to meet electricity needs the role of the energy regulator will be of even greater importance to furthering transparency ensuring that accounting systems meet acceptable standards rationalizing tariffs and moving to full cost recovery implementing effective licensing systems and formulating new market designs and market monitoring systems the government should provide the resources necessary to strengthen both nerc and sreda and ensure they are independent adequately staffed and receive opportunities for professional development developing efficient institutional and market structures strategic priority the single buyer with independent power generation system needs further reform and privatization to create a more competitive market environment discussion the bpdb is the single buyer in bangladesh s power system it buys power from the generators and sells it to urban distribution companies and the breb cooperatives but bpdb has not been able to pass on the full price of power to the distribution entities with population and income growth breb consumption has grown to more than 42 percent of total electricity sales to distribution to improve local supply the breb has been permitted to develop small ipps in its service areas at least twelve units totaling 225 mw with capacity between 11 and 33 mw each are in operation a key element of the bangladeshi government s overall economic strategy is the creation of special economic zones over the next fifteen years as many as 100 zones are envisioned the bangladesh economic zone authority beza has approved thirty seven zones with eight export zones already in operation companies from countries with strong government support especially china japan and south korea are negotiating deals to establish industrial plants in these zones these economic developments and the growth in incomes and urbanization require a comprehensive review of the electricity market design that bangladesh will need in the future given the investment requirements opportunities should be pursued for private investors to participate both in urban distribution companies and in these new economic zones including the building of grid interactive mini grids and generation plants achieving a cleaner and resilient generation mix strategic priority bangladesh should continue to diversify its electricity mix but reorient its strategy to give priority to lower carbon sources and away from oil and coal by focusing on gas renewables and increased energy efficiency given the growing demand for gas and potential for declines in major gas fields high priority should be given to increasing onshore and offshore gas exploration and development including through the increase in the well head price of gas given the declining costs of renewables and its favorable solar resources bangladesh should also reexamine considering the new world bank solar park model its grid based renewable targets and how mini grids and distributed solar power systems can play a larger role in its future mix discussion with current installed capacity at about 21 419 mw the bpdb seeks to reach 24 000 mw by 2021 40 000 mw by 2030 and 60 000 mw by 2041 bangladesh has had difficulty in meeting peak electricity demand which reached 14 796 mw on may 29 2019 against generation of 12 893 mw peak demand was more than 3 500 mw higher than the recorded level of 11 387 mw on july 18 2018 below is a discussion of the various strategic options for meeting the increases in electricity demand natural gas bangladesh s domestic onshore gas fields have long been the main source of gas for the power and industrial sectors gas production has increased at an average rate of 5 7 percent over the 2007 2017 period and 3 2 percent in the 2017 2018 year chevron s three fields have supplied about 58 percent of the production after considering the sale of its gas assets in 2017 to chinese investors chevron decided to remain in bangladesh and invest in maintaining production in april 2019 the company was awarded rights to explore block 9 an onshore area east of dhaka near the bakhrabad gas field this award is hopefully a sign that the government will begin to open other onshore areas to foreign investors that can make the needed investment but there is concern about the potential decline in production from chevron s bibiyana and several petrobangla fields in the future the government s efforts to attract companies in expensive offshore exploration has been unsuccessful a new model production sharing agreement with improved prices and allowance for exports has been prepared but auctions for new blocks have not yet occurred these factors in the face of the 6 4 percent growth in gas demand have led the government to pursue imported lng to both meet new requirements and reduce dependence on fuel oil and high speed diesel units which represents about 30 percent of installed electricity generation capacity and have been a major drain on the government budget since electricity retail prices do not cover these costs bangladesh joined the ranks of lng importers in 2018 with the connection of a floating storage regasification unit fsru moored at moheshkhali island near chittagong with a capacity of 3 75 million tonnes per annum mmtpa as with pakistan s first import facility us company excelerate energy with partial funding from the international finance corporation ifc and a fifteen year terminal fee agreement with petrobangla supplied the fsru which began regasifying the first qatar lng on august 12 2018 but inadequate pipeline capacity initially limited output and a 30 kilometer km pipeline is being built between anwara and fouzdarhat petrobangla has entered into a fiften year contract with qatar s rasgas for 2 5 mmtpa in addition oman trading international began deliveries to the excelerate energy fsru in january 2019 under a ten year contract for 1 million tons the international gas union igu reports that bangladesh imported 0 7 million metric tons mmt in 2018 in late november 2019 the first shipment of russian lng reached the summit lng terminal in bangladesh bangladesh plans additional lng import capacity to meet the needs of large new gas combined cycle generation plants in march 2018 a 3 billion project between summit power and mitsubishi subsidiary diamond gas was announced for a two 1 200 mw unit plant based on imported lng the japanese company jera has also taken a stake in the power project bangladesh s second fsru arrived in april 2019 with qatar lng under the agreement between summit lng terminal and excelerate energy while these first two fsrus have been installed relatively quickly despite some issues with rough waters during the monsoon season exxonmobil qatar petroleum and twelve other firms have expressed an interest in building bangladesh s first onshore lng regasification terminal with a larger 7 5 mmtpa capacity this strong private sector interest has spurred the government to approve a new policy to allow private companies to import lng while limiting their sales to the state company petrobangla at the same time petrobangla is reported to be talking with chinese and indian companies about building a 7 5 mmtpa onshore lng terminal in cox s bazar as of this writing bangladesh had just announced an agreement between the bpdb and the saudi private power company acwa power for a 3 600 mw gas to power complex including an lng import facility coal bangladesh s master plan envisions coal providing 40 percent of power generation in the high demand case and 34 percent in the low demand case by 2030 with indian chinese japanese and possibly south korean financing power plants using imported coal are under construction at rampal 1 320 mw and at payra 1 320 mw in southern bangladesh and a large 1 3 gigawatt gw coal facility has been proposed for moheshkhali island in cox s bazar district although this may be developed as a gas complex there have been both local and international protests against these coal plants a draft decision memorandum for review by unesco s world heritage committee advised the government of bangladesh to cease development of the power plant until a strategic environmental assessment could be undertaken as well as place the sundarbans the largest mangrove forest in the world where the rampal plant is being built on a list of natural sites that are in danger the decision to place the site on the endangered list was postponed to 2020 in addition to these imported coal projects there have been proposals for the development of a large open pit coal mine in the phulbari region in the northeast of the country there have been local protests against this project due to concerns over potential destruction of agricultural land and displacement of indigenous communities the government had suspended plans for the project but in early 2019 chinese interests were pursuing projects both in phulbari and in dinajpur an agreement was reportedly signed between gcm resources with the chinese company powerchina for a 4 billion domestic coal mine power project in dinajpur district in northwest bangladesh the bangladeshi decision to start developing a greenfield coal power capacity raises serious questions about economic as well as environmental sustainability these investments are creating long term external financial dependence as well as raising concerns as to the possibility that these plants may become economically unviable as the costs of alternatives falls and climate costs rise nuclear bangladesh has been caught up in the aggressive russian nuclear export drive that together with its military sales has expanded russian influence in both the middle east and south asia russia with its long standing political military and energy relationships with bangladesh has been pursuing a nuclear export project since 2009 in late 2015 russia concluded a twenty eight year ten years grace 11 38 billion state loan at a favorable rate of libor plus 1 75 percent for two generation iii vver 1200 reactors at rooppur 87 miles west of dhaka bangladesh is to provide 10 percent of the project costs construction started in late 2017 and the first unit is planned for completion in 2023 with a second unit one year later russia is working with india on similar units and india is training bangladeshi operators indian architectural and engineering a e companies are engaged in some of the civil works for the units in bangladesh russia is pursuing a long term build own operate boo approach in some of its export deals but it is reported that rosatom the russian state atomic energy corporation will operate the rooppur plant for only the first year nuclear power is projected in the bangladesh revised power sector master plan to account for about 4 percent of electricity generation in 2030 given the current us strategic paradigm focusing on great power competition there is concern in the trump administration and congress over russia s nuclear power exports and the implications of the long term dependency this is creating in countries like egypt turkey and now bangladesh security and safety issues for a nuclear start up program are significant even though bangladesh unlike pakistan and india has signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt and is a member of the international atomic energy agency iaea despite the iaea s technical assistance to the bangladesh nuclear regulatory commission in reviewing nuclear laws preparing for adhering to international legal instruments developing and reviewing regulations assessing sites and developing a radioactive waste management system transparency concerns exist based on experience with other rosatom projects for example the full cost of the project is not clear based on reported loan amounts it is reasonable to estimate that this cost will be at least 5 000 per installed kilowatt kw suggesting a relatively high levelized cost of electricity lcoe renewables bangladesh has begun to take a greater interest in renewable generation but it has experienced difficulties in pursuing large renewable energy projects for electricity grid connection unlike for off grid applications bangladesh s vision 2021 proposes a 10 percent renewable target in 2021 2 000 mw out of 20 000 mw forecasted and its recent renewable energy development targets call for 2 458 mw of renewable energy capacity to be installed by 2021 most of the new capacity is planned from solar 1 270 mw or 52 percent and wind 1 150 mw or 47 percent and there are also targets for biomass 30 mw biogas 2 mw and small hydro 6 mw the world bank notes that there have to date been no utility scale wind projects and the largest solar project is the 28 mw teknaf photovoltaic project in the cox s bazar region which became operational in september 2018 access to land has been a major factor holding up new projects but in march 2019 the world bank approved an 185 million loan to the government of bangladesh for the first 50 mw phase of a 310 mw solar park in feni district in the southeast in the administrative district of chittagong which will be implemented by the electricity generation company of bangladesh an enterprise of the bpdb world bank officials indicate that this project will require building of dikes and elevation of the photovoltaic modules to prevent flooding thereby increasing costs an alternative expansion scenario bangladesh can move towards a more sustainable lower carbon future by limiting coal development installing efficient natural gas expanding renewables and improving end use energy efficiency figure 5 presents an alternative energy efficiency low carbon case compared to the modified case in the master plan that projects installed capacity growing from the current 20 gw to 40 gw in 2030 and 60 gw in 2040 in the master plan fossil fuel continues to provide more than 80 percent of the fuel for power generation the author s alternative scenario projects a 20 percent lower demand case with an aggressive renewable energy growth to 22 percent in 2030 and 30 percent in 2040 with reduced coal capacity and a doubling of gas capacity by 2040 even in this case fossil fuels still account for more than 60 percent of total installed generation but carbon emissions will be considerably lower given the increase in renewables nuclear hydro imports and less carbon intensive gas generation recent assessments have raised the prospect of lower capacity additional requirements in the future given the many current plants in the pipeline a high level committee reporting to the power cell of the ministry of energy has concluded that the requirement in 2030 with planned plants and improved efficiency would be 29 619 mw a pause in new approval by the bpdb has been debated expanding electricity access to poor and rural areas strategic priority the government of bangladesh should seek to facilitate even faster private deployment of solar power systems in rural areas building on idcol s experience but working with private banks to develop project aggregation mechanisms for the financing of mini grids for communities and with reb cooperatives on system integration discussion bangladesh has followed the us electric cooperative model and with usaid nreca assistance over several decades has developed a system under the breb which has grown to eighty pbs rural cooperatives covering 460 upazillas and serving 66 087 villages with more than 30 million residents as the government has built out the breb and urban distribution grids it has also given support to off grid solar systems more than 4 million solar home systems shs have been installed in bangladesh and private companies like solaric with some commercial financing have advanced to developing small nano grids in rural villages although most of the shs have been financed under idcol s donor supported programs with private providers the breb has begun to support installation of shs solar irrigation systems rooftop solar and some mini grids and conducted training for more than 1 000 technicians idcol and the breb have developed a memorandum of understanding on selection and approval of sites for mini grids at least twenty five idcol mini grids have been approved 4 69 mw and ten are operational idcol was targeting fifty mini grids by 2018 the breb irrigation tariffs are lower than the costs from solar irrigation systems but the solar power systems can compete with diesel gensets idcol had a target of 1 550 solar irrigation pumps by 2018 despite the successes and estimated savings of more than 400 million from shs substitution for kerosene in bangladesh the rapid expansion of shs sales and providers has given rise to problems due to the growth of unregulated entrepreneurs selling cheaper but poor quality systems as well as the rapid extension of breb grid programs and the use of social safety net funds to subsidize low income consumers high priority should be placed on maintaining high standards as well as good cost recovery in order to continue the scale up of system deployment and encourage greater interest by local banks collaborating with neighbors on regional electricity and gas networks and markets strategic priority bangladesh should continue to diversify its electricity imports from india nepal and bhutan as part of an effort to promote peaceful relationships that advance economic development bangladesh should give priority to hydro based imports and avoid dependence on electricity from indian coal generation plants discussion regional energy cooperation has been difficult in south asia but bangladesh and india have been working on forging electricity links for more than six years bangladesh imported about 8 percent of its power from india in 2016 2017 over the 500 kilovolt kv high voltage direct current hvdc line which was put into service in october 2013 as the first international transmission line in south asia it was funded by the asian development bank there are plans to expand its capacity by 900 mw by 2021 the adani group has announced plans to build a 1 600 mw coal plant in india to sell power to bangladesh bangladesh is also pursuing increased imports from hydro facilities in bhutan and nepal and forecasting steadily increasing imports of 1 200 mw by 2020 2 500 mw by 2025 and 5 000 mw by 2030 an ambitious scheme proposes to build a 5 000 mw transmission grid connecting india s northeastern states to the mainland through bangladesh in return bangladesh would get 20 percent of the electricity bangladesh is investing in the 1 125 mw kuri gongri hydro plant in bhutan along with india and nepal and looking to participate in other hydro projects bangladesh is looking to import power from the upper kamali 900 mw hydro plant being built by the gmr group of india in nepal with myanmar s huge hydro resources and prospective offshore natural gas resources it may also be a potential source of electricity and or possibly gas in the coming decades in september 2018 total announced the successful appraisal of myanmar s shwe yee htun 2 offshore gas field with a preliminary reserve estimate of 2 3 trillion cubic feet attracting domestic and international investment and financing strategic priority besides the institutional and regulatory reforms discussed above bangladesh needs to focus on maximizing private investment in the sector and be especially careful as it deals with the pressures to add new generation capacity about assuming external loans from china and other state sources that put unsustainable debt pressure on its fiscal system the gas and renewable energy sub sectors should be given highest priority since they are both economically viable and can attract private equity and debt financing reducing the public debt burden with growing energy demands from rapid urbanization greater attention should be given to improving energy efficiency especially through building envelope appliance and hvac heating ventilation air conditioning system standards and incentives for building owners to invest in modern energy management systems improvement in the transparency professional capability and credibility of the national energy regulators will be increasingly important for attracting transparent and sustainable financial investments in the sector discussion despite the domestic political risks bangladesh s state minister for power energy and mineral resources nasrul hamid said on october 17 2019 that power investment in bangladesh had reached 22 billion bangladesh is looking to a wide range of investment options to meet future requirements including green bonds and capital from insurers and pension funds as well as sovereign wealth funds bangladesh s central bank has been very active in pursuing these options with the ifc adb and other international financial institutions it is even considering deploying foreign exchange reserves to support domestic bond issuances an important issue is the role of china with its large infrastructure financing under the bri of which bangladesh is a signatory while criticism of debt trap diplomacy has been especially aimed at the huge 62 billion bri program in pakistan china has also pledged 26 billion for bri infrastructure projects in bangladesh but unlike in pakistan chinese lending for energy in bangladesh appears to be a much smaller but not insignificant share of the overall package and the debt implications not as severe although bangladesh s external borrowing for domestic energy infrastructure projects is expected to increase external debt which was estimated by the imf at 35 billion at the end of fy2017 or 14 3 percent of gdp the imf debt sustainability analysis designates bangladesh as a medium performer and concludes that the risk of external debt stress is low as indicated above bangladesh has in its coal expansion strategy turned to china and also japan for financing the overseas development institute s recent report on group of twenty g20 coal subsidies estimates that china and japan accounted for 87 percent of the g20 countries 16 billion in average annual public financing for coal projects in 2016 2017 nearly half of their 14 6 billion in coal financing went to pakistan and bangladesh in these years with pakistan receiving 3 975 billion from china and bangladesh obtaining 1 650 billion from china and 1 207 billion from japan as noted above the chinese are supporting a new 2 000 mw coal plant in bangladesh that will use domestic coal with a potential expansion to 6 000 mw officials from the world bank and other financial institutions have increasingly expressed concern over the economic sustainability of these coal projects and the financial risks to the government as witnessed in bangladesh government s prior experience with the imported oil rental plants these projects are according to a senior bangladeshi official likely to have an lcoe of around 8 cents per kwh which may be higher than future gas and renewable costs there are however recent signs that chinese companies are pursuing projects in renewable energy in august 2019 reuters reported that the china national machinery import and export company cmc had entered into a joint venture with bangladesh s north west power generation company to implement 500 mw of renewable energy capacity through an estimated investment of 400 million the competition among sources will be strongly influenced by the domestic gas pricing policy as bangladesh ramps up its lng and coal imports the government in july 2019 increased domestic gas prices by a weighted average of 32 8 percent to take into account the higher lng gas prices compared with subsidized domestic prices s p global platts reports that while this action will help the financial position of petrobangla it will negatively affect textile and other key industries furthermore the government will still need to provide funding through the energy security fund and other subsidies to cover the full cost of the lng imports both the world bank and the adb now have lending policies that focus on lower carbon options recent world bank projects in bangladesh have focused on transmission improvement rural electrification and renewable energy i e the 156 million scaling up renewable energy project and the 155 million rural electrification and renewable energy development ii rered ii project the 450 million enhancement and strengthening of power transmission network in eastern region and the 59 million power system reliability and efficiency improvement project these projects help support policies to reduce losses increase electricity access and off grid solar applications and stimulate investment in grid connected renewable energy the adb has also been a major energy lender to bangladesh current adb projects in bangladesh include a 583 million debt and risk guarantee package for india s reliance power s lng terminal and a 750 mw gas combined cycle power plant south of chittagong which has an overall estimated cost of 1 billion loans totaling 616 million to enhance power transmission and distribution and 526 million in support for the third public private infrastructure development facility ppidf 3 which includes funding for renewable energy and idcol among bilateral donors usaid s energy program in bangladesh while not of the same magnitude as its past capital lending in rural electrification has focused on developing clean energy sources energy efficiency off grid solar systems and clean cooking programs usaid programs helped catalyze cooperation between bangladesh and india that led to the completion of the 500 kv transmission line mentioned above the overseas private investment corporation opic now known as the us international development finance corporation and the us trade and development agency have recently focused on working with us companies on lng and gas development lng and gas fired power generation have opened new opportunities for private sector investment general electric which has had a long presence bangladesh has developed new joint ventures with both summit power international from singapore which is the largest independent power producer in bangladesh and mitsubishi one project with summit is for the 583 mw gas combined cycle meghnaghat ii power plant near dhaka for operation by 2022 and the second project is with mitsubishi and summit for a 3 billion 2 400 mw thermal power and import terminal facility at matarbari on moheshkhali island conclusion the bangladeshi government s policies in the energy sector will be critical to the country s national security economic development and environmental sustainability energy demand in bangladesh has been booming and the country has become increasingly dependent on imported oil and recently gas and coal to sustain its economic growth although gas will remain the main source of power generation a more diversified mix is developing with coal nuclear and renewable energy foreign financing of more than 20 billion from china russia japan and india is expanding electricity capacity while the world bank and the adb have been supporting transmission and distribution projects there are clearly political economic and environmental risks in this heavy external dependence the chinese have increased their presence in bangladesh through the bri and financing for both imported and domestic coal projects russia is using military sales and nuclear and oil and gas project financing to augment its influence and create long term dependencies in contrast to this state driven financing and given a projected need for 70 billion in power investment by 2035 bangladesh should work on attracting increased private investment in the sector by improving its financial viability strengthening the regulatory framework and reforming its market structure priority should be given to gas and renewable generation and energy efficiency from an economic and environmental perspective to minimize debt and fiscal impacts and fulfill bangladesh s commitments under the paris agreement the potential for private investment in generation transmission and demand management should be fully pursued as the government proceeds with the implementation of its ambitious scheme to establish industrial and export zones the united states should increase its engagement with bangladesh under the free and open indo pacific strategy and asia edge initiative work with european countries and international financial institutions to promote clean energy options and raise concerns with china and japan over their continued financing of coal plants finally developing countries like bangladesh face enormous challenges in attaining the un sdgs approved by world leaders in late 2015 the energy sector is central to realizing these aspirations it is precisely for this reason that bangladesh and its supporters should chart a course that can lead to a more efficient clean and affordable power and energy system about the author

calendar year 2019 cy19 was a full year under pakistan tehreek e insaf pti governance cy19 has actually witnessed 2 quarters of fiscal year 2018 19 fy19 and two of fy20 while we evaluate cy19 a glimpse from cy18 under fy19 i e first two quarters of fy19 will be handful to understand the year passed 2019 and to predict economic activities coming up next in 2020 cy19 remained very tough for newly elected government pti to take unpopular decisions right after coming into power first time pti won elections on promises to provide 10 million jobs housing for lower income class bringing back looted money anti money laundering drive reducing indirect taxes promoting tourism export and to make white elephant state owned enterprises soes back on track together with privatization through wealth management theory above all it was claimed that pakistan will not go to international monetary fund imf however when mr imran khan became prime minister he inherited a pakistan facing economic emergency though gross domestic product gdp was at higher end i e 5 8 discount rate controlled at 5 75 with inflation around 4 due to artificially controlled exchange rate current account and trade account deficits resulted all times high with rising debt repayments and increasing imports as compared to declining exports resultantly foreign exchange reserves fell well below dangerous levels compelled pti to present a mini budget in 1st quarter of financial year 2019 1qfy19 and then in 3qfy19 i e 1qcy19 not only that contrary to its claim pti went into talks with imf where negotiations became a challenge not meeting timeline to get funds for scheduled payments therefore pm reshuffled the cabinet and mr asad umer stepped down from ministry of finance mof replaced by an advisor to pm for mof mr hafeez shaikh who further appointed mr reza baqir ex imf as governor state bank of pakistan sbp and mr shabbar zaidi became chairman federal board of revenue fbr in early 2019 in this scenario of economic uncertainty financial action task force fatf black listing remained hanging sword over pakistan which further intensified the grim economic situation of the country political uncertainty in pakistan was on its peak by closing of cy19 together with international situation where indian occupied kashmir iok is hostage by modi government and a trade war between china and usa continues gdp growth rate reduced from 5 8 to 2 9 as calculated by international financial institutions large scale manufacturing units lsms showed negative growth rate around 6 which effected small and medium enterprises smes related to these lsms and therefore unemployment increased in return there seems a two point agenda of present regime to deal with inherited economic emergency it tightened the monetary and fiscal policies on one end and focused on international relations to get economic support on the other starting with controlling current account and trade account deficits i e twin deficits government decided to free float the exchange rate with minimum intervention of sbp which was also a condition from imf while negotiating the 6 billion usd loan it resulted dollar skyrocketed and touched rs 164 in 4qfy19 from rs 119 in 1qfy19 which went down to rs 155 in 1qfy20 and stable trend is continued even at the closing of 2019 this massive devaluation controlled imports to a larger extent whereas exports witnessed a marginal growth as economy of pakistan had been transformed into import based consumption economy because of artificially controlled dollar by previous regimes therefore when rupee devaluated it resulted in a drastic rise of inflation which increased to double digits in 4qcy19 for controlling inflation sbp increased discount rate from 5 75 lowest in previous regime to highest at 13 25 devaluation of currency and rise in discount rate resulted increase of input cost of those industries which were depending on imported inputs and bank borrowings petroleum prices felt this heat and energy cost at manufacturing and consumer end increased accordingly owing to such situation where business activities slowed down gdp growth rate reduced from 5 8 to 2 9 as calculated by international financial institutions large scale manufacturing units lsms showed negative growth rate around 6 which effected small and medium enterprises smes related to these lsms and therefore unemployment increased in return documentation drive remained another obstacle for growth of economy which made some production units from slowing down to even shut down however documented economy is important not only for fulfilling requirement of fatf and imf but for improvement in tax revenue by increasing tax net eventually by increasing tax net more direct taxation will take place which will slowly replace indirect taxation benefiting general public who are presently imposed with the biggest indirect tax i e general sales tax furthermore documented economy will give true and fair view of financial statistics mof was busy in surgery of an economy near to collapse pm visited friendly countries to meet urgent need of foreign exchange requirement while mof was busy in surgery of an economy near to collapse pm visited friendly countries to meet urgent need of foreign exchange requirement in this regard pm went to china usa saudia uae russia malaysia and gained support in shape of deferred payment oil foreign direct investments fdis even direct deposit of dollars in current account after detail deliberations and by aligning economic system of pakistan with that of as

the targets assigned and is moving in directions the fund considers prudent in november 2019 imf released a positive preliminary report in favor of pakistan world bank also praised the macro economic developments and governmental efforts for ease of doing business in its report about ease of doing index pakistan s status improved 28 notches up and placed at 107th rank from 136th the country turned out to be the sixth global reformer and first in south asia that brought ease in doing business in the reported year mr hammadazhar presented pakistan s case at fatf in october 2019 very well that despite of indian strong lobby the country skipped the possibility of being placed in black list along with support of china and turkey it could not have been possible without strict monitoring of banking transactions by compliance units of sbp headed by mr reza baqir and documentation drive by fbr chairman mr shabbar zaidi though pakistan has marginally skipped from fatf black listing however with the continuing efforts by sbp and fbr pakistan will be able to get out of grey list as well eventually confidences of foreign and local investors improved in 2nd half of year 2019 which also reflected in pakistan stock exchange psx that rallied back strongly in a few months becoming the best performer globally since the low in august it has been the 6th best performing market since july this year and since october 1st it has posted a return of 14 1 all alone by november 2019 in december 2019 chinese investors have shown interest of investing some 2 billion in psx subject to certain

while 2019 was a turbulent year to be sure every asset class still managed to end in the green mainly thanks to central bank stimulus in the fx space the winners were the canadian dollar and british pound the us dollar was almost flat while the euro underperformed looking into 2020 many risks still hang over the euro as the eurozone is hardly growing and while many strategists are calling for the dollar s demise that seems unlikely unless the fed starts cutting again the yen may have a cold start to the year but eventually recover as brexit risks resurface and us election uncertainty sets in does king dollar still reign the world s reserve currency is set to end the year and the decade on a high note yes the dollar did surrender some ground to the british pound and canadian dollar in 2019 but it was higher against many other peers advancing by 2 6 against the euro for instance this despite a dramatic u turn by the fed which abandoned its hiking cycle and instead cut interest rates three times to cushion america from the trade war and a slowing global economy simply put the us economy was an attractive destination for capital flows even accounting for the fed cuts america still offers much higher rates than most other g10 economies a safe environment and faster economic growth now the question is whether this can continue in 2020 crucially many strategists are calling for losses on expectations that the improved mood on trade will diminish the dollar s haven appeal a pick up in global growth will make the us less attractive by comparison and uncertainty surrounding the presidential election will add a risk premium to the dollar while these are valid arguments the real question is where else can investors hide replicating the dollar s high yielding but safe haven status is a difficult task and for all its troubles the us economy is still miles ahead of europe which is barely growing and is mired in structural and institutional problems low yielding japan is equally unattractive without a risk off episode while emerging markets seem particularly risky in an unstable trade environment unless the fed starts cutting rates aggressively and erodes the dollar s rate advantage or germany announces a big fiscal spending package to boost the struggling euro area see below it s difficult to envision any real downside in the greenback neither of those seems likely over the coming months at least euro waiting in the rain for fiscal stimulus delays expected the euro area had a troublesome year with growth slowing as brexit uncertainties and trade risks brought the bloc s manufacturing sector to its knees the situation was dire enough for the european central bank ecb to relaunch its quantitative easing qe program only nine months after terminating it while growth now seems to be bottoming out it is stabilizing at a very low level so there isn t much to celebrate what s more european monetary policy is near its limits after years of heavy money printing so more ecb stimulus like bigger qe injections will probably not do much to boost the economy rather large fiscal stimulus is needed but the only country with any real fiscal room is germany and berlin has been painfully clear it has no intention of launching a major fiscal package without such a spending package growth is likely to stay anemic not to mention other risks like the white house turning its sights to trade with europe now that there s a ceasefire with china the top us trade official robert lighthizer recently said that america s large trade deficit with the eu can t continue which may be a prelude of things to come and while investors have taken a more positive stance on brexit lately helping the euro recover it may be just a matter of time until the threat of a no deal exit comes back on the table more below all told the euro will likely remain a funding currency in 2020 and persistent economic weakness could even see the ecb ramp up its qe dosage which could keep the single currency on the back foot absent a serious fiscal package no end in sight to brexit drama but boe policy could also steer pound after a tumultuous 2019 2020 could be the year brexit finally gets resolved however given that british pm boris johnson didn t waste any time after his landslide election victory in setting a tight deadline of december 2020 to negotiate a post brexit trade deal it s not looking like next year will be smooth sailing for the pound having won december s snap vote on getting brexit done johnson s inflexible deadline should not have come as too much of a surprise however having just trimmed their short positions for the pound this wasn t what traders wanted to hear and cable s post election rally quickly evaporated the most likely outcome is that the uk will leave the eu on january 1 2021 with some sort of a temporary deal or johnson will agree to a last minute extension if enough progress is made yet markets will not appreciate the uncertainty and the political posturing meaning more bumpy rides for sterling ahead but perhaps a bigger source of uncertainty will be what the bank of england will do policymakers are currently split as to whether the uk economy is slowing enough to warrant a rate cut and it could take several months before a clearer picture emerges a lot will depend on how much the end of the political deadlock boosts business spending and whether there s a revival in eurozone and global growth until investors can better gauge the uk s growth momentum and in turn the rate outlook the pound will remain hostage to brexit headlines if the data continues to deteriorate and johnson maintains a hardline approach the pound could soon be revisiting the 1 25 level yen a hostage to risk appetite in japan the safe haven yen had a volatile year going from the worst performing major currency in early 2019 to the best performer as trade tensions escalated and then back to flat against the dollar as the us and china reached a ceasefire 2020 could shape out in a similar manner the biggest risks facing global markets trade and brexit have diminished substantially recently hurting demand for the defensive currency that positive sentiment could endure in the coming weeks as the us and china sign their phase one deal and the brexit process finally enters its second stage potentially setting the yen up for some early year losses looking further out however the yen might come back even assuming the trade truce holds and that s a big assumption the risk of a no deal brexit may still come back on the table unless the eu and uk can reach a full trade deal in eleven months which is almost unfathomable given that the eu canada one took seven years to negotiate the uk will need to extend the transition period the problem is pm johnson has repeatedly vowed not to do so so he might default back to threatening a no deal exit to extract concessions as the deadline approaches meanwhile the lead up to the us presidential election could also see investors shun risky assets like stocks and turn to safe havens especially if one of the progressive candidates sanders or warren secures the democratic nomination both advocate higher business taxation to finance social programs so it s safe to say such a nomination would probably spook stocks leading to a wider risk off environment yuan with a mind on financial stability china experienced a sharp slowdown in 2019 as the trump tariffs and the associated uncertainty damaged the industrial sector and exports the slowdown would have been even worse had beijing not enacted proactive monetary and fiscal stimulus looking into 2020 the risks for both growth and the yuan still seem tilted to the downside the trade war has been put on ice but there s always a risk that it fires up again especially if the white house feels beijing isn t living up to its promises or if trump ramps up the tough on china rhetoric ahead of the election meanwhile the majority of tariffs remain in place equally important are financial stability risks china s total debt is already very high as is its banking leverage meaning the size of the banking sector relative to gdp therefore adding more stimulus to boost growth is extremely risky as it may compound vulnerabilities and amplify future shocks indeed there are already some signs of stress ranging from rural bank runs to defaults by state owned enterprises while these have been contained so far this is certainly something to keep a close eye on aussie kiwi and loonie s outlook still tied to trade war the commodity linked australian new zealand and canadian dollars had a rollercoaster 2019 as trade tensions got inflamed and defused time after time while the loonie still managed to hold onto its gains from early in the year and the aussie and the kiwi bore the brunt of trump s trade outbursts all three currencies look set to end the year on a positive note australia s new zealand s and canada s dependency on exports has exposed their economies to the trade war china is the biggest buyer of australian and new zealand exports while the us is the largest market for canadian producers hence any disruption to those markets would have knock on effects on the economies of australia new zealand and canada that s already evident in australia where annual growth has fallen to the lowest since 2009 and even the once robust labour market has started to wobble the reserve bank of australia was quick to respond and cut the cash rate three times in 2019 heading into 2020 investors think there s an 85 probability the rba will cut rates by another quarter point if the us china ceasefire is preserved those odds are likely to come down during the course of 2020 lifting the aussie however even against the backdrop of subsiding trade frictions there are still risks to the aussie s uptrend inflation remains stubbornly low and without a pickup in jobs growth which is essential for pushing up wages the rba is likely to ease policy next year limiting the local dollar s advances in contrast the new zealand dollar has more scope to extend its impressive rally from the 10 year lows brushed in october unlike the rba the reserve bank of new zealand is not seen cutting rates further in 2020 as the economy appears to be stabilizing and a recently announced fiscal package should provide an additional boost bucking the trend among g7 nations the canadian economy has proved the most resilient even though growth in the country has not been exactly spectacular either still the relative strength has kept the bank of canada boc on hold throughout the year and markets don t expect any change in interest rates during 2020 the slightly bullish outlook for oil canada s biggest export for at least the early parts of 2020 should be positive for growth and a possible rebound in the us may further bolster the canadian economy however it s not an entirely rosy picture in canada as the jobs market appears to be slowing and the boc is keeping a close watch on consumption and housing amid some warning signs if the domestic economy remains solid and growth improves globally the loonie s outlook is positive as the boc is more likely than the fed to hike rates however in the event of a flare up in trade tensions whether with china or the eu the loonie could significantly underperform its peers as the boc has more room to cut rates than its counterparts and markets currently don t expect any easing

as the 2010s draw to a close the global economy is in a very different place at the decade s end than at its beginning many of the sociopolitical events that took place around the world were reflective of the financial world analysts say the election of donald trump in 2016 was the catalyst for significant change in the u s economy and the global economy but his rise was as much an effect of broader forces at work as it was a cause of these movements and moments that reshaped the economy over the last 10 years eurozone in crisis in the wake of the recession unsustainably high deficit and debt levels in several european countries led to a crisis requiring the intervention of third party financial institutions such as a 2012 bond buying program implemented by the european central bank to tamp down interest rates on sovereign debt which were rising as investor confidence shrank the crisis was most acutely felt in greece which had its bond rating slashed slashed to junk status after it was revealed that the government had seriously misrepresented its debt burden leaders agreed to sharp austerity measures in return for bailouts from the union and the international monetary fund in the subsequent backlash and public protests against greek austerity measures there was speculation that the country might leave the eurozone entirely some say these events were a precursor to and a catalyst of britain s 2016 vote to leave the eurozone brexit is kind of the natural outcome of when greece was basically held hostage said brad mcmillan chief investment officer at commonwealth financial network they were forced into a multi year depression in order to save the euro obviously brexit opens up the possibility more concretely that european countries can leave their union and i m sure that s going to have all kinds of ramifications said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics with nationalism growing in prominence he predicted that the eurozone will face a continuation of these challenges in the coming decade nationalism hits trade the 2010s were marked more broadly by a surge of populist and nationalist sentiment both in the u s and elsewhere around the world a sentiment that is fundamentally reshaping trade between countries and changing the calculus for multinational corporations we ve seen this rise of nationalism which is a political issue reshaping financial markets tremendously said joseph heider president of cirrus wealth management for roughly half a century business and industry labored to build manufacturing and production facilities and supply chains to take advantage of the availability of raw materials cheap labor and lax environmental regulations all in a relentless drive for efficiency now that commercial infrastructure is under strain trump s decision to pull the united states out of the trans pacific partnership and start a trade war with china is the most visible and consequential manifestation of this trend with his on again off again threats to impose tariffs on europe mexico and other trading partners a close second politics is now taking primacy over economics over the past several decades we ve been building an economically optimized world right now that is no longer the case mcmillan said political economy is now being prioritized over economic efficiency and that s something we haven t seen for decades that takes us back to the 50s fed intervenes to prop up the economy in the wake of the financial crisis the federal reserve initiated monetary policy with little precedent in modern times it held interest rates at zero for an extended period of time and undertook enormous quantitative easing programs to pump liquidity into financial markets the decade was really remarkable in the sense that for the first six years of the decade we had zero percent interest rates and for the first five years we had quantitative easing said dan north chief economist at euler hermes north america characterizing the central bank s activities as a wild monetary policy experiment some market observers defend the fed s interventionist streak particularly at the start of the decade with the financial crisis still fresh in people s minds the biggest thing in the last 10 years is the continuation of quantitative easing without quantitative easing i think everything would be drastically different way worse than things are now said mitchell goldberg president of clientfirst strategy in hindsight some question whether the fed was too accommodative a stance that could have ramifications for the next recession when the fed cut interest rates to the unprecedented level of zero to 0 25 percent nobody expected it was going to last the seven years that it did mcbride said we ve had way too much easy money for way too long and at some point it s going to come back and get us north said this leaves the fed with fewer tools at hand to boost the economy he said we re leaving very little room for the next recession tax cuts lead to buybacks republicans sweep of the 2016 election facilitated the passage of a massive corporate tax cut financial experts say the passage of the tax cuts and jobs act at the end of 2017 had positive results initially but those short term gains could come at the cost of long term pain trump got elected and went on a path of reducing regulation north said i think honestly the reduction in regulation has helped the economy and i think the tax cut helped the economy as well he said but he added that since economic growth fell far short of republicans forecasts the stimulative effects of the tax cut have faded and the national debt has ballooned a risky combination it s putting america on a less stable financial future because of the structure of this unfunded non sustainable tax cut crowley said proponents of the the tax cuts predicted that companies would spend their windfalls expanding and investing in production facilities technology and human capital instead the cuts spurred a wave of corporate stock buybacks which helped propel the market to new record highs but also potentially limited the broader impact the tax cuts were intended to have it s in part a reflection of the fact that there may be in some sectors more than others limited investment or acquisition opportunities or a lack of appealing valuations on those that make a buyback a more palatable way to boost earnings per share said greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate com every dollar that s going into buybacks is a dollar that s not being used for another form of expansion he said share repurchases have also contributed to stock valuation gains but investing experts warn that this inflation can distort markets more dollars chasing fewer stocks because of all the buybacks isn t something you want long term investors to hang their hat on said john lynch chief investment strategist at lpl financial stock market highs the increase in buybacks is one factor that has contributed to the record long bull market a meteoric rise virtually no one would have predicted 10 years ago when 2010 began the stock market had already begun the long climb out of its recession era hole but the mood was still pessimistic the decade started off very ominously zandi said we began the decade not knowing that the crisis was over we d just suffered the worst economic downturn since the 1930s depression the recession was over officially by june 2009 but it wasn t quite clear that we were out of it since then of course stocks have smashed through one record high after another with valuations boosted by both monetary and fiscal policy mcbride said the fed s trio of rate cuts in 2019 reversed the correction that took place at the end of last year sustaining the bull market for a record setting 10th year that helped cushion the broader economy but it s also helped juiced the equity markets lower interest rates make other investments less appealing he said that enhances the appeal of equities relative to bonds or cash
introduction the 2019 visit of pakistan prime minister imran khan to washington and his july 22 meeting with us president donald trump focused attention at least briefly on both the prospects for peace in afghanistan and broader south asia regional security issues energy security is an important aspect of the geopolitics of the region and while it is common to focus on india as the third largest primary energy user in the world after china and the united states pakistan also is significant given its growing economy and large population of 207 million from a geopolitical standpoint though pakistan takes on more importance amid rising great power competition rivalries among china russia iran india and the united states in the region and specifically as china expands its presence through its belt and road initiative bri and the china pakistan economic corridor cpec pakistan s politics has been tumultuous with rival parties struggling for power khan s august 2018 election as prime minister has ushered in a new political era in pakistan his pakistan tehreek e insaf pti party which defeated the outgoing pakistan muslim league nawaz and pakistan people s party for seats in the legislature has already faced many challenges including a slowing economy and continuing energy crisis pakistan is a poor country with a per capita gross domestic product gdp of us 1 909 in early 2019 and 58 million people lack access to electricity with growing incomes population and urbanization energy demand is increasing placing pressure on domestic resources despite the existence of indigenous natural gas renewable and coal resources pakistan has become more dependent on imported oil gas and recently coal resources although it is a small emitter of carbon dioxide co2 unlike india or china pakistan is likely to increase its greenhouse gas emissions depending on the fuel choices and investments it makes the turn to embrace coal is an emerging concern in the broader asian context and in the wake of the paris agreement on climate change which pakistan ratified its nationally determined contribution ndc affirmed its desire to join the global effort to mitigate and adapt to rising emissions including from the power sector that is the leading source of pakistan s emissions poor countries often suffer the most from climate change and pakistan has long been experiencing the direct effects of severe climate events like floods and heat waves in 2018 pakistan was hit with heavy monsoon rains reported to have been the heaviest in thirty eight years in 2019 the nation experienced a record heat wave as the monsoon rains were delayed with an all time high temperature of 120 degrees fahrenheit recorded june 2 3 in jacobabad in sindh province although the international donor and private investment community has had a substantial engagement with pakistan s energy sector for many years considerable obstacles remain in reforming the energy sector and mobilizing critical energy investments the security environment especially outside the punjab and sindh provinces is problematic and the large and pervasive circular debt problem described later has deterred investors us pakistan relations have been strained over pakistan s harboring of the haqqani network a sunni islamist insurgent group involved in the afghan war trump s suspension of military and security assistance and the enhanced us defense partnership with india khan s visit however seems to have improved relations between the nations with the development of a common understanding of the need for a negotiated peace in afghanistan as well as enhanced energy cooperation this report is the third country analysis in the atlantic council s transforming the power sector in developing countries series this series initiated following the historic paris accord of 2015 considers the political economy of implementing the paris targets and commitments focusing on the obstacles and strategies for decarbonization of the important power sector the initial report presented a generic framework and strategic action plan for power sector transformation and subsequent reports have applied this approach to both specific countries such as china and indonesia and issues this analysis turns to south asia and attempts to tie together the geopolitical dimensions of the energy transformation process with the severe poverty and climate change challenges faced by pakistan a separate companion issue brief examines nearby bangladesh critical challenges as a large developing country pakistan faces a wide range of problems especially related to overcoming poverty and improving the health education and employment opportunities for low income groups the energy sector is critical to progress in addressing these problems but inadequate investment unreliable energy supplies weak governance and poor fiscal management of the sector have been major constraints the problem of creating a viable energy sector that can mobilize the needed investments and support sustainable economic growth is a fundamental challenge this section examines the position of pakistan with respect to five common challenges affecting power sector transformation as identified in the initial strategy report namely 1 meeting growing energy demands and moving to a cleaner energy mix 2 improving governance and transparency 3 increasing affordability and access 4 addressing environmental degradation and climate change and 5 achieving power sector financial viability meeting growing energy demand and moving to a cleaner energy mix pakistan s economy over the past five years has been growing at more than 4 percent and reached 5 2 percent in 2018 although primary energy consumption in 2018 grew by 5 percent primary energy growth has historically lagged behind economic growth between 2007 and 2017 the average rate of primary energy growth was 2 7 percent compared with a 3 8 percent average annual increase in gdp pakistan depends principally on oil and gas for over 70 percent of its primary energy and has become increasingly dependent on oil and gas imports although pakistan has some domestic crude oil production about 90 thousand barrels per day in 2018 this only accounts for 18 percent of total oil consumption the growing oil import bill puts great pressure on budgets and reserves the international monetary fund imf estimates pakistan s 2017 18 oil imports at us 14 6 billion or about a quarter of total estimated current account imports and 2019 20 imports are expected to be at least us 17 billion the depreciation of the pakistan rupee in 2018 added an additional burden to the import bill pakistan has had to turn to gas imports as domestic gas consumption has grown by 7 percent in 2018 and outpaced domestic production pakistan s indigenous gas production has stagnated at about 34 billion cubic meters bcm in 2018 accounting for 80 percent of domestic consumption expansion of electricity generation to meet rising demand and reduce the endemic power blackouts and outages has been a high priority of the pakistan government installed generation capacity has greatly expanded from 23 337 megawatts mw in 2014 to 33 836 mw in february 2019 and electricity generation increased by 11 percent from 2017 to 2018 pakistan continues to have a gap however of several thousand megawatts in the non summer months when hydropower output is lower and electricity demand is high although natural gas fired generation provides the largest share of electricity output pakistan has significant hydropower production some nuclear power and increasing renewable energy generation see figure 2 we examine more closely the transformation and diversification challenge in the strategic priorities section improving governance and transparency although pakistan has made progress in developing its institutions in the energy and power sectors much remains to be done to improve their governance and transparency a separate professional energy regulatory body the pakistan national electric power regulatory authority nepra has been in place since 1997 however it still needs to improve its autonomy authority and accountability becoming less dependent on the ministry of energy the evolution of energy institutions in pakistan has been shaped by the relationship between electricity and water the priority of water management in pakistan and the construction of tarbela and other major dams and hydropower plants led to the development of a combined ministry of water and power while the development of the large sui and other gas fields was overseen by a separate ministry of petroleum and minerals as thermal power generation expanded in the 1980s and 1990s state utility company water and power development authority wapda was unbundled with wapda retaining hydropower at the same time four separate state thermal companies were established in 1998 along with a separate authority for electricity transmission the national transmission and dispatch company ntdc a central power purchasing agency cppa responsible for billing and financial settlements was separated from ntdc in 2015 heightening transparency in power transactions and financial relations in the major karachi electricity market the main supplier is k electric formerly the karachi electric power corporation for several years k electric had been a target of acquisition by china s shanghai electric company but the majority shareholder the dubai based abraaj group collapsed in 2019 separately many privately owned electricity generating companies ipps are involved in the thermal hydro and renewable subsectors and have established a pakistan independent power producers association it was then prime minister shahid abbasi a former minister of petroleum from the pakistan muslim league who in his brief tenure succeeded in establishing the ministry of energy which combined the ministry of petroleum and natural resources and the power division of the ministry of water and power in august 2017 it remains to be seen whether this institutional restructuring will improve governance and transparency given the close relationship between electricity and gas both indigenous and imported the creation of a single ministry may help achieve better planning and coordination between the oil and gas and power sectors in general energy policy and governance has been quite fragmented in pakistan involving the pakistan ministry of finance the planning commission the provincial governments as well as the state energy organizations major decisions on energy policy and investment are usually reviewed and approved by the economic coordination committee chaired by the prime minister former prime minister nawaz sharif tried to improve coordination in the sector through an interagency energy group and brought in from abroad a pakistani with experience working in western companies as his energy adviser upon his election as prime minister khan assumed the position of minister of energy as well as minister of the interior but in september 2018 he appointed omar ayab khan also from the pti party as minister of energy the prime minister also created the task force on energy reform which is headed by his energy adviser naseem babar increasing affordability and access as a largely rural country pakistan faces major challenges in providing affordable and reliable electricity to its population as mentioned above 58 million people lack access to electricity and the challenge is particularly acute in rural areas where only 54 percent have access pakistan s progress in expanding access has been slower compared to some other countries for example nearby bangladesh boosted its access level to 88 percent in 2017 from 55 percent in 2010 and more recent estimates are as high as 95 percent pakistan aspires to achieve universal electricity access by 2030 and priority towns in each province have been identified pakistan s rural electrification programs are heavily focused on grid expansion by the various regional distribution companies many of which are constrained in their ability to finance grid expansion especially in the remote and sparsely populated areas of baluchistan and tribal areas decentralized renewable systems are beginning to be introduced but not at the same scale as in bangladesh where several dozen nongovernmental organizations ngos and private companies are marketing these systems for household and village applications tackling environmental degradation and climate change pakistan and the south asia region as a whole face enormous environmental challenges due to the geographical and ecological situation population growth and urban pressures pakistan s population is expected to grow to 309 million by 2050 as a result water and energy will become critical to its survival key to pakistan s future is the indus river basin and system both for irrigation and as a water supply for major urban centers in the east and south the basin is subject to regular flooding and cyclones in 2010 pakistan suffered especially severe flooding that seriously damaged the electricity system and caused an estimated us 25 3 billion in costs or 5 4 percent of gdp the global climate risk index ranks pakistan as the seventh most affected country during the period 1997 2016 with 141 severe climate events incurring estimated losses of us 3 8 billion in pakistan these events have included droughts and heat waves e g 1998 02 and 2014 17 and glacial lake outburst floods in the northern mountains pakistan s initial submission in the run up to the paris climate summit the intended nationally determined contribution indc presents a useful summary of the threats that pakistan is facing from climate change many sectors activities and target groups are vulnerable to the threats of climate change in pakistan these among others include increased variability of monsoon rapid recessions of glaciers of hindu kush karakoram in the himalayas threatening water flows in the indus river system increased siltation of downstream water reservoirs increased risk of floods and droughts heat stressed conditions in arid and semi arid regions leading to reduced agriculture productivity intrusion of saline water in the indus delta affecting coastal ecology and fishery production and increased cyclonic activity in the coastal belt due to high sea surface temperatures while these climate impacts have taken their toll pakistan emits quite small amounts of co2 i e only about 0 6 percent of global energy co2 emissions pakistan s indc reports energy emissions in 2015 of 185 97 metric tons mt out of total emissions of 405 mt bp estimates that pakistan s energy co2 emissions rose in 2018 to 195 7 mt a 3 8 percent increase over 2017 overall energy related co2 emissions are projected to increase to 898 mt in 2030 pakistan s conditional commitment at paris was however to reduce overall emissions by 20 percent from the projected 2030 levels if an estimated investment of 40 billion were forthcoming for abatement actions in energy industry and agriculture meeting this reduction target will require major changes in strategy and financing which will be discussed later in this document achieving power sector financial viability the establishment of a financially sound power sector in low income developing countries is a common problem and pakistan is continuing to struggle to reduce losses improve collections and rationalize tariffs the power crisis in pakistan has received much attention including front page stories in major western papers the shortage of power supplies coupled with a large deficit in collections and pervasive circular debt has represented a persistent political problem stemming back to well before the sharif and khan governments at the root of the problem is both high technical and commercial losses and especially nonpayment by the government and its state companies the issue of losses and inadequate collections is problematic in most of pakistan s ten electricity distribution companies which had average losses of 17 95 percent in 2016 17 with three reporting losses of over 30 percent see figure 3 although estimates vary the cumulative debts of the power system including the shifting circular debt among state gas companies power distribution companies independent power producers consumers and the government s central purchasing agency have continued to build up over the years and were estimated to have reached a cumulative level of 1 55 trillion pakistan rupees abbreviated as rs and the amount equivalent to us 11 7 billion as of june 2018 with the average tariff of rs11 70 kilowatt hour kwh well below the determined power supply cost for 2018 19 of rs15 53 kwh although the early 2019 level was widely reported at rs1 4 trillion one independent analysis places the official designed circular debt at rs829 billion as of july 2019 not including loans of the syndicated term finance facility which if added would total about rs1 8 trillion the government with donor support has sought to reduce payment arears and has tried to cap the overall level of circular debt as much as rs600 billion of this debt has been parked in a state holding company the power holding private ltd phpl private power producers through the independent power producers advisory council ippac have disputed the effectiveness of government efforts highlighting a rising circular debt claiming that their share was rs254 billion in 2017 these independent power producers have long term power purchase agreements with government entities that have been criticized as too costly with their take or pay arrangements and for renewables high feed in tariffs which are designed to promote installation of renewable electricity technologies in 2017 the government decided to move generally to shorter term competitively bid tenders i e terms of fifteen years instead of twenty five to thirty years and take and pay formulas the world bank and the imf have reported lower estimated levels of circular debt the world bank estimated rs420 billion or us 4 billion by the end of fiscal year fy 16 or 1 percent of gdp and the imf rs514 billion at the end of 2017 what seems to have occurred is that the government reduced the budgeted power subsidy from rs349 billion in 2012 13 to rs118 in 2016 17 and this contributed to a buildup of circular debt besides low tariffs a major contributing factor to circular debt is the large transmission and distribution t d losses the target for t d losses for fy2016 17 was 15 3 percent while the reported losses in distribution alone were almost 18 percent as indicated above if transmission losses are included the total difference between electricity generated by the producers and electricity sold by the regional distribution companies discos amounted to 21 6 percent of generation in fy2016 17 arrears in the gas sector also have been rising to a reported us 1 billion for sui northern and sui southern gas companies and the government increased gas prices by 200 percent on july 1 2019 in summary the overall cost to pakistan of the power sector s poor economic and financial performance is large a world bank report estimates that the total economic cost of power sector distortions in pakistan was us 17 7 billion in fy15 or about 6 5 percent of gdp stemming from the negative impacts us 12 9 billion a year of unreliable electricity to firms and households strategic priorities this section presents policy directions that pakistan should consider taking to address the above critical challenges it takes the general prescriptive approach from the first report in the series and offers suggestions on specific strategic priorities for pakistan these priorities address the following 1 creating a sound policy legal and regulatory environment 2 developing efficient institutional and market structures 3 achieving a cleaner and more resilient generation mix 4 expanding electricity access to the poor and rural areas 5 collaborating with neighbors on regional electricity and gas networks and markets and 6 attracting international investment and financing creating a sound policy legal and regulatory environment strategic priority the pakistan government urgently needs to develop a comprehensive energy plan and formulate legal and regulatory measures that tackle critical reforms in the parastatal energy companies and power market enhance revenue collection create a more favorable environment for investment and accelerate efforts to develop its indigenous renewable energy and gas resource development for its energy security economic growth and environmental sustainability discussion the creation of a sound longer term energy policy has been difficult as domestic and external political and economic pressures buffet the government the imperative of addressing short term energy shortages the severe budget and financial constraints and the dramatic swings in international energy prices has made it hard to develop an optimal strategy that balances energy security economic growth and environmental sustainability pakistan has pursued high cost short term fixes while at the same time accepting billions in large infrastructure loans notably from china for coal and nuclear plants that are problematic given the financial difficulties faced by the government and the power sector policies to promote domestic renewables and gas development have not received sufficient priority vis à vis projects to develop imported coal and liquefied natural gas lng increasing power sector revenues is of critical importance especially through tariff rationalization and the reduction of both technical and nontechnical losses in the system pakistan committed to raise tariffs and reduce circular debt in its july 2019 extended fund facility eff agreement with the imf and the imf released the first us 1 billion tranche of the us 6 billion package after pakistan adjusted tariffs by over 10 percent with further increases planned developing efficient institutional and market structures strategic priority the pakistan government should restructure the single buyer system and fully unbundle the power sector while maintaining a priority focus on improving the revenue and financial position of the sector the privatization of better performing distribution companies in major cities like lahore islamabad and faisalabad should be pursued to improve commercial operations and provide resources for the government discussion pakistan has the potential to develop a more competitive power market but the highly politicized single buyer system i e one in which transmission is controlled by the government is holding back progress although private generation has overtaken public sector generation distribution losses are still too high and major investments in transmission and distribution are needed to keep up with surging power demands the economic competitiveness of renewables and the potential for distributed gas systems open up new possibilities for a less centralized and more transparent commercial operation of the system policy makers should now begin to unbundle the system fully and move to a bilateral contracts approach and the introduction of third party access in pakistan the world bank s appraisal report concludes that that the discos and ntdc are not at arm s length from the power division of the ministry of energy and remain in an entrenched bureaucratic culture the cppa proposal to become a market operator which has been under review by the national energy regulatory commission is a positive sign but further restructuring is needed in its early days the sharif government announced plans to privatize distribution in the major cities of faisalabad lahore and islamabad where incomes and affordability are higher and initial disco privatization was a condition of the previous imf us 6 6 extended fund facility political opposition however kept the sharif government from pursuing this objective and it was abandoned in 2016 khan has an opportunity to revive this process and in march 2019 the minister of privatization indicated that nine distribution companies would be included in the list of state owned enterprises for privatization along with several generation companies although experience in other countries shows that losses can be reduced with proper metering billing and collections systems and investments it is clear that the circular debt overhang and government nonpayment obstacles need to be overcome and political support for strong legal enforcement of collections including by government entities and rationalization of tariffs will be essential achieving a cleaner and resilient generation mix strategic priority pakistan should continue to diversify its electricity mix but reorient efforts to accelerate the move to lower carbon sources and away from oil and coal by focusing on gas renewables and increased energy efficiency it should seek to facilitate the private investments needed to meet its 30 percent renewables target by 2030 and ensure that the transmission investments required to integrate these sources into the grid are realized and carefully coordinated with generation expansion plans given the declining costs of renewables its favorable solar resources and high electricity access requirements pakistan should give greater priority to minigrids and distributed solar power systems for towns and villages discussion pakistan has ambitious plans to expand electricity generation capacities currently pakistan s installed capacity stands at about 34 282 mw and pakistan s target is to increase generation capacity to about 50 000 mw by 2022 and 62 186 mw by 2025 meeting peak load estimated at over 25 000 mw in 2019 is a problem exacerbated by transmission and distribution limitations to address the frequent outages and rising electricity demands pakistan has turned heavily to imported natural gas and coal natural gas pakistan has already achieved significant reductions in oil generation especially through substitution of natural gas with both the level and share of oil declining from 30 22 terawatt hours twh 26 49 percent in 2017 to 14 32 twh 11 54 percent in 2018 the substitution of gas for oil has substantially reduced pakistan s fuel import bill by more than us 2 billion pakistan has rapidly increased the use of gas in its power generation since the initiation of lng imports in march 2015 in march 2018 gas power generation accounted for 43 percent of total power generation 3 013 gigawatt hours with lng providing 19 percent and domestic gas 24 percent three major new gas power plants in punjab province totaling 3 6 gigawatts gw accounted for the significant increase pakistan has two floating storage regasification unit fsru lng facilities at port qasim the excelerate nakilat 3 8 million metric tons per annum mmtpa fsru at the engro elengy group terminal and a 5 7 mmtpa unit owned by pakistan lng terminals ltd the main lng import contracts are for supplies from qatar the cabinet economic coordination committee in july 2019 endorsed planning for a third terminal and other projects by major oil companies including shell exxon and total have been proposed lng imports are expected to grow with estimated levels of 14 million metric tons mmt by 2022 and 21 mmt by 2025 up from just 6 7 mmt last year pakistan s focus on lng and gas fired power generation has opened new opportunities for us lng exports and investment by the private sector general electric has a long standing presence in pakistan and plays a major role in pakistan s power system with its technologies providing as much as 25 percent of pakistan s total generation this work includes new gas units both large and small gas field units steam systems and wind turbines coal despite environmental concerns and its paris ndc commitment to reduce projected co2 emissions pakistan is counting on coal to play a significant role in the nation s future power mix with a combination of both coal imports as well as domestic resource development pakistan has 6 6 gw of coal plants under construction with coal capacity additions totaling 11 353 mw projected for 2025 the pakistan vision 2030 targets installed coal capacity of 19 910 mw by 2030 representing 19 percent of the projected installed generation mix estimates foresee pakistan s imports of coal rising from about 12 million metric tons mmt in 2018 to 30 mmt in 2020 and 40 mmt in 2025 imports will increase to meet the needs of two new large coal plants at sahiwal and port qasim pakistan is therefore moving rapidly to implement its policy decision to develop almost from scratch a coal power industry with all the attendant infrastructure requirements for import and transport although this follows the trend in some other south and southeast asia nations there are serious questions about the viability of this strategy from both economic and environmental standpoints even though both the sahiwal and port qasim coal plants are efficient and use super critical coal combustion technology in pakistan one recent study using data from the energy regulator shows see figure 5 that both renewables and gas are less costly than coal with wind at 4 3 cents per kwh solar at 5 3 cents gas at around 6 cents and hydro averaging a little over 8 cents compared with 8 4 cents for super critical coal plants such as the china huanang coal plant at sahiwal have been given a power purchase agreement price of 8 36 cents per kwh these investments create long term obligations and the coal plants may become stranded assets potentially obsolete and weighing on balance sheets as renewable energy costs decrease and the costs of climate change increase nuclear important developments are evident in global nuclear markets as russia and china seek to expand their political and economic influence in developing regions through the export and state financing of nuclear power plants china and russia are building over 60 percent of the nuclear reactors currently under construction in the world today pakistan is thus far the only foreign country operating chinese commercial nuclear reactors chinese nuclear engagement with pakistan dates to 1993 when the china national nuclear corporation cnnc began construction of the first of four small chinese cnp300 nuclear reactors at its chashma complex in central pakistan with commercial operation in 2000 2011 2016 and 2017 as it pursued export opportunities china in 2015 began to construct near karachi two of its larger indigenous designed hualong one plants 1 000 mw each the first and only chinese generation iii plants thus far to be built outside china they are expected to be completed by 2021 and 2022 and will be an important showcase together with the four hualong one plants under construction and ten planned plants in china cnnc is building these units with reported financing from a us 6 5 billion loan in 2014 from the chinese export import bank a third hualong one unit for the chashma complex is at the tender stage but it is unclear whether the financing has been finalized pakistan envisions 8 800 mw of nuclear capacity by 2030 providing 20 percent of its electric power although nuclear energy is a small part of pakistan s power mix these huge projects create a long term financial technological and energy dependency on china and its authoritarian system and state companies they reduce transparency in the sector and raise concerns about safety and security pakistan like india has not signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty but the nation is a member of the international atomic energy agency iaea in 2018 pakistan established a four year joint program with the iaea to work on ensuring the safety and security of the new plants the economics of the new plants are still unclear but given the reported size of the loans it is reasonable to estimate that the plants in pakistan will cost about us 4 000 per installed kw assuming they are completed on schedule even with high capacity factors they will likely be among the highest cost power generation units renewables interest and investment in renewable energy have picked up over the past four or five years however excluding large hydropower capacity renewables only accounted for 4 percent of pakistan s generation in 2018 as pointed out in the renewable readiness assessment by the international renewable energy agency irena pakistan has substantial wind energy potential i e 6 9 to 8 6 meters per second in the sinh corridor and solar resource potential and international companies from many countries are establishing facilities particularly in the sindh and punjab provinces chinese companies have been major investors in wind projects accounting for 397 5 mw or 36 8 percent of the new wind power capacity developed in pakistan between 2014 and 2018 in total 1 500 mw of wind solar and bagasse a biowaste had been installed as of 2017 and nepra projected in 2017 that more than 3 500 mw of these sources will be added by 2024 25 a july 2019 report of the us commercial service indicates that a 400 mw installation at the quaid e azam solar park is operating with expansion planned and an additional twenty four solar projects of different scale are producing 550 mw of power at least six bagasse plants of 201 1 mw are in operation besides its large hydropower potential pakistan has many favorable sites for small hydro projects 877 projects are underway and will add to the current generation of 128 mw the khan government has recently announced ambitious plans to increase the share of renewable energy in total power generation to 30 percent by 2030 including wind solar small hydro and biomass the new plans are expected to expand renewable capacity by as much as 7 000 mw by 2025 to around 20 percent of generation in addition there is a target to raise the share of large scale hydro more than 50 mw currently around one fourth of the country s electricity supply to 30 percent by 2030 reaching 60 percent renewable and hydro generation by 2030 would be a tremendous achievement and counter the growing trend of fossil fuel imports pakistan has been moving to further its investments in hydropower which has long been a pillar of the electricity system accounting for between 25 percent and 30 percent of nationwide generation depending on water availability pakistan s installed hydro capacity reached 9 389 mw in 2018 with the commissioning of the 108 mw golen gol 2 the 1 410 mw tarbela fourth extension and the 969 mw neelum jhelum projects work is beginning on the large world bank funded 4 320 mw dasu project which has experienced major delays due to land issues and the government has announced an 800 mw mohmand dam project on the swat river in the khyber pakhtunkhwa province pakistan is experiencing historically low water flows and the potential for further climate impacts may affect this important subsector despite the value of the projects in terms of increasing water storage and management capacity expanding electricity access to poor and rural areas strategic priority pakistan should develop a high priority program to support private entrepreneurial and ngo efforts to commercialize solar power systems in rural areas and ensure high standards for reliability and service they should encourage banks to lend for these projects as well as facilitate cooperation between solar system providers and the regional distribution companies especially on technology interface issues for minigrids and microgrids pakistan should consider the adaptation of the bangladesh infrastructure development company limited idcol public private partnership model which has been so successful in mobilizing over 500 million in donor funding for wide spread installation by private organizations of off grid solar photovoltaic systems discussion pakistan is taking steps to introduce solar power to rural villages the world bank has approved a new project the sindh solar energy project that will finance 200 000 solar home systems and larger grid connected units pakistan needs to tap private entrepreneurial talent in developing these programs and ensure that sound technical standards are adopted it can learn from other experiences in south asia and east africa where substantial commercialization of both solar home systems and minigrids is occurring collaborating with neighbors on regional electricity and gas networks and markets strategic priority pakistan should continue to pursue diversification of its electricity and gas imports from central asia promoting peaceful relationships and advancing economic development while resisting iranian pressure to expand electricity and gas import from iran discussion attempts at energy cooperation in south asia have been a challenge given the conflicts and historical legacies a few signs of progress are emerging however as pakistan pursues overland imports of electricity and gas in addition to its major focus on maritime imports of lng and coal for power pakistan has long been eyeing the potential for electricity and gas imports from central asia for more than a decade the turkmenistan afghanistan pakistan india tapi gas pipeline and the casa 1000 electric transmission line projects have been pursued to bring gas from turkmenistan and hydro generated power from tajikistan and central asia turkmengas leads the tapi consortium which includes the afghan gas corp pakistan s interstate gas system ltd and india s state owned gail construction started on the 1 840 km 10 billion project in turkmenistan in december 2015 and in afghanistan in february 2018 it will supply 33 bcm of gas from the large galkynysh gas field in turkmenistan to the border with india with pakistan and india taking up to 14 bcm each and afghanistan 5 bcm commercial contracts are under negotiation among the four companies with possible financial closure by the end of 2020 the asian development bank adb has been a major supporter of the project but chinese and south korean banks are financing the development of the galkynysh field and the processing plants the united states has consistently taken the position that the project s commercial viability depends on the openness and willingness of international petroleum companies to be involved in the upstream development turkmenistan has however moved ahead to develop the field itself and expand production to 40 bcm by 2025 with the continuing conflict in afghanistan there are clearly risks to the project the taliban have stated assurances of protecting the pipeline despite the history of fighting to control farah a western province and city adjacent to herat near the iranian border where the pipeline will traverse the pipeline will also pass through quetta in pakistan s baluchistan province where militant and terrorist groups operate thereby adding to pipeline security risks the outcome of ongoing negotiations among the taliban and the afghan government with us chinese and russian involvement will likely be critical to the project s fate and the attitude of india toward continued participation another long pursued project is the casa 1000 high voltage direct current hvdc electricity transmission line that will bring seasonably available hydropower from tajikistan and the kyrgyz republic through afghanistan to pakistan the world bank is the major financier but additional funders include the islamic development bank the european bank for reconstruction and development the united kingdom and the united states although construction began in may 2016 progress has been slow especially in tajikistan contracts the main components of the project include 500 kilovolt kv alternating current ac line from datka in the kyrgyz republic to substation sugd 477 kilometers or 296 miles away in tajikistan 1 300 mw ac dc converter station at sangtuda tajikistan 750 km hvdc line from sangtuda to nowshera pakistan and 1 300 megawatt dc ac converter station at nowshera power purchase agreements have been completed between the participating national transmission companies and commercial operations are expected to begin in 2022 the adb did not support casa 1000 instead pursuing the turkmenistan afghanistan pakistan tap project a 500 kilovolt kv electricity transmission project that would use the same route as the tapi pipeline and potentially would allow larger power flows than casa 1000 the tap framework agreement was signed in may 2018 and has two main phases the first phase to be completed by 2021 will use the existing infrastructure under the adb financed turkmenistan uzbekistan tajikistan afghanistan pakistan tutap power interconnection project which aims to export power from turkmenistan to afghanistan and pakistan the second phase to be completed by 2022 will transfer power from turkmenistan through the border of serhetabad in turkmenistan and torghundy into herat kandahar and spin boldak in afghanistan and export to chaman and quetta in pakistan another factor in the regional equation is of course iran that nation has proclaimed its desire to be a regional electricity hub with exports to the caucasus through armenia and azerbaijan and to central asia through turkmenistan and directly to turkey afghanistan and pakistan iran s power exports generated us 3 37 billion in revenue between september 2013 and may 2017 according to a pakistan press report citing iran s energy ministry with iraq ranking as the largest market 1 400 mw per year although iran s electricity exports to afghanistan and pakistan are presently only about 130 mw iran has indicated its readiness to provide as much as 3 000 mw to pakistan the current confrontation with the united states and us sanctions on iran pose a problem for pakistan s pursuit of this option as well as pakistan s long delayed import of natural gas from iran the latter project which dates over a decade envisioned the completion of an 8 bcm pipeline although iran has finished its segment pakistan has not proceeded with its leg due to us pressure and sanctions and iran has threatened to take the issue to the international court of justice in the hague attracting domestic and international investment and financing strategic priority pakistan needs to step up its efforts to improve the financial position of its power sector reduce quasi fiscal deficits and increase the efficiency of the state energy companies if it is to attract the capital and financing needed to meet the growing electricity demands the emphasis should be on attracting private capital and the government should be more careful in assuming external state loans from china and other sources that exacerbate the public debt position and increase co2 emissions the gas and renewable energy subsectors should be given highest priority since they are both economically viable and can attract private equity and debt financing with growing energy demands from rapid urbanization greater attention should be given to improving energy efficiency especially through building envelope appliance and hvac system standards and incentives for building owners to invest in modern energy management systems improvement in the transparency professional capability and credibility of nepra will be increasingly important to assuring sound and sustainable financial investments in the sector discussion although the recent slowdown in pakistan s economy has raised concerns the energy sector continues to attract considerable interest from private and state investors donors and international financial institutions ifis prime attention has focused on the expansion of chinese financing for infrastructure including energy under the bri substantial international criticism including disparaging comments on china s debt trap diplomacy lack of transparency and state dominated nonmarket approach from senior us administration and congressional leaders has been aimed at china s us 62 billion cpec program to construct roads mines power plants ports and other infrastructure the official cpec website as of july 2019 contained fifteen priority energy projects involving over 11 000 mw of new capacity us 16 billion in estimated investment several coal mines and two major high voltage transmission lines these projects do not include the more than us 6 billion of financing for the nuclear plants that china is building near karachi and planned for chasma or the ongoing us 10 billion port development at gwadar in baluchistan which china has leased for forty three years and which may become important for future oil and coal imports there has also been speculation that china intends to use gwadar port for its naval expansion especially in light of china s agreement to sell pakistan eight submarines china is sending thousands of workers to pakistan for these projects posing a challenge for pakistan security officials the sahiwal coal fired power plant was commissioned in may 2017 after being constructed in twenty two months the pakistan government allocated us 1 71 billion in the 2017 18 budget for cpec projects significant vehicles for chinese government energy finance include the two so called policy banks the china development bank and the chinese export import bank a boston university dashboard that tracks energy financing from these institutions reports us 19 098 billion in chinese energy loans from these banks to pakistan during 2014 18 mainly for nuclear coal and hydro projects this major borrowing comes at a time when pakistan is already facing an elevated current account deficit and a ballooning external public debt estimated by the imf at us 105 8 billion in march 2019 public and public guaranteed debt is projected by the imf to increase to us 234 billion in 2019 20 in part driven by the cpec related outflows loan repayments and profit repatriation pakistan s current chinese debt is estimated to be us 15 billion in public loans and us 6 7 billion in commercial finance obligations this weakening external financial position will be a major challenge and require significant external resource mobilization to meet the debt service obligations as the imf pointed out in approving the us 6 billion eff pakistan officials have argued that official debt to china is limited since many of the projects involve commercial loans and foreign direct investment by chinese companies and official debt is only a small portion of the overall national debt of us 100 billion and the annual investment program of the government international criticism of chinese actions goes beyond the long term financial dependency aspects and political ramifications of these projects to include the environmental and climate change impacts of its lending for coal projects and the weak environmental standards in the hydro and other projects pakistan has been a major focus of chinese international coal financing the overseas development institute s june 2019 report estimated that group of twenty g20 countries provided coal financing and subsidies of us 16 billion during 2016 17 with china and japan accounting for 87 percent of this amount pakistan received us 3 975 billion from china during this period boston university s china s global energy finance tracker indicates that coal was a major part of the us 3 3 billion in chinese funding from the chinese development bank and chinese export import bank during 2017 the contradiction of china seeking to reduce coal s role domestically through the substitution of gas renewables and nuclear and its aggressive support for overseas coal plants is quite stark and reflects the political influence of the large chinese state industrial companies this trend in encouraging coal use is alarming in terms of both global efforts to combat climate change and reduce co2 emissions and in terms of pakistan s future policy direction chinese officials indicate that they are just responding to the desires of the country officials that view coal as the least cost option the evidence increasingly see figure 5 shows however that renewables and gas are competitive and certainly less expensive if environmental health water and other factors are considered chinese support for overseas coal projects contrasts with the position of the ifis which are supporting hydro gas and other renewable energy projects for example the world bank is a major donor in pakistan and is supporting a us 425 million national transmission modernization project a tarbela fourth extension hydro project of us 390 million which provides additional funding to the original us 840 million tarbela extension loan a us 588 4 million dasu hydro stage 1 project and a us 100 million sindh solar energy project although the asian development bank did finance the us 900 million jamshoro coal plant in pakistan over the objections of the obama administration and other countries it has since focused on noncoal projects in transmission distribution renewable energy and energy efficiency over the period 2005 17 adb provided us 6 2 billion for energy in pakistan accounting for 28 percent of its operations in the country of the bilateral donors active in the sector the us government through the us agency for international development usaid overseas private investment corporation opic and the us department of energy has provided energy assistance and financial support to the power sector and us investors over many decades this assistance has helped finance both human and physical infrastructure from hydro facilities to thermal power plants electricity distribution improvement rural electrification and more recently wind projects and transmission investments in pakistan s sindh province since 2011 alone usaid financed projects have added over 3 500 mw of electricity to pakistan s national grid this includes 1 049 mw of generation capacity from new and rehabilitated hydro and thermal power plants and 2 505 mw of transmission and distribution capacity improving the performance of the distribution companies also has been a central focus of usaid programs helping to realize through loss reduction efforts 212 mw in distribution capacity and the recovery of over us 429 million in revenue although pakistan with its favorable renewable resource potential and feed in tariff policies has been relatively successful in attracting project financing from both private and public sources it will need to further improve the investment climate if it is to realize the new ambitious targets of the khan government an important aspect will be the implementation of a major renewable energy auction system that has become the global norm as they move away from rigid feed in tariffs these efforts should be coordinated with broader power sector restructuring and plans are developing to allow direct sales of power from renewable generators to industrial consumers investment in transmission capacity will be critical and the world bank and others are working with the government to consider options for both siting and financing opening up some transmission projects to private investors is certainly an option that should be evaluated conclusion south asia with its rapidly growing energy sector is poised to play an expanding role in global energy markets and geopolitics this issue brief has focused on pakistan which faces challenges in meeting rising energy demands and addressing security poverty and climate change issues the intensifying great power competition among the united states china and russia is playing out in this region and the energy sector is one critical arena the united states has long standing strategic interests in the region given us investment in aiding a peaceful and viable afghanistan as well as mitigating tensions and potential conflict between the nuclear states of pakistan and india china is expanding its influence in the region and has made pakistan a top focus of its belt and road initiative and the china pakistan economic corridor with its heavy investment in electric power and infrastructure projects energy is critically important to raising pakistan s per capita income levels and achieving universal electricity access is an important objective faced with rising energy demands from increasing urbanization incomes and population pakistan has increased its reliance on fossil fuel imports despite the fact that according to the us geological survey it has petroleum resources of 164 million barrels of oil and 24 6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas although this paper has not discussed the upstream oil and gas sector pakistan should consider ways to further investment in domestic exploration and development of these resources pakistan s power sector diversification program concentrates on expanding coal generation from both imported and domestic sources the planned scale up of coal generation from almost nothing a few years ago is very troubling and adds to international concerns that countries especially in asia are not seriously implementing their paris agreement commitments to mitigate co2 emissions united nations un secretary general antónio guterres in his closing remarks at the un climate conference in new york on september 23 2019 called for countries to stop building coal plants after 2020 although this call is highly aspirational and not very realistic in terms of pakistan s situation pakistan s leaders would be wise to reorient their policies away from coal and greatly ramp up their renewable energy energy efficiency and gas and lng development efforts as the new khan government targets seem to suggest improving the financial viability of the power sector and ameliorating the circular debt problem are vitally important to attracting the needed investment for projects and establishing credible power off take agreements pakistan can build on the success it has had in attracting investment in wind and solar development to complement its large hydro development program and ensure that investments in transmission are made to accommodate this expansion international financial institutions and us and european donors should continue to encourage this direction while raising with high level chinese officials the issue of its aggressive coal project financing given the growing climate change impacts of storms and stresses on water resources it is critical for pakistan to elevate

the minutes for each regularly scheduled meeting of the committee ordinarily are made available three weeks after the day of the policy decision and subsequently are published in the board s annual report the descriptions of economic and financial conditions contained in these minutes and in the summary of economic projections are based solely on the information that was available to the committee at the time of the meeting the federal reserve board and the federal open market committee on friday released the attached minutes of the committee meeting held on december 10 11 2019 a summary of economic projections made by federal reserve board members and reserve bank presidents for the meeting is also included as an addendum to these minutes a joint meeting of the federal open market committee and the board of governors was held in the offices of the board of governors of the federal reserve system in washington d c on tuesday december 10 2019 at 10 00 a m and continued on wednesday december 11 2019 at 9 00 a m 1 a welcome email is on its way if you don t see it please check your junk folder eric belsky 3 director division of consumer and community affairs board of

governors matteo iacoviello and andrea raffo 6 deputy associate directors division of international finance board of governors jeffrey d walker 3 deputy associate director division of reserve bank operations and payment systems board of governors participants continued to discuss issues related to the ongoing review of the federal reserve s monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices the staff summarized the feedback received through the fed listens initiative a series of 14 public facing events conducted around the country with a broad range of individuals and groups these events engaged with the public directly on issues pertaining to the dual mandate objectives of maximum employment and stable prices representatives from underserved communities who participated in the fed listens events generally saw the current strong labor market as providing significant benefits to their communities most notably by creating greater opportunities for individuals who have experienced difficulty finding jobs in the past nevertheless these representatives noted that the benefits from current labor market conditions flowing to people in their communities were less than those implied by national statistics and they expressed concerns that the recent gains might not be sustained in the event of an economic downturn business representatives reported experiencing challenges finding qualified workers and described several initiatives to attract and retain workers including training programs and a willingness to employ individuals who are unlikely to have been considered in less favorable labor market conditions inflation developments elicited fewer comments at these events and were generally seen as posing less of a challenge than labor market conditions representatives of retirees mentioned difficulties associated with the rising costs of health care and prescription drugs whereas those representing low and middle income communities pointed to the rising costs of basic necessities such as housing utilities and food business representatives emphasized the importance of low and stable inflation for planning and decision making event participants were concerned about rising costs of living and generally perceived low inflation as desirable from that perspective event participants were asked about monetary policymakers concerns regarding overall inflation running persistently below 2 percent they noted that the federal reserve could better communicate its reasons for these concerns when asked about the effects of changes in interest rates representatives of underserved communities said that such changes had little effect on many members of their communities who have limited or no access to credit representatives of retirees conveyed a more negative view of low interest rates given the greater reliance of wealthier retirees on interest income business representatives generally found the low interest rate environment beneficial the staff briefing also included an analysis of distributional considerations for monetary policy consistent with the feedback received at the fed listens events the evidence reviewed by the staff showed that workers who are young less educated african american or hispanic tend to face a greater than average risk of losing their jobs during recessions the staff used simulations from a specific macroeconomic model to explore how heterogeneity of households might affect the transmission of economic shocks and changes in monetary policy to the economy the staff s simulations embedded the assumption that households have limited ability to borrow which makes some households consumption spending more sensitive to changes in income as a result in these simulations downturns lead to larger contractions in aggregate demand than would be the case if all households could borrow to support their consumption spending in response to a loss in income the amplification of recessionary shocks was especially large when the monetary policy response was constrained by the effective lower bound elb on the policy interest rate overall the analysis suggested that the costs of recessions as well as the benefits of economic stabilization might be larger than suggested by models that did not account for differences across households regarding their access to credit participants agreed that the fed listens outreach efforts had informed their understanding of the goals and tradeoffs associated with monetary policy and had provided highly useful input into their deliberations several participants voiced their desire to continue the conversations initiated at the fed listens events participants also shared their appreciation of the feedback they receive on a regular basis from members of the public including through the federal reserve system s extensive networks of contacts and community outreach efforts a few participants emphasized that policymakers engagement with the public helps build trust fosters transparency and reinforces the credibility of the federal reserve participants generally saw the feedback from fed listens events as reinforcing the importance of sustaining the economic expansion so that the effects of a persistently strong job market reach more of those who in the past had experienced difficulty finding employment several participants mentioned that sustaining strong labor market conditions helps workers build skills and cement their attachment to the labor force in a manner that might reduce the scarring effects of future downturns and might increase the maximum sustainable level of employment over the longer run a number of participants also emphasized that sustaining strong labor market conditions is helpful for meeting the committee s symmetric 2 percent inflation goal regarding inflation participants recognized that segments of the public generally do not regard the fact that aggregate inflation is running modestly below the committee s 2 percent goal as a problem a few participants noted that the public s view on this issue was understandable from the perspective of households and businesses going about their daily lives in an economy with low and stable inflation that said a couple of participants cautioned that inflation could emerge as a concern among members of the public if it became more volatile or ran at levels substantially away from the committee s goal many participants also warned about the macroeconomic consequences of not achieving 2 percent on a sustained basis in particular if inflation ran persistently below the committee s objective longer term inflation expectations could drift down resulting in lower actual inflation with lower inflation nominal interest rates would be lower as well and therefore closer to the elb as a result the scope for monetary policy to support the economy in a future downturn through interest rate cuts would be reduced a situation that would likely worsen economic outcomes for households and businesses in light of these considerations participants generally agreed that they need to communicate more clearly to the public their rationale for and commitment to achieving 2 percent inflation on a sustained basis and of ensuring that longer run inflation expectations are anchored at levels consistent with this objective to ensure the effectiveness of these and other communications several participants stressed that the federal reserve needs to adapt its communications to various audiences a few participants emphasized that communications about the committee s resolve to return inflation to 2 percent need to be backed with actions and results to ensure that the public sees these communications as credible some participants spoke to some of the challenges associated with assessing the maximum level of employment a few participants noted that aggregate statistics mask significant heterogeneity in labor market outcomes a few others pointed to the continued absence of significant wage and price pressure traditionally seen as a symptom of a tight labor market even as the unemployment rate had moved below most estimates of its longer run level a few participants raised the possibility that the maximum sustainable level of employment had increased as the expansion continued to draw workers who would otherwise not be in the labor force with respect to the role of distributional considerations in the pursuit of the dual mandate objectives several participants noted that it was important for policymakers to be cognizant of how monetary policy affects different segments of the population most participants commented on the large costs that recessions and high unemployment impose on communities notably on their most vulnerable constituents and stressed the need for monetary policy to seek to avoid recessions in the first place or reduce their severity when they occur a number of these participants emphasized that while monetary policy actions can have different effects across groups monetary policy actions that are driven by the pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices ultimately benefit all groups participants viewed the role of monetary policy as supporting a strong stable economy that benefits all americans various participants noted that monetary policy is a blunt instrument whose effects cannot be targeted to specific communities several participants remarked that while monetary policy actions can improve the conditions of vulnerable communities notably by supporting a strong job market these actions may not reduce inequality in wealth and income for these and other reasons many participants emphasized that policies other than monetary policy are appropriate to directly address inequality in addition a couple of participants cautioned that maintaining accommodative financial conditions could be counterproductive if doing so fueled financial imbalances and exacerbated the next economic downturn the system open market account manager first reviewed developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period market prices appeared to respond mainly to signs of stabilization in the u s and global economies and to developments associated with trade policy market participants noted some risks to the outlook including brexit and geopolitical factors regarding expectations for u s monetary policy the open market trading desk s surveys and market based indicators pointed to a very high perceived likelihood of no change in the target range for the federal funds rate at this meeting the expected path of the federal funds rate implied by the medians of survey respondents modal forecasts remained essentially flat through 2020 survey and market implied uncertainty about the near term outlook for monetary policy declined with market commentary attributing the decrease in part to the committee s october communications survey respondents placed a higher probability on a reduction in the target range over 2020 than an increase participants agreed that their review of monetary policy strategy tools and communication practices would continue at future meetings and as a result that the committee would not reaffirm its existing statement on longer run goals and monetary policy strategy at the january 2020 meeting the committee plans to revisit this statement closer to the conclusion of the review likely around the middle of 2020 the manager turned next to a review of money market developments since the october meeting starting with an update on the implementation of the committee s strategy to ensure ample reserves reserve management purchases of treasury bills continued at a pace of 60 billion per month with propositions remaining strong and little discernible effect on market functioning while these purchases accumulated the desk continued to conduct regular repurchase agreement repo operations in order to maintain reserves at or above the level that prevailed in early september repos outstanding from these desk operations totaled roughly 215 billion per day consisting of both overnight and term operations with respect to conditions around year end the manager noted that forward measures of market pricing continued to indicate expectations of temporary upward pressures on some secured rates money market rates are often volatile around year end and federal reserve operations are not intended to eliminate all year end pressures but rather to ensure that reserve supply remains ample and to mitigate the risk that such pressures could adversely affect the implementation of monetary policy the desk had already conducted three longer term repo operations spanning year end for a total of 75 billion and planned to announce an additional longer term operation as well as increase the amount of overnight repo offered around the year end date the manager reported that the desk is closely monitoring reserves and money market conditions and that it is prepared to adjust plans as needed as reserve levels increased the distribution of reserves across bank types became comparable with where it was in early september the federal funds rate and other overnight money market rates fell modestly and were close to the interest on excess reserves ioer rate for most of the period the intraday dispersion of rates was also lower than when reserves were at similar levels before september in addition to helping keep reserves ample repo operations likely have reduced pressures in money markets and the dispersion in money market rates the manager discussed two operational considerations around policy implementation the first involved the risk that future treasury bill purchases could have a larger effect on liquidity in the treasury bill market in light of expected seasonal declines in bill issuance and the federal reserve s growing ownership share of outstanding bills if this risk were to materialize the federal reserve could consider expanding the universe of securities purchased for reserve management purposes to include coupon bearing treasury securities with a short time to maturity purchases of these short dated securities would not affect broader financial conditions or the stance of monetary policy the manager also discussed expectations to gradually transition away from active repo operations next year as treasury bill purchases supply a larger base of reserves the calendar of repo operations starting in mid january could reflect a gradual reduction in active repo operations the manager indicated that some repos might be needed at least through april when tax payments will sharply reduce reserve levels the manager also noted that the federal reserve bank of new york communicated to its customers that the remuneration rate on the foreign repo pool will be revised to be generally equivalent to the overnight reverse repo rate this action may reduce activity in the pool to some extent and increase the level of reserves as reserves remain ample the manager noted that it may become appropriate at some point to implement a technical adjustment to the ioer rate and the offered rate on overnight reverse repurchase on rrp agreements should conditions warrant this adjustment the ioer rate could move closer to the middle of the target range for the federal funds rate and the on rrp rate could be realigned with the bottom of the target range the information available for the december 10 11 meeting indicated that labor market conditions remained strong and that real gross domestic product gdp was increasing at a moderate rate in the second half of 2019 consumer price inflation as measured by the 12 month percentage change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures pce remained below 2 percent in october survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations were little changed by unanimous vote the committee ratified the desk s domestic transactions over the intermeeting period there were no intervention operations in foreign currencies for the system s account during the intermeeting period total nonfarm payroll employment surged in november boosted in part by the return of auto workers who had previously been on strike in october the average pace of job gains over the three months ending in november which is unaffected by the strike was stronger than earlier in 2019 however the rate of increase in payrolls so far this year was slower than last year even accounting for the anticipated effects of the bureau of labor statistics benchmark revision to payroll employment which will be incorporated in the published data in february 2020 the unemployment rate ticked up in october but then moved back down to its 50 year low of 3 5 percent in november the labor force participation rate and the employment to population ratio held steady on balance over those two months the unemployment rates for african americans asians hispanics and whites were little changed on net over the past two months the unemployment rate for each group was below its level at the end of the previous economic expansion though persistent differentials between these rates remained the average share of workers employed part time for economic reasons in november stayed below its level in late 2007 both the rate of private sector job openings and the rate of quits edged down in september but these readings were still at fairly elevated levels the four week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits through late november remained near historically low levels in general recent measures of nominal wage growth continued to be moderate total labor compensation per hour in the business sector increased 3 7 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter the employment cost index for private sector workers rose 2 7 percent over the 12 months ending in september while average hourly earnings for all employees increased 3 1 percent over the 12 months ending in november total consumer prices as measured by the pce price index increased 1 3 percent over the 12 months ending in october core pce price inflation which excludes changes in consumer food and energy prices was 1 6 percent over that same 12 month period while consumer food price inflation was lower than core inflation and consumer energy prices declined the trimmed mean measure of 12 month pce price inflation constructed by the federal reserve bank of dallas remained at 2 percent in october the consumer price index cpi rose 2 1 percent over the 12 months ending in november while core cpi inflation was 2 3 percent recent readings on survey based measures of longer run inflation expectations including those from the university of michigan surveys of consumers the survey of professional forecasters the survey of consumer expectations from the federal reserve bank of new york and the desk s survey of primary dealers and survey of market participants were little changed on balance the michigan survey measure ticked back down in early december to the bottom of its recent range after ticking up in november real residential investment appeared to be increasing further after rising solidly in the third quarter both starts and building permit issuance for single family homes increased in october and starts of multifamily units also rose existing home sales continued to increase in october although new home sales edged down following a solid gain in the third quarter all told the data on construction and sales continued to suggest that the decline in mortgage rates since late 2018 has been boosting housing activity real pce continued to expand in october following a strong gain in the third quarter sales of light motor vehicles rose markedly in november key factors that influence consumer spending including the low unemployment rate the upward trend in real disposable income high levels of households net worth and generally low interest rates were supportive of solid real pce growth in the near term the michigan survey measure of consumer sentiment rose again in early december to an upbeat level and had more than recovered from its drop in august the conference board survey measure of consumer confidence remained at a favorable level in november real nonresidential private fixed investment remained weak overall after declining in the second and third quarters nominal shipments and new orders of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased solidly in october following a string of decreases although many forward looking indicators pointed to continued softness in business equipment spending most measures of business sentiment were still downbeat analysts expectations of firms longer term profit growth edged down further and concerns about trade developments continued to weigh on firms investment decisions nominal business expenditures for nonresidential structures outside of the drilling and mining sector continued to decline in october and the total number of crude oil and natural gas rigs in operation an indicator of business spending for structures in the drilling and mining sector fell further through early december total real government purchases were increasing slowly in the fourth quarter nominal defense spending in october pointed to only a modest rise in real federal government purchases real purchases by state and local governments looked to be moving roughly sideways state and local payrolls expanded modestly on net over october and november and nominal construction spending by these governments was about flat in october industrial production decreased in october and remained notably lower than at the beginning of the year production in october continued to be held down by the strike at general motors although the end of the strike and automakers schedules suggested that assemblies of light motor vehicles would rebound in november overall manufacturing production appeared likely to remain soft in coming months reflecting generally weak readings on new orders from national and regional manufacturing surveys declining domestic business investment slow economic growth abroad and a persistent drag from trade developments article content the nominal u s international trade deficit narrowed in october exports fell a little with declines in all export categories except for services and industrial supplies imports fell much more and the declines were broad based with the largest contributions coming from imports of consumer goods and automotive products available trade data suggested that the contribution of net exports to real gdp growth which was slightly negative in the third quarter would turn somewhat positive in the fourth quarter foreign economic growth slowed further in the third quarter amid continued weakness in the global manufacturing sector recent monthly indicators pointed to a stabilization in the pace of economic growth in china and several advanced foreign economies however other indicators suggested that social unrest weighed heavily on economic activity in several countries most notably in hong kong and that weakness persisted in parts of latin america foreign inflation picked up somewhat as energy prices stabilized although inflation remained relatively low in most foreign economies staff review of the financial situation investor sentiment fluctuated over the intermeeting period largely in response to ongoing trade negotiations between the united states and china on net equity prices increased moderately while corporate bond spreads narrowed slightly yields on nominal treasury securities were little changed financing conditions for businesses and households remained supportive of spending and economic activity federal reserve communications over the intermeeting period were viewed as suggesting that additional near term changes to the target range for the federal funds rate were less likely than had previously been expected a straight read of the probability distribution for the federal funds rate implied by options prices suggested that investors assigned a high probability to the target range remaining unchanged at the december fomc meeting forward rates implied by overnight index swap quotes declined slightly on net and implied about a 25 basis point decline in the federal funds rate by the end of 2020 nominal treasury yields fluctuated over the intermeeting period but on net the treasury curve was little changed measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead based on treasury inflation protected securities increased slightly from near multiyear low levels broad stock price indexes increased moderately over the intermeeting period amid movements largely attributed to trade related developments and stronger than expected u s employment reports option implied volatility on the s p 500 index increased modestly but remained near the low end of its historical distribution on net corporate credit spreads narrowed slightly conditions in short term funding markets were stable over the intermeeting period interest rates for overnight secured and unsecured loans fell in line with the 25 basis point decrease in the target range for the federal funds rate at the october fomc meeting trading in money markets was orderly with volumes in normal ranges and spreads narrower relative to the ioer rate pressures on rates at october month end and november mid month both days with sizable settlements of treasury auctions were muted compared with other recent treasury issuance days the desk s open market operations aimed at maintaining ample reserves proceeded smoothly as in u s markets sentiment in foreign financial markets fluctuated in response to news on u s china trade negotiations most foreign equity price indexes and long term sovereign yields in germany the united kingdom and japan increased modestly on net the broad dollar index ended the period little changed political unrest in hong kong and latin america garnered some financial market attention and led to a weakening of some latin american currencies notably the chilean peso but the imprint on broader financial markets was limited financing conditions for nonfinancial businesses remained accommodative gross issuance of corporate bonds was robust on average in october and november gross issuance of institutional leveraged loans remained near recent monthly averages meanwhile commercial and industrial loans held by banks contracted in october but increased modestly in november the credit quality of nonfinancial corporations deteriorated slightly in recent months but remained solid overall after particularly strong gross equity issuance in september initial public offerings declined and seasoned offerings remained solid in october and november credit conditions for both small businesses and municipalities stayed accommodative in the commercial real estate cre sector financing conditions also remained generally accommodative commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs spreads widened slightly over the intermeeting period but remained near the low end of their post crisis range agency and non agency cmbs issuance increased in october to a post crisis high cre loan growth at banks also increased in october relative to recent quarters financing conditions in the residential mortgage market remained accommodative over the intermeeting period mortgage rates were little changed since the october fomc meeting consistent with this year s decline in mortgage rates home purchase originations and refinancing originations both rose mortgage credit standards were little changed financing conditions in consumer credit markets remained generally supportive of growth in consumer spending although conditions continued to be tight for nonprime borrowers auto loans increased consistent with significant declines in auto loan interest rates this year credit card debt grew at a solid pace and interest rates on credit card debt began to fall consumer asset backed securities issuance was strong through october as spreads stabilized at levels that were somewhat above their post crisis averages staff economic outlook the projection for u s real gdp growth prepared by the staff for the december fomc meeting was revised up a little for the second half of 2019 relative to the previous projection this revision primarily reflected incoming data for household spending and business investment that were somewhat stronger than expected even with this upward revision real gdp was forecast to rise more slowly in the second half of the year than in the first half mostly because of continued soft business investment and slower increases in government spending the forecast for real gdp growth over the medium term was also revised up a bit on balance primarily in response to a somewhat higher projected path for equity prices nevertheless real gdp growth was still expected to slow modestly in the coming years largely because of a fading boost from fiscal policy output was forecast to expand at a rate a little above the staff s estimate of its potential rate of growth in 2019 through 2021 and then to slow to a pace slightly below potential output growth in 2022 the unemployment rate was projected to be roughly flat at around its current level through 2022 and to remain below the staff s estimate of its longer run natural rate the staff s forecast for total pce price inflation in 2019 was revised down a bit as a downward revision to core pce prices in response to recent data was partly offset by an upward revision to consumer energy prices beyond 2019 core inflation was expected to be above its pace this year and this projection was revised up a touch because of the slightly tighter resource utilization in the current forecast the projection for total inflation in 2020 was a little lower than for core inflation due to a projected decline in consumer energy prices over the remainder of the medium term projection total inflation was expected to be about the same as core inflation although both inflation measures were forecast to continue to run a bit below 2 percent through 2022 the staff continued to view the uncertainty around its projections for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation as generally similar to the average of the past 20 years the staff viewed the downside risks to economic activity as having eased a bit since the previous forecast but still judged that the risks to the forecast for real gdp growth were tilted to the downside with a corresponding skew to the upside for the unemployment rate important factors influencing this assessment were that international trade tensions and foreign economic developments seemed more likely to move in directions that could have significant negative effects on the u s economy than to resolve more favorably than assumed in addition softness in business investment and manufacturing production so far this year were seen as pointing to the possibility of a more substantial slowing in economic growth than the staff projected the risks to the inflation projection were also viewed as having a downward skew in part because of the downside risks to the forecast for economic activity participants views on current conditions and the economic outlook in conjunction with this fomc meeting members of the board of governors and federal reserve bank presidents submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gdp growth the unemployment rate and inflation for each year from 2019 through 2022 and over the longer run based on their individual assessments of the appropriate path for the federal funds rate the longer run projections represented each participant s assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge over time under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy these projections are described in the summary of economic projections sep which is an addendum to these minutes participants agreed that the labor market had remained strong over the intermeeting period and that economic activity had risen at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low although household spending had risen at a strong pace business fixed investment and exports had remained weak on a 12 month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent market based measures of inflation compensation remained low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed participants generally expected sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes this outlook reflected at least in part the support provided by the current stance of monetary policy nevertheless global developments related to both persistent uncertainty regarding international trade and weakness in economic growth abroad continued to pose some risks to the outlook and inflation pressures remained muted in their discussion of the household sector participants agreed that spending had increased at a strong pace they generally expected that consumption spending would likely remain on a firm footing supported by strong labor market conditions rising incomes and solid consumer confidence in addition residential investment had continued to pick up reflecting in part the effects of lower mortgage rates many participants commented that business contacts in consumer related industries reported strong demand or that contacts were optimistic about the holiday retail spending season however some participants observed that recent data on retail sales or motor vehicle spending had decelerated slightly with respect to the business sector participants saw trade developments and concerns about the global economic growth outlook as the main factors contributing to weak business investment and exports participants generally expected these factors to continue to damp business investment and exports they expressed similar concerns about activity in manufacturing industries a few participants noted that the current weakness in capital expenditures could lead to a slower pace of productivity growth in future years a few others observed that businesses were diversifying their supply chains or investing in technology to adapt to persistent uncertainty regarding international trade which might mitigate the effects of such uncertainty on future business spending a number of participants commented on challenges facing the energy and agriculture sectors a few participants remarked that activity in the energy sector was especially weak reflecting low petroleum prices low profitability and tight financing conditions for energy producing firms several participants noted that the agricultural sector also faced a number of difficulties including those associated with trade developments weak export demand and challenging financial positions for many farmers a couple of participants noted that farm subsidies from the federal government were offsetting a portion of the financial strain on farmers participants judged that conditions in the labor market remained strong with the unemployment rate at a 50 year low job gains remaining solid and some measures of labor force participation increasing further the unemployment rate was likely to remain low going forward and various participants remarked that there were some indications that further strengthening in overall labor market conditions was possible without creating undesirable pressures on resources in particular a number of participants noted that the labor force participation rate could rise further still moreover measures of wage growth had generally remained moderate however a few participants commented that increases in the labor force would likely moderate as slack in the labor market diminished in addition a couple of participants remarked that the preliminary benchmark revision released in august by the bureau of labor statistics had indicated that payroll employment gains would likely show less momentum coming into this year once those revisions are incorporated in published data early next year a couple of other participants thought it was important to better understand the quality of jobs being created business contacts in many districts indicated continued strong labor demand with firms reporting difficulties in finding qualified workers or broadening their recruiting to include traditionally marginalized groups a number of participants noted that wage pressures were evident for some industries in their districts and a couple of participants commented that firms were responding to those pressures in a variety of ways including investing in technology that could serve as a substitute for labor in their discussion of inflation developments participants noted that recent readings on overall and core pce inflation measured on a 12 month change basis had continued to run below 2 percent survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed and market based measures of inflation compensation remained low a few participants commented on factors that may temporarily exert upward pressure on some measures of inflation in the coming months assessing all these factors participants generally expected that inflation would return to the 2 percent objective as the economic expansion continued and resource utilization remained high however weakness abroad and subdued global inflation pressures were cited as sources of risk to this assessment participants who expressed less confidence that inflation would return promptly to the 2 percent objective commented that inflation had averaged less than 2 percent over the past several years even as resource utilization had increased or that global or technology related factors were exerting downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult to overcome participants also discussed risks regarding the outlook for economic activity while many saw the risks as tilted somewhat to the downside some risks were seen to have eased over recent months in particular there were some tentative signs that trade tensions with china were easing and the probability of a no deal brexit was judged to have lessened further in addition there were indications that the prospects for global economic growth may be stabilizing a number of participants observed that the domestic economy was showing resilience in the face of headwinds from global developments moreover statistical models designed to gauge the probability of recession using financial market data including those based on information from the treasury yield curve suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent months however new uncertainties had emerged regarding trade policy with argentina brazil and france and political tensions in hong kong persisted in their consideration of monetary policy at this meeting participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 1 2 to 1 3 4 percent to support sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective as reflected in their sep projections participants regarded the current stance of monetary policy as likely to remain appropriate for a time as long as incoming information about the economy remained broadly consistent with the economic outlook of course if developments emerged that led to a material reassessment of the outlook the stance of policy would need to adjust in a way that fostered the committee s dual mandate objectives a number of participants agreed that maintaining the current stance of monetary policy would give the committee some time to assess the full effects on the economy of its policy decisions and communications over the course of this year along with other information bearing on the economic outlook participants also discussed how maintaining the current stance of policy for a time could be helpful for cushioning the economy from the global developments that have been weighing on economic activity and for returning inflation to the committee s symmetric objective of 2 percent participants generally expressed concerns regarding inflation continuing to fall short of 2 percent although a number of participants noted that some of the factors currently holding down inflation were likely to prove transitory various participants were concerned that indicators were suggesting that the level of longer term inflation expectations was too low a few participants raised the concern that keeping interest rates low over a long period might encourage excessive risk taking which could exacerbate imbalances in the financial sector these participants offered various perspectives on the relationship between financial stability and policies that keep interest rates persistently low they remarked that such policies could be inconsistent with sustaining maximum employment could make the next recession more severe than otherwise or could strengthen the case for the active use of macroprudential tools to guard against emerging imbalances various participants remarked on issues related to the implementation of monetary policy highlighting topics for further discussion at future meetings among the topics mentioned were the potential role of a standing repo facility in an ample reserves regime the setting of administered rates and the composition of the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities over the longer run committee policy action in their discussion of monetary policy for this meeting members noted that information received since the fomc met in october indicated that the labor market remained strong and that economic activity had been rising at a moderate rate job gains had been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate had remained low although household spending had been rising at a strong pace business fixed investment and exports remained weak on a 12 month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy were running below 2 percent market based measures of inflation compensation remained low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations were little changed members agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 1 2 to 1 3 4 percent members judged that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective members also agreed that in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee would assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective and they concurred that this assessment would take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations and readings on financial and international developments with regard to the post meeting statement members agreed to state that they judged that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support the achievement of the committee s policy objectives members discussed their options regarding references to global developments and muted inflation pressures in the statement in their judgment these factors cited in previous post meeting statements as part of the rationale for adjusting the stance of policy remained salient features of the outlook accordingly they agreed to cite them in the sentence indicating that the committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook with the retention of these references to global developments and muted inflation pressures members agreed that the text on uncertainties about the outlook could be removed a few members suggested that the language stating that monetary policy would support inflation near 2 percent could be misinterpreted as suggesting that policymakers were comfortable with inflation running below that level they preferred language that referred to returning inflation to the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective other members thought that the reference to near 2 percent was intended to encompass modest deviations of inflation above and below 2 percent at the conclusion of the discussion the committee voted to authorize and direct the federal reserve bank of new york until instructed otherwise to execute transactions in the soma in accordance with the following domestic policy directive to be released at 2 00 p m effective december 12 2019 the federal open market committee directs the desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1 1 2 to 1 3 4 percent in light of recent and expected increases in the federal reserve s non reserve liabilities the committee directs the desk to continue purchasing treasury bills at least into the second quarter of 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early september 2019 the committee also directs the desk to continue conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through january 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non reserve liabilities and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation in addition the committee directs the desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend holiday or similar trading conventions at an offering rate of 1 45 percent in amounts limited only by the value of treasury securities held outright in the system open market account that are available for such operations and by a per counterparty limit of 30 billion per day the committee directs the desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the federal reserve s holdings of treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all principal payments from the federal reserve s holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities received during each calendar month principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage backed securities up to 20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of treasury securities outstanding principal payments in excess of 20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage backed securities small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable the committee also directs the desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the federal reserve s agency mortgage backed securities transactions the vote also encompassed approval of the statement below to be released at 2 00 p m information received since the federal open market committee met in october indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate job gains have been solid on average in recent months and the unemployment rate has remained low although household spending has been rising at a strong pace business fixed investment and exports remain weak on a 12 month basis overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent market based measures of inflation compensation remain low survey based measures of longer term inflation expectations are little changed consistent with its statutory mandate the committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability the committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 1 2 to 1 3 4 percent the committee judges that the current stance of monetary policy is appropriate to support sustained expansion of economic activity strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee s symmetric 2 percent objective the committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook including global developments and muted inflation pressures as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate in determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate the committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective this assessment will take into account a wide range of information including measures of labor market conditions indicators

democratic parties are farther apart on these issues than at any other moment in recent history the republican party led by us president donald j trump will continue to prioritize his energy dominance agenda this agenda favors expanded production and access to all fuels with a focus on abundant us fossil fuel resources and a sharply circumscribed role for emissions reductions and climate policy early proposals from the democratic presidential candidates suggest an alternative vision where formulating a national climate policy with an emphasis on largescale emissions reduction would foster rapid decarbonization through a massive investment in clean energy infrastructure and the deployment of zero and low carbon fuels throughout the us economy on foreign and trade policies a second trump administration will maintain its nationalistic and isolationist tone which prioritizes transactional relationships over conventional alliances and shared values reshoring of manufacturing and jobs will be at the heart of trade agreements although a democratic administration may share the sense of skepticism toward globalized and multilateral trade the party s leading presidential candidates firmly support the traditional us alliance system place greater emphasis on human rights and democracy and would enshrine leadership on climate change as a cornerstone of foreign relations and especially future trade agreements the competing visions of a republican and a democratic administration could hardly be more disparate this issue brief compares the salient energy policies under two scenarios the first is a reelected trump administration the second anticipates a democratic administration each scenario is collated under domestic energy climate change foreign and trade policies the authors conclude that industry and external stakeholders should prepare for a volatile outlook regardless of the outcome on november 3 2020 the deep and entrenched energy challenges that face the united states and the mounting pressure from climate change cannot be fully managed or surmounted by a single us presidential administration however dynamic much depends on the 2020 electoral cycle but policy uncertainty will persist regardless of the outcome of the election scenario one donald j trump is reelected the trump administration s energy agenda in its first term provides a guidepost for its probable approach in a second term on the domestic front this includes completing the deregulation agenda expanding domestic production and export dominance further curtailing the consideration of climate concerns in permitting of infrastructure and restricting the right of us states to exceed federal minimum environmental standards on the international stage a second term for trump will likely mean a constrained role for us leadership abroad and pursuit of bilateral trade agreements that protect domestic industries completing the deregulatory agenda the trump administration has pursued with varying degrees of success a robust slate of deregulatory policies throughout the us energy sector since the administration s earliest days us officials have prioritized the growth of us fossil fuel production and exports through a stated policy of energy dominance trump himself has proclaimed that under his leadership the golden era of american energy is now underway the administration has pursued a thorough rollback aimed at rewriting and in some cases rescinding a range of environmental and land use policies at the federal level at the us department of the interior doi the administration has curtailed protections in the endangered species act attempted to open nearly all of the outer continental shelf to offshore oil and gas leasing and replaced the obama era methane waste prevention rule at the environmental protection agency epa the administration has developed the affordable clean energy ace rule to replace the clean power plan finalized a new waters of the united states wotus rule to limit federal authority to block infrastructure under the clean water act relaxed emissions standards for new coal fired power plants under the new source performance standards and eased technical requirements and timelines for methane leak repair at the department of transportation the administration has proposed the safer affordable fuel efficient safe vehicles rule which would amend existing corporate average fuel economy cafe by retaining the model year 2020 standards for both programs through model year 2026 the epa meanwhile has tried to revoke california s waiver of preemption under section 209 of the clean air act to set tougher vehicle fuel efficiency standards perhaps most importantly the administration is using executive authority to assert federal supremacy over energy infrastructure in unprecedented ways it is developing new council on environmental quality ceq guidance on the implementation of the national environmental policy act and limiting states authority to stall or deny infrastructure under the clean water act an area particularly rife with tension between the federal government and progressive state governments that are skeptical of new fossil fuel infrastructure against this backdrop republican control of the us senate has proven instrumental most notably in the confirmation of key political appointees at the federal agencies who share the president s vision and have worked to implement it in a trump reelection scenario it is likely that the senate will remain in republican hands even if full control of congress proves elusive for the party accordingly our discussion below assumes a compliant republican controlled senate in a reelection scenario energy dominance encore the trump administration has prioritized expanded domestic fossil fuel production midstream infrastructure buildout and downstream export infrastructure e g new approvals for liquefied natural gas or lng export terminals as the core of energy dominance critically however many of the administration s hallmark efforts ace future corporate average fuel economy cafe standards and epa and doi methane regulation are just now seeing final or even draft rules announced in the federal register democratic state governments are vowing to fight these federal efforts in court more broadly federal rulemaking is deliberately slow leaving ample time for litigation and may ultimately end up in the us supreme court which now has a conservative majority other efforts couched in executive authorities e g one federal decision protocol for permitting and time limits on environmental reviews do not carry the weight or impact of legislation and regulation these could be undone with a mere signature by a democratic administration despite the rollback of policies very little in the domestic energy space is settled as the campaign season swings into high gear the key question for energy producers in 2020 is will the trump administration s deregulatory pro fossil fuel agenda be entrenched or reversed in a reelection scenario entrenchment will prevail but not without consequences the administration will continue pursuing lower cost and regulatory barriers for permitting all types of fossil fuel projects the trump administration s april 2019 executive orders on infrastructure and permitting are meant to exert federal control over permitting the administration will defend the draft epa rules published on august 9 2019 limiting state and tribal authorities under section 401 of the clean water act if the administration is successful states and interested stakeholders may be increasingly handicapped when it comes to opposing or even delaying new infrastructure buildouts by requesting stays or seeking to overturn existing permits by challenging the administration s implementation of federal environmental laws these issues are unlikely to be decided in the courts by november 2020 but likely will be by 2024 lower courts have already rejected several of the fast track regulatory decisions because they contravene federal legislation of the marquee cases at the center of the regulatory battles as of october 4 2019 the us supreme court has agreed to hear the case concerning atlantic coast pipeline s acp previously revoked forest service permit during the court s current term in the meantime the lower courts are divided even the eventual supreme court ruling will not fully decide acp s fate and numerous pertinent issues remain unresolved among various levels of regulators a doubling down on federal supremacy over permitting will if successful improve the outlook for fossil fuel operators and builders invested in these massive projects and raise the prospects for oil and gas production takeaway capacity and exports at the federal energy regulatory commission ferc trump s reelection would ensure a republican majority on the key five member commission entrusted with reviewing and approving infrastructure for interstate transmission of electricity natural gas and oil with the departure of commissioner cheryl lafleur at the end of august 2019 two of five seats at the commission are vacant ferc will as a result likely move more slowly through ongoing applications and project decisions a reelected trump administration will bring ferc to full strength with a republican majority facilitating expeditious approval timelines for applicants and a likely favorable view of fossil fuel midstream infrastructure e g oil gas and product pipelines and export projects e g lng terminals although recent legal setbacks may require ferc to conduct more thorough reviews of downstream greenhouse gas ghg emissions for fossil fuel infrastructure applications a republican majority at ferc under a trump administration would neither require operators to calculate the upstream or downstream impact of their projects nor offset emissions so long as the permits themselves can withstand legal scrutiny us land under lease to oil and gas developers february 12 2006 flickr us bureau of land management wyoming on land use a reelection would empower the administration to continue opening public lands and possibly offshore acreage for oil and gas leasing despite significant opposition from local and tribal organizations one analysis earlier in 2019 estimated that the doi has offered nearly 16 8 million acres of federal land for oil and gas leasing since trump took office with a centerpiece effort to open as much as 1 6 million acres in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr in alaska a reelected administration will double down on these efforts recent efforts to revise to the national endangered species act and alter specific species protections e g for the greater sage grouse in major oil and gas producing states are designed to ease new private upstream development although some of these efforts are already facing litigation plans to restrict or rewrite protections for ecologically sensitive or cultural sites e g the new bears ears oil and gas leasing program have similar goals these outcomes may not be confined to on shore the doi s efforts to rewrite the five year offshore leasing plan ended ignominiously earlier in 2019 as a result of fervent state opposition spearheaded by bipartisan governors from coast to coast an administration guaranteed four more final years could resurrect the five year plan and open huge swaths of the us coastline to new oil and gas drilling without fear of political repercussion a successful effort to revamp and finalize the extant five year plan would make a successor administration s job of curtailing it more arduous and time consuming curtailed climate policy in the second term the united states is due to withdraw formally from the paris agreement on the morning after the election november 4 2020 since trump announced his decision in june 2017 to withdraw the united states unilaterally from the climate pact us delegations have had limited participatory engagement with the subsequent conferences of the parties cops and the president has undertaken a secondary campaign to expunge climate science in total from official white house committees and documents if reelected trump will not pause the us withdrawal from the paris agreement and the administration will fall back on its skeptical isolationist position vis à vis global climate policy lacking firm us leadership the parties to the paris agreement may be increasingly hard pressed to implement its terms and maintain global cohesion on the need to reduce emissions quickly in the united states the trump administration will prioritize a hands off approach to the regulation of all types of ghg emissions especially carbon dioxide and methane a second trump administration would defend the inside the line approach of the finalized ace rule published on june 19 2019 which relies on limited internal efficiency improvements at existing power plants to achieve modest emissions reductions methane emissions will likely rise with one estimate projecting 480 000 tons of additional methane emissions by 2025 on the back of growing production and limited takeaway capacity if revised epa regulations are fully implemented all of this may suggest a rosy outlook for producers and operators and continued bearish signals for oil and gas markets from more us supply but there are some important caveats most importantly progressive state governments will not easily bend to a reelected trump they will most likely redouble their efforts to curtail fossil fuel infrastructure and enforce robust climate policies and emissions reductions in lieu of federal leadership the president can only push federal supremacy so far states and municipalities retain important rights to regulate land use and water quality operators may find opposition as strident as ever with denial of local permits occurring more quickly and frequently grassroots activism in opposition to infrastructure is rising especially as young consumers learn to use their power to influence corporate behavior e g the rising tide against single use plastic polling data is clear that young americans across the political spectrum are deeply troubled by climate change and may be ready to use their dollars accordingly populist driven consumer or product boycotts targeted at industry and partner companies as well as pressure on the major investment firms to divest from fossil fuels could accelerate under a second trump term finally industry should not discount the risk of international backlash as overseas buyers particularly in europe look for additional ways to decarbonize trial efforts at international border adjustments for carbon may quickly follow unregulated methane flaring for example could be an impetus justifiable or not for new penalties on us lng even as the market remains hotly competitive for suppliers investment and climate disclosure or lack thereof is another area where pressure on us multinational companies will mount especially as european multinational companies press forward with mandated disclosures the trump administration has already tried via the securities and exchange commission sec to block climate focused corporate shareholder resolutions it is not clear however for how long the administration can insulate us companies from this particular rising tide fundamentally the trump administration s top priorities are the reshoring of us jobs and manufacturing and the delinking of global supply chains this stands in stark contrast to conventional us policy favoring multilateral trade and more robust market interconnections if it succeeds industry may find that us producers access to burgeoning international markets will ultimately contract over the long term a weakened hyper nationalist global economy bodes poorly for the gdp energy demand growth and ease of trade foreign policy will congress compete for control assuming that ongoing trends continue and major black swan scenarios e g eruption of a war in the middle east or a global recession are avoided the foreign policy outlook in a reelection scenario may still produce headwinds for industry the trump era has seen a rise in authoritarian and revanchist governments around the world repression of opposition parties targeting of minority populations intimidation of neighboring governments and expansion of regional or global hegemony in some cases with trump s tacit approval congressional reaction to authoritarian actions even if those actions have the blessing of the trump administration could produce sanctions and other obstacles to trade with russia china turkey or other countries russia will continue to upgrade its arctic facilities and military capacities as it looks for ways to develop the region s lucrative resources despite us sanctions a confident russian government certain of us neutrality may seek further inroads political military or otherwise in ukraine and the baltics the russo chinese alliance will persist as long as the supply and demand needs of both countries align and as long as the chinese view russian engagement as an inroad to the arctic in its own neighborhood china may be emboldened by a retrenched divided united states to attempt to control the south china sea more aggressively as it did throughout the summer of 2019 in vietnamese waters seek new ways to undermine hong kong and taiwan s autonomy and intimidate southeast asia wary of international entanglements the trump administration is unlikely to apply pressure or enforce consequences for rogue behavior the us congress may be less acquiescent even with the senate safely in republican hands maintaining pressure on russia and perhaps also iran to a lesser extent is one area where lawmakers could unite across the aisle especially if provoked by the executive branch via tweet or otherwise the surge in sanctions legislation throughout trump s first term is likely a trend marker future sanctions bills targeting adversarial energy producers could boomerang back to us industry if us retrenchment continues congress will not hesitate to use its most powerful toolset to take back the reins us president donald trump appears before workers at cameron lng export facility in hackberry louisiana may 14 reuters leah millis the administration will continue to prioritize bilateral alliances with governments including in israel and saudi arabia that oppose iran this strategy has already fostered instability in the middle east especially as tehran opts for kinetic asymmetric responses to us pressure such as the attacks in september 2019 on saudi oil processing infrastructure the trump administration has not as yet articulated exactly what a new deal with iran will entail and iran will seek fresh leverage before it commits to any humiliating compromises trade policy more tariffs ahead the trump administration has left an indelible stamp on us trade policy this has been marked by a robust use of tariff powers shaking extant alliances and undermining decades of conventional wisdom in support of multilateral trade agreements in favor of a new brand of economic nationalism us tariffs on steel imports have raised the cost of energy infrastructure this protectionist agenda is far more likely to push manufacturers to different low wage countries even as automation accelerates globally retaliatory chinese tariffs have dramatically curtailed us oil and natural gas exports to china and have made financing lng export facilities that aspire to export to one of the world s fastest growing lng markets challenging frictions with mexico over steel and automobile tariffs and the threat of tariffs on goods to pressure mexico on migration issues have led to concerns in what is today the largest export market for us natural gas and petroleum products over the reliability of us natural gas exports these headwinds for us exports from trade tensions are likely to persist while the united states mexico canada agreement usmca may win ratification in 2020 the balance of the trump administration s trade agenda to negotiate comprehensive bilateral deals with europe japan and china is likely to be suspended pending the election results in 2020 if trump is reelected his administration may make slow progress toward negotiating final agreements but industry should not expect rapid or fully satisfactory results a second trump administration will thus likely mirror the first in terms of aggressive support for us fossil fuels limited engagement on any aspect of climate policy and a nationalistic trade and foreign policy agenda the key differences in a second term will be the ability to complete the first term s rulemaking to reshape regulatory bodies to achieve victory in the courts as republican appointees populate the judiciary and to refocus and potentially rebrand the united states as a supporter of economic nationalism transactional diplomacy and foreign policy restraint with the freedom and flexibility inherent to a new electoral mandate and the elimination of the pressure of campaigning a reelected administration will be less constrained than before to follow its deepest instincts and redesign us energy policy in its image in this environment finding areas of cooperation within congress and particularly between the legislative and executive branches will be challenging nevertheless there are a few areas where republicans and democrats may be able to work together in congress as we have seen over the past two years it is likely that both sides of the political aisle will defend a robust budget for the department of energy especially its research and development capacities as well as the national laboratories certain technologies especially efficiency carbon cap ture sequestration and transport battery storage and hydrogen production and fuel cell development could find enough support among bipartisan coalitions even if some on both sides are not fully on board with all of these emerging toolsets and their respective applica tions importantly however a recalcitrant white house that pushes full steam ahead with deregulation could be a problematic ally to congressional republicans seeking to build bipartisan support in any of these areas making compromise more challenging scenario two election of a democratic president it is impossible to project with certainty which two individuals will populate the 2020 democratic ticket let alone the final details of their energy and climate proposals nevertheless the baseline for a future democratic platform has been clearly demarcated in recent months the future of any such proposals depends heavily on the eventual makeup of congress as we have seen under trump the white house has considerable power to steer policy by virtue of executive authority but any major decisions on government spending require congressional input and oversight even if democrats take the senate in 2020 their majority will not be filibuster proof while it is possible to end the filibuster even democrats are divided over crossing this rubicon and opting instead for a liberal use of budget authority requiring a simple majority to pass is more likely governing as ever is far removed from campaigning our scenarios assume that a democratic administration will face serious congressional and likely judicial limitations on what it can and cannot implement if not a divided government outright a climate focused energy policy if a trump reelection means doubling down then a democratic victory will mean doubling back with a return to the 2016 status quo as the minimum starting point a democratic administration will be deeply skeptical of new fossil fuel infrastructure especially large interstate and international projects where public opposition from activists for example the keystone pipeline is all but guaranteed it will be sympathetic to national and grassroots activists who oppose new buildouts and may tacitly support state level efforts to delay or refuse new fossil fuel projects a democratic president might prefer to strengthen the national environmental policy act nepa to clarify the scope of climate and emissions reductions disclosure and include explicit mitigation mandates in federal environmental law in the absence of democratic control of congress a democratic administration would revise the ceq guidance and regulations as the trump administration is doing now but in the opposite direction as the next best option certainly a democratic administration will return to obama era policies around the implementation of the clean air and clean water acts and revive its expansive wotus definition to slow or constrain new buildout at ferc a democratic administration will at minimum fill out the agency with two new democratic commissioners it will likely seek commissioners whose records suggest support for measurement and offset of significant ghg emissions for major infrastructure projects as articulated by current democratic commissioner richard glick us sen elizabeth warren d ma a democratic presidential candidate has suggested an overhaul and renaming of ferc to federal renewable energy commission with the stated mission of reducing ghg pollution ironically a democratic administration may be inclined to employ trump era tools specifically federal supremacy an administration with ambitious renewables generation goals for example may try to expedite federal approvals for locally controversial infrastructure e g offshore wind fields the democratic presidential candidates and much of the electorate at large agree on the importance of expanding renewables generation the most ambitious plans envision a wholesale replacement of fossil fuel energy throughout the us economy in power generation buildings and transportation demanding that utilities achieve 100 percent clean renewable electricity by the 2030s for example would be an unprecedented and prescriptive intrusion of federal power into the us electricity markets and infrastructure investment decisions moreover hard political realities may temper these proposals when it is time to craft policy one recent estimate suggests that taken together there are nearly one million jobs in the petroleum coal and natural gas sectors while a further 130 000 americans are employed in fossil fuel power generation in addition millions more livelihoods builders retailers public service providers are adjacent to or supported by the energy industries the impacts on labor of a rapid systemic transformation will require careful attention as will the unavoidable impacts of a rapid systemic shift on the us gross domestic product gdp and wall street with serious and immediate consequences for retirees and others wind farm in turlock california unsplash american public power association a ban on new public lands leases for fossil fuel development could be an immediate high priority agenda item it is preeminent on nearly every democratic presidential candidate s platform beyond the relatively narrow confines of public lands a democratic administration will pursue quick high publicity wins for progressives these may include forbidding future leases in the anwr in alaska a revival of the restrictive obama era five year offshore plan or perhaps a moratorium on new offshore drilling the reinstatement of pre trump era species protections and the reestablishment of controversial protections for sensitive ecological regions and national parks beyond the relatively small percentages of oil and gas currently produced on public lands it is much less clear how a democratic administration would pursue the more complicated goals of stopping or preventing specific forms of fossil fuel production everywhere as some progressive candidates have vowed some proposals from the most vociferously progressive candidates indicate that they will ban hydraulic fracturing on all us soil including privately owned land where the vast majority of us oil and gas is produced if private lands can be targeted for hydraulic fracturing further inroads against other types of upstream development are not inconceivable of course such ambitions will prove far easier said than realized getting little help from congress such efforts would likely force the administration into a long and difficult rule making process at epa and might prove legally vulnerable without legislative changes to the clean air and clean water acts faced with an expansive domestic policy agenda tax reform healthcare reform immigration gun control even an ambitious progressive administration may hesitate to expend that level of commitment to stall or outright block some types of fossil fuel development from sea to sea moreover the attacks on the saudi oil processing facilities at khurais and abqaiq in september 2019 highlighted the importance of energy self sufficiency for supply security and price stability even a democratic administration will be loath to cede the energy security that has been the focus of us energy strategy since 1973 until low carbon alternatives are readily available climate policy historically high ambitions every democratic presidential candidate has said that the united states will rejoin the paris agreement under their leadership since rejoining can be done via executive powers this will be a day one priority and will immediately reinvigorate the global conversation on climate change a democratic president will resubmit the us nationally determined contribution ndc a required submission for any party to the agreement and will likely commit to deeper emissions cuts over the original obama administration version in line with carbon neutrality by 2050 if the trump administration can defend the ace rule a democratic administration will need one to two years to develop and finalize a replacement akin to a clean power plan 2 0 a new plan must feature deep emissions cuts facilitated by a total phaseout of coal rapid uptick of renewable generation and constraints on new natural gas generation democrats are increasingly thinking in terms of economy wide emissions not simply replacing or phasing out coal fired power generation to secure what they see as critical deep reductions the transportation sector which is prominent in the green new deal and many democratic candidates climate strategies will be a target whereas the trump administration is looking to revoke california s state authorities under the clean air act to enforce tighter emissions standards a democratic administration may see the california standards as a baseline not ceiling for new cafe standards in a reinvigorated push toward fuel efficiency and technological innovation warren who has adopted many key tenets of the climate strategy of washington governor jay inslee s now defunct presidential campaign has promised historically ambitious efficiency standards reaching a requirement for 100 percent zero emissions for all new light and medium duty vehicles by 2030 cafe standards are among the policy areas where a democratic administration s priorities may dovetail with those of industry and the private sector notably some us and international automakers investing in high efficiency and low carbon technological improvements within their sectors for industry especially independent operators the most immediate changes of consequence may come in methane regulation the democratic candidates roundly agree that methane emission reductions are equally if not more important than reducing carbon dioxide emissions any democratic president will reinstate stricter technical and leak repair requirements for operators and demand measuring and reporting of methane leaks although some have vowed to go further in 2019 for example democratic candidate us sen cory booker d nj promised to institute a requirement for fossil fuel companies to stop methane leaks from both new and existing sources or face heavy penalties another candidate us sen bernie sanders d vt has suggested that if he were to become president the epa would regulate methane in the same way as it regulates other emissions such as carbon dioxide under the clean air act and will toughen the obama era rules on leak detection and repair these proposals could raise upstream costs throughout the domestic oil and gas sector limit supply and stall export growth indeed this outcome is the official goal for some candidates notably sanders and warren however a democratic administration particularly one facing a divided congress will labor under the same restraints that have slowed the trump era rollback rewriting rules and arguing for more expansive federal powers to pursue ambitious emissions reductions will be a multiyear process carrying the risk of legal defeat from the district courts up to the us supreme court these historically high ambitions may pose risks to a new democratic president as expectations may exceed the party s legislative mandate and the speed of the policy process however deeply a new administration is committed to its climate agenda the machinery of government grinds slowly an attempt to expedite it can mean stinging losses and wasted effort moreover a first term democratic president must be extremely careful with constituencies in swing states where the oil and gas industries are major employers and local economies are highly dependent on fossil fuels e g pennsylvania ohio and colorado a complete hydraulic fracturing ban now supported by some leading democratic candidates could dislocate rural and semi rural economies in these high value purple states a new administration cannot afford to anger these voters ahead of the 2022 midterms and a 2024 reelection campaign proposals to end crude or fossil fuel exports entirely face a similar problem the newly acquired mantle of net exporter status has economic benefits for american workers throughout the value chain and arguably climatic benefits overseas for asian markets looking for alternatives to coal for power generation and industry even if a progressive democrat is elected in 2020 the headiness of victory must sooner or later give way to the realities of governance to be sure the rapidly growing sectors around renewable and zero carbon energy production and operation will see a new dawn under a democratic presidency but there are important areas where conventional producers may be able to cooperate with democratic priorities prominent among these are carbon capture technologies utilization and storage as well as direct capture and carbon pricing both of which already enjoy strong and growing industry support and are popular among some of the 2020 democratic candidates carbon pricing in the united states faces an uphill battle in congress despite no lack of bills on the table carbon capture research and development on the other hand could find immediate and robust bipartisan support us industry is firmly behind improving available technologies and reducing costs as quickly as possible a democratic administration on the other hand may be inclined by virtue of necessity to prioritize carbon capture in order to cut near and medium term emissions growth in the midst of climate emergency a characterization that is increasingly a truism on the progressive left another emerging area where a democratic administration may bring federal resources to bear is promoting carbon sequestration through the agriculture sector where decarbonization alone has proven particularly difficult among the candidates mayor pete buttigieg has most prominently featured agriculture and rural communities more broadly in his climate proposals he has recommended refocusing usda s research and development budget to reduce agriculture s carbon emissions to net zero or even net negative and supporting soil management techniques geared towards optimizing carbon sequestration through techniques such as crop rotation advanced grazing methods and nitrogen management some of these proposals could feature in executive orders others such as financial incentives for farmers to sequester carbon may require congressional approval and tax code alterations it is less clear however if and how nuclear energy will figure into a democratic presidency the progressive left as epitomized by the sanders campaign is uncomfortable or neutral with respect to nuclear power the senator himself has listed nuclear among false solutions his administration would fight or deprioritize other campaigns former us vice president joe biden booker us sen amy klobuchar d mn and the now defunct inslee campaign are warmer toward nuclear power but remain concerned about waste management and safety like the oil and gas industries nuclear power has high state level salience and in some communities provides an economic lifeline recent state legislative efforts to preserve extant nuclear resources affirm the importance of nuclear facilities to local economies this is one area where the moderate progressive democratic divide may be in sharpest relief at the federal level but even a firmly progressive administration may hesitate before pushing back against local efforts in favor of nuclear infrastructure seeking a us competitive advantage and new job markets a democratic administration will also explore emerging fields in energy research and development specifically the advent of artificial intelligence and autonomous tools drones trucks sensory technology and would invest heavily in modernizing the us grid network within a broader infrastructure package while republicans are certainly not opposed to these technologies especially when used voluntarily and in support of conventional resource development democrats will favor mandatory applications to climate and emission reduction such as methane monitoring the conventional energy industries are already hard at work in these fields suggesting another potential open door for joint efforts with the agencies and residual benefits favoring the early movers in these new fields zero emission hydrogen fuel cell technology is another emerging storage solution alongside new types of battery storage that a democratic administration might pursue if clean hydrogen production can be cost efficient major international oil companies iocs notably total in japan are actively working on scaling up hydrogen fuel cell vehicles hydrogen research and development could be a source of bilateral cooperation as well given strong interest in japan and europe bipartisan support for us national energy laboratories for research and development and energy efficiency measures has had a leveling effect on republican and democratic administrations in the past and should provide significant opportunity for common ground in the future foreign policy strategic reassurance with a dose of climate policy democrats at every level of government have decried trump s approach to foreign policy particularly his administration s seeming overtures to authoritarian regimes and geostrategic adversaries a democratic administration especially a progressive one is unlikely to seek out foreign adventures nevertheless the united states post world war ii history is clear in our view that diplomacy backed by credible use of force is usually the most effective a democratic administration will likely rebuild and reempower its state department as part of a broader multilateral coalition centric vision for us leadership strategic reassurance to european asian and latin american allies will be a day one priority a new administration will vocally reaffirm the us commitment to nato the european union eu and the transatlantic partnership industry should beware that a new administration may demand further investigations into 2016 russian election interference and publicly back one or more of the major russia sanctions bills presently waiting to move in congress possibly facilitating a rapid passage within the first 100 days a new administration will likely maintain an adversarial relationship with china like the trump administration many democratic presidential candidates see chinese economic manipulation as the core challenge facing us workers and the manufacturing sector sanders has decried current trade and tax agreements that make it easier for multinational corporations to ship jobs overseas and throwing american workers out on the street warren has criticized china directly noting the suppression of pay and labor rights poor environmental protections and years of currency manipulation the more moderate mayor pete buttigieg of south bend indiana has affirmed a serious challenge from china that cannot be fixed through tariffs economic distortions aside democrats have a much longer list of concerns a new administration will likely press china on rising carbon emissions coal consumption and exports rampant human rights violations against religious and ethnic minorities efforts to dominate the south china sea and its regional neighbors and recent attempts to undermine democratic and populist movements in hong kong and taiwan using these issues as leverage a democratic administration may be able to stabilize the trade relationship with a limited agreement that includes drawing down the current expansive tariff regime on both sides especially if a deal could include a rapprochement on global climate priorities even a modest deal at this stage would be immediately beneficial for us crude and lng exports languishing under retaliatory tariffs but the long term us china relationship will likely remain more fractious than harmonious industry should not rest comfortably but should prepare for long term headwinds in the us relationship with the world s fastest growing energy consumer the starkest foreign policy reversal could come in the middle east where a democratic administration could cast a sharply critical eye on two of the trump administration s most important allies israel and saudi arabia in congress the democratic caucus is divided on support for both countries and foreign aid budgets will likely be contested bills that sought to limit arms sales or end the war effort in yemen that were rejected by trump earlier in 2019 might see a more welcome reception from a democratic president a democratic president might reopen investigations into the 2018 murder of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi at the saudi consulate in istanbul and could tacitly or vocally endorse a version of the justice against sponsors of terrorism act jasta legislation facilitating foreign lawsuits against saudi arabia in the event that the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec restrains oil production to levels that elevate oil prices to unpopular levels a democratic us department of justice investigation into opec as an anti trust matter with particular focus on the opec deal to prop up global oil prices could strongly appeal to the democratic base even as mere signaling twelve democratic us presidential candidates debate during the fourth us democratic presidential candidates 2020 election debate at otterbein university in westerville ohio october 15 2019 reuters shannon stapleton most democratic candidates support a renegotiation aimed at resurrecting the iran nuclear deal formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa as with the trade agenda a jcpoa 2 0 will be a priority but iranian negotiators will find the bar for complete reversal of the secondary sanctions regime higher than in 2015 if a democratic administration can secure a handful of additional concessions on nonnuclear issues related to iran s regional conduct and ballistic missile program even if only on paper it can claim to have secured a deal superior to former us president barack obama s and accomplished what the trump administration never could in that scenario iranian crude exports presently down to 100 000 barrelsper day bpd from 2 5 million bpd in april 2018 should quickly bounce back with deeply bearish implications for global oil markets downward pressure on already limp crude prices an economic headwind to a new us administration could send opec starting with saudi arabia back to the drawing board or even running for cover trade policy fairer trade for growth and a counterweight to china democrats have so far struggled to craft an alternative answer to trump s unconventional trade agenda indeed many progressive democrats share the administration s basic skepticism toward multilateral trade but for wholly different reasons more broadly trump s vision of economic nationalism articulated since 2015 will not disappear from the minds of voters overnight democratic presidential candidates are divided into those seeking fairer trade and those who have found nearly all prior trade deals fatally flawed yet support for trade among democratic constituencies and the electorate overall is on the rise facing these countervailing forces democrats cannot simply patch up the trans pacific partnership tpp or transatlantic trade and investment partnership ttip rush to undo all existing trump era retaliatory or product specific tariffs offer a cordial handshake to beijing and proclaim that bygones are bygones however much industry and multinational corporations may hope nor will democrats be willing to admit that the trump administration succeeded on any front particularly trade it may however be willing to build on existing work done under the current us trade representative ustr seek stronger labor and environmental protections and craft what it will try to argue are better deals for which it can then claim credit the usmca is a case in point house democrats insisted on stronger enforcement labor and environmental provisions and won sufficient gains to obtain the support of the afl cio with so many democrats in swing districts dependent on trade speaker pelosi agreed on an updated usmca with bipartisan support passage is likely in 2020 beyond north american trade industry should expect a much warmer us mexico relationship especially under a more progressive democratic administration which will be sympathetic to leftist mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador amlo and his efforts to work with the united states on immigration if the ongoing negotiations over export pipelines into mexico can be resolved south of the border a democratic administration will be hard pressed to block increased gas exports to mexico despite likely tepid support within a democratic administration for fossil fuels exports a us eu and a more comprehensive us japan agreement may quickly follow an approved usmca as a democratic administration will be keen for first year wins and public reaffirmation of important strategic alliances via trade relationships there may be consideration given to finding a way for the united states to join a rebranded tpp 12 as a counterweight to china although industry can confidently expect that major trade deals will go through and meet a supportive congress it should not expect a bright future for investor state dispute settlement isds protections the current ustr has pushed back against comprehensive isds throughout its extensive negotiations on the usmca and there appears to be no constituency on the other side of the aisle wishing to revive it the agreements will come eventually but investors should anticipate higher investment risk than they previously enjoyed democrats will not simply polish trump era agreements and move them through congress they will try to augment future agreements with progressive flavor through environmental side agreements and possibly climate policy demands environmental issues among others have been a sticking point between the ustr and house democrats on the uscma the democratic presidential candidates across the ideological spectrum appear united on integrating climate strategy into a new trade agenda biden has said his administration will impose carbon adjustment fees or quotas on carbon intensive goods from countries that are failing to meet their climate and environmental obligations and condition future trade agreements on partners commitments to meet their enhanced paris climate targets warren has promised that any potential free trade agreement partner must pass a litmus test including membership in the paris agreement with an independently verifiable national emissions reduction plan and the elimination of domestic fossil fuel subsidies all of these requirements may prove fungible and negotiable in practice but climate policy will become a core component of any new trade agenda as a means to shore up domestic progressive constituencies and put pressure on carbon intensive economies overseas to clean up their act or risk losing access to us markets the utility of trade as a driver of global climate policy and the need for wider coalitions to address chinese and russian revanchism may make a fairer trade policy a focal point of a democratic administration s international economic policy the more things stay the same volatility ahead the disparity between the old and a potentially new administration can be fairly described as a sea change with numerous immediate and near term implications for energy markets producers and operators both scenarios present their own challenges as well as bearish and bullish market signals in this sense the 2020 election is profoundly consequential unfortunately the broader context suggests that the major overarching challenges facing the us and global energy markets will remain unresolved nowhere is this problem more stark than with climate change whichever administration takes office in january 2021 it will not be able to solve the long term energy transition puzzle that has bedeviled policy makers and their increasingly angry constituents the world over overseas especially in developing asia emissions growth continues to accelerate while low and zero carbon fuels struggle to compete against cheap native coal resources entrenched local and national interests challenging land use and geographic problems subsidized power prices uncompetitive investment frameworks and extant young coal infrastructure despite some new efforts including the 2018 better utilization of investment leading to development build act to facilitate modern infrastructure in developing countries us diplomacy and money is far behind on the climate challenge within the united states the democratic primary has shown just how far the progressive climate agenda has become mainstream all of the democratic candidates are focused on the urgency of climate change and the drastic measures needed to fight it the green new deal has thrown down the gauntlet for both parties as its advocates will remain a vocal wild card for years to come trump s reelection will frustrate and motivate these constituencies while a new democratic administration will find itself facing unrelenting pressure and a steep list of demands most of which will be beyond the political capacity or willpower of any singular presidential administration against this backdrop the physical consequences of climate change will intensify and growing numbers of moderate and independent voters will demand a more comprehensive and effective response from the federal government in short us energy policy is quickly entering uncharted waters it is not at all clear that any one candidate has viable solutions for the breadth and complexity of the challenges ahead while these issues remain unresolved industry should expect that the politics around us production of all fuels permitting processes the evolving us

the start of the new year has seen a drastic switch in focus from trade wars to possibly a us iran war the focus for the week ahead was supposed to be the leaking of the details of the phase one trade deal but that will not be the case financial markets will now closely follow the tit for tat response following the us airstrike in iraq that killed iran s top commander iran s response is likely to be strong but not necessarily swift as iranians re evaluate their strategy iran is convinced the killing of qasem soleimani was an act of war and we should not be surprised if we see a limited military confrontation over the upcoming weeks risk aversion could also remain the overall theme next week as we could see markets become disappointed with the lack of substance in the 86 page phase one agreement prior to the january 15th signing we should start to see leaks of part of the agreement usd the dollar could continue to benefit on safe haven demand as tensions escalate in the middle east safe havens could see further gains next week because the us is sending more troops in preparation of a potential military confrontation the falling dollar call that markets were embracing for the first quarter will likely take a break here oil general qassim soleimani oil prices spiked alongside gold as tensions are approaching a critical level between us and iran the trump administration strike was a strong retaliation to the attack on the us embassy in iraq by pro iranian militiamen financial markets are now awaiting iran s response which will likely have a wide reaching impact on all asset classes iran may choose to target americans abroad cyber attacks along with further uprisings in the regions that will see us troops on heightened alert in iraq yemen syria and the israeli lebanese border oil volatility will remain intense and we could see swings in both directions as investors will likely push prices higher on actions that yield supply disruptions or increased military conflict expectations if iran initially targets allies to the america or cyber attacks we could see oil prices somewhat soften gold investors have not priced in the chance of a full blown out war in the middle east and gold will remain the favorite safe haven trade other safe havens such as the dollar and yen will benefit from the developments in the middle east but gold will remain king gold prices could easily take out last year s high and make a run towards 1 600 an ounce over the course of this month bitcoin bitcoin could benefit from heightened tensions in the middle east the digital coin has outperformed oil and gold following the us airstrike that killed a top iranian commander we could see investors temporarily put concerns aside that tighter restrictions from the chinese and us will weigh on the crypto space bitcoin could see further bullish momentum on expectations demand will greatly increase in the middle east uk nothing has changed over the festive period the uk is still on course to leave the eu at the end of january with only a few days of scrutiny over the withdrawal bill next week standing in the way the pound has managed to hold onto much of its election gains although it remains a little off the highs given boris johnson s recently earned majority in the house of commons i can t imagine he ll suffer any major setbacks next week after which attention will shift to 11 months of trade negotiations and the direction of travel of the bank of england under the leadership of andrew bailey who replaces mark carney on 16 march risk barring any bizarre surprises next week the near future should be far less turbulent that we ve become accustomed to of course no deal wto brexit remains on the table at the end of next year so in effect we just have a new deadline cny the chinese yuan could decline on disappointment with the details with the phase one trade deal and on further escalation in tensions between the us and iran the yuan was expected to continue to strengthen on an extended pause in trade tensions between the world s two largest economies chances of any progress on a phase two deal seem to be closer to slim to none turkey a relatively quiet week in store for turkey with only a couple of pieces of low tier data due out 2019 was a bounceback year for turkey with the central bank under the leadership of murat uysal following the removal of governor murat cetinkaya in july cutting interest rates by 12 in five months to 12 in a bid to lift the economy out of recession the plan worked although there remains questions around the independence of the central bank considering the actions of erdogan in removing the governor and his past views on interest rates the currency is holding up for now though although risks remain risk this is a currency that s prone to rapid devaluations especially at a time when the central bank is cutting interest rates aggressively despite warnings about the impact such a move will have on the currency so far the central bank has been rewarded for ignoring these warnings but that may not last riksbank minutes minutes from 19 december released on wednesday at the meeting the riksbank went against the trend and raised rates by 25 basis points to 0 moving away from negative interest rate policy that some central banks continue to embrace policy makers appear concerned about negative unintended consequences of nirp which makes a move back into negative territory in the near term unlikely they may also not be in any particular rush to hike though either hong kong the quiet period on the protest front looks set to continue into early january the economy continues to implode with tourist bookings over the christmas period reportedly down 53 from a year ago it could only be a matter of time before clashes break out between normal hongkongers who ve been affected by the economic downturn and the protestors the unemployment rate rose to a 2 1 2 year high this month and retail sales fell 24 in october and are expected to fall more than 25 last month data due on january 3 the us china trade truce might offer a chance for the economy to rebound a touch the major events in january will be unemployment on the 20th cpi on the 21st and the lunar new year holidays on the last weekend risk as always there is the risk that protests escalate and turn violent again which would be negative for the hk33 index and could push usd hkd back to the upper half of the trading band china nothing much to report now that the phase 1 trade deal is agreed in principle barring any unforeseen setbacks expectations are that it will be ratified signed in the second half on january pmi numbers were steady in december and next week we have only ppi and cpi to expect cpi is currently running at a near eight year high due to higher food prices especially pork following the decimation of herds due to swine fever throughout this year the pboc has trimmed its reserve requirement ratio by 50 bps effective jan 6 which is expected to free up about 115 billion in funds which could give the economy a lift as we kick off 2020 risk any back tracking on the phase

underperformed against its other emerging market currencies risk the rbi may ease up their efforts in supporting the economy but they should remain committed to preventing a sharp appreciation with

barring any sudden downturn in economic data wildfires raging in new south wales could hit economic activity for q4 and beyond not forgetting the budget pressures risk any downside misses on the data

thirty years ago the world saw the indian and chinese economies as being comparable both were considered engines of global growth today the view looks different china s gdp and per capita income are nearly five times those of india meanwhile india s economic engine is sputtering gdp growth today is the lowest it has been in six years in order to prevent the situation from worsening the modi government should pay undivided attention to getting growth back on track says duvvuri subbarao former governor of the reserve bank of india and a research fellow at the center for advanced study of india casi at the university of pennsylvania he recently gave a talk at penn titled will the indian elephant dance again knowledge at wharton interviewed subbarao about his views on the indian economy and how it can get back on track among other issues an edited transcript of the conversation follows listen to the podcast at the top of this page knowledge at wharton why is the elephant an apt metaphor for the indian economy duvvuri subbarao in development economics parlance the east asian economies taiwan korea singapore hong kong are referred to as the tigers the next generation of fast growing asian economies thailand philippines malaysia indonesia are referred to as the cubs china is called the dragon all these countries delivered a growth miracle in the last 40 years the first off the block were the east asian tigers which moved from poverty to prosperous societies in just one generation even as they defied the washington consensus and adopted a model of state led capitalism china accomplished an astonishing feat in the history of development economics growing on an average at double digit pace for about three decades on a trot the next growth miracle hopefully will be from india india is referred to as an elephant because it is a strong animal with enormous potential but it moves at a lumbering pace the hope is that it will start dancing and deliver the next growth miracle knowledge at wharton why hasn t it been dancing so far subbarao growth in india has slumped to 5 or in fact less than 5 on an annualized basis causing a lot of anxiety both to the government and to all of us indians growth has declined sharply because all growth drivers have petered out growth comes from private consumption government consumption investment and net exports the investment driver petered out some years ago our net exports are actually deducting from growth they used to contribute positively to growth but they re not doing so anymore over the last five years the single growth driver has been consumption both government and private government is unable to expand spending further because of fiscal constraints private consumption has slumped because credit is being choked and households have run down their savings the net result is that not only is the elephant not dancing it s barely able to walk knowledge at wharton could you put india s growth trajectory during the past 20 years into perspective what major factors since 2000 have brought the economy to where it stands today growth has slumped because all growth drivers have petered out subbarao that perspective is important twenty years ago a remarkable confluence of circumstances generated and strengthened the view that india had arrived there was a structural upturn in the economy triggered by an unprecedented investment boom accompanied by an unprecedented credit boom huge investments were made into production and into infrastructure investment as a proportion of gdp went as high as 38 the india growth story started unfolding in the five years before the global financial crisis we clocked 8 5 to 9 annual growth on average we weathered the global financial crisis reasonably well and came out of the crisis sooner than most emerging economies things started unraveling around 2010 when many projects got delayed investments soured bad loans mounted the financial sector came under stress in popular perception this reversal in prospects is associated with crony capitalism while there certainly was a bit of that it will be misleading to attribute the entire downturn to crony capitalism there were several other factors at play for example much of this investment went into infrastructure which was an uncharted territory both for the corporates investing and for the banks lending to them the projects were based on demand projections far into the future assuming a high growth scenario which was simply unrealistic then there were delays in projects because of delays in clearances and permissions court orders cancelling some government decisions added to the delays as a result of all these factors the investment engine switched off with investment and net exports not contributing substantially to gdp growth during prime minister modi s first term in office the economy was firing on a single engine the engine of consumption but even that consumption engine has now petered out with the result that growth has declined sharply to 5 knowledge at wharton people often compare india and china why didn t india follow the path blazed by china as was widely expected subbarao if you go back 30 years india and china were roughly at par whether you compare by per capita income in terms of ppp or by current market prices starting 1990 china zoomed whereas india just lumbered along today china s gdp is five times that of india china s per capita income is nearly five times india s per capita income the number of poor people china lifted out of poverty in the last three decades is unprecedented in human history whereas india still has hundreds of millions of poor people china is a middle middle income country india is a low middle income country china s fear is that it will get locked into a middle income trap india s fear is that it will get locked into a low income trap growth in both india and china was driven by investment but china s investment boom continued whereas india s investments petered out of course when you compare india and china you should not ignore other vital differences between the two giant economies china is an authoritative regime india is a democracy china produced and exported with not much of the benefit ploughed back into domestic consumption whereas india produced and passed on the benefits to the domestic economy which boosted consumption especially of the poorer sections of society they were different growth models knowledge at wharton do you think india can replicate the chinese model of export led growth subbarao i do hope so but it ll be difficult prime minister modi has talked about engineering a manufacturing revolution in india because we need to create jobs hundreds of millions of jobs we need not just growth but job intensive growth towards that endeavour we need to engineer a manufacturing revolution because only the manufacturing sector can generate jobs of the type and in the numbers we want sure we need to maximize exports as well but whether we can be an export powerhouse like china is a different proposition there are important differences between 1990 when china started its export drive and 2019 when india wants to be an export powerhouse the original sin of not implementing reforms has caught up with us and the economy is down to 5 growth in 1990 globalization was seen as a benign phenomenon improving welfare in rich countries and in poor countries today there s a backlash against globalization it s viewed as a disruptive force that destroys jobs and erodes welfare in 1990 world demand was expanding at a scorching pace today world demand is subdued and is unlikely to revive to the pre crisis levels because of what is termed secular stagnation in the 1990s global value chains were becoming the cornerstone of manufacturing today the global value chain model is eroding because of advances in machine learning artificial intelligence and robotics because of all these headwinds today as compared to the 1990s it will be difficult for india to replicate the china model of export led growth knowledge at wharton when the first modi administration took office in 2014 it inherited a structural downturn whose roots go back to 2010 since the modi government enjoyed widespread business support hopes were high that the economy would forge ahead but that didn t happen why did the process of economic reform stall subbarao i wish i had a credible answer it is true that there was a lot of business support for prime minister modi when he first came into office nearly six years ago in fact in 2014 modi campaigned mainly on an economic platform that he would create jobs and revive investment there were high hopes and expectations that he would plunge headlong into implementing structural reforms to redeem these campaign promises that required political capital and he had plenty of that arguably he had more political capital than any other recent prime minister he had a rock solid majority in the parliament more than two third of the states accounting for over 80 of india s gdp were controlled by the bjp his party regardless modi seemed disinclined to invest his enormous political capital to implement the politically difficult reforms sure some important reforms got under way during his first term such as the implementation of a nation wide gst goods and services tax the enactment of the bankruptcy code and the inflation targeting framework of the reserve bank but he initiated none of these reforms these were all initiatives that he inherited it s happenstance that they culminated on his watch on his own modi did not initiate any notable fresh economic reform early in his first term he attempted land acquisition reform but when there was a backlash he quickly gave up modi somehow seemed to have succumbed to the mistaken belief that the economy will run on autopilot without any policy intervention the original sin of not implementing reforms has now caught up with us and output growth is down to 5 knowledge at wharton since you are a former governor of the reserve bank of india what is your view of the demonetization exercise that the government undertook in 2016 what are the reasons that prompted it and what impact has it had on the indian economy subbarao according to the government there were several objectives behind demonetization it was to attack black money it was to attack counterfeiting of currency and financing of terrorism it was also to shift the economy from a cash intensive to a cash light mode whether something as draconian as demonetization was necessary to achieve any of these objectives is questionable even allowing for the benefit of the doubt only the first objective of attacking black money justifies something as extreme as demonetization but even there the justification is weak the argument is that people who hoarded black money wouldn t be so stupid as to retain it in the form of cash they d have already converted it into gold jewelry real estate or moved it into swiss bank accounts looking back now that the dust has settled the economy paid a heavy price hundreds of millions of low income households who operate in the informal sector where transactions are almost entirely in cash suffered enormous losses many of them lost jobs even their livelihood the economy lost up to 1 5 percentage points of growth will be difficult for india to replicate the china model of export led growth it s not clear that the objectives have been realized all of the rs 15 trillion 211 billion of cash that was demonetized had come back into the banking system on the face of it no black money has been unearthed undaunted the government claims that there will be long term sustainable benefits how will they materialize they will materialize through for example the tax gdp ratio going up on a structural basis because of the fear of getting caught it will materialize through a decline in corruption which will improve the ease of doing business drive investment up which in turn will boost growth these are hard to measure benefits and in any case will take time to materialize knowledge at wharton what are the biggest risks the indian economy faces at present if you were the rbi governor today what advice would you give the modi government about how to turn the economy around subbarao the biggest risk i think is that india will slip into a new hindu rate of growth get locked into a low growth spiral that s possible but not probable and certainly not inevitable india has the potential to grow faster indeed significantly faster to realize that potential we need to raise investment and implement policies to improve the productivity of investment and in order to convert faster growth into poverty reduction we need to address agricultural distress create jobs improve outcomes in education and health and deepen the skill endowment as much as the objectives are clear the agenda too is clear structural reforms addressing the real sectors of the economy and governance reforms to improve the ease of doing business what advice would i give the modi government i am sure the prime minister is not handicapped by lack of advice for sure he is getting a lot of advice and very competent advice at that anyway since you asked should i have the opportunity i will tell the prime minister it s the economy sir what prime minister modi should do in my view is to wholeheartedly embrace responsibility for reviving the economy he should make an unequivocal statement that repairing the economy putting it on track to a five trillion output as quickly as possible will be his single point agenda and will receive his undivided attention to the exclusion of all other social and political concerns to be credible on that he should back up that statement with an action plan and a roadmap with clear milestones and measurable outcomes knowledge at wharton india s financial sector both the shadow banking sector as well as the mainstream banks is in trouble what needs to be done to turn that around subbarao you are right the financial sector both the banking sector and the shadow bank sector what we in india call the non bank finance company nbfc sector are deeply stressed the banking sector stress is a result past investments having soured for the reasons that we discussed earlier the mechanisms for recovery were feeble and in any case banks were reluctant to enforce even those feeble mechanisms because a perverse system of incentives was at play the system of rewards and penalties was such that there was an incentive in not recognizing a bad loan and instead to camouflage it by evergreening it as a result the bad loan problem grew in size festered and eventually became explosive structural reforms addressing the real sectors of the economy and governance reforms to improve the ease of doing business the problem on the nbfc side roughly paralleled that in the banking sector the loan default by the umbrella infrastructure finance company il fs last year had a huge knock on impact on the entire nonbank finance sector note that with banks in distress it was the non bank sector that was lending for consumption which in turn was fuelling growth but with the nbfc sector coming under distress too the credit channel got choked consumption slowed and growth slumped it s now become common parlance to describe india s financial sector problem as the triple balance sheet problem the balance sheets of banks of non banks and of the corporates are all in distress and need to be repaired the task is clear and so is the action plan public sector banks need to be capitalized given its fiscal constraints the government simply does not have the resources to capitalize to the full extent necessary it s time to stop treating public sector banks as holy cows and own up to the fact that at least some public sector banks need to be privatized on the nbfc side those that are not just illiquid but insolvent should be allowed to die under the bankruptcy process and finally now that the ambiguities in the bankruptcy code have been resolved the process must be expedited so that confidence revives and new investments come on stream knowledge at wharton has the integrity of institutions like the reserve bank of india been compromised because of political and economic pressures if so what can be done subbarao that question defies a binary yes or no answer although your question is about institutions in general let me talk about the reserve bank because i m familiar with the rbi at the end of 2018 there was an acrimonious spat between the government and the reserve bank of india that played out in the public domain for several weeks differences or even spats between governments and central banks are neither unique to india nor are they new there was a spat here in the in the u s with president trump tweeting that the fed had gone crazy there were similar spats between governments and central banks in turkey in europe and in japan so what happened in india was not unique such spats are not new either there were differences between the government and the rbi before me during my time and after my time what was different this time around was that the differences played out in the public domain and they got politicized all of that is behind us now and things seem to have settled into a new equilibrium modi should make an unequivocal statement that repairing the economy will be his single point agenda and will receive his undivided attention for the long term i think it s important for the government to recognize the significance of the autonomy of the central bank and respect that and it s equally important for the central bank to recognize the limits of its autonomy after all why is it that a central bank should be autonomous let me spend a minute on that around the world central banks are accorded a certain amount of autonomy because it is believed that an autonomous central bank is necessary for sound macroeconomic management preserving macroeconomic stability which is a necessary condition for sustained growth requires taking a long term view of the economy and taking decisions that might run counter to short term compulsions such decisions might inflict pain in the short term but they deliver long term gains you cannot leave such decisions to politicians who typically have a short term outlook driven by electoral cycles mind you here i am talking about all countries not just india everywhere especially in democracies politicians tend to compromise long term sustainability for short term gains it is to manage these horizon differences that it s important to have an apolitical central bank with autonomy and with a mandate to take a long term view of the economy going forward in india i think it s important to institutionalize a code of conduct both for the government and the rbi with regard to autonomy government is sovereign and there are obvious limits to the central bank s autonomy the government on its part should realize that its job is only to set the mandate but not to tell the rbi how to deliver on that mandate rbi on its part should realize that it is limited by the mandate set by the government in other words that it has no goal independence but only instrument independence and that i think will be a goldilocks relationship knowledge at wharton you were the governor of the rbi from 2008 to 2013 it was a very critical period when the global financial crisis ravaged the world economy you even wrote a book about leading the rbi through five turbulent years what challenges did you face leading the rbi during that time how did you deal with those challenges and what lessons can others learn from your experience subbarao i went in as governor of the rbi on september 5 2008 on the 7th fannie and freddie went into conservatorship on the 8th countrywide financial went down on the 10th aig came to the brink of a meltdown on the 13th merrill lynch vanished and on the 16th the big bang lehman brothers collapsed the global financial sector came to a near death experience the global economy plunged into the biggest and deepest downturn since the great depression of the 1930s virtually every country in the world was affected by the crisis and so was india but in india there was dismay disbelief and denial that we could be affected by the crisis the story going around was that this new governor came and he brought on the crisis i had no option but to go along with that wherever i went within the country or outside people used to ask me why is india affected by the crisis and when we will get out of it my stump answer was since you say i brought on the crisis to india that the crisis started with me it will end only when my term is over and for good measure i used to tell them when my term would end but here s the thing the week after i left the reserve bank the crisis ended growth started going up inflation started going down the rupee stabilized if there was one prophecy i wanted to be wrong on it was this it was baptism by fire for me regarding your question about leadership the crisis threw up lots of leadership lessons but i will talk about just one which is how important it is for a leader to have credibility when i went in as governor i was an unknown civil servant who suddenly became governor in other words i abruptly shifted from being an unknown unknown to a known unknown but the governor has to be a known quantity the markets and other stakeholders need to be able to interpret the governor s style and stance and understand his nuance and body language this process inevitably takes time but such time was denied to me there was a lot of anxiety in the markets about whether i a greenhorn governor could manage the crisis the markets did not have confidence in me that was bad enough but what compounded matters was that i had no credibility there was this view that i was sent into the reserve bank by the government to act at the government s bidding that i would compromise the reserve bank s autonomy to implement government instructions credibility is not given to you on a platter you have to earn it all these doubts and suspicions swirled in a time of crisis when governments and central banks had to work together everywhere around the world governments and central banks were working together and in close coordination here in the u s in the u k and in europe japan and china but in india when the government and the reserve bank were working together it was interpreted as my taking instructions from the government and in the process compromising the reserve bank s autonomy the sum and substance of all this was that circumstances conspired against me to deny me the credibility required of a leader and that in turn threatened to erode my effectiveness the lesson from my crisis experience is that to be effective a leader needs to have credibility and credibility is not given to you on a platter you have to earn it knowledge at wharton how did you earn it subbarao well you must go through the slog in a situation like mine i couldn t have earned credibility simply by declaring that that i am independent that i will preserve and protect the autonomy of the reserve bank of india and that i will not succumb to pressures credibility has to be earned not through words but through actions and behaviour and that inevitably takes time i can say with some satisfaction that when i look back on my record i believe i have earned a reasonable reputation for standing for the autonomy of the reserve bank of india and that i believe came through an evaluation of my actions knowledge at wharton there has been a lot of discussion these days about central banks launching their own digital currencies do you think this is a good idea subbarao i m not sure there is a clear cut answer as of now opinion is divided money as we know has three functions it s a unit of account a medium of exchange and a store of value money issued by central banks which is the norm around the world performs all these three functions such money is uncontested legal tender technological advances over the last 10 to 15 years have made possible crypto currencies bitcoin was the first into the market but now there are possibly 50 to 60 crypto currencies what is common to all of them is the underlying block chain technology and a decentralized management none of them is obviously legal tender in other words one can refuse to transact in them a central bank digital currency cbdc is a different proposition different from these commercial crypto currencies because a cbdc will be able to perform like money it will be able to perform all the three functions of money that i listed above it will be like traditional money except that it will be in a digital form the main advantage will be that a cbdc will make payment systems more efficient for example at present if i have to transfer money to you we need the intermediation of a commercial bank but if there was a cbdc you and i could transact directly through our central bank accounts it is also argued that a cbdc will make monetary policy transmission more efficient especially in a situation of negative interest rates which is now the case in some rich countries on the other hand a cbdc is not costless for example if there was a cbdc it s possible that commercial banks might be undermined commercial banks after all perform an important function of financial intermediation that might be undermined also the central bank might expose itself to credit risk and should that risk materialize the cost will be borne by taxpayers so it s not as if a central bank digital currency is unambiguously good let me also add that it s not as if central banks currently don t issue digital currencies they do but they issue them only to commercial banks so the question is how do they expand the realm of cbdcs open up cbdcs first to nonbank financial companies then to nonbank nonfinancial companies and eventually to ordinary people like you and me can that be managed is it necessary at all what implications will it have these are all important questions without clear answers as yet i think central banks are now in a wait and watch mode they want to understand the full implications and have a better understanding of the costs and benefits before moving forward but some central banks like in sweden and china are going forward at a rapid pace knowledge at wharton if india were to try and launch a digital currency how would it be done there and how might that process differ from the way it could be done in say a developed economy like the u s subbarao i heard the governor of the reserve bank of india recently comment on whether the reserve bank will issue a digital currency he said that they re watching the situation he didn t close the option but he did not also say that the rbi is going to adopt a cbdc soon india s main motivation for launching a cbdc would be to promote financial inclusion technology has been the main force behind the deepening of financial inclusion in india over the last 10 years and a cbdc can potentially help accelerate and deepen the financial inclusion to your second question about how it might differ from a digital currency issued by the federal reserve i m thinking on my feet now you ve got to recognize that the dollar is the dominant reserve currency today if the federal reserve were to issue a digital currency it will very soon become the currency for the international payment system whereas a digital currency issued by the reserve bank of india will not enjoy that status knowledge at wharton to end with the question with which we began when will the indian elephant start dancing again subbarao i hope it will start dancing soon the elephant you must recognize is a strong animal and has great potential once it starts dancing it can go on and on for a long time

by kate duguid new york reuters investors rushed into safe haven assets on friday after u s air strikes in iraq killed a senior iranian military official sending the japanese yen to a three month high while the u s dollar index was knocked by the weakest domestic factory activity in a decade in addition to the yen u s treasuries german bunds and gold rallied after the overnight air strike in baghdad killed qassem soleimani tehran s most prominent military commander and the architect of its growing military influence in the middle east overall geopolitical risk premia have risen substantially overnight said karl schamotta chief market strategist at cambridge global payments investors were really looking for safe havens and a port in the storm he added the japanese yen had risen as high as 107 82 per dollar and was last up 0 48 on the day at 108 04 the yen is often seen as a haven from risk given japan s status as the world s largest creditor nation a holiday in tokyo also made for thin conditions exaggerating the move the u s dollar index initially benefited from the move into safe haven assets but those gains were erased after the institute for supply management ism reported that the manufacturing sector contracted significantly in december it was last up 0 03 on the day at 96 873 the attack sparked concerns about crude supply disruptions lifting oil prices more than 3 petrocurrencies gained slightly on the higher crude prices but those were then largely offset by the overall move away from risk said schamotta the u s manufacturing sector contracted in december by the most in more than a decade with order volumes crashing to a near 11 year low and factory employment falling for a fifth straight month according to a report from ism released on friday that is a depressing number said schamotta it suggests trade war related uncertainty has actually damaged the manufacturing sector on a sustained basis and that points to weakness in gdp particularly in the coming quarter because what you re likely to see is an inventory drawdown as opposed to continued build story continues the longer term effects on the dollar are unclear though it weakened friday the greenback may ultimately benefit if slower u s manufacturing dents hopes for global growth in 2020 the idea that other countries that are large exporters to the u s might see a large rebound in the near term that idea is losing traction here said schamotta reporting by kate duguid and olga cotaga editing by dan grebler and tom brown
january 03 2020 04 04 pm updated 04 04 pm ist jayati ghosh professor of economics at jawaharlal nehru university jnu in new delhi is one of the world s leading development economists a fierce critic of the near universal obsession with fiscal discipline ghosh believes that india cannot revive its economy without increasing public spending in an exclusive chat with the magazine she spoke about among other things the looming global recession the situation at jnu and what s in store for the next generation of indians edited excerpts tell us something about your childhood i was born in bangkok my father an economist who worked for the government was posted there for a few months my mother was expecting but she went along with him but they came back to delhi which is where i grew up for the most part what about college i went to miranda house where i did sociology i was interested in understanding social processes but the more i did sociology the more i realised that it s just the surface that it is the economy that s really shaping social processes so i decided to study economics i had to learn mathematics over the summer holidays the entrance exam at jnu at the time was such that you didn t need an earlier degree in economics to enrol in an ma course there after the m a after my ma in economics from jnu i did my ph d from cambridge i stayed on in cambridge as a research fellow for a couple of years working on issues of external debt in developing countries then i realised that i couldn t stay in england it s wonderful when you are a student it s international there are lots of students from all over the world and you are a community it s when you start working that you realise that this is not where you should be so i came back and worked briefly with the planning commission before i got this dream job at jnu you ve been at jnu a long time how would you describe what s happening to it today jnu is one of the best universities not just in india or asia but possibly the world it has an amazing combination of good faculty bright students and diverse students this is a very special characteristic because it isn t just geographical diversity or gender diversity but also caste class and ethnicity and the obc reservations have made it even more diverse such an institution especially in the social sciences gives you a much greater richness of conversation in the classroom and outside i ve seen that many of the students when they come in are reticent they don t participate in discussions once they ve been here two three years they become totally confident and articulate a whole lot of awakening not just political but also social happens and an institution that does this is very special but this is precisely what is being sought to be destroyed now the recent move to increase fees would force nearly half the students to leave it would not only be a terrible blow to their prospects and those of other less well off students in the future but also damage the diversity that makes for much better scholarship international agencies have predicted a global recession in 2020 will india be badly affected or somewhat insulated the prognostication of a global recession is something i share unless something radical is done and i don t see that happening we are on the verge of a significant crisis we are already seeing all kinds of skittishness in global financial markets and there is a downslide in investment everywhere well before the global slowdown we had several internal problems falling investment rates falling employment falling consumption all bad indicators domestically now you add to that worsening exports and capital moving out and not just foreign capital we now have data showing that domestic residents are sending huge amounts of money abroad thanks to the liberalised remittance scheme in the latest quarter it was 20 of inward remittances there s been so much debate on whether the slowdown is cyclical or structural what s your take this is a foolish debate cyclical would mean that growth will go up and then down and then up again but it is not automatic if it goes down and nothing happens to make it go up again it will stay down then will you call it cyclical or structural these terms are being misused what s happening is that we are going through a downswing and this downswing is reflecting a lack of demand in the system workers don t have jobs farmers don t have income so they can t buy so eventually even the formal sector is hit what would you suggest to resolve the demand problem the government has to step in and create demand this is basic economics increase your mgnrega spend more on infrastructure put more income in the hands of farmers they will buy more they will spend the money that will have a positive multiplier effect it will generate more income more production more employment more investment and all that but for some reason the government is doing the opposite not only is it not spending more it is spending less it has to be mindful of its fiscal deficit target right this whole fiscal deficit business first of all it s a big lie it s much larger than they claim it is the government doesn t pay the public sector enterprises take the food corporation of india fci for instance every year the fci is supposed to get a subsidy to cover its losses suppose they don t give it enough and then they can t cover their losses how do they manage they take on debt so every year for the last 11 years p chidambaram started it the fci was not being paid its dues so it takes on debt on which it has to pay interest but this is off the central government budget the cag has calculated that if you added allthis other spending that the government has done then your fiscal deficit is close to 5 not the 3 3 or whatever it is that they are claiming the claims may be untrue but what s wrong in maintaining fiscal discipline why are we so terrified of a fiscal deficit because people think it will create inflation or a balance of payments crisis or both right now clearly it has not created inflation because the fiscal deficit is much larger than they claim it is and it hasn t been inflationary in any case 3 3 is not some gold standard that you have to meet the balance of payments deficit is happening for other reasons because our exports are a disaster not because our imports have shot up so the reasons why you would be scared of a fiscal deficit don t exist in a downswing when you have unemployment when you have unutilised capacity if you spend more it is not inflationary rather it increases economic activity so i don t know why they are unable to do this is it to do with the bond markets the bond market is why they lie about the actual fiscal deficit too but if you want to do that you can still do that you can keep on lying and also create special purpose vehicles that will do public investments for you you don t have to do it yourself you got a windfall from the rbi spend the money increase public services it would generate employment but no what do you do instead you give tax breaks to big corporates many people have said that the tax breaks will boost investor sentiment and thus help attract fdi helping india use the opportunities created by the us china trade war why does a company go into a country it s because they anticipate profits now if you are otherwise not competitive if you have terrible infrastructure your ports are clogged your electricity doesn t work half the time and you therefore need expensive power backup your workers are not trained in the way we want and are not fed properly or housed properly as a result of which their productivity is not great why would they come here in other words taxes are one of the factors but a number of studies have shown that taxes are like no 17 on the list of factors that firms consider when deciding where to invest so when companies say they invest in say ireland for tax purposes that is just an office with ten people in it it is not real investment the opportunities created by the us china trade war have already been grabbed by the likes of vietnam the philippines and cambodia some fdi from us companies has already moved there it didn t come to india why because we are bad at all the other stuff and how do you fix the other stuff with public investment as an economist how do you differentiate between good gdp growth due to greater production of goods and services such as food and hospitals from bad gdp growth coming from say production of weapons and construction of detention centres for non citizens we don t that s why it is so foolish to be obsessing about the gdp whether its growing at 5 2 or 7 1 or whatever it is meaningless in terms of the welfare of the people even purely material welfare you identified an example of bad gdp let us take the example of delhi we have a terrible polluting congested unliveable system of privatised transport with too many cars instead if we had instituted a clean green ecologically efficient public transport system that was free it would bring down gdp significantly but would offer a much better quality of life for everybody gdp is a bad indicator economists have known this for a while if that is so then what s the alternative i feel we should have an index that is relatively simple and is based on the material standards of the bottom half of the population i d say let s just look at the consumption standards of the bottom 50 i want that to go up by 5 a year that would be a decent goal the world over we are looking at interest rates close to zero if not negative interest rates even the rbi has been steadily cutting rates what does this mean for a common man it s terrible news for the common man because it really means that if you re planning to save for your post retirement income you are going to be a loser big time negative interest rates are a way of attacking the working class over time as opposed to today the reason we are stuck with very low or negative interest rates is because governments the world over refuse to use fiscal policy how is that after the global financial crisis in 2008 the west went in for very low interest rates they think if they have very low interest rates somehow investments will come investors are looking at the difference between the rate of profit and the rate of interest that they have to pay right if the rate of expected profit is coming down then the only way that you will invest is if you keep the rate of interest even lower anyway that s the argument behind low interest rates but if at the same time you had also adopted a fiscal policy by which i mean public spending you would have created economic activity you would have created demand and you would have actually survived even with higher interest rates because expected profits would be higher so it is the neo liberal straitjacket this mindset that you just cannot do fiscal policy that is keeping interest rates low there is this blind obsession that we can only do monetary policy put lots of money in the system keep interest rates low and hope that things will recover the logical culmination of this approach is negative interest rates but that s not a solution what happens to the idea of saving when there is a very low or negative interest rate because then your savings wither away right yep the very fact that this policy can become mainstream is a comment on how all economic analyses in our media are so heavily biased in favour of the upper class because who would really like negative interest rates finance walas they use the money to play around with all these other things that they make us invest in what other things increasingly people are being pushed away from bank deposits they are being told why don t you put your money in a mutual fund put it in an investment programme that will generate money over time it s a combination of debt assets and equity assets and all kinds of fancy things that you won t understand you will get monthly statements that are so incomprehensible you won t even know if you are losing money and if you do make money much of it will be taken away by brokers as commissions and fees given the rise of automation in a big way is job creation as a policy goal even feasible anymore since we don t need so much labour should we then think of an alternative policy approach such as ubi such as ubi look there was a time when we used runners to send information across now we just send an email or make a phone call throughout history technology has displaced labour it s just that new activities are created the problem today the misfortune globally is that the fourth industrial revolution is happening at the time of neo liberalism where this whole obsession with austerity means the government does not intervene to create jobs and therefore we leave it to the market to create jobs the market always goes for the most profitable and the most profitable have always been the businesses with the least labour involved this is not new it is much better to hire a machine because they don t talk back at you they don t ask for higher wages they don t combine and form a union technological progress doesn t necessarily mean an aggregate jobs fall because it all depends on whether there is enough spending to create demand for labour intensive activities you want the state to keep coming up with new labour intensive activities the economist wiliam baumol has pointed out that there is a whole bunch of service sector activities where there is no concept of labour productivity increase for instance you need exactly the same number of people to play a beethoven symphony you can t say i am going to be more productive and do it with half the number of musicians similarly there are several other service sector activities that are fundamentally relational care activcities need a human being the human being can be assisted by machines but you need the human being so if you need less and less human beings to do the boring work i would say that is wonderful because in an ideal society you could have a much shorter working day and everybody could have much more time for creative activities care activities relational activities and entertainment all of these are hugely employment intensive if you go to a restaurant it s better to have more waiters than less in a hospital it s better to have more nurses than less it s better to have more artists performers and musicians than less it s because we have progressively lost our imagination that we think we can only do the boring office work and now machines can do our boring office work we have been so ground down by neo liberal capitalism that we can t even think beyond this why is it that even in europe where unions have traditionally been powerful they are unable to challenge austerity do they in fact see some merit in austerity i wouldn t say they see any merit in austerity measures i think we underestimate the lethal combination of finance and lobbying power and their ability to control politics we can see this in our own country there are too many cases of turkeys voting for christmas people keep voting for things that are actually against their best interests also the media keeps presenting things relentlessly in a certain way this whole idea that public spending is bad but tax cuts are good there is no rationale there but the media onslaught is relentless and the media is controlled by the corporations we cannot underestimate their ability to influence public discussions and debate either in the global north or in countries like india is there a schism in india between manufacturing capital and finance capital are they at loggerheads over what they want from government policy about 15 years ago i would have said yes but today all the smart ones in manufacturing have created a finance company as well they have diversified into other things the distinction today is between large capital and small medium investment small and medium first of all cannot diversify they are just trying to make a living out of making a particular thing and they ve really been messed around with large capital can play around can diversify can lobby can influence policy influence media and pretty much get what it wants but it s the small and medium who are the main job creators and this is the big divide at the moment describe the modi government s policy orientation in one line extreme crony capitalism but you can be very friendly to certain crony capitalists and also do a lot for small and medium enterprises isn t the government doing that not at all there is a lot of pr such as mudra loans for instance they are a good idea but when you look at the actual loan amounts they are pathetic most of them are in the under 50 000 category what can you do with 50 000 as for medium enterprises they were smacked by demonetisation they were smacked by gst and now they are being smacked by tax inspectors they are facing an extremely adverse environment and that too in a scenario of declining demand so i would say this government is the opposite of small investor friendly what do you think life is going to be like for the next generation of indians i worry about this a lot because i have a daughter who is just beginning her life i think we are headed for a demographic disaster but everyone keeps talking about a demographic dividend demographic dividend refers to a scenario when you have lots of people of working age but what do you call it when you have lots of people of working age and no jobs that s why it s a disaster because you then get a massive increase in social and political instability you may paper over it or even make it work for you politically for a while by diverting them into loving cows loving mother india lynching people and all that you can do this for a while but eventually you lose control of it so we could be heading towards very serious anarchy there could be a general breakdown of civic order the more you try to unify a country like india through a very top down kind of structure the more the chances of a breakdown this is my pessimistic vision and your optimistic one my teacher joan robinson used to say anything you say about india the opposite is also true every time i feel depressed about india i also remember that we have amazing resilience amazing courage not just individual but community courage i have or i used to have this faith that indian society being so complex doesn t go for extremes easily i don t think that there is any such thing as one indian who is tolerant and secular and all that but the extraordinary multiplicity among indians is irrepressible this absence of homogeneity is something that you cannot do away with easily and that is a massive strength i see two pianos here you play yes i used to the older one has died so i bought the other one recently how did you get interested in the piano i started playing the piano when we were in the u s my father was a great lover of western classical music he decided that we should learn an instrument so my sister was put on the piano and i was put on the violin one day he discovered that one of the best violin teachers in washington d c he used to train people for the washington symphony orchestra and so on lived nearby he went to him and said you have to teach my daughter the violin master replied that he only taught advanced students and naturally my loving father said yes yes my daughter is very advanced so i went along i was seven years old i was a disaster and the poor man he had said he would take me on so he had to one day he got so fed up with how terribly i was playing that he grabbed the violin and hit me on the head with it his building was across the road from our home so i walked back crying i arrive home my father opens the door and sees me standing there violin in hand bawling he asked what had happened i said the teacher had hit me on the head with the violin my father unfazed said never mind we ll find you an instrument you can t be attacked with that s how i got to learn the piano sampath g thehindu co in
the world has lost a great warrior for price stability paul volcker led a determined campaign to restrain double digit inflation as the u s federal reserve s chair in the 1980s and exerted a powerful influence over u s economic policy for decades to follow just a couple of years ago when he was nearly 90 he grilled me on the inflationary potential of abenomics prime minister shinzo abe s economic reform strategy i was an adviser on formulating the strategy but despite volcker s praiseworthy achievements it is worth considering the relevance of his approach in today s low inflation environment in 1936 when john maynard keynes published the general theory of employment interest and money global price movements were sluggish assuming that below zero inflation would remain relatively rigid and basing inflation expectations on past outcomes keynes prescribed large scale fiscal expenditure this helped countries to escape from the deflation of the great depression but after world war ii erupted in 1939 inflation surged in many countries including greece hungary and the philippines in the united states inflation reached double digit rates in 1942 and 1947 when volcker became fed chair in august 1979 u s inflation was again at double digit levels 11 35 percent and rising to rein it in and stabilize the wider global economy the fed hiked interest rates despite the backlash from some u s industries when he left his post in 1987 the inflation rate was below 4 percent its peak since then is 5 4 percent in 1990

the us economy and financial system including being able to maintain and fund the gargantuan trade deficits and fiscal deficits has become reliant on the dollar being the dominant global reserve currency and the imf just released its next installment on how this status has been changing total foreign exchange reserves in all currencies combined declined 0 6 in the third quarter from the second quarter to 11 66 trillion according to the imf s quarterly cofer data us dollar denominated exchange reserves such as treasury securities us corporate bonds etc held by foreign central banks ticked down 0 4 to 6 51 trillion but holdings denominated in other currencies fell faster and the share of dollar denominated reserves edged up to 61 8 of total exchange reserves the dollar s status has declined from a share of 66 in 2014 to a share of 61 8 in q3 2019 this data does not include the fed s holdings of dollar denominated assets such as its pile of treasuries or mbs though it includes the fed s holdings of assets denominated in foreign currencies 20 6 billion minuscule compared to its 4 16 trillion in total assets and minuscule compared to china s stash of foreign exchange reserves of 3 1 trillion the data also does not include the assets other central banks hold in their domestic currency the us dollar s share of total global reserve currencies declines when central banks other than the fed proportionately reduce their dollar denominated assets and add assets denominated in other foreign currencies over the long term the recent moves in the dollar s share are relatively small there have been huge moves from 1977 through 1991 when the dollar s share plunged from 85 to 46 and then huge moves as the share rose again to 70 by 2000 euro fails to reach parity with the dollar the creation of the euro came with a lot of hopeful rhetoric that it would reach parity with the us dollar in every way including as global trade currency global financing currency and global reserve currency the euro has been replacing in phases the national currencies of eu member states starting with five currencies including the deutsche mark a major reserve currency at the time but far below the dollar during the initial phase of the conversion of european currencies to the euro the euro s share of global reserve currencies rose and the dollar s share fell from 71 5 in 2001

a country and it was assumed by euro boosters that given the size of the eurozone its currency would reach parity with the dollar and end the dollar hegemony these hopes were trashed by the sovereign debt crisis in the eurozone and the euro s share has since been hovering in the range of 19 to 21 in the third quarter the euro s share of global foreign exchange reserves ticked down to 20 1 where is the chinese renminbi in october 2016 the imf included the chinese renminbi in the currency basket of the special drawing rights sdr and the renminbi became officially a global reserve currency but since then progress of the currency has been exceedingly slow and there are no signs the rmb would dethrone the us dollar anytime soon but it has surpassed the swiss franc the australian dollar and the canadian dollar as its share in the third quarter grew to 2 0 short red line near the very bottom to see what is going on beneath the dollar euro battle it s useful to look at the currencies without the dollar and the euro the chart below shows that the yen s share having surged to 5 6 has pulled away from the other currencies including the rmb and that the pound sterling s share despite the brexit turmoil has held roughly steady the share of other currencies plunged when the rmb was pulled out of that category in 2016 since that time the rmb has increased its share from 1 to 2 surpassing the australian dollar in 2018 and the canadian dollar in 2019 allocated foreign exchange reserves this data is based on data that central banks submit to the imf the imf does not disclose the detailed holdings by individual central banks it only discloses it in aggregate as you see here but not all central banks participate in disclosing to the imf how their foreign exchange reserves are allocated by currency but participation has been rising in 2014 59 of the foreign exchange reserves were allocated to specific currencies by q3 2019 allocated reserves reached nearly 94 of total reserves the relationship between trade deficits and reserve currency status the us dollar is the dominant reserve currency and the us has the largest trade deficit in the world this gave rise to the theory that the us in order to maintain the dollar as dominant global reserve currency must have a large trade deficit but this must have relationship is disproven by the euro and the yen the second and third largest reserve currencies their economies have substantial trade surpluses with the rest of the world but there is a relationship the us dollar s status as the largest reserve currency and the largest international funding currency permits the us to easily fund its trade and fiscal deficits this enabled policies by the us government by governments of other countries and actions by corporate america that have led to the gargantuan dual deficits

the world has lost a great warrior for price stability paul volcker led a determined campaign to restrain double digit inflation as the u s federal reserve s chair in the 1980s and exerted a powerful influence over u s economic policy for decades to follow just a couple of years ago when he was nearly 90 he grilled me on the inflationary potential of abenomics prime minister shinzo abe s economic reform strategy i was an adviser on formulating the strategy but despite volcker s praiseworthy achievements it is worth considering the relevance of his approach in today s low inflation environment in 1936 when john maynard keynes published the general theory of employment interest and money global price movements were sluggish assuming that below zero inflation would remain relatively rigid and basing inflation expectations on past outcomes keynes prescribed large scale fiscal expenditure this helped countries to escape from the deflation of the great depression but after world war ii erupted in 1939 inflation surged in many countries including greece hungary and the philippines in the united states inflation reached double digit rates in 1942 and 1947 when volcker became fed chair in august 1979 u s inflation was again at double digit levels 11 35 percent and rising to rein it in and stabilize the wider global economy the fed hiked interest rates despite the backlash from some u s industries when he left his post in 1987 the inflation rate was below 4 percent its peak since then is 5 4 percent in 1990

the arrival of the new year marks the beginning of a decade of intensifying class struggle and world socialist revolution in the future when learned historians write about the upheavals of the twenty first century they will enumerate all the obvious signs that existed as the 2020s began of the revolutionary storm that was soon to sweep across the globe the scholars with a vast array of facts documents charts web site and social media postings and other forms of valuable digitalized information at their disposal will describe the 2010s as a period characterized by an intractable economic social and political crisis of the world capitalist system they will note that by the beginning of the third decade of the century history had arrived at precisely the situation foreseen theoretically by karl marx at a certain stage of their development the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production or what is but a legal expression for the same thing with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto from forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters then begins an epoch of social revolution with the change of the economic foundation the entire immense superstructure is more or less rapidly transformed what in fact were the principal characteristics of the last ten years the institutionalization of unending military conflict and the growing threat of nuclear world war there was not a single day during the last decade when the united states was not at war military operations not only continued in iraq and afghanistan new interventions were undertaken in syria libya yemen and ukraine even as 2020 is just getting under way the murder of iranian major general qassim suleimani ordered by president donald trump threatens all out war between the united states and iran with incalculable consequences the involvement of an american president in yet another targeted killing followed by bloodthirsty boasting testifies to the far advanced derangement of the entire ruling elite moreover the adoption of a new strategic doctrine in 2018 signaled a vast escalation in the military operations of the united states in his announcement of the new strategy then defense secretary james mattis declared we will continue to prosecute the campaign against terrorists that we are engaged in today but great power competition not terrorism is now the primary focus of u s national security the new doctrine revealed the essential purpose of what had previously been called the war on terror the attempt to maintain the hegemonic position of american imperialism the united states is determined to maintain this position whatever the financial costs and the consequences in terms of human life as the international institute for strategic studies iiss states in its recently released strategic survey for its part the us is not likely voluntarily reluctantly or after some sort of battle to pass any strategic baton to china all the major imperialist powers escalated during the past decade their preparations for world war and nuclear conflict the trillion dollar military budget adopted in 2019 by the trump administration with the support of the democratic party is a war budget germany france the uk and all the imperialist countries are building up their armed forces the targets of imperialism including the ruling elites in russia and china alternate between threats of war and desperate efforts to forge some sort of agreement the institutions developed in the aftermath of world war ii to prevent another global conflict are dysfunctional the strategic survey writes the trends of 2018 19 have all confirmed the atomisation of international society neither balance of power nor international rules based governance serve as ordering principles international institutions have been marginalised the diplomatic routine of meetings continues yet the competing exertions of national efforts too rarely coordinated with others matter more and most often they are erratic in both execution and consequence the end of a global rules based order i e one dependent on the unchallengeable dominance of us imperialism sets into motion a political logic that leads to war as the strategic survey warns law is made and sustained by politics when law cannot settle disputes they are shunted back to the political realm for resolution to understand the realm to which the iiss is referring one must recall clausewitz s famous definition of war as politics by other means and what would a modern world war entail the iiss calls attention to new plans for the use of nuclear weapons meanwhile the us and russia are modernizing their arsenals and changing their doctrines in ways that facilitate their use while the dispute between india and pakistan over kashmir remains a potential flashpoint for the use of nuclear weapons the recklessness bordering on insanity that prevails among policy makers is indicated in the growing conviction that the use of tactical nuclear weapons is a feasible option the iiss writes all that can be said with reasonable certainty is that a limited regional nuclear exchange under some circumstances has severe global environmental effects but under other circumstances the effects could be minimal the movement toward a third world war which would threaten mankind with extinction cannot be halted by humanitarian appeals war arises out of the anarchy of capitalism and the obsolescence of the nation state system therefore it can be stopped only through the global struggle of the working class for socialism the breakdown of democracy the extreme aggravation of class tensions and the dynamic of imperialism are the real sources of the universal breakdown of democratic forms of rule as lenin wrote in the midst of world war i imperialism is the epoch of finance capital and monopolies which introduce everywhere the striving for domination not for freedom whatever the political system the result of these tendencies is everywhere reaction and intensification of antagonisms in this field lenin s analysis is being substantiated in the turn of the ruling elites during the past decade toward authoritarian and fascistic methods of rule the rise to power of such criminal and even psychopathic personalities as narendra modi in india rodrigo duterte in the philippines benjamin netanyahu in israel abdel fattah al sisi in egypt jair bolsonaro in brazil donald trump in the united states and boris johnson in the uk is symptomatic of a systemic crisis of the entire capitalist system seventy five years after the collapse of the third reich fascism is making a comeback in germany the alternative für deutschland which is a haven for neo nazis emerged during the past decade as the main opposition party its rise was facilitated by the grand coalition government a corrupt media and reactionary academics who whitewash with impunity the crimes of hitler s regime similar processes are at work throughout europe where the fascist leaders of the 1930s and 1940s petain in france mussolini in italy horthy in hungary and franco in spain are being remembered with nostalgia the decade saw the resurgence of anti semitic violence and the cultivation of islamophobia and other forms of national chauvinism and racism concentration camps were constructed on the us border with mexico to imprison refugees fleeing from central and south america and in europe and north africa as the frontline of the anti immigrant policy of the eu there is no progressive tendency to be found within the capitalist parties even when confronted with a fascistic president the democratic party refrains from opposition based on the defense of democratic rights employing the methods of a palace coup the democrats seek trump s impeachment only because he in their view has undermined the us campaign against russia and the proxy war in ukraine the attitude of the entire bourgeois political establishment to democratic rights is summed up in the horrific treatment of wikileaks founder julian assange and whistleblower chelsea manning with the support of both the democrats and republicans assange remains confined in belmarsh prison in london awaiting extradition to the us manning has been imprisoned for nearly a year for refusing to testify before a grand jury called to indict assange on further charges the persecution of assange and manning is aimed at criminalizing the conduct of constitutionally protected journalistic activity it is part of a broader suppression of dissent that includes the campaign of internet censorship and the jailing of the maruti suzuki workers in india and other class war prisoners the preparations for war involving massive expenditures and requiring the accumulation of unprecedented levels of debt snuff the air out of democracy in the final analysis the costs of war must be imposed upon the working people of the world the burdens will encounter resistance by a population already incensed by decades of sacrifice the response of the ruling elites will be the intensification of their efforts to suppress every form of popular dissent the degradation of the environment the last decade was marked by the continued and increasingly rapid destruction of the environment scientists have issued ever more dire warnings that without urgent and far reaching action on a global scale the effects of global warming will be devastating and irreversible the deadly inferno engulfing australia as the year ended is only the latest horrific consequence of climate change in november 11 000 scientists signed a statement published in the journal bioscience warning that planet earth is facing a climate emergency it noted that over the course of four decades of global climate negotiations with few exceptions we have generally conducted business as usual and have largely failed to address this predicament the climate crisis has arrived and is accelerating faster than most scientists expected it is more severe than anticipated threatening natural ecosystems and the fate of humanity especially worrisome are potential irreversible climate tipping points and nature s reinforcing feedbacks that could lead to a catastrophic hothouse earth well beyond the control of humans these climate chain reactions could cause significant disruptions to ecosystems society and economies potentially making large areas of earth uninhabitable earlier in the year the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change reported that 821 million people who were already suffering from hunger face starvation as agricultural regions are impacted by global warming hundreds of millions could lose access to fresh water while many more will be affected by increasingly severe weather patterns flooding drought and hurricanes climate change and other manifestations of environmental degradation are the product of a social and economic system that is incapable of organizing global production in a rational and scientific manner on the basis of social need including the need for a healthy environment rather than the endless accumulation of personal wealth the aftermath of the 2008 crash and the crisis of capitalism underlying all other aspects of the social and political situation is the malignant growth of extreme social inequality the inevitable and intended consequence of all the measures adopted by the ruling class following the economic and financial crisis of 2008 following the financial crash which occurred on the eve of the 2010s world governments and central banks opened the spigots in the united states the bush and particularly the obama administrations engineered the 700 billion bailout of the banks followed by trillions of dollars in quantitative easing measures that is the purchase by the federal reserve of the worthless assets and securities held by financial institutions overnight the federal deficit of the american government was doubled the assets of the federal reserve rose from under 2 trillion in november 2008 to 4 5 trillion in october 2014 and the figure remains at more than 4 trillion today with a new 60 billion a month asset purchase program initiated in late 2019 the balance sheet is expected to surpass post crash highs by the middle of this year this policy has continued under trump with his massive corporate tax cuts and demands for further reductions in interest rates the new york times noted in a january 1 article a simple investment strategy that worked in 2019 buy almost anything that the value of almost all investment assets jumped sharply over the past year the nasdaq rose by 35 percent the s p 500 by 29 percent commodities by 16 percent us corporate bonds by 15 percent and us treasuries by 7 percent it was a remarkable across the board rally of a scale not seen in nearly a decade the cause mostly a head spinning reversal by the federal reserve which went from planning to raise interest rates to cutting them and pumping fresh money into the financial markets all the major capitalist powers have pursued similar measures the allocation of unlimited credit and money printing and this in the final analysis is what quantitative easing is intensified the underlying crisis in trying to rescue themselves the ruling elites enshrined parasitism and raised social inequality to a level unknown in modern history benefiting from the limitless infusion of money into the market the fortunes of the financial elite rose during the past decade to astronomical heights the 500 richest individuals in the world 0 000006 percent of the global population now have a collective net worth of 5 9 trillion up 1 2 trillion over the past year alone this increase is more than the gdp that is the total value of all goods and services produced of all but 15 countries in the world in the us the 400 richest individuals have more wealth than the bottom 64 percent and the top 0 1 percent of the population have a larger share than at any time since 1929 immediately preceding the great depression the social catastrophe confronting masses of workers and youth throughout the world is the direct product of the policies employed to guarantee the accumulation of wealth by the corporate and financial elite the decline in life expectancy among workers in the us the mass unemployment of workers and particularly young people throughout the world the devastating austerity measures imposed on greece and other countries the intensification of exploitation to boost the profits of corporations all this is the consequence of the policy pursued by the ruling elites the growth of the international working class and the global class struggle the objective conditions for socialist revolution emerge out of the global crisis the approach of social revolution has already been foreshadowed in the mass demonstrations and strikes that swept across the globe in 2019 in mexico puerto rico ecuador colombia chile france spain algeria britain lebanon iraq iran sudan kenya south africa india and hong kong the united states where the entire political structure is directed toward the suppression of class struggle witnessed the first national strike by auto workers in more than forty years but the dominant and most revolutionary feature of the class struggle is its international character rooted in the global character of modern day capitalism moreover the movement of the working class is a movement of the younger generation and therefore a movement that will shape the future those under 30 now comprise over half the world s population and over 65 percent of the population in the world s fastest growing regions sub saharan africa the middle east and south and southeast asia each month in india one million people turn 18 in the middle east and north africa an estimated 27 million young people will enter the workforce in the next five years from 1980 to 2010 global industrial development added 1 2 billion people to the ranks of the working class with hundreds of millions more in the decade since of this 1 2 billion 900 million entered the working class in the developing world internationally the percentage of the global labor force that can be classified as peasant declined from 44 percent in 1991 to 28 percent in 2018 nearly one billion people in sub saharan africa are expected to join the working class in the coming decades in china alone 121 million people moved from farm to factory between 2000 and 2010 with millions more in the decade since it is not only asia and africa that have seen a growth in the working class population in the advanced capitalist countries large sections of those who would have previously considered themselves middle class have been proletarianized while the wave of immigrants from latin america to the united states and from north africa and the middle east to europe has added millions to a highly diverse workforce from 2010 to 2019 the world s urban population grew by one billion creating a network of interconnected megacities that are both hives of economic productivity and social powder kegs where inequality is a visible fact of daily life and these workers are connected with each other in a manner that is unprecedented in world history the colossal advances in science technology and communications above all the rise of the internet and the proliferation of mobile devices have allowed masses of people to bypass the fake news of the bourgeois media which function as little more than mouthpieces for the state and intelligence agencies more than half of the world s population 4 4 billion people now have access to the internet the average individual spends over two hours on social media each day largely on handheld devices workers and youth can now coordinate their protests and actions on a global scale expressed in the international movement against climate change the emergence of the yellow vests as a worldwide symbol of protest against inequality and the solidarity of auto workers in the united states and mexico these objective changes are producing major shifts in social consciousness on the central question of social inequality the 2019 united nations human development report explains that in almost all countries the percentage of people demanding greater equality increased from the 2000s to the 2010s by up to 50 percent the report warned surveys have revealed rising perceptions of inequality rising preferences for greater equality and rising global inequality in subjective perceptions of well being all these trends should be bright red flags the role of revolutionary leadership the growth of the working class and the emergence of class struggle on an international scale are the objective basis for revolution however the spontaneous struggles of workers and their instinctive striving for socialism are by themselves inadequate the transformation of the class struggle into a conscious movement for socialism is a question of political leadership the past decade has provided a wealth of political experiences demonstrating in the negative the critical role of revolutionary leadership the decade began with revolution in the form of the monumental struggles of egyptian workers and youth against the us backed dictatorship of hosni mubarak in the absence of a revolutionary leadership and with the assistance of disorientation introduced by the petty bourgeois organizations the masses were channeled behind different factions of the ruling class culminating in the reestablishment of direct military dictatorship under the butcher of cairo al sisi all the alternatives to marxism concocted by the representatives of the affluent middle class have been discredited the apolitical and neo anarchist occupy wall street movement in the us in 2011 was revealed to be a middle class movement whose call for a party of the 99 percent sought to subordinate the interests of the working class to those of the top 10 percent new forms of left populism were promoted in europe including syriza in greece and podemos in spain syriza came to power in 2015 and for four years implemented the dictates of the banks podemos is now a governing party in coalition with the spanish socialist party psoe which is committed to a right wing pro austerity program the five star movement presented as an anti establishment insurgency ended up in political alliance with the italian neo fascists corbynism which peddled the illusion of a revival of the labour party as an instrument of anti capitalist struggle proved in the end to be synonymous with political cowardice and prostration before the ruling class were sanders to make his way to the white house his administration would prove no less impotent in latin america the left bourgeois nationalism that was part of the pink tide lulaism in brazil the bolivarian revolution of chavez in venezuela and evo morales in bolivia has been shipwrecked by the crisis of world capitalism their own austerity and pro corporate policies prepared the way for a sharp shift to the right including the rise to power of bolsonaro in brazil and the us backed military coup against morales in 2019 the trade unions which have long served as mechanisms for the suppression of the class struggle have been exposed as agents of the corporations and the state in the united states the struggles of auto workers have been waged in conflict with the corrupt executives of the uaw under indictment or investigation for taking bribes from the companies and stealing workers dues money the uaw however is only the clearest expression of a universal process a vast political and social differentiation has taken place between the working class and an international tendency of politics the pseudo left which is based on sections of the affluent upper middle class who purvey the politics of racial gender and sexual identity the politics of the upper middle class seeks access to and a redistribution of some of the wealth sloshing about within the top 1 percent they wallow in their obsessive fixation on the individual as a means of leveraging identity into positions of power and privilege while ignoring the social interests of the vast majority the tasks of the international committee of the fourth international in many of the comments in the bourgeois press the protests and struggles over the past year are referred to as leaderless but this is only a preliminary stage in the development of the consciousness of the masses the masses accumulating experience in the course of struggle are undergoing a profound change in their social and political orientation it is in the context of this revolutionary process that the fight for socialist consciousness will develop the new decade of social revolution brings with it a new stage in the history of the international committee of the fourth international the practice of the revolutionary movement is decisive the resolution of the socialist equality party us national congress in 2018 explained an evaluation of the objective situation and realistic appraisal of political possibilities which excludes the impact of the intervention of the revolutionary party is utterly alien to marxism the marxist revolutionary party does not merely comment on events it participates in the events that it analyzes and through its leadership in the struggle for workers power and socialism strives to change the world see the resurgence of class struggle and the tasks of the socialist equality party there are many signs of the growing international political influence of the icfi during 2019 the wsws experienced an enormous growth in its readership despite a campaign of internet censorship the total number of page views increased to 20 million from 14 million in 2018 a growth of more than 40 percent the largest period of readership with more than two million people accessing the site each month corresponded with the general motors strike and the auto workers struggle in september and october these developments mark a significant advance but there is no cause for self satisfaction the growth of the influence of the icfi poses all the more clearly the immense responsibilities and tasks that lie ahead the turn must now be to the working class to the active intervention in every manifestation of the opposition of workers and youth to inequality war and dictatorship there must be tireless work to raise the political level to create a cadre in the factories and in the schools to explain the lessons of history and the nature of capitalism there will be no shortage of people determined to fight for socialism but this determination must be armed with a strategy that unifies the struggles of the working class in a worldwide movement for socialism this year marks the 80th anniversary of the assassination of leon trotsky the co leader with lenin of the russian revolution and founder of the fourth international by a stalinist agent on august 20 1940 in the final years of his life trotsky placed enormous emphasis on the role of revolutionary leadership the historical crisis of mankind is reduced to the crisis of revolutionary leadership he wrote in the founding document of the fourth international now it is a question of building the icfi internationally of expanding the socialist equality parties in countries where they exist and building new sections in countries where the icfi does not yet have an organized presence the enormous historical foundation upon which this movement rests the conscious repository of the experiences of the international working class must be brought forward in the developing struggles of the working class and forging the path to socialism as we begin this decade the icfi recalls the words with which trotsky concluded the founding document of the fourth international workers men and women of all countries place yourselves under the banner of the fourth international it is the banner of your approaching victory for information on joining the sep or building a section of the icfi in your country click here
markets will get back into full gear next week as traders return from their festive breaks and the economic data start rolling again the spotlight will be on the nonfarm payrolls report in the united states but key indicators out of the eurozone china canada and japan should also attract attention with the trade optimism setting the market mood at the end of 2019 and the start of 2020 there s a risk the incoming data may not support the brightening picture that many investors have embraced lately setting the stage for a possible correction aussie eyes domestic and chinese data as rally loses steam the australian dollar managed to reverse its huge losses from the third quarter to end 2019 only slightly in the red against its us counterpart but the impressive rally since october is already showing signs of exhaustion and if next week s data prove uninspiring the sell off could deepen looking at the domestic releases they will consist of the aig manufacturing index for december on monday november building approvals on wednesday the trade balance on thursday and retail sales numbers for november on friday australia s reliance on china for its exports means aussie traders will also be watching chinese price gauges due on thursday the consumer price index cpi in china jumped to the highest in eight years in november but markets largely ignored the spike as it was mainly down to soaring pork prices and a bigger concern is the continued weakness in producer prices the producer price index ppi edged up only marginally in november to 1 4 year on year reflecting weak demand for factory goods the us and china agreed a phase one trade deal in december and any pickup in the ppi in the coming months could be attributed to this though it would be too soon for it to impact the december reading a rebound in japanese consumption consumer spending slumped in japan in october as the sales tax went up from 8 to 10 the drop in household spending was almost as bad as in 2014 when the sales tax was last hiked triggering a recession however although the broader impact on the economy is not anticipated to be as severe as it was in 2014 growth remains under pressure from the trade frictions that have had a devastating effect on manufacturers globally particularly the car industry hence it will be crucial for consumption to bounce back quickly to prevent japan s economy from slipping into recession the household spending numbers for november are due on friday and before that the latest wage growth figures will be watched on wednesday but as is typical for japanese data the reaction in the yen is expected to be limited as until the bank of japan signals it is ready to beef up its already massive stimulus program nothing will change in terms of the outlook for monetary policy eurozone inflation to tick higher the euro closed 2019 on a more positive tone than how it began and despite ending the year nowhere year its starting point there are signs that the long drawn out downtrend has finally bottomed out easing trade tensions which in turn have put a dent in the us dollar are one of the factors bolstering the single currency but there have also been some tepid signs of green shoots in the eurozone economy next week s data could further add to the evidence of an improving growth picture starting with the final services pmi readings for december and the sentix index for january on monday there will be more business surveys on wednesday with the economic sentiment indicator which is forecast to have edged up to 101 5 in december the other important releases are november retail sales and the flash inflation estimates for december on tuesday there was some good news for the european central bank last month when both the headline and underlying measures of inflation headed higher the headline rate is forecast to have risen further increasing from 1 0 to 1 3 year on year in december but the two core rates are expected to have stayed unchanged also coming under investors radar will be industrial data out of germany industrial orders and production figures are due on wednesday and thursday respectively both are forecast to show positive growth for november after contracting in october any disappointment in these numbers would question whether a recovery is really underway in europe s largest economy and possibly undermine the euro s latest attempt at a rebound last but not least the ecb will publish the account of its december policy meeting on thursday first nfp report of 2020 much to be excited about with the us china trade deal now temporarily out of the way the focus in early 2020 will be on whether the us economy will be able to regain some momentum or if it will be stuck in the slow lane one thing s for certain there will be no shortage of data next week to give investors a fresh glimpse into the health of the economy first up are the trade balance and factory orders on tuesday both for november as well as the ism non manufacturing pmi after two consecutive months of declines factory orders rose by 0 3 m m in october they are forecast to maintain a positive trend in november to rise

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government

source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel look for water and assisting regulators in west africa in cracking down on illegal gold mining it can help humanitarian agencies navigate in the aftermath of natural disasters in some cases it might help us peer into the future in december the world resources institute unveiled an online tool that uses satellite imagery in conjunction with other data to predict water shortages and conflicts in 2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

gualinga a teen indigenous activist from the ecuadorian amazon took world leaders to task at the cop 25 climate summit and accused oil companies of violating our human rights university students in india are protesting a new citizenship law that excludes muslim migrants young people are in the lead said u n secretary general antónio guterres in a statement on human rights day everywhere they are marching against corruption repression and inequality and for human rights and human dignity in 2020 youth activists will continue to speak up for the world they want to see says jessica taft a youth movement researcher and professor of latin american studies at the university of california santa cruz that kind of involvement by young people isn t new taft says but what has changed she says is that today s social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other with their phones set to retweet they can instantly amplify movements that are half a world away a common refrain from young activists is that the failures of previous generations have left them stuck in a flawed version of the world that an older generation helped make many of the issues that they re focusing on right now are ones that they re able to claim moral authority around as young people says taft that includes topics such as climate change and gun violence which young people can address from personal experience like the students at stoneman douglas high school in parkland fla who captured the world s attention after the shooting at their school matt deitsch a graduate of the school and an organizer of the march for our lives rally in washington d c told npr in an interview in 2019 if we re not standing up and organizing ourselves then we re not doing enough to save lives in america pien huang cash will be king of aid it s an idea that has been gaining popularity for more than two decades instead of giving poor people goods and services say a cow or job training why not just give them money and let them decide how best to spend it interest in cash transfers as this form of aid is often referred to is likely to get even bigger over the coming decade says david evans a senior fellow at the washington d c think tank center for global development one reason is that researchers will increasingly be able to study the long term effects of some of the earliest large scale cash transfer programs a series of government assistance schemes that began in latin america in the late 1990s already we re starting to see the first wave of long term evaluations says evans who is on leave as a lead economist at the world bank so far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short term needs like giving their families enough food each day rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way but these families were also able to give their children more schooling and now that the kids are aging into the workforce it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty if so says evans that will be an

hey there time traveller this article was published 02 01 2020 1557 days ago so information in it may no longer be current washington the federal reserve s policymaking committee saw much less risk of recession at its meeting last month when it kept interest rates steady after three straight cuts and signalled that it expected to keep low rates unchanged through this year minutes of the december meeting released friday showed that fed officials favoured keeping rates in a low range of 1 5 to 1 75 to cushion the u s economy from slow global growth and the trump administration s trade conflicts officials were also concerned that inflation still hadn t reached the fed s target level of 2 still many fed policymakers at the dec 10 11 meeting expressed the view that the risks of a u s china trade war had diminished along with the probability of a disruptive brexit the meeting occurred two days before the trump administration and beijing reached a preliminary trade deal though press reports had already suggested that an initial agreement was near file in this dec 11 2019 file photo federal reserve chair jerome powell arrives to speak at a news conference after the federal open market committee meeting in washington on thursday jan 2 2020 the federal reserve releases minutes from its december meeting when it kept its key interest rate unchanged ap photo jacquelyn martin file at their meeting last month fed officials noted that the u s economy was showing resilience despite the trade fights and a weak global economy the minutes said a rise in long term rates also suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent months since last month s meeting though tensions have escalated in the middle east as the trump administration has confronted iranian backed forces in iraq on friday stocks sank on wall street and oil prices jumped after u s forces in iraq killed a top iranian general yet many analysts say higher oil prices could potentially benefit the u s economy because of the sharp increase in the past decade in u s oil production higher oil prices encourage energy companies to invest in drilling wells which boosts demand for steel pipe and other equipment from u s factories and creates jobs those trends increasingly offset the drag on consumer spending exerted by higher gas prices joe brusuelas chief economist at the tax advisory firm rsm suggested that the risks to the u s economy are for now contained as a result we do not expect any action by the federal reserve brusuelas said there would need to be a much greater disruption to oil supply from the persian gulf to warrant a rate cut by the fed in the near term but should iran respond to the attack and military action escalates the danger to the u s economy could increase economists said the wild card is whether turmoil in the middle east triggers a sustained sell off in equities depressing business and consumer confidence to the point where labour market and inflation concerns become secondary said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics though the fed s policymaking committee voted unanimously last month in favour of keeping rates unchanged several members voiced concerns about the long term consequences of very low rates keeping rates ultra low could fuel excessive risk taking on wall street a few participants warned which could lead to dangerous asset bubbles if those bubbles were to burst it could make the next recession more severe than otherwise but a greater number of fed officials felt that the job market could still strengthen and draw more people off the sidelines into jobs without sending inflation up too much that sentiment would favour keeping rates low to further reduce unemployment and stimulate economic growth chairman jerome powell echoed that view in the post meeting news conference signalling that the fed was comfortable with keeping rates low for the foreseeable future we have learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation powell said at the news conference fed officials also expressed concern that americans expectation for future inflation was too low inflation expectations some argue can become self fulfilling if workers expect low inflation they re less likely to demand higher pay which in turn allows companies to keep a lid on prices low inflation expectations are another reason for the fed to keep rates down in hopes that they will eventually

barkin president of the federal reserve bank of richmond said he was concerned about the weakness in business investment which he attributed to uncertainty caused by factors ranging from rising middle east tensions to the outcome of trade talks with china but he said there were reasons to be optimistic including the benefits of the fed s three rate cuts last year while there is always the risk of a

predicting that 168 million people a record will need humanitarian assistance in 2020 because of extreme weather large infectious disease outbreaks and intensifying protracted conflicts across more than 50 countries that s around a million more people than were in need of assistance in 2019 and the number is expected to continue to rise up to 200 million people by 2022 the u n expects that providing this assistance in 2020 could cost up to 29 billion hot spots include burkina faso where a surge in violence by religious extremists has displaced more than half a million people the philippines where a christmas eve typhoon killed more than two dozen and venezuela where an economic collapse has resulted in the exodus of nearly 5 million people in the last five years shannon scribner associate director for humanitarian policy and programs at oxfam america says that funding to respond to these crises is not keeping pace with the need and that will continue to be a challenge scribner says another concern is an increasing number of restrictions on international ngos that make it harder to enter and operate in conflict affected areas such as syria and yemen humanitarian law isn t being upheld in some of the countries where we re working says scribner and we don t see world leaders talking about human rights the way they once did one key solution she says channel more funding to small local groups that know the terrain intimately rather than big international ngos tim mcdonnell second tier diseases will go gangbusters over the last 12 months the world made steady progress against the big infectious killers hiv malaria and tuberculosis but other illnesses some of them easily preventable stole the limelight those second tier diseases include measles and dengue which did gangbusters in the tropics cholera raged inyemen polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat in pakistan polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018 in a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort a dozen countries that had been polio free including china angola and the philippines reported cases of vaccine derived polio in 2019 venezuela reported itsfirst yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country s health care system continues its downward spiral despite efforts to rein it in a few cases of middle east respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the middle east and that will probably continue in the coming year recent high profile measles outbreaks in the u s europe the philippines and samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year to prevent outbreaks the world health organization says that roughly 95 of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles more thanhalf the countries in the world including the u s at 94 haven t reached that threshold according to unicef where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020 afghanistan angola bolivia and haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40 but there are some signs of progress this year a newdengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years and the world is more prepared to deal with ebola than at any time in history two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use all developed after the 2014 west africa outbreak the current ebola outbreak in eastern democratic republic of congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world s ability to battle this virus if there s an ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020 it would likely be contained and crushed quickly jason beaubien aid will become even more political it seems we re returning to the bad old days of the cold war when we used aid as a glorified payoff for friends and allies says jeremy konyndyk a senior fellow at the center for global development and former u s foreign disaster assistance chief under the obama administration instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development konyndyk says there s a growing mentality in the u s that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line examples include trump s freezing andreinstatement of aid to el salvador guatemala and honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies his threats tocut off countries that don t vote with the u s at the united nations and hiswithdrawal of aid to palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan the u k has also announced plans to merge its department for international development into its foreign office a move thatmore than 100 charities say risks politicizing u k aid these shifts by the u s and u k two of the world s largest aid donors could set the tone for a lot of aid policy around the world says konyndyk joanne lu unrest over inequality will grow 2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world and according to some experts the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020 since the 1980s income inequality has been on the rise says lucas chancel co director of the world inequality lab at the paris school of economics in the u s for example chancel says the richest 1 owned about 40 of the nation s wealth in 2016 up from 20 in the 1980s and trump s 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of american households it is unlikely that 2020 brings anything different he says meaning inequality will deepen despite the efforts of angry protesters to stop it part of the problem is that inequality has a new face according to a new report by theunited nations development programme people are no longer just angry about income they re concerned about inequalities in political representation and power higher education access to technology and the resources to survive climate change chancel says the protests in chile france lebanon hong kong and other countries demonstrate that governments still do not seem to have grasped the reality of the situation and have yet to provide adequate solutions until they do the undp report warns the social unrest will likely continue joanne lu water taps continue to run dry in june 2019 chennai india reached day zero the day on which the city s reservoirs ran almost completely out of water by the fall seasonal rains had resupplied the city at least temporarily but the looming specter of water scarcity is certain to continue in cities around the world in 2020 in india alone 21 cities are at risk of running dry in 2020 according to a government report and an august report from the world resources institute found that a group of 17 countries that together are home to one quarter of the global population including botswana india iran and mexico are using as much or more water than they can replace upmanu lall director of the columbia water center says that while droughts linked to climate change can create water scarcity in many cases day zero events are caused more by government mismanagement of water resources i haven t seen any reasonable improvement he says so i think there will continue to be places that are stressed and at least one will pop up as a day zero this year the indian subcontinent is a prime candidate he says but on the plus side climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for el niño and la niña the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others the absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity either way victoria beard an urban planning professor at cornell university and world resources institute fellow says water scarcity will continue to be a problem especially in cities until governments of high risk localities pay to massively overhaul their water systems people are demanding of their leaders to see investments in basic services she says there s no self provision that s going to solve this problem in the long term there are no examples where it s a free for all and it works out well you need coordinated massive public investment tim mcdonnell gender equality is not on the horizon the u n calls gender equality a necessary foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world yet no country in the world is on track to achieve gender equality as defined by the u n s sustainable development goals by 2030 2020 will mark an important milestone in the long road to gender equality it s the 25th anniversary of the beijing declaration and platform for action which is considered a landmark progressive blueprint for advancing women s rights the global community will be taking stock of progress and lack thereof at gatherings such as that of the u n commission on the status of women in march worldwide women continue to face disproportionate rates of discrimination and violence less access to economic and educational opportunities and exclusion from decision making roles at the community and governmental levels by one measure the world will not achieve gender equality for nearly a century the most current estimate by the world economic forum which publishes an annual report to track country by country progress across economic educational health and political dimensions is that achieving parity across all four dimensions will take an average of 99 5 years at the current rate while the wef report found that achieving parity is relatively close at hand for educational attainment which could be possible in as soon as 12 years progress toward closing the economic opportunities gap is actually backsliding by that metric parity is a lowly 57 8 and will take 257 years to overcome emily vaughn hopeful trends global health will get woke this year expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when western countries colonized poor countries stripping them of resources and autonomy people who work in the field know that much of the money influence and decision making about how to help low income countries still comes from wealthy countries with little input from the people who receive the assistance one reason for this mindset says renzo guinto a filipino physician and a member of the lancet planetary health s editorial board is the colonial roots of tropical medicine in the colonial era european researchers studied diseases in the colonies to protect the colonizers not the people living in those places from getting sick over the past couple of years he and a growing number of global health staffers have been working to make a change they aim to give medical professionals in low income countries real leadership roles at the university level students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field s colonial history in global health curriculum and communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags shiftthepower and decolonizeglobalhealth jennifer lentfer a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development there are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject in the coming weeks lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative and in january graduate students at duke university are organizing a conference called decolonizing global health 2020 there s a real question as to how to flip the leadership says lentfer and that s coming to a big head malaka gharib satellite imagery could improve global health this year expect to see more research on global health and development from a sky high point of view imagery produced by satellites is becoming more ubiquitous and inexpensive and an increasingly vital source of data on poverty disease and environmental challenges marshall burke deputy director of stanford university s center on food security and the environment is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them let s say you run a government agency in a low income country and want to identify the poorest 10 of villages or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito borne diseases satellite imagery can help you answer those questions burke says in a way that s much less expensive and time consuming than traditional boots on the ground surveys cars large buildings and well tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space satellite imagery is already helping cattle herders in the sahel

2020 burke says expect to see more satellite based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers and although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the u s and the european union more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries including ethiopia s first observatory satellite launched in late december tim

let s face it 2019 is going to be a hard year to beat stocks and 401 k plans up more than 25 on average wage gains of 3 to 5 7 million surplus jobs and the lowest unemployment and inflation rates in nearly 50 years that s a lot to celebrate booms like this don t happen by accident the imperative is for republicans to connect the dots between this banner year for the middle class and the tax cuts deregulation policies and pro america energy production initiatives so will 2020 continue the winning streak the only thing that we know for sure is that economists don t know for sure i ll include myself in that category the best i can do is provide reasons for optimism and reasons for pessimism the case for optimism 1 america has scored two big wins on the trade front the biggest risk since trump entered office was a freeze up of the global trading system because of his tariffs now with the concluding of the trade deal with canada and mexico and a very positive outlook for a trade win in the tariff wars against china investors are bullish the china deal takes an escalation of tariffs off the table for 2020 2 the federal reserve is finally getting it right a year ago the fed torpedoed the economy and the stock market fell by 2 500 points while gdp growth and investment stalled out now rates are lower there is more dollar liquidity and we have price stability with very little risk of inflation 3 trump s tax cuts are working the tax cuts have been a spectacular success in terms of generating jobs wage hikes profits and gdp growth the chances of those tax cuts going away in 2020 are close to zero if anything we might see another small tax cut in sum the policy goals are turned toward growth 4 washington will be paralyzed with partisan gridlock in 2020 good when things are going well less is more so what could go wrong here are four things to worry about 1 china trade deal blows up beijing could back out they ve done it before or they could start cheating if either happens trump hammers them with more tariffs and we are back in a trade war 2 elizabeth warren bernie sanders joe biden oh my if markets start anticipating that any of these anti growth candidates will win stocks will tumble if trump loses then we are talking green new deal medicare for all capital gains taxes wealth taxes and the end of the trump tax cuts to say this would be harmful to growth and stocks is a vast understatement and if trump loses to one of these candidates the market could collapse 3 the global economy stays flat it s been stalled out for the last year or two and if it doesn t get a boost in europe and elsewhere it s going to affect u s growth negatively we can t keep carrying the world economy on our shoulders 4 housing bubble bursts again don t look now but fannie mae and freddie mac are up to their old tricks providing near 100 loan guarantees on 2 3 down payment loans if housing values fall defaults will soar as they did in 2008 and 2009 amazingly the government has learned none of the lessons from the last housing meltdown on balance i m with the bulls for 2020 just don t expect 25 gains again this year stephen moore is an economic consultant with freedomworks and co author of trumponomics inside the america first plan to revive our economy
for global investors the sky started brightening as a tumultuous 2019 drew to a close stock indices in recent weeks have gained 2 6 with developed markets rising the most and many are closing in on all time highs most prominent are the us stock indices where every day the s p dow jones and nasdaq have been touching historic highs global sovereign bond yields have also picked up significantly with german and japanese yields rebounding to levels not seen since the start of 2019 it is as if the dramatic events that created the past year s global market turbulence never happened backing the recent risk on sentiment are three factors 1 economic data which clearly show signs of stabilising 2 liquidity injections into the world economy and 3 signs of global risk abating these three conditions represent a light at the end of the tunnel to guide investors into a new year signs of a pickup in manufacturing are reflected in the global purchasing managers index pmi which rebounded into positive territory in november at 50 3 the first plus 50 reading in six months the global services and composite pmi rebounded as well the recovery in global manufacturing is mainly the result of the revival of chinese manufacturing pmi which is moving in tandem with monthly economic indicators such as retail sales and industrial production the surprising rebound was partially due to one off factors such as the tremendous volume of online sales during alibaba s annual singles day nov 11 extravaganza as well as the return of economic activity following the long golden week holiday inventory restocking but another structural factor leading to the rebound of chinese and global manufacturing in our view has been the depletion of global inventories on an aggregate level the new order ratio in the pmi has been jumping in the past few months implying that producers had halted production while running down inventories to match slipping demand now they are restocking as they prepare to step up output again on the individual country level inventory levels in major economies the us the eu and china indicate that the level of inventory to sales in the us and eu or inventory growth in china has peaked and is levelling off if these conditions persist we may see a rebound in global pmi as we did in 2017 though probably not of the same magnitude this implies that a mini synchronised rebound in global manufacturing in the next few months is possible the global economic slowdown in 2019 also prompted changes in the monetary policy approaches by the central banks of major economies apart from interest rate cuts liquidity injections or quantitative easing qe are what matter most to the financial markets and are positively correlated with the performance of risk assets based on the latest data available november the balance sheets of leading global central banks the us euro zone japan the uk have been expanding continuously mainly as a result of liquidity injections in the short term money market by the us federal reserve in order to reduce tightness in the repurchase repo market the fed plans to buy up to 60 billion per month in short term treasury bills from october 2019 to march 2020 this continuous liquidity injection has led to positive performance of global financial markets the last and most important factor affecting the global financial markets has been a significant easing of global risk events especially the us china trade war and brexit washington and beijing this month are expected to sign a phase one deal under which china would import 40 billion worth of us agricultural products while agreeing to increase its total us imports by at least 200 billion over the next two years china has also agreed to tighten intellectual property rights enforcement and end forced technology transfer a key demand of the us and refrain from competitive devaluations of the yuan in return washington called off tariff increases on 156 billion worth of chinese consumer goods and will halve tariffs on another 110 billion in chinese imports to 7 5 no trade reversal even though the enforcement of the phase one deal will be difficult in our view especially increasing agricultural imports ending forced technology transfer and finding a mutually acceptable mechanism for dispute settlement with president donald trump facing re election in november the administration will not want to reverse the deal and risk substantially escalating the trade war again and while tariffs might be cut further in order to boost the us economy we believe a substantial phase two trade deal is unlikely to be agreed before the election on the brexit front the situation has improved substantially with prime minister boris johnson and his conservatives winning a big majority in the dec 12 election britain will now leave the eu on jan 31 as planned but a lot of hard work remains but we believe a limited detail free trade agreement between the uk and the european union is within reach at the end of 2020 in line with mr johnson s plan in light of these factors we believe that risk on mode will continue at least for the first quarter of this year we recommend that investors accumulate risk assets especially in developed markets as well as emerging markets stocks such as those in china at the same time they should stay underweight on fixed return asset classes such as treasuries debentures and reits nevertheless with the global economy in the late cycle stage and the possibility of unforeseen risk events we still

1 in late december bullish investor sentiment has fallen to 37 22 that s below the 40 9 reading for neutral sentiment that has climbed from 35 4 in late december we interpret that shift as investors

last month when it kept interest rates steady after three straight cuts and signaled that it expected to keep low rates unchanged through this year minutes of the december meeting released friday showed that fed officials favored keeping rates in a low range of 1 5 to 1 75 to cushion the u s economy from slow global growth and the trump administration s trade conflicts officials were also concerned that inflation still hadn t reached the fed s target level of 2 still many fed policymakers at the dec 10 11 meeting expressed the view that the risks of a u s china trade war had diminished along with the probability of a disruptive brexit the meeting occurred two days before the trump administration and beijing reached a preliminary trade deal though press reports had already suggested that an initial agreement was near at their meeting last month fed officials noted that the u s economy was showing resilience despite the trade fights and a weak global economy the minutes said a rise in long term rates also suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent months since last month s meeting though tensions have escalated in the middle east as the trump administration has confronted iranian backed forces in iraq on friday stocks sank on wall street and oil prices jumped after u s forces in iraq killed a top iranian general yet many analysts say higher oil prices could potentially benefit the u s economy because of the sharp increase in the past decade in u s oil production higher oil prices encourage energy companies to invest in drilling wells which boosts demand for steel pipe and other equipment from u s factories and creates jobs those trends increasingly offset the drag on consumer spending exerted by higher gas prices joe brusuelas chief economist at the tax advisory firm rsm suggested that the risks to the u s economy are for now contained as a result we do not expect any action by the federal reserve brusuelas said there would need to be a much greater disruption to oil supply from the persian gulf to warrant a rate cut by the fed in the near term but should iran respond to the attack and military action escalates the danger to the u s economy could increase economists said the wild card is whether turmoil in the middle east triggers a sustained sell off in equities depressing business and consumer confidence to the point where labor market and inflation concerns become secondary said ian shepherdson chief economist at pantheon macroeconomics though the fed s policymaking committee voted unanimously last month in favor of keeping rates unchanged several members voiced concerns about the long term consequences of very low rates keeping rates ultra low could fuel excessive risk taking on wall street a few participants warned which could lead to dangerous asset bubbles if those bubbles were to burst it could make the next recession more severe than otherwise but a greater number of fed officials felt that the job market could still strengthen and draw more people off the sidelines into jobs without sending inflation up too much that sentiment would favor keeping rates low to further reduce unemployment and stimulate economic growth chairman jerome powell echoed that view in the post meeting news conference signaling that the fed was comfortable with keeping rates low for the foreseeable future we have learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation powell said at the news conference fed officials also expressed concern that americans expectation for future inflation was too low inflation expectations some argue can become self fulfilling if workers expect low inflation they re less likely to demand higher pay which in turn allows companies to keep a lid on prices low inflation expectations are another reason for the fed to keep rates down in hopes that they will eventually boost inflation in comments since the december meeting fed officials have remained upbeat about the economy s prospects in remarks titled is a recession around the corner thomas barkin president of the federal reserve bank of richmond said he was concerned about the weakness in business investment which he attributed to uncertainty caused by factors ranging from rising middle east tensions to the outcome of trade talks with china but he said there were reasons to be optimistic including the benefits of the fed s three rate cuts last year while there is always the risk of a shock the fed has done a lot to support the economy s continued expansion and to provide buffers against the downside barkin said in comments to a bankers

a surprise air strike by the us military that killed iran revolutionary guards commander qasem soleimani on friday escalated tensions between washington and tehran according to the us department of defence president donald trump had ordered the strikes in a decisive defensive action to protect us personnel abroad general soleimani was actively developing plans to attack american diplomats and service members in iraq and throughout the region general soleimani and his quds force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of american and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more pentagon said in a statement the strike which follows
by much of what passes for left commentary in the u s emerged from the post wwii synthesis of radical right economics with a fey liberal notion of democracy in recent years this synthesis has been given the name neoliberalism left largely untouched have been the premises and analytical architecture of neoliberalism which are as much a part of the neoliberal ethos as the nominal ideas as such much of this criticism has had the effect of reinforcing the ideas and actions that are being critiqued presidential candidate elizabeth warren articulated this paradox when she stated that she is capitalist to her bones when tied back to her erstwhile policy prescriptions she restated the neoliberal synthesis capitalist economics tied to a fey conception of democracy as inclusion in capitalist political economy the question then what happens when capitalist outcomes are anti democratic is this not the central political question of the age moreover how and when was capitalism decided upon as the mode of social organization through anything resembling a democratic process the answer is that it wasn t capitalism is an imposed political order that is put forward as both not political and freely chosen what lies behind it is a neoliberal conception of history as before and after the before which occurred before we had a say in the matter and the after which is the world that was decided on before this tyranny of history of being born into already distributed political and economic power calls the theoretical acuity of both capitalism and democracy into question both depend on an absence of coercion power to work if a few people own everything they can make capitalism the least efficient economic system ever conceived and if a few people control political outcomes democracy can hardly be claimed to exist if people are born into a world where a few people own everything and a few people determine political outcomes then neither capitalism nor democracy can be claimed to exist in less abstract terms u s president donald trump s rewrite of the nafta trade agreement first passed by democrat bill clinton in 1994 tweaks the original and reframes the role of class struggle regarding trade pacts while the trade pacts that preceded nafta carried with them a sense of being republican the national democrats countered by inserting labor friendly language not through substantive opposition getting nafta passed required a coalition between business friendly republicans and new democrats led by bill clinton it was mr clinton s understanding of the neoliberal ethos that gave him the ability to frame the economic policies of the radical right through the language of democratic inclusion to get a sense mr clinton promoted the idea of a level playing field as he was working with the titans of industry to deliver working class jobs to low wage locales overseas the level playing field was a promise of popular inclusion while his economic policies were being written by corporations and the rich to lower wages and crush the power of labor the idea that trade is always and everywhere beneficial has been the american position left right and center since the reemergence of neoliberalism in the mid 1970s this is why having labor representatives at the table during trade negotiations slowed the evisceration of labor s power not one whit to follow the logic trade is so beneficial that labor benefits from it even though labor s power has been eviscerated through trade agreements as even clintonite supporters of free trade like paul krugman argued early on trade creates winners and losers there is no universal benefit through neoliberal ideology the prior distribution of political and economic power should have had no impact on the distribution of the benefits of trade agreements otherwise the argument over free trade turns into rococo apologetics to benefit the already rich and powerful as it turned out oligarchs and corporations got cheap labor in subsidized factories and freedom from environmental regulations and effective taxation the laboring classes got gradually debased paychecks and benefits followed by exciting new career opportunities as uber entrepreneurs and greeters at walmart what this means is that understanding power is more important to predicting the winners and losers of neoliberal economic policies than knowing the economics this is more likely than not the reason why power is assumed out of capitalist economic theory but what else are establishment politicians referring to when they claim that wildly popular policies in the public interest can t be gotten through congress if the people elect representatives to do the people s bidding but the representatives do the bidding of business interests then where does the power lie it lies with the oligarchs and that isn t democracy the concept of power at work is as part of an iterative social political economic process that neoliberal ideology can t accommodate the theorized point of capitalism is to tie economic distribution to economic production the equal distribution of political power implied by democracy comes from membership in a democratic society not from a system for meritoriously allocating it without perpetual redistribution to place people in equal starting positions neither capitalism nor democracy operate as the theories that support them claim but what trade agreements do accomplish is to reorganize political and economic relations that 1 benefit the already rich and powerful but that 2 disproportionately harm those whose lives have been reorganized when the reorganizing force is threatened amazon uses economic and political power to limit and or eliminate competition for the benefit of jeff bezos and a few other connected executives much of this has nothing to do with market competition witness the self dealing of political competition to attract amazon facilities but shutting amazon down would immediately put thousands of people on the unemployment line in similar fashion left critiques of donald trump s trade war an apparent negotiating tactic for winning trade concessions have centered on the distribution of economic pain not the widely destructive consequences of neoliberal trade agreements or their being structured to cause maximum economic pain to vulnerable citizens when trade relations are threatened complaints that so and so consumer products are made more expensive come from so far down the neoliberal rabbit hole that their very existence affirms the basic economic and political logic of neoliberalism as well as the thatcherite tina there is no alternative if the prior distribution of political and economic power destines the benefits of trade to accrue to the already rich and powerful then why would a democratic society either care about or acquiesce to what benefits the rich and powerful and to the extent that the continued aggregation of wealth by the few buys them more political power how are such policies not antithetical to political democracy posed historically isn t the increasing concentration of wealth and power amongst the few the actual historically demonstrated outcome of neoliberal policies the link between capitalism and democracy in neoliberal theory comes through the idea of choice democracy provides people with a choice of who they want to lead them and capitalism provides them with a choice between consumer products the facile nature of the comparison between how people chose to organize their societies and their preferred brand of toilet tissue didn t occur to those who formulated it because they didn t consider social organization to be a choice to be left to the people neither capitalism nor neoliberalism have ever been put to a vote think way way back to the u s backed coup in 1973 that ousted the democratically elected president of chile salvador allende to install both neoliberal reforms and a murderous military dictatorship that quelled resistance to neoliberalism through political repression capitalism wasn t a choice made by the chilean people through democratic means it was forced on them by capitalist ideologues american liberals as it turned out who were writing books about the unbreakable link between capitalism and democracy as they were having chilean protestors tossed out of airplanes in flight to refresh a bit of history here the u s was founded by slave owning oligarchs who rebelled against the british monarchy in part because britain had outlawed slavery if one considers slaves as citizens in a democratic sense the power of capital to render democratic consent meaningless is made excruciatingly obvious much of the rest of american history has been to make the rest of us answerable to the whims of the oligarchs gross generalization that this is i get around and i ve never met anyone who voted for nafta u s machinations in chile represented a convergence of imperialism cold war methods and neoliberal ideology of current interest is that four plus decades later the people of chile have once again taken to the streets to protest the imposition of neoliberalism they are part of global uprising that to date remains largely unfocused a mix of social angst generalized political grievances and declining economic circumstances what appears to tie them together is a sense of imposed social order whether by the u s the chinese government or repressive governments put in place to maintain imperial order what the u s coup in chile illustrates is the imposed nature of capitalism economists claim that it is the result of an evolutionary process by which trade between peoples and nations evolved into trade centered political economy this even though 1 the pre eminent capitalist nations are current and former empires 2 variations on slavery and indentured servitude defined their early incarnations 3 governments have kept a heavy hand in fostering promoting and supporting dominant industries and 4 trade has been more often imposed at the end of a gun than chosen through democratic means the marshall plan that rebuilt the industrial economies of germany and japan after wwii was in part premised in the neoliberal idea that capitalist democracy promotes peace and stability this despite the u s being the most militaristic nation in human history germany and japan have indeed remained peaceful in a pax americana kind of way since wwii the u s has fought major land and air wars in korea vietnam laos cambodia afghanistan and iraq and through proxies it has fought wars in nicaragua el salvador honduras yemen somalia libya ukraine and so forth the irony of a militaristic nation putting forth experts who claim they know the formula for peace and stability doesn t seem to have been much explored neoliberal founder karl popper famous defender of open societies from their enemies joined milton friedman in explaining why capitalist democracy has no need for a militarized police force the largest carceral population in both absolute and relative terms in human history a dedicated political police force fbi and the most intrusive surveillance technologies ever conceived there was nothing democratic about the crafting or passage of nafta mr clinton straight up lied when he said that it would create thousands of good paying jobs every economist who had looked at the deal concluded that jobs would be lost from it george h w bush had been unable to get it passed because people didn t trust republicans to do the right thing it was bill clinton s liberal bona fides that sold democrats on neoliberalism that it is the economic ideology of the radical right was hidden behind the façade of kinder gentler liberalism if one follows the global links of multinational corporations to markets they can largely be explained through or at least follow imperial history were the neoliberal trade theorists krugman correct in their theories not just their subject but the premises and architecture of their arguments there is no necessary reason why this would be the case because pre existing power is nowhere to be found in their models again if pre existing power determines outcomes and history has fairly well demonstrated that it does then little is left of the theories the benefits of trade have accrued to the rich and powerful who favor trade agreements economic aggregates have been used to hide these distributional disparities in political terms liberals continue to disparage those who they have dispossessed at their own peril america is still at a point where the deeper issues of political economy are excluded from acceptable discussion the overton window with environmental and increasingly social issues only resolvable through the radical reorganization of political economy defense of the range of acceptable discussion is moral cowardice unless all of the premises of modernity are laid bare to be acted on the future is bleak notes the claim that large swaths of people have been lifted out of poverty conflates broadly integrated state policies like those of china with the benefits of trade additionally there is conflation of monetization with value creation the nominally communist government of china decided to industrialize china built the institutions necessary to do so and chose an export driven strategy the next logical step is to use state resources to create a consumer culture in other words consumers don t create capitalism the state in league with corporations create consumers if you see natural evolution or the will of the people in any of this please let me know regarding monetization with money an apple has monetary value without money it doesn t the apple exists regardless of whether or not it has monetary value to claim that something has been produced that people are somehow richer by giving the apple monetary value is a category error in similar fashion capitalism has relegated millions of people to lives of poverty by lifting them out of poverty nafta flooded mexico with cheap industrial corn from america this destroyed

sharon zollner chief economist at anz bank photo dean purcell what are the big trends that will define our economy in 2020 we asked some of new zealand s leading market economists to give us their picks from those we ve distilled the top five and some honourable mentions when we did this last year the economists were picking commodities house prices interest rate yield curves chinese growth and wage inflation as indicators to watch the top two commodities and housing really were new zealand s economic saviours in 2019 read more the big numbers new zealand s economists will be watching this year premium is nz s economy in trouble here are the top five indicators economy hub the five biggest risks facing nz this year new zealand ranked third freest economy in the world it s almost a bit depressing but for all our efforts to diversify the economy sentiment has rebounded on the back of strong export prices and a resurgent auckland housing market we ve also seen some pretty solid wage growth this year albeit underpinned by government policy and state sector wage settlements chinese growth held up despite the trade war thanks largely to renewed government stimulus at the very least it stayed firm enough to maintain demand for new zealand exports even though tourist numbers took a hit and last year s big story the inverted yield curve as a harbinger of recessionary doom didn t quite pan out in fact the chart which measures the returns on us treasury notes over time did briefly dip into inverted territory with returns for short term 2 year treasury notes going higher than returns for long term 10 year notes but they didn t stay there for long as us economic confidence bounced back through the second half of the year so what to watch in 2020 credit conditions the most common theme in the economists picks for 2020 was the risk of credit tightening it was a horror year for the australasian banks in 2019 with numerous controversies and the sudden departure of management on both sides of the tasman a combination of fallout from culture and conduct reviews increased capital requirements low interest rates squeezing margins and a general slowing of economic activity has already prompted banks to lend more cautiously that s having a flow on effect through the business and agriculture sector in particular the housing market remains key to new zealand s economic outlook photo nzme will the rbnz s new capital rules put even more pressure on lending the rbnz says its capital requirements won t affect the economy much while the more extreme commentaries out there are predicting a credit crunch says westpac chief economist dominick stephens annual business credit growth has been pretty stable at around 5 per cent over the past four years if it tanks the doomsayers were right and the economy will slow if it stays steady then the rbnz s more sanguine view was right we think there s more of a potential story here than the rbnz does says anz chief economist sharon zollner observed credit growth is of course a mix of demand and supply factors but we will be watching it more closely than normal over the next 12 months house prices the late lift in auckland sales seems to have revived sentiment across the country such is the power of the property wealth effect in new zealand that a turn in the market has already flowed through to consumer confidence with the latest mcdermott miller survey showing a sharp rebound in november does the modest upturn under way turn into a full blown boom with attendant impacts on credit consumer spending interest rates etc asks asb chief economist nick tuffley supply issues still seem to be at play in auckland and some other parts of the country but there must be increasing concerns that further significant house price rises only set the housing market up for a bigger potential correction at some point in the future says infometrics chief forecaster gareth kiernan in the meantime strength in house prices could have positive effects for consumer spending as well business confidence and investment business confidence remains a controversial indicator with some arguing it s biased and self fulfilling of course even if both these complaints are valid business sentiment still represents a powerful force on the economy influencing both employment and investment trends on that basis it remains a popular pick among economists as something to watch in 2020 anz s zollner picks the investment aspect of the anz business outlook survey as key most seem to agree the economy is bottoming out around 2 per cent but there s a range of opinions on how fast it will rebound from there she says that ll hinge to a large extent on whether businesses seize the opportunity low interest rates present or not she notes that from this month anz will have new data in the business outlook survey asking firms what the three biggest current drivers of their investment decisions are that as well as the headline investment intentions data will be revealing she says politics elections and government spending the announcement government plans for more spending on infrastructure and the prospect of more to come as we head into election year has prompted several economists to pick fiscal stimulus as a key feature of the economy in 2020 it s election year and the government has already signalled some intent with its infrastructure announcement says infometrics kiernan we doubt the infrastructure channel will be sufficiently timely to boost economic growth and or the government s polling before the election even if the economic rationale for more infrastructure investment is sound look for more cash to be splashed around next year particularly from nz first given what remains in the provincial growth fund and how closely they re flirting with the 5 per cent threshold the budget will be the centrepiece of new spending says bnz head of research stephen toplis we know roughly what the government s capex plans are what we don t yet know is what the opex tax plans will be the election outcome in both the united states and new zealand will be of major importance in determining economic direction given the capacity constraints that still remain in the construction sector it will be interesting to see what the mix of public and private investment will be over the coming years to see if there are any signs of crowding out of private investment says nzier principal economist christina leung nz initiative s oliver hartwich offers a global take on the issue pointing to global policy uncertainty index which is riding higher than it was before the gfc inflation inflation and wage inflation in particular remains central to many economic outlooks it still plays a key role in determining monetary policy settings after all confidence may improve markets may rally higher and growth may become more self fulfilling but if inflation remains structurally challenged and wages fails to lift then measures of inequality will worsen says kiwibank chief economist jarrod kerr christina leung nzier economist photo supplied new zealand s productivity has languished and our burgeoning infrastructure deficit doesn t help wages growth has been soft and inequitable public sector wages have lifted recently as several collective pay deals for frontline public servants came through what we want to see is more broad based wage growth low inflation was key to the rbnz s ability to leap in and rescue the economy from low business confidence and global woes this year says westpac s stephens inflation below target meant the rbnz could aggressively cut the ocr which facilitated that housing market turnaround i expect that ongoing low inflation will allow the rbnz to keep the party going however non tradables inflation has been trending higher recently and if it continues to lift then the rbnz may have to confiscate the punchbowl it s not so much wages specifically that we are interested in but rather what wage growth will tell us about labour shortages the economy s potential growth rate pressure on corporate profitability and the likelihood of heightened cpi inflation says bnz s toplis honourable mentions the nz initiative s hartwich went for a more structural pick in productivity growth which most economists agree is a missing ingredient in new zealand s economic story hartwich points to the oecd graph for productivity as expressed by gdp per hour worked new zealand s growth path is not flash not good enough for a country that likes to think of itself as broadly successful he says we need to do a lot better to be able to afford the education health care and general quality of life we aspire to wellbeing is just a hollow intention without productivity hartwich also highlights the rise of negative yielding debt around the world as a symptom of the worrying imbalances that remain in the global economy economists will also still be keeping an eye on global growth in 2020 particularly commodity prices news out of china and production indicators like the pmi and global ip industrial production kiwibank s kerr says we re an island on the edge of the earth with a huge reliance on global trade and finance in a world grappling with trade wars and threats of brexit indicators of global production are important global growth forecasts have been ratcheted down all year recent indicators suggest a solid improvement into 2020 global ip data will give us a good guide on the sustainability of the recent improvement
there s a problem with america s favorite statistic gdp it avoids pretty much everything that s actually truly really good for society including the importance of robust ecology still it s the biggest measure of what s happening with the economy and used around the world even though horribly flawed according to some forward thinkers gross domestic product gdp the monetary value of all finished goods and services is a distortion that needs fixing nobel winning economist joseph stiglitz s former chief economist of the world bank new book measuring what counts the global movement for well being the new press 2019 tackles the issue by exposing its paramount importance in judging how society gauges prosperity or alternatively the failure of prosperity e g one in eight americans 40 million is on food stamps during the longest economic expansion in memory and 40 50 of americans don t have 400 readily available for emergencies is this failed prosperity gdp distorts reality by giving an appearance of real economic growth even as living standards stagnate for lower middling classes additionally gdp totally misses ecosystem collapse by abuse misuse overuse which is only noticed by the general public after it s way too late when it s easily noticeable even by those of low self esteem that blindly follow tyrannical maniacs hmm according to stiglitz the world is facing three existential crises 1 a climate crisis 2 an inequality crisis and 3 a crisis in democracy yet the accepted ways by which we measure economic performance gives absolutely no hint that we might be facing a problem accordingly politicians see positive gdp numbers which inspires them to continue with the status quo meaning they do not focus on key aspects for sustainability as well as human well being gdp does not compute environmental degradation gdp does not register societal divisions that build tension over massive wealth disparity and gdp overlooks calculations of lowered standards of living for the abandoned middle class as they increasingly deploy mountain loads of debt to support bogus lifestyles according to pew research center in real terms average hourly earnings peaked more than 45 years ago source for most u s workers real wages have barely budged in decades pew research center august 7 2018 where s prosperity furthermore according to stiglitz if growth is not sustainable because we are destroying the environment and using up scarce natural resources our statistics should warn us if we measure the wrong thing we will do the wrong thing stiglitz s new book with co authors french economists jeapaul fitoussi and martine durand discusses alternative metrics that more properly account for details like sustainability as well as how people feel about their lives in other words gdp does not paint a true life picture rather it s a wobbly ghostly statistic that measures business activity without consideration for humanity or ecology begging the question what s really important in life gdp numbers do not hint at trouble with 1 sustainability of resources 2 climate crises or 3 the well being of the people yet all three are crucial issues under stress like never before as an interesting side note according to jorgen randers a global forecast for the next forty years 2052 a report to club of rome commemorating the 40th anniversary of the limits to growth chelsea green publishing 2012 there s already a shift away from the use of gdp the sustainability revolution has already begun the new paradigm already emerged forty years ago or perhaps even fifty with rachel carson in 1962 it has spread since but it is still not mainstream we have evolved an increased understanding of the need to replace fossil energy but we have not really embarked on the challenge and some even in high places have started to talk seriously about the need to replace gdp growth with growth in well being as the overriding societal goal randers pg 13 furthermore gdp totally misses crucial points supporting societal existence from an ecological perspective as stated by christopher o clugston s blip humanity s 300 year self terminating experiment with industrialism booklocker press 2019 the premise of blip is that increasingly pervasive global nonrenewable natural resource nnr scarcity is causing faltering global human prosperity which is causing increasing global political instability economic fragility and societal unrest this scenario will intensity during the coming decades and culminate in humanity s self inflicted global societal species collapse almost certainly by the year 2050 gdp does not calculate does not represent and does not hint at the scarcity value associated with overuse abuse of natural resources accompanied by egregious planet wide degradation e g the gooey tar sands in alberta canada this is the world s most destructive oil operation and it s growing national geographic 2019 the missing gdp calculations result in cultural upheaval as people increasingly hit the streets in protest aware that something is not right and the canadian tar sands are proof positive that something is way way way off course it literally frightens the daylights out of people that seriously contemplate future prospects for society it s an actual horror story in the making in full operation and actually celebrated by neoliberal

open this photo in gallery mark carney governor of the bank of england at the bank s headquarters in london england on dec 19 2019 mr carney is probably one of the highest paid civil servants in the world francesca jones the globe and mail bank of england governor mark carney is in a sense already history he has stood for his portrait outgoing governors of britain s most powerful non elected job usually avoid the less intrepid sitting position the oil painting by brendan kelly will be hung shortly after mr carney s departure from the bank in march like everything inside the bank which was founded in 1694 and is fondly known among many employees as hogwarts the portrait s display will follow an ancient tradition it will replace the painting of his predecessor mervyn king in the neoclassical parlour outside the governor s office mr king s portrait above the fireplace will simply shift one spot to the left as will that of his predecessor eddie george and so on mr carney will look like a youngster compared with some of the grizzled old men who adorn the walls the former governor of the bank of canada is 54 and trim he doesn t look much older than the day he started the job in july 2013 almost three years before the brexit referendum that bitterly split britain barring a bit more grey and the small bald patch forming at the back of his head the point being he has another career in him so what will it be mr carney doesn t much like the question no doubt because the gossip machine spits out his name every few years as a contender for the leadership of the liberal party of canada the chatter has intensified since prime minister justin trudeau lost his majority in the october election i want to sleep mr carney says laughing i look forward to coming home we re going back to canada we still have our house in ottawa ottawa itself is a clue that he might have public life in mind and if he goes in that direction a high flyer like him is clearly not aiming for minister of corner stores or ambassador to costa rica only a couple of weeks after we met mr carney did indeed fill in part of his post bank of england agenda the secretary general of the united nations antonio guterres appointed him un special envoy for climate action and finance an apparent reward for leading an effort to create a global task force in 2015 to ensure that banks insurers and industrial companies can survive financial stress from potentially catastrophic climate change mr carney replaces former new york mayor michael bloomberg mr bloomberg now a contender for the democratic nomination in the u s presidential race informally handed the role over to him in december at the un s climate summit in madrid but the role is unpaid and part time meaning mr carney still has some big career decisions to make charlotte hogg another youngish high flyer who was the first chief operating officer of the bank of england from 2013 to 2017 told me from the london offices of visa europe where she is chief executive officer that mr carney seems destined for another big name job he will do something amazing she says he has so much to contribute he s immensely able he will change the world whatever he does a political career would seem fitting admirers and detractors alike say he injected what they call political elements into his bank of england career by immersing himself in the brexit and climate change files to the point that the mundane world of monetary policy sometimes seemed secondary mr carney insists he never breached the bank s neutrality nor strayed from its core mandate to ensure price and financial stability but some critics including former members of the bank s all powerful monetary policy committee mpc argue that he embraced mission creep i think he found it quite difficult to distinguish between his role as an independent central banker and his political role says andrew sentance the british economist who was an mpc member from 2006 to 2011 somehow he merged the two together of course climate change is a very important issue mark carney sort of weaved it into his role in a political way he wasn t within his remit to be honest tony yates a former bank of england economist questions mr carney s focus on climate why pick climate change he says climate change is a risk but i don t think it s immediate it s a very long term risk much more immediate risk to the banks is say political risk so he could have set up a unit in the financial risk area called political risk and financial instability there is no doubt that climate change emerged as mr carney s defining issue in recent years more so than fiddling with interest rates which he hardly did at all they stayed at or near rock bottom levels throughout his tenure greenies around the world like him a lot i keep prying mr carney about his career plans and a few clues do emerge i do think issues about the environment and the new economy are fundamental and obviously they are particularly critical in canada and it s very important we get them right back home he says there are a set of issues i would like to be involved in in some way but how exactly academically or commercially or some other manner trading london for ottawa is bound to be a shock for mr carney his british born wife diana she and mr carney met at oxford university and their four teenage daughters mr carney is probably one of the highest paid civil servants in the world in addition to his base salary of 480 000 three times what the u k prime minister gets he receives an annual housing allowance of 250 000 his pension plan taxable benefits and other goodies including the housing allowance took the haul in the past fiscal year to 884 000 1 5 million according to the bank of england s annual report replicating that income in canada won t be easy unless he plunges back into investment banking mr carney spent 13 years at goldman sachs before joining the bank of canada as deputy governor in 2003 his opulent work settings will be impossible to replicate to an outsider his bank of england digs really do seem like a hogwarts fantasy the massive bank of england site in the city of london the financial centre covers 3 5 acres and the high exterior stone walls make it look like a fortress its warren of buildings and courtyards mostly date from the early 20th century although bits of it are far older holed up inside are 4 500 employees who do everything from monitoring reams of commercial bank and insurance company data and measuring inflation rates to guarding the subterranean gold bullion vaults and designing new banknotes visitors are greeted by a steward in a pink jacket and a black top hat the pink is known as houblon pink after sir john houblon the bank s first governor 1694 1697 why that colour was associated with him has been lost to history on a grey day in mid november i am escorted to the governor s parlours on the main floor where the corridors are covered in elaborate roman inspired mosaics mr carney looking dapper in a blue suit comes bounding out to greet me before our interview he gives me a quick tour of his corner of the bank the office is vast its walls covered in oil paintings not one of which is a rendition of montagu norman the baron who was governor of the bank from 1920 to 1944 thirteen renditions of norman paintings mosaics statues are scattered throughout the bank and mr carney decided the one in his office could go i lent it to george osborne mr carney says referring to the anti brexit former chancellor of the exchequer who lured mr carney to britain from the bank of canada where he became the bank of england s first non british governor in 2013 mr carney acquired british and irish passports the office overlooks a grassy courtyard that used to be a churchyard in addition to a beehive and yes a statue of mr norman it is home to four mulberry trees they too are historically significant britain s first banknotes issued at the end of the 17th century were made from dark paper sheets derived from the trees bark deep below the courtyard lie 400 000 bars of gold worth more than 200 billion it is the second biggest stash of gold in the world after the new york federal reserve s and off limits to the public mr carney arrived at a time that might now be described as peak central bank never before had central bankers had so much independence and power they could shape entire financial and economic systems by setting interest rates flooding markets with liquidity through the mass purchases of sovereign and corporate bonds known as quantitative easing and regulating banks and insurers to make sure that their collapse would not jeopardize savers or cost taxpayers billions royal bank of scotland briefly the world s biggest bank was rescued by the british government in the 2008 financial crisis and remains 62 per cent owned by the state central banks at least in the western world have gained their independence only in recent decades for a long time many of them were the lapdogs of finance ministers if the politicians wanted to juice the economy ahead of an election they would arrange a cozy little fireside chat with the central bank governor and suggest an interest rate cut even if it risked triggering inflation resistance was futile the bank of england didn t get final say on interest rates until 1997 when tony blair s new labour government decided politicians should not be trusted with monetary policy the government would stick with fiscal policy spending and taxation but the bank lost commercial bank supervision powers those powers and then some were restored after the 2008 financial crisis when the british banking system all but collapsed and the government went into bailout mode mr carney admits he wasn t tested in the same way that mr king or mario draghi who was president of the european central bank until this past october were tested the former steered the british financial system out of trouble after the failure of lehman brothers in 2008 the latter led the ecb through a euro debt crisis in 2011 and 2012 that came close to shredding the common currency and seeing grexit the departure of greece from the euro zone still mr carney says he was challenged to the hilt when i showed up then i viewed the role as reforming the institution reforming the financial sector and getting the economy growing so fixing three things if you will he made considerable progress in all three areas he made no strategic errors says economist charles goodhart professor emeritus at the london school of economics and a former member of the bank of england s mpc he says mr carney performed especially well on the financial stability side in the wake of the financial crisis shoring up the financial system the bank of england through the financial policy committee invented tough new stress tests for the british banks to ensure they could endure a lehman style meltdown without going belly up to make them more resilient they now hold three and a half times more capital than they did before the financial crisis giving them a comfortable shock absorbing cushion and hold 1 trillion in liquid assets more than four times the precrisis level we have a financial sector that is 10 times gdp canada s is two times gdp so we can t afford another crisis with the knock on effects to u k gdp that we saw before mr carney says pushing the bank of england into the 21st century culturally speaking is a work in progress the bank was ridden with management silos overly bureaucratic stuffed with powerless committees and of course dominated by white men mr carney cut the number of internal committees from 78 to 24 and installed an amazon inspired decision making system which insisted on short memos written in concise english that everyone had to read before meetings we make decisions like amazon now we ask alexa should we raise interest rates today mr carney jokes diversity targets were put in place to overcome the embarrassing lack of women and ethnic minorities at every level the proportion of women in senior levels has almost doubled to 32 per cent the goal is 35 per cent by 2020 but the number of senior employees in the bame category black asian minority ethnic is still short of the target of 13 per cent by 2022 a few very senior women left during mr carney s era including u s economist kristin forbes now of mit s sloan school of management who was a rare rebel voice on the bank of england s mpc minouche shafik who was deputy governor reportedly did not get along with mr carney and was touted in the media as a contender to replace him in december the government appointed bank of england alumnus andrew bailey ceo of the financial conduct authority britain s financial services regulator as his replacement neither woman would talk to the globe and mail the views on mr carney s role as chairman of the nine member mpc charged with keeping consumer price inflation at two per cent are somewhat mixed under his leadership the mpc pursued a cautious steady as she goes strategy when mr carney arrived in 2013 the bank s base rate was at 0 5 per cent in august 2016 two months after the brexit referendum the mpc dropped the rate to a record low of 0 25 per cent to help calm the markets since then the committee has raised the rate twice taking it to 0 75 per cent that s it in six and a half years under mr carney s leadership there have been only three rate moves one down two up mr goodhart of the london school of economics finds no faults in the mpc s track record given the relatively low gdp growth and moderate inflation but other observers think the mpc kept rates too low for too long when rates are at rock bottom the central bank effectively loses its main recession fighting tool because it has run out of room to reduce them further the brexit referendum in 2016 split britons into leavers and remainers contrary to predictions among remainers that the british economy would fall off a cliff after a vote to leave project fear as it was dubbed it held up fairly well there has been only one quarter of negative growth since mid 2016 although the expansion is slow the european commission expects british gdp to grow 1 3 per cent this year when growth is positive and unemployment is falling pressure generally mounts on central bankers to raise interest rates mr carney had said in 2013 that rates would stay at historic lows at least until unemployment dipped below 7 per cent which it did in 2014 the jobless rate in britain has plummeted since the crisis years and is now at a 44 year low of 3 8 per cent yet interest rates have barely moved up mr sentance who was one of the most hawkish members of the mpc during his era says mr carney seemed to lack the will to raise rates even though the economic data suggested he could start bringing them back to normal that is non crisis levels i think he was frightened he says in 2013 and 2014 he had a great opportunity then brexit came along and he was very influenced by the political agenda david blanchflower the british american economist at new hampshire s dartmouth college who served on the mpc from 2006 to 2009 says the committee was guilty of groupthink the lack of dissenting voices under mr carney s leadership although he admits those voices have always been rarities at the mpc everyone on the committee has been irrelevant he says he should have been encouraging more debate brexit emerged as a lightning rod when mr carney testified before parliamentarians in march 2016 three months before the referendum leavers accused the governor and the bank of exaggerating the economic downside a month before the vote mr carney warned that brexit could possibly include a technical recession mr carney has kept up his warnings in late 2018 the bank predicted that a disorderly departure from the european union could shave 8 per cent from gdp this past september however mr carney told a parliamentary committee that the bank expected the economy to shrink by just 5 5 per cent in a worst case no deal brexit crash out scenario all the bank s brexit scenarios have been dismissed as scaremongering by the leavers who say they leave no doubt that mr carney is a liberal remainer arch brexiteer jacob rees mogg government leader in the house of commons called for mr carney s head in late 2018 telling the bbc that he was a second tier canadian politician even mr carney s predecessor mr king couldn t resist taking an indirect swipe before the referendum official economic projections intended to scare the country into voting remain didn t succeed mr king wrote in a bloomberg opinion piece it saddens me to see the bank of england unnecessarily drawn into this project in the three and a half years since the referendum the economy did not go into recession nor did job growth stall of course brexit has yet to happen grim economic news may lie ahead when britain leaves the eu at the end of january as prime minister boris johnson has promised or fails to strike a trade and services deal with the eu by his imposed deadline of december 2020 mr carney absolutely denies he was straying into the political realm he argues that it was the bank s duty to present its views on the risks surrounding the potential forms of brexit hard soft or somewhere in between parliament he notes demanded the bank s views and they were duly delivered he was doing his job i ve been a central bank governor in crisis times for almost 13 years he says i ve been through the global financial crisis i ve been through several euro crises i have been through the scottish and brexit referenda and what you have to do in all these situations is stick to your remit and make the right call and sometimes that makes for uncomfortable identification of risk and people often don t thank you for the actions taken that often mitigate those risks mr carney was referring to the bank of england s pledge that it would provide ample liquidity if needed to help overcome the shock of the brexit vote the crisis management worked sterling fell the day after the referendum but there was no financial panic but he also notes that britain s economy did in fact substantially underperform the g7 countries after the referendum investment shrank the pound fell growth slowed and inflation climbed all this even before britain had hit the road after january a brexit induced recession is not out of the question the bank of england s brexit warnings may yet come to pass i ask mr carney if he will admit to being a remainer now that his term is up i have no opinion on it he says mr carney does have opinions and lots of them on climate change those opinions have helped make him a british and international superstar but they have led to further accusations that he jeopardized his political neutrality mr carney thinks that unless banks and insurers the financial system in general prepare for climate change they could be in for a nasty shock financially speaking climate change has been something close to an obsession for him since he arrived at the bank of england in 2013 he stepped up his climate efforts in 2015 when he was chairman of the financial stability board fsb the group of 20 body that monitors the global financial system s health his first significant climate speech was delivered to the lloyd s of london insurance market that september it was called breaking the tragedy on the horizon climate change and financial stability mr carney identified several big climate risks one was physical risk such as catastrophic flooding in which paying claims might destroy an insurer another was transition risk the risks involved in shifting to a low or zero carbon economy and the spending needed to do it largely eliminating fossil fuels could turn oil companies into investment pariahs and leave them with stranded assets oil gas and coal reserves left undeveloped and therefore worthless as temperatures rise fossil fuel producers and their bankers could also face lawsuits for misleading investors over the risk of climate change the result was the task force on climate related financial disclosures tcfd which was launched by mr carney and mr bloomberg mr carney has effectively turned his tcfd appearances around the world into a second career in an interview at the madrid climate summit in early december he said the disclosures that have followed tcfd guidelines have succeeded beyond our expectations today about 80 per cent of the biggest 1 100 global companies disclose climate related risks in line with tcfd reporting guidelines and three quarters of major investors such as pension funds are using tcfd data to help make investment decisions firms that align their business models with the transition to net zero will be rewarded handsomely mr carney said during a madrid appearance those that fail to adapt will cease to exist mr carney s climate crusade earned him rock star status but also bolstered the view among his critics that he was a political animal mr yates the former bank of england economist and mr sentance the former mpc member applaud mr carney for identifying the potential dangers of rapid climate change but both are puzzled as to why he focused on it so intently given that the financial system at any one time might face more immediate risks such as the us 1 2 trillion leveraged loan market which some analysts call a ticking time bomb he talked about climate change women s rights equal opportunity inequality socially responsible capitalism mr yates says when you stack all of those things up together it discredits his position as governor i think he has done quite a lot of damage to the institution because of it speeches should be tedious and technocratic and you shouldn t be able to figure out what party he would vote for with carney it oozes from him all the time he speaks the two men think that mr carney in part used brexit and climate change to raise his profile to prepare for a political career at his level that might centre on taking a shot at replacing justin trudeau as liberal leader remember he is moving back to ottawa a liberal party insider who spoke on condition that his name not be revealed says the party has approached mr carney a couple of times to test his interest one approach was made after michael ignatieff resigned as liberal leader in 2011 we needed a leader who wanted to return this party to relevancy he says mark is unquestionably someone who is interested in public life he s extraordinarily skilled and experienced but the insider says mr carney would now have tough potential competition from deputy prime minister chrystia freeland among others and his long absence from canada might hurt him in the way it hurt mr ignatieff he ll have a price to pay if he wants to go for it the insider says like giving talks in church basements and tim hortons in the middle of winter at the end of the interview i ask mr carney again what he might do in canada he rattles off a string of issues that are close to his heart and are particularly critical in canada including globalization equality the environment and the transition to a new cleaner economy and stresses that he wants to return to canada because i m canadian it s a non answer that carries a big hint there s really only one job in canada that can give him the power to shape canada s future your time is valuable have the top business headlines

even as the federal debt heads toward the highest level since world war ii trump 2016 campaign adviser arthur laffer is less worried about the fiscal situation than he was in the obama years laffer the economist widely regarded as the father of supply side economics said that president trump is right to have the federal government borrow money now while interest rates and the cost of the debt service are low to pay for his policies from my standpoint the debt and deficits today are less worrisome than they were three or four years ago the 79 year old former adviser to president ronald reagan told the washington examiner laffer s view of the federal debt is at odds with that of many mainstream economists who warn that the government s fiscal course is unsustainable with federal debt held by the public at 78 of gross domestic product and annual deficits projected to exceed economic growth indefinitely federal reserve chairman jerome powell for example has said that congress and the president should address the debt now while unemployment is low and the economy is healthy rather than during some future crisis in fact deficit reduction was a shared bipartisan goal for most of the 2010s even when the economy wasn t strong president barack obama backed a mix of tax hikes and spending cuts to lower deficits while the tea party influenced gop hammered him as a big spender and called for more aggressive spending cuts one particular influence in raising the alarm about the federal debt was a 2010 paper from harvard economist kenneth rogoff and then university of maryland economist carmen reinhart in which they concluded that economic growth slows when federal debt rises above 90 when you look at ken rogoff s book waah waah waah he was sitting there crying like a baby in a nursery said laffer referring to the rogoff reinhart book this time is different debt is a tool it s neither a good nor a bad the time to borrow he said is when the government can get favorable terms in the past decade interest rates on government debt have fallen consequently the cost of servicing the debt is low despite the large amount of debt about 1 5 of gdp less than it was during the recession and about half what it was in the 1990s laffer who advised trump on his 2016 campaign tax reform proposal and is a longtime collaborator with top white house economic adviser larry kudlow said that the administration isn t wrong to preside over larger deficits although he does believe that trump should and will cut spending trump though regularly condemned obama for the rising debt and ran on a platform of shrinking that debt in fact in early 2016 he pledged to eliminate the federal debt then 19 trillion instead the total debt has already passed 23 trillion but as trump has signed more government funding bills that increase spending and deficits have risen accordingly kudlow and other administration officials have downplayed the necessity of addressing the debt laffer argued that they are on the right course given low interest costs just as bill clinton was right in the late 1990s to run surpluses when the cost of servicing the debt was high many democrats aware that successive republican administrations have pursued deficit financed tax cuts are increasingly in favor of presidents enacting major new programs without offsetting them with spending cuts or tax hikes but with a democrat rather than trump in the oval office freshman rep alexandria ocasio cortez for instance has called for implementing a green new deal without necessarily offsetting its cost calling it a mistaken idea that such a plan would have to be fully paid for in taxes ocasio cortez subscribes to a heterodox economic theory known as modern monetary theory which posits that governments because they can create their own money are constrained in spending only by inflation mmt as it s known has been popularized by former adviser to sen bernie sanders stephanie kelton some democrats have also argued that they would put themselves at a disadvantage by not matching republicans in adding to the deficit to pursue their policy goals liberals rebelled against house speaker nancy pelosi s plan to institute a pay as you go rule for the 116th congress that would require offsets for spending bills such a rule would be a terrible policy that unilaterally disarms the incoming democratic majority s ability to govern liberal rep ro khanna of california said at the time laffer though is happy to see trump pursue his agenda through higher deficits just as the reagan administration of which he was a part did what we did is we borrowed shitloads of money excuse me pooploads of money and invested it in lower tax rates to create more incentives to produce increase output to sell to produce we put it into a strong dollar in the foreign exchanges he said we did all of that and we then sat back and prayed that it would work
markets will get back into full gear next week as traders return from their festive breaks and the economic data start rolling again the spotlight will be on the nonfarm payrolls report in the united states but key indicators out of the eurozone china canada and japan should also attract attention with the trade optimism setting the market mood at the end of 2019 and the start of 2020 there s a risk the incoming data may not support the brightening picture that many investors have embraced lately setting the stage for a possible correction aussie eyes domestic and chinese data as rally loses steam the australian dollar managed to reverse its huge losses from the third quarter to end 2019 only slightly in the red against its us counterpart but the impressive rally since october is already showing signs of exhaustion and if next week s data prove uninspiring the sell off could deepen looking at the domestic releases they will consist of the aig manufacturing index for december on monday november building approvals on wednesday the trade balance on thursday and retail sales numbers for november on friday australia s reliance on china for its exports means aussie traders will also be watching chinese price gauges due on thursday the consumer price index cpi in china jumped to the highest in eight years in november but markets largely ignored the spike as it was mainly down to soaring pork prices and a bigger concern is the continued weakness in producer prices the producer price index ppi edged up only marginally in november to 1 4 year on year reflecting weak demand for factory goods the us and china agreed a phase one trade deal in december and any pickup in the ppi in the coming months could be attributed to this though it would be too soon for it to impact the december reading a rebound in japanese consumption consumer spending slumped in japan in october as the sales tax went up from 8 to 10 the drop in household spending was almost as bad as in 2014 when the sales tax was last hiked triggering a recession however although the broader impact on the economy is not anticipated to be as severe as it was in 2014 growth remains under pressure from the trade frictions that have had a devastating effect on manufacturers globally particularly the car industry hence it will be crucial for consumption to bounce back quickly to prevent japan s economy from slipping into recession the household spending numbers for november are due on friday and before that the latest wage growth figures will be watched on wednesday but as is typical for japanese data the reaction in the yen is expected to be limited as until the bank of japan signals it is ready to beef up its already massive stimulus program nothing will change in terms of the outlook for monetary policy eurozone inflation to tick higher the euro closed 2019 on a more positive tone than how it began and despite ending the year nowhere year its starting point there are signs that the long drawn out downtrend has finally bottomed out easing trade tensions which in turn have put a dent in the us dollar are one of the factors bolstering the single currency but there have also been some tepid signs of green shoots in the eurozone economy next week s data could further add to the evidence of an improving growth picture starting with the final services pmi readings for december and the sentix index for january on monday there will be more business surveys on wednesday with the economic sentiment indicator which is forecast to have edged up to 101 5 in december the other important releases are november retail sales and the flash inflation estimates for december on tuesday there was some good news for the european central bank last month when both the headline and underlying measures of inflation headed higher the headline rate is forecast to have risen further increasing from 1 0 to 1 3 year on year in december but the two core rates are expected to have stayed unchanged also coming under investors radar will be industrial data out of germany industrial orders and production figures are due on wednesday and thursday respectively both are forecast to show positive growth for november after contracting in october any disappointment in these numbers would question whether a recovery is really underway in europe s largest economy and possibly undermine the euro s latest attempt at a rebound last but not least the ecb will publish the account of its december policy meeting on thursday first nfp report of 2020 much to be excited about with the us china trade deal now temporarily out of the way the focus in early 2020 will be on whether the us economy will be able to regain some momentum or if it will be stuck in the slow lane one thing s for certain there will be no shortage of data next week to give investors a fresh glimpse into the health of the economy first up are the trade balance and factory orders on tuesday both for november as well as the ism non manufacturing pmi after two consecutive months of declines factory orders rose by 0 3 m m in october they are forecast to maintain a positive trend in november to rise by 0 2 there could be more upbeat numbers from the ism non manufacturing composite the closely watched barometer for services sentiment and activity has been on a downpath since the end of 2018 but may now finally be stabilizing the index is expected to have increased from 53 9 to 54 5 in december moving to the highlight of the week the nonfarms payrolls report for december will hit the markets on friday with the headline figure projected to come in at 165k this would represent a slowdown from november s 266k print which had been boosted by one off factors such as the end of the general motors strike the unemployment rate is forecast to have remained at 3 5 and average hourly earnings are also anticipated to have held steady at 3 1 y y better than expected numbers are unlikely to provide much of a boost to the dollar as the federal reserve has made it clear it will not be in a rush to raise interest rates if the data starts to improve on the other hand any negative surprises could deepen the downside pressure facing the greenback currently having ended 2019 on the backfoot jobs report in focus in canada too while the late 2019 risk rally has been bruising for the us dollar it s been a boon for commodity linked currencies such as the canadian dollar the combination of rising risk appetite and higher oil prices have propelled the loonie to 14 month highs and those gains could continue next week if the december employment report due on friday doesn t disappoint the canadian economy is forecast to have added 20k jobs in december which would be a big improvement on the shockingly hefty 71 2 jobs lost in the prior month

mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador has extended the occasional olive branch to the business community without delivering what it wants over the past few months mexican president andres manuel lopez obrador has made a bit of a show of cozying up to people in what he used to call the mafia of power he took the stage with carlos slim the country s richest person at a news conference he stood with leaders of two of the biggest business groups as he declared the private sector crucial to growth he tweeted a photo of himself with the head of italy s eni which has an oil drilling project in tabasco state the twitter post intrigued the investors and analysts reading the national palace tea leaves stirring speculation the president would lift his controversial embargo on oil field auctions which had brought in billions of dollars in foreign investment advertisement this was wishful thinking amlo as the president is known has extended the occasional olive branch to the business community without delivering what it wants which is basically a return to the more business friendly policies of his predecessor enrique peña nieto investors remain skittish as lopez obrador enters his second year in office with the country convulsed by violent crime and drug cartel turf wars the mexican economy is in a slump and many forecasts for 2020 are grim ernesto revilla citigroup inc s head of latin american economics and a former chief economist at the finance ministry expects the economy to grow just 1 in 2020 the second worst performance since 2009 the worst 2019 to have a more positive outlook and scenario going forward you would need a dramatic change in investor sentiment revilla said the majority of the private sector in mexico is still skeptical before his landslide election in july 2018 lopez obrador provoked anxiety among the corporate elite as he disparagingly called it dismissing big business people as traffickers of influence since his inauguration in december 2018 he has done little to calm their nerves two of his shock moves were scuttling a new 13 billion airport for mexico city that had been under construction for three years and was one third complete and demanding natural gas companies renegotiate long ago signed pipeline contracts advertisement then there was the moratorium on oil field auctions peña nieto had opened up the once vital sector to try to kick some new life into it the country s output has been falling for 15 years and state owned petroleos mexicanos is the world s most indebted oil company renewing the oil rounds would be a very positive piece of news that would generate confidence said gustavo de hoyos the head of coparmex which represents 36 000 companies in mexico and a frequent critic of the president i don t have any indication that it s going to happen one reason lopez obrador may be reluctant to change course on the auctions is fear of upsetting the leftist wing of the diverse movement that backs him rocio nahle the energy minister has championed the state s historic primary role in producing crude lopez obrador is wary of making decisions that could tip the balance in his cabinet and among his base according to one person close to him it s not all bad news in the economy inflation is near the central bank s 3 target less than half what it was two years ago the national government will likely have another primary budget surplus next year multinationals that have operated in mexico for decades haven t abandoned the country foreign direct investment grew by 7 8 in the first three quarters of the year the replacement for the north american free trade agreement could soon go into effect on the other hand gross fixed investment has fallen an average of 5 monthly from a year earlier under lopez obrador domestic companies don t trust the administration will respect the rule of law and not pull the rug out from under them according to interviews with six executives who declined to speak on the record for fear of reprisals advertisement that s an unfounded concern said jesus ramirez lopez obrador s spokesman it is a government for all both the public sector and private sector he said the two have to agree on common strategies to shore up the economy so that there s economic growth and that there are jobs lopez obrador has pledged to lift economic growth to 4 and to spend 44 billion on infrastructure to help get there with most of the capital coming from the private sector participation of the private sector in the country s growth is necessary he said when he unveiled the package which includes highway railway port airport and telecommunications projects that could be a catalyst for economic development slim who owns or has stakes in mexican consumer goods mining construction and real estate ventures said that day but analysts complained that details were scarce and the s p bmv ipc stock index fell 1 6 the day the plan was announced the national infrastructure plan is a step in the right direction but is unlikely to be a catalyst for mexico to exit its investment limbo morgan stanley analyst nikolaj lippman said in a research report if the administration is ever going to win the trust of business it will take more effort and time revilla said most of the slowdown in the economy in 2019 can be traced to internal factors and the cancellation of the airport the initial confidence shock was big enough to scare investment away for some time
let s address an elephant in the room the rapidly expanding federal debt each annual deficit raises the total debt and forces the treasury to issue more debt in hopes someone will buy it the u s government ran a 343 billion deficit in the first two months of fiscal 2020 october and november and the 12 month budget deficit again surpassed 1 trillion federal spending rose 7 from a year earlier while tax receipts grew only 3 no problem some say we owe it to ourselves and anyway people will always buy uncle sam s debt that is unfortunately not true foreign treasury buyers are turning away the foreign buyers on whom we have long depended are turning away as peter boockvar noted foreign selling of u s notes and bonds continued in october by a net 16 7b this brings the year to date selling to 99b with much driven by liquidations from the chinese and japanese it was back in 2011 and 2012 when in each year foreigners bought over 400b worth thus it is domestically where we are now financing our ever increasing budget deficits the fed now has also become a big part of the monetization process via its purchases of t bills which also drives banks into buying notes the fed s balance sheet is now 335b higher than it was in september at 4 095 trillion again however the fed wants to define what it s doing market participants view this as qe4 with all the asset price inflation that comes along with qe programs it will be real interesting to see what happens in 2020 to the repo market when the fed tries to end its injections and how markets respond when its balance sheet stops increasing in size it s so easy to get involved and so difficult to leave declining foreign purchases are in part a consequence of the trade war the dollars china and japan use to buy our t bills are the same dollars we pay them for our imported goods but interest and exchange rates also matter with rates negative or lower than ours in most of the developed world the us had been the best parking place but in the last year other central banks started looking for a nirp exit higher rate expectations elsewhere combined with stable or falling u s rates give foreign buyers who must also pay for currency hedges less incentive to buy u s debt if you live in a foreign country and have a particular need for its local currency an extra 1 in yield isn t worth the risk of losing even more in the exchange rate i know some think china or other countries are opting out of the u s treasury market for political reasons but it s simply business the math just doesn t work especially when president trump is explicitly saying he wants the dollar to weaken and interest rates go even lower if you are in country x why would you do that trade you might if you re in a country like argentina or venezuela where the currency is toast anyway but europe japan china the rest of the developed world it s a coin toss the fed began cutting rates in july funding pressures emerged weeks later coincidence i suspect not the fed started monetizing debt it sure looks like through qe4 and other activities the fed is taking the first steps toward monetizing our debt if so many more steps are ahead because the debt is only going to get worse as you can see from the chart below the fed is well on its way to reversing that 2018 quantitative tightening luke gromen of forest for the trees is one of my favorite macro thinkers he thinks the monetization plan will get more obvious in early 2020 those that believe that the fed will begin undoing what it has done since september after the year end turn are either going to be proven right or they are going to be proven wrong in q1 2020 we strongly believe they will be proven wrong if when they are the fftt view that the fed is committed to financing u s deficits with its balance sheet may go from a fringe view to the mainstream both parties in congress are committed to more spending no matter who is in the white house they will encourage the federal reserve to engage in more quantitative easing so the deficit spending can continue and even grow the next recession whenever it happens will bring a 2 trillion deficit meaning a 40 trillion dollar national debt by the end of the decade at least 20 trillion of which will be on the fed s balance sheet my side bet is that in 2030 we will look back and see that i was an optimist sometime in the middle to late 2020s we will see a great reset that profoundly changes everything you know about money and investing crisis isn t simply coming we are already in the early stages of it i think we will look back at late 2019 as the beginning this period will be rough but survivable if we prepare now in fact it will bring lots of exciting opportunities the great reset the collapse of the biggest bubble in history new york times best seller and renowned financial expert john mauldin predicts an unprecedented financial crisis that could be triggered in the next five years most investors seem completely unaware of the relentless pressure that s building right now learn more here
trade uncertainty clouds 2020 outlook published friday january 3 2020 some room for optimism abounds the u s rural economy will continue to face headwinds in 2020 and is expected to underperform relative to the economy of urban america since 2014 gdp growth in rural counties has averaged almost 1 percent less than in urban counties that trend is likely to continue without a significant upswing in agricultural commodity prices energy exploration rural manufacturing and other industries upon which rural economic growth depend despite that bearish prognosis there is room for optimism according to a comprehensive 2020 outlook report from cobank s knowledge exchange division the u s farm economy has demonstrated its resiliency in the face of trade wars extreme weather and other disruptive events while the downside impact of trade disputes and tariffs will remain severe for many some agriculture sectors will see stronger exports and higher prices rising animal protein and dairy exports will be a bright spot for producers in 2020 most current signals indicate the overall domestic economy is on firm footing thanks almost exclusively to the consumer said dan kowalski vice president of cobank s knowledge exchange division however without a meaningful u s china trade deal the u s agricultural economy will continue to struggle with uncertainty in 2020 the cobank 2020 outlook report examines 10 key factors that will shape agriculture and market sectors that serve and impact rural communities throughout the u s after a year of trade tensions declining gdp and the slowest global economic growth since the depths of the financial crisis the world s leading economies hope to turn the page in 2020 the prognosis however offers little to support such optimism consumer strength the world over has prevented further slowing in the global economy the direction and severity of the u s china trade dispute will continue to have the most significant influence on the world economy in 2020 a leveling off of trade tensions would allow global economic growth to bottom out in early 2020 before showing signs of life later in the year however the vulnerable state of the global economy makes it susceptible to contraction if trade conditions worsen the u s economy will enter 2020 decisively split powered by a resilient and confident consumer but hamstrung by a risk averse business sector that has stopped investing now that stimulus effects from the 2017 tax reform and the 2018 spending bill have faded the economic expansion will show its age losing steam in the coming year there is evidence that since 2017 more people including those in rural communities have broadly shared the benefits of economic growth despite the continual rise in wealth inequality all eyes will be on the central banks as the world inches closer to the end of the longest period of economic growth in history japan and europe are still stimulating their economies with negative interest rates and quantitative easing after three rate cuts in 2019 the u s federal reserve is holding a more conservative stance with its target rate near 1 5 percent china has the most room to maneuver with its short term rate just under 3 percent all these accommodative stances are made possible because inflation remains inexplicably low despite tightening labor markets federal reserve chair powell s role in 2020 is to keep the late stage expansion going while simultaneously preparing for the recession that will arrive sooner or later agricultural policy at the federal level has been wrought with uncertainty and volatility the trade environment for 2020 remains hazy as well beyond a possible u s china phase one deal more progress with china will be a challenge as a result it is difficult to see trade as a bright spot in 2020 the atmosphere in washington today has given way to progress on agricultural labor legislation and the usmca but a protracted partisan fight over impeachment is on tap in the senate this rancor makes it difficult to advance legislation that helps agriculture which would give either side a win for the hotly contested 2020 election market facilitation program payments to farmers helped make up for persistently low commodity prices in the last year without a substantive u s china trade deal the u s agricultural economy will continue to struggle with trade uncertainty in 2020 as questions linger as to whether usda will continue to soften the blow of the trade war for farmers and ranchers with government payments amid persistently low commodity prices and rising costs u s farmers and ranchers continue to struggle with low and declining working capital farm debt already at record levels is expected to continue climbing as credit quality in farm loans declines particularly for grain and dairy producers however stable farm real estate values have helped farmers the resiliency of farmland values despite the steep drop in net farm income over the years has allowed farmers to restructure debt and address tight cash flow and liquidity crunches fruit nut and vegetable markets will continue to face rising production costs in 2020 due to mounting regulations particularly as they relate to controls over groundwater in california regulations under the state s sustainable groundwater management act sgma are about to go into effect and could potentially cause acreage shifts between crops of varying water needs other government action in 2020 could have a favorable impact on specialty crop growers the farm workforce modernization act currently being debated in congress is a hopeful sign for an improved regulatory environment for agricultural labor if passed it would help ease the tight labor supply plaguing agriculture challenges for the grain sector will persist in 2020 fueled by commodity price pressure policy uncertainty and export weakness amid growing global supply abundance especially for corn and soybeans u s wheat producers and exporters though may benefit from an improved export pace in 2020 with the russian wheat crop struggling biofuels also face challenges in 2020 u s ethanol production according to the u s energy information administration is expected to fall by 1 9 percent in 2019 to 15 8 billion gallons and remain flat in 2020 the outlook for farm supply companies is mixed and continues to be heavily influenced by weather to improve its value proposition this sector is actively pursuing vertical and horizontal consolidation with dairy and animal protein production looking toward another year of increased production in 2020 a rebound in exports will be critical to profitability in both sectors per capita consumption of animal protein in the u s will likely set a new record in 2019 overall dairy consumption in the u s will remain strong in 2020 as americans continue eating more cheese and butter but fluid milk will likely continue its long term decline strong demand and rising exports though will not erase financial stress at the farm level producers of beef pork poultry and dairy will likely experience stress from higher feed costs due to lower crop yields this fall companies throughout the electricity supply chain are likely to face heightened simultaneous demands for cleaner and less expensive power generation in 2020 these pressures reflect the intense popular concern about climate change wealth and income inequality and slowing economic growth three issues which americans rank as equally important in recent polling in many rural communities these concerns are likely to manifest in more numerous and more vehement calls for greater renewable power generation for utilities the task of justifying multi million dollar expenditures on new renewable resources will be easier in 2020 as the unsubsidized costs of solar wind battery energy storage and flexible natural gas fired resources continue to decline rural and regional telecommunications operators will become targets in 2020 for investors and strategic buyers as the pool of available mid sized fiber transport companies dries up demand for these companies has been so strong that valuations are reaching levels that were unthinkable a few years ago mergers and acquisition activity in rural markets should be brisk as the growth in data traffic offers attractive returns for investors and opportunities for strategic buyers to gain scale and access to new markets 2020 will also bring the launch of the rural digital opportunity fund rdof the latest broadband incentive program from the federal communications commissions and its largest effort to close the urban rural digital divide return to top of page

there s a problem with america s favorite statistic gdp it avoids pretty much everything that s actually truly really good for society including the importance of robust ecology still it s the biggest measure of what s happening with the economy and used around the world even though horribly flawed according to some forward thinkers gross domestic product gdp the monetary value of all finished goods and services is a distortion that needs fixing nobel winning economist joseph stiglitz s former chief economist of the world bank new book measuring what counts the global movement for well being the new press 2019 tackles the issue by exposing its paramount importance in judging how society gauges prosperity or alternatively the failure of prosperity e g one in eight americans 40 million is on food stamps during the longest economic expansion in memory and 40 50 of americans don t have 400 readily available for emergencies is this failed prosperity gdp distorts reality by giving an appearance of real economic growth even as living standards stagnate for lower middling classes additionally gdp totally misses ecosystem collapse by abuse misuse overuse which is only noticed by the general public after it s way too late when it s easily noticeable even by those of low self esteem that blindly follow tyrannical maniacs hmm according to stiglitz the world is facing three existential crises 1 a climate crisis 2 an inequality crisis and 3 a crisis in democracy yet the accepted ways by which we measure economic performance gives absolutely no hint that we might be facing a problem accordingly politicians see positive gdp numbers which inspires them to continue with the status quo meaning they do not focus on key aspects for sustainability as well as human well being gdp does not compute environmental degradation gdp does not register societal divisions that build tension over massive wealth disparity and gdp overlooks calculations of lowered standards of living for the abandoned middle class as they increasingly deploy mountain loads of debt to support bogus lifestyles according to pew research center in real terms average hourly earnings peaked more than 45 years ago for most u s workers real wages have barely budged in decades pew research center august 7 2018 where s prosperity furthermore according to stiglitz if growth is not sustainable because we are destroying the environment and using up scarce natural resources our statistics should warn us if we measure the wrong thing we will do the wrong thing stiglitz s new book with co authors french economists jeapaul fitoussi and martine durand discusses alternative metrics that more properly account for details like sustainability as well as how people feel about their lives in other words gdp does not paint a true life picture rather it s a wobbly ghostly statistic that measures business activity without consideration for humanity or ecology begging the question what s really important in life gdp numbers do not hint at trouble with 1 sustainability of resources 2 climate crises or 3 the well being of the people yet all three are crucial issues under stress like never before as an interesting side note according to jorgen randers 2052 a global forecast for the next forty years a report to club of rome commemorating the 40th anniversary of the limits to growth chelsea green publishing 2012 there s already a shift away from the use of gdp the sustainability revolution has already begun the new paradigm already emerged forty years ago or perhaps even fifty with rachel carson in 1962 it has spread since but it is still not mainstream we have evolved an increased understanding of the need to replace fossil energy but we have not really embarked on the challenge and some even in high places have started to talk seriously about the need to replace gdp growth with growth in well being as the overriding societal goal randers p 13 furthermore gdp totally misses crucial points supporting societal existence from an ecological perspective as stated by christopher o clugston s blip humanity s 300 year self terminating experiment with industrialism

donald trump is enjoying a burst of applause from the new trade agreement by our nation canada and mexico but he owes that applause in part to democrats who were looking out for american interests and he should hope americans don t come to understand the deep long term damage team trump is doing to our economy overall trump s trade policies notably on environmentally friendly electric generation equipment soybeans and intellectual property are big losers for america congressional democrats agreed to the revised usmc agreement only after changes were made at their insistence to improve opportunities and competitive conditions for american workers for example within a few years 40 to 45 percent of cars must be made in factories that pay workers at least 16 an hour a policy that affects only mexico where average auto worker pay is just 2 60 an hour showing they could negotiate and impeach at the same time house democrats approved the new trade agreement the day after voting to impeach trump they have also passed more than 400 bills most of them with bipartisan support that now molder on the desk of mitch mcconnell the senate majority leader there is no question of course that this trade agreement is much better than nafta speaker nancy pelosi said in announcing the bipartisan agreement on usmca pelosi said the new deal will be infinitely better than what was initially

make that calamity less likely under other changes negotiated by the democrats the usmca should make it possible to organize independent unions in mexico will require serious safety inspections and impose environmental rules so that mexican manufacturers do not gain a cost advantage by avoiding the costs of cleaning up their pollutants the democrats failed however to revise or kill section 230

in a newspaper each year applicants have a very brief period to respond and must do so via fax a technology few low paid workers possess on the other side team trump maintains barriers for

the tone in global financial markets has turned cautious after a u s airstrike killed a top iranian commander fueling concern over an escalation in tensions u s stock futures dropped and asian shares reversed gains while oil spiked along with the yen and gold qassem soleimani a feared iranian general who through proxy militias extended his country s power across the middle east was killed at the direction of u s president donald trump the risk off move deepened after iran s supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said severe retaliation awaited soleimani s killers the shock news comes after most asset classes had a stellar 2019 with u s equities capping one of the best years of the past decade here are 10 analysts and money managers on what it means for the market outlook blackrock inc wei li head of ishares emea investment strategy in london within the space of 24 hours sentiment took a 180 degree turn this very much characterizes the sort of year we expect 2020 to be on the one hand fundamentals are getting a bit better trade headlines are getting a bit better but on the other hand bouts of volatility will be frequent given how strong sentiment is and how fundamentals have been in terms of bottoming out and to some degree recovering we could see investors using this opportunity to potentially buy the dip until we actually see tangible evidence of uncertainty impacting growth we could see investors being quite tactical around the event fidelity investments jurrien timmer director of global macro in boston if i can find an issue with the market the forward p e is now at 18 1 2 it essentially front ran an expected improvement in earnings and now those earnings have to come through which i think they will but at an 18 1 2 forward p e there s not a lot of margin for error and so when you add something geopolitical like this it s not the same as being at a 15 p e and so that leaves the market a little bit vulnerable at least over the near term societe generale sa kit juckes chief fx strategist in london gold s a winner as tension increases and oil prices are higher too bond yields are lower the equity rally which was underway in the u s has stalled but not gone dramatically in reverse and in the fx market safe havens and oil sensitive currencies benefit but it s the yen which is the clear winner the key level to watch is probably eur jpy 120 that probably holds unless there is further escalation given the scope for tension to persist in the strait of hormuz a protracted period of higher oil prices has to be a risk credit agricole sa valentin marinov head of g 10 currency research in london who calls the timing of the escalation unfortunate it could dash market hopes for a rebound of the global economy that is still to emerge from under the cloud of the u s china trade war risk sentiment should remain fragile also because central banks may be slow to respond or simply no longer have the arsenal to respond in an adequate way he calls the yen and swiss franc attractive while saying the conflict could weigh on risk correlated oil importing currencies like the korean won ing groep nv antoine bouvet senior rates strategist in london recent episodes of u s iran tensions have not resulted in material escalation but even in a fairly benign outcome to this crisis the bid in u s treasuries and bunds should last at least into next week colombo wealth sa alberto tocchio chief investment officer in lugano switzerland the severe retaliation aspect is possibly what is scaring the markets as it could mean that there will be a counter attack versus american diplomats markets could use this excuse to take some profits as sentiment and positioning are possibly too high we would then use the possible weakness to increase our equity exposure saxo capital markets pte kay van petersen global macro strategist in singapore we are moving potentially from proxy iran versus proxy saudis and u s to potentially direct iran backed forces versus u s forces however net net i struggle to see what iran can really do people are still not back at their desks fully until next week to mid january so illiquidity could give us some overreaction to the downside still let s see how the next 24 to 48 hours play out remember it s the weekend already in the middle east the gain in oil honestly feels a touch overdone but this is positive for u s defense spending and even french defense stocks could get a boost later he noted so much for trump calling troops home covenant capital pte edward lim money manager in singapore this attack merely highlights the geopolitical risk of the oil markets and the market undergoing a possible oil shortage in the first one to two quarters of 2020 we didn t do anything on the news as we have already

gotabaya rajapaksa was elected president at a time when the country s crisis had reached its climax and the country was on the brink of bankruptcy by victor ivan after ending the internal civil war there were no killings of civilians or damage to property caused by terrorist attacks until the recent attack launched on easter sunday by a group of extremist muslim youths but in the aftermath of the internal civil war the country was gradually pushed into a crisis which was greater than the one that prevailed during the period of protracted bloodshed the distortions and decline that occurred in the social political and economic sphere during the uncivilised period of violent struggles have now taken a new turn for the worse impacting the growing crisis to overcome this situation it remained an essential condition to adopt socio structural reforms to recreate the social political and economic system but for whatever reason the rajapaksa regime that won the internal civil war and the yahapalana regime that succeeded the former did not resort to structural reforms necessary to reconstruct the social political and economic system which had fallen into decay and degeneration disregarding this urgent need and attempt to maintain the living standards at previous level by increasing the volume of foreign borrowings pushed the country into a complete bankruptcy gotabaya rajapaksa was elected president at a time when the country s crisis had reached its climax and the country was on the brink of bankruptcy the current crisis it is facing cannot be considered a phenomenon that is restricted only to a debt crisis however it has become the major factor that determines the overall crisis debt crisis by the time gotabaya rajapaksa was elected as president sri lanka s outstanding foreign debt had risen to 52 313 million the amount received from foreign commercial enterprises constitutes 50 of the total value of loans expenditure on foreign debt instalments and interest payable in 2017 could be 3 167 million and 4 188 million in 2018 it was 4 500 million for 2019 the total cost of foreign debt service payments is equal to 115 of the annual income of the government failure to pay at least one of the loan instalments to foreign commercial enterprises will result in sri lanka being declared a bankrupt country although the crisis in sri lanka was distinctly evident neither the government of mahinda rajapaksa nor the yahapalana government took it seriously and made necessary structural reforms instead the debt crisis was ignored fitch ratings inc the international credit rating institution has downgraded the credit rating applicable to sri lanka to b status in november this has resulted in depriving the country of the possibility of borrowing from other countries at concessionary interest rates thereby compelling sri lanka to borrow at market interest rates or black market rates currently sri lanka is not in a position to pay the instalments and interest on foreign debt using internal economic strength of the country in this backdrop that a large portion of the loan instalment has to be procured from foreign commercial establishments under the circumstances if we are driven to pay at black market rate of interest instead of the normal market rate inevitably it will exacerbate the sri lankan debt crisis in a new way but the sri lankan government does not seem to be paying urgent and serious attention to overcome the terrible crisis it is facing at the moment moreover it has also not shown that it has a sustainable and practical vision for that so much so the attention of the government opposition parties and the general public is focused on the forthcoming parliamentary election the impact that the increase in the rate of interest even by one single decimal point payable on loans obtained in millions of dollars can make on economy is enormous the gravity of this situation will be further aggravated if the present ranking of sri lanka s credit rating is dropped down to the level of dccc in the event we fail to take practical action to resolve the debt problem such a situation if it occurs will be the worst that can happen as it will inevitably push sri lanka into a state of complete insolvency sri lanka now stands on the verge of a terrible abyss the political leaders who are supposed to steer the nation and the religion are either in a mood of excitement and joy caused by the overwhelming victory of the presidential election or in a state of bewilderment caused by the defeat of the election they do not seem to perceive the real situation the predicament the country is facing they are fully absorbed in the upcoming carnival of the parliamentary election the most important thing to realise at this moment is that sri lanka has reached a level in which the country is compelled to come to terms with the situation and abandon the life of abundance and comfort and be prepared to adopt a life of austerity there is no magic wand that the government can wave to do away with the crisis but if necessary it can take certain practical and feasible measures to ease off the burden of the people the rural farmer community has the greatest potential to ease the sufferings of the people in a period of hardships such as this therefore the country should be directed towards adopting accelerated and practical measures in making a rapid and comprehensive growth in the rural agriculture if the damage caused by wild animals to rural economy could be reduced and brought to a minimum it will certainly help resulting in a big boost and a rapid growth in rural agriculture there are two measures the government can take in this respect one is to reduce the density of population of monkeys and rilavus by 80 this move alone will make a significant boost in rural agriculture including home gardening it will also help increase at least to double the income generated by rural agricultural sector the next important thing to do along with this would be to grant the farmers the right to hunt wild animals such as wild boar porcupines and peacock that damage agriculture and allow the farmers to possess transport and sell the meat of those animals these measures will lead to a significant increase in the output of rural agricultural production and a significant increase in the income of the farmers dhal lentils chillies and milk the importance of dhal in the field of sri lankan cuisine is enormous so much so life without love is compared to a hotel without a dhal curry the cost of importing dhal is as high as 1 600 million per annum although dhal lentil cannot be grown in sri lanka it would be possible to grow thora parippu a local variety of dhal that grows on sri lanka s soil the peeled green gram also known as moong dal is more delicious than lentils if the entire requirement of green gram and thora parippu is produced locally import of dhal to sri lanka can be cut off completely thereby making a saving of 1 600 million in foreign exchange spent on importation of dhal per annum it is only about 15 of the total requirement of chillies that is produced in sri lanka approximately 50 000 metric tons of dried chillies are imported per annum and the cost incurred is rs 10 000 million as per the estimates of the department of agriculture the income that can be earned from one acre of paddy stands at rs 40 000 while that of chillies is as much as rs 333 373 regrettably due to abandonment of research on chilli seeds except for finding varieties for raw chillies it has not been possible to develop a proper variety for dried chillies however if the research is conducted using genetic technology making it a matter of national priority it would not be difficult to develop perhaps in less than a year a variety of green chillies that can resist the leaf blight and produce a generous crop capable of making one kilo of dried chillies with four kilos of green chillies if the old fashioned methods of chilli cultivation are modernised by replacing them with greenhouse systems despite its initial cost being high it would be possible to generate comparably higher income whilst at the same time making it a pioneering opportunity of shifting sri lanka s agricultural sector into a modern phase from its current state of stagnation sri lanka spends 400 million on import of milk powder per annum since sri lanka produces 45 of its milk requirement it will not be a big burden for the country even if the milk powder imports are completely stopped however it will not be difficult to make sri lanka self sufficient from milk if there is a consistent national policy on cattle farming cattle farming is not economically viable unless it is pursued for the production of both milk and meat india does not consume beef but it is one of the major beef exporters in the world if sri lanka does not consume beef it must be allowed to be carried out at least as an export industry it is only then that it would be possible to make cattle farming an economically viable business and the country self sufficient in milk fuel and motor vehicles the annual cost of importing motor vehicles to sri lanka is 1 573 5 million import of all types of motor vehicles can be banned for a period of five years though it can have a drop in tax revenues of the government it can make a big relief on the problem of balance of payment it can also reduce the cost of fuel presently sri lanka has too many motor vehicles therefore a policy that regulates the quantum of vehicles used will certainly take the country to a level where the optimum use of motor vehicles are made while at the same time boosting the technical sector of the automobile industry in the country fuel cost can be considered as the largest component of import costs annual fuel import cost of sri lanka is 4 151 million countries like brazil the united states the european union and india have adopted a policy of mixing 10 to 15 ethanol or alcohol to petrol this blended mixture of petrol and alcohol is considered as a type of an eco friendly fuel brazil has produced two models of motor cars capable of being driven only by ethanol why can t sri lanka adopt a similar policy wouldn t it be possible to use locally produced illicit alcohol called kasippu as a source of automobile fuel for this purpose i think there is a good potential for that it is important that we should emulating the experience of other countries look into the possibility of using kasippu as a source of fuel and conduct research to find out what changes are needed to make for kassipu which at present is being manufactured at cottage level as an illicit brew if kasippu can be converted into a viable alternative to mix with petrol by identifying the changes need to be made for it it would be possible to save 650 million spent on petrol imports by doing so this industry which is being carried out at domestic level as an illicit operation can be regularised and made a major contributor to the economy of the country it can be converted into an industry that will add a higher value to the country s economy than the amount added by paddy production the income that could be generated by this project will amount to rs 117 500 million consequently the income flow to the rural economy will go up by the same amount turning disaster into a blessing the present crisis can be made an opportunity to convert rural agriculture into an export market without limiting it to paddy farming and field crops only i hope to talk about how it can be done separately in a future article for the time being i must say that by implementing the proposals described above alone it would be possible to save 4 205 million in foreign exchange which is equal to the annual premium sri lanka has to pay for debt servicing we can be wiser and practical in proportion to the challenge the country is facing it would be possible to turn even a great disaster into a blessing the catastrophic breakdown of the entire system of the country can be transformed into an opportunity to modernise the country and move it forward with an enhanced vigour and momentum the country can be orientated towards such a massive transformation only if sri lanka has the necessary discipline to make a proper investigation into the causes that pushed the country into its present state of failure and the wretchedness at the time of independence sri lanka enjoyed a shining position among asian countries at that time most asian countries that have currently achieved massive development were lagging far behind sri lanka notwithstanding the strength and potential it had initially which other countries did not have sri lanka has become a stagnant inefficient and failed state afflicted with rampant corruption and incessant bloodshed the main reason for this can be described as an outcome of its failure to build the modern nation without leaving room for the recognition of caste discrimination and occasional outbreaks of clashes on ethnic and religious lines what many countries in the world which had encountered unfortunate predicaments like this had done to overcome the situation had been to direct the country towards adopting a people s constitution aimed at creating a socio political and economic environment conducive to restore the country and uplift them into a better level it can be described as a direct democratic opportunity extended temporarily to the public within the framework of democratic rule to exercise their sovereignty to recreate the entire system after having looked into all aspects of governance whilst at the same time limiting the monopoly power enjoyed by the political elites in the past who have a history of unsuccessful rule behind them under the circumstances it is the public inspired by sound dialogues carried out with restraint who can act as the builders of the modern nation and make necessary changes to restructure the political and economic system in the process the public too will change and adapt themselves to suit modern needs

lenci sickler a fifth generation farmer who oversees more than 10 000 acres in western north dakota stops short of saying whether farmers in southern states are better off than his peers in the midwest the payment rates vary by county but a 2019 federal payment program intended to help farmers facing low prices caused by president donald trump s trade war with china has paid the south higher rates than the midwest the payments are intended to support farmers for crops like soybeans and corn that were subject to retaliatory tariffs from china in north dakota which typically sends more than two thirds of its soybeans to china it s more expensive to send exports to new markets such as europe lawmakers academics and farmers question whether the aid has favored certain regions and states and whether the payments line up with farmers actual economic losses local farmers in western north dakota whose counties are generally receiving a lower rate than eastern counties are disappointed about the rates though they won t complain sickler said but it s still a little disheartening to know that we were at the bottom of the list just based on locations advertisement farmers in the midwest face tough decisions heading into the new year after being walloped by historic rain and flooding on top of trade uncertainties and several years of low commodity prices even with the apparent end to trump s trade war with china they ll continue to endure 2019 s unprecedented economic and weather challenges economists predict fewer crops in the dakotas illinois indiana and ohio it s likely the u s department of agriculture will distribute a third tranche of the trade related payments called market facilitation program payments to farmers who grow soybeans corn and other crops affected by the tariffs it s not yet known who would be eligible how payments would be distributed or when this year s payments of up to 14 5 billion have been critical to shoring up the farm economy they also picked winners and losers between regions and crops according to a november report from democratic members of the u s senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry fueling a partisan fight on capitol hill the report provides evidence that the 2019 mfp awarded 95 of top payment rates to southern farmers helped wealthy farms and foreign companies and offered no long term investment or plan for rebuilding lost markets the minority members represent the corn belt west and northeast but states in the midwest which have more farmers and farm acreage have received the highest payouts across two years of the program rough estimates show illinois 2 6 billion and iowa 2 5 billion at the top followed by minnesota 1 7 billion and kansas 1 6 billion between the market facilitation program and two additional programs the trump administration has authorized roughly 28 billion in 2018 and 2019 to compensate farmers and ranchers for their losses caused by trade tariffs and to shore up political support from an important constituency according to a november report from the conservative american enterprise institute the differences between the 2018 and 2019 programs and a lack of transparency in how this year s payments were calculated has opened the usda to criticism advertisement unlike the 2018 payments which were based on production this year s payment rates were distributed on a per acre basis and range from 15 to 150 rates of more than 100 an acre are concentrated in georgia alabama mississippi arkansas texas and arizona according to the university of illinois publication farmdoc daily the difference is caused in part by the increasing mfp payment per pound of cotton which went from 6 cents to 26 cents between 2018 and 2019 cotton is largely produced in the south by contrast the payment per pound of corn went from 1 cent to 14 cents counties in the west upper midwest and eastern seaboard tended to be paid at rates below 50 an acre the average payment rate in north dakota where agriculture represents about a quarter of the state s economy was 31 an acre many counties in the southwestern part of the state were paid at the minimum rate southeastern north dakota where five counties rank among the top 20 soybean bushel producers in the country was paid at rates up to 60 an acre as in other states payment rates in neighboring counties differed wildly it s not equitable necessarily from farm to farm said mark watne president of the north dakota farmers union and then it s not enough to offset what may have been substantially higher prices had we not had a trade war we d rather have better trade the market facilitation program was designed to support farmers facing low prices for their crops because of trade disputes and retaliatory tariffs and not to provide relief from natural disasters flooding and other extreme weather the first year of payments in 2018 was restricted to producers of a limited number of crops _ soybeans corn cotton sorghum wheat sweet cherries shelled almonds _ and hog and dairy producers crop payments were based on harvested production in 2018 and the value of u s exports after chinese tariffs advertisement in 2019 the program took a different approach to avoid influencing planting decisions as officials had the year before they estimated damage from retaliatory tariffs but the number of eligible crops increased from nine to 41 among the new crops were chickpeas dried beans and lentils but announcing a second payment year in may had broader effects no official at usda would have ever announced a payment like this in a planting season said jonathan coppess a clinical assistant professor in agricultural and consumer economics at the university of illinois at urbana champaign one of the results of that we re seeing is late harvest just having a late planting season is not an isolated incident it causes other challenges per acre payment rates were based on the impact of unjustified trade retaliation in that county according to the usda the department calculated the aggregate effect on commodities in each county and divided that figure by the average total acres of eligible crops reported to the department between 2015 and 2018 while about three fourths of 2018 payments went to soybean growers and were concentrated in corn belt states that changed this year producers growing different eligible crops received the same payment rate because the rates were set by county rather than by crop during an october hearing of the u s senate agriculture committee usda deputy secretary stephen censky insisted the 2019 mfp payments are equitable and based on models the department created to show the effects of retaliatory tariffs that has been done on a consistent basis without any kind of consideration of north south east west or anything like that to take a look at what are the actual effects censky said according to the senate democrats five southern states _ georgia mississippi alabama tennessee and arkansas _ received the highest per acre payment rates in the first round of 2019 mfp payments advertisement and while the impacts of the retaliatory tariffs are widespread the payment rates have not aligned to help the regions and crops harmed the most according to the report by the senate agriculture committee s democratic members meghan cline communications director for the committee s republican chairman u s sen pat roberts of kansas did not respond to several requests for comment other critics point to a lack of transparency in how the usda calculated mfp payment rates the broad discretion it allows agriculture secretary sonny perdue to spend taxpayer dollars without congressional approval and a failure to account for cross commodity effects for example low soybean prices lead to low canola oil prices canola farmers are considered in the county payment rates but the 2019 program doesn t attach a price to canola the pressure on the mfp program the political pressure is growing and it signals a bigger problem in the farm economy said david widmar an agricultural economist at agricultural economic insights llc producers still to this day are not profitable enough to cover all their obligations amid 2019 s economic and weather challenges producers sought help from an array of federal programs in addition to mfp they had access to crop insurance disaster assistance regular crop programs and cover crop payments it s unclear to what extent the programs interacted and whether the usda considered the potential for overlapping payments said carl zulauf professor emeritus in the department of agricultural environmental and development economics at the ohio state university in columbus i think that s a really important policy question that we as policy analysts and policymakers need to grapple with zulauf said when you sum the programs together were farmers overcompensated for losses due to natural disasters advertisement to be sure payments are providing much needed cash flow to struggling farms agricultural credit conditions and farm incomes are expected to continue declining in coming months in states including missouri kansas and nebraska according to a november report from the federal reserve bank of kansas city in missouri meanwhile farm bankruptcies were up 24 in 2019 from 2018 over the 12 month period ending in september chapter 12 filings were highest in wisconsin 48 followed by georgia nebraska and kansas 37 each iowa kansas minnesota nebraska south dakota and wisconsin were among the states that experienced filings at or above 10 year highs according to the american farm bureau federation farmers won t complain about the mfp payments said sickler the north dakota farmer but i think most farmers would echo we d rather have better trade dakota farming this year spring and fall flooding battered the dakotas and other midwestern states republican governors in north and south dakota declared emergencies and the states received federal disaster relief agricultural producers had trouble getting out into saturated fields for spring planting and again months later for fall harvest historic flooding and rainfall prevented a record 19 6 million acres from being planted across the country this year south dakota led all states with 3 9 million acres followed by ohio at 1 6 million acres illinois at 1 5 million acres and missouri at 1 4 million acres only two of the top 10 states _ arkansas 1 33 million acres and texas 867 000 acres _ are outside the midwest unplanted acres were not eligible for market facilitation program payments it s hard for a farmer to just not plant said krista joy swanson a farmer and visiting research specialist in agricultural and consumer economics at the university of illinois at urbana champaign it s in your blood it s your passion it s what you want to do advertisement but there was still an opportunity for those farmers to receive a market facilitation program payment they could have filed a claim for prevented planting insurance coverage that protects producers who are unable to plant a crop by a certain date and subsequently planted a cover crop that was eligible for payment through the program if they did they were eligible for payments at the minimum 15 an acre rate those individuals that had the prevent planting came out with a hell of a lot more welfare than anyone else said doug sombke president of the south dakota farmers union because they got paid not only for the prevent planting and their crop insurance but they also got paid for the loss of marketplace on acres they didn t grow anything on the lack of planting reached local economies beyond farms if a farmer spends roughly 500 an acre on things such as soil sampling chemicals and seed sales that s 500 multiplied by the prevent planting acres that isn t being spent with ancillary businesses sombke said they re under extreme financial pressure right now sombke said of the other businesses but guess what they don t have an mfp payment or crop insurance that covers them when the agricultural industry suffers farmers make fewer purchases said south dakota state sen arthur rusch a republican our sales tax revenues are lower which is a big source of revenue here in south dakota so it s all interconnected rusch introduced a concurrent resolution in january 2019 urging trump to make agricultural exports a priority and protect agricultural products from tariffs it was adopted by the senate but not the house in her december budget address south dakota gov kristi noem a republican noted that agriculture faces an uncertain outlook in 2020 the budget did not include discretionary inflation increases for overall k 12 education medicaid providers and state employees among the state s biggest expenditures her concern is that the revenue isn t there rusch said and that s largely because of the poor farm economy which is not entirely due to the trade tariffs but that has had a significant effect as a u s china trade deal looms there s hope _ along with skepticism that the uncertainty is coming to an end even if a deal advances farmers face a long road ahead how do we transition from the end of the trade war if it ends today to where the markets catch up said widmar the agricultural economist china is not going to wake up tomorrow and buy all the beans they haven t bought over the past 18 months ___ c 2020 stateline org visit stateline org at www stateline org distributed by tribune

03 01 2020 listen foreign investment into africa is the most deceptive and abused phrase ever used purposely to confuse people of goodwill that international corporate world is trying to do for africa what was done for europe after the war while it is true that europe and other continents got richer the face of poverty shifted from asia to africa this is reality today that most people with any form of sincerity or conscience cannot argue with what most of us do is blame africans for their own predicament from slavery to neo colonialism of course there are enough blames greed traitors and accomplices to go around it still takes two tangles european countries have benefited right from the days of slavery to money laundering today not by passive accidents but by active designs while it is true that money laundering incurs consequences for africans caught in the process it does not negate the amount of stolen money into european and american banks or economy into the hands of legal and financial accomplices that are charging about a third of the loot as fees helped hide poor countries foreign reserves abroad foreign companies are still at it just as when economic opportunities dried up in 1800 europe and the americas they turned too faraway continents looking for natural and human resources even the moroccans decided on further south into west africa to capture the gold after fighting wars that depleted their resources and left them poorer all these have become ancient history today but if we do not learn from our past we are bound to repeat the same mistake in the future africa s future started yesterday according to oxfam it is indisputable that about one trillion american dollars have been lost from africa to enrich other countries in europe and asia if that is not foreign investment or drain from africa how difficult is it to understand the reverse psychology practices of how europe under developed africa it has never been a secret since france a small country with a tiny tribal population still feeds on french speaking developing countries african foreign reserves in france treasury cannot be spent without the approval of france indeed one of their presidents so admitted publicly middle class africans especially the ones trained at the london school of economics wharton business school harvard or university of toronto have preached to us since independence that only foreign investment can save africa voila realities have taught us different lessons sixty years is a long time enough to understand the dynamics of economics somehow african markets have adopted western and eastern european economics be it capitalist or communist theory like old wine in a new bottle obviously the only missing theory has been african economics we must hastily add that it is not out of commission or omission but out of favor to old colonialists to be like them those african professors that dared criticize the cramming of communist or capitalist economic theory as unsuitable or unworkable without adaptation to african market realities were run out of town as teachers of voodoo economics the reason is not farfetched africans longed to be part of the world communities so bad we were willing to relinquish anything with african appellation or culture those that are still preaching african salvation by the way of foreign investment have not given up indeed their staunch advocates come are africans while those old enough to remember the relative economic reprieve africa had after independence they came to realize that it was only political but did not include actual economic independence the ploughing of african wealth continued as foreign investment moreover africa s economic fortune declined further with the introduction of structural adjustment even when the international monetary fund and world bank expressed misgivings at a conference in ghana that they did not take the sociopolitical factor into consideration we had some african economists insisting that african countries implemented structural adjustment wrongly as the cause of the problem then came devaluations that paralyzed most african countries in the guise that once our human and natural resources become cheaper for foreign currencies they would be able to buy more and that would spur economic growth by creating more jobs those propagating what we all knew as blatantly false then and now realized that we had no commodity that would enter their market even under obama administration s agoa most of our commodities were rejected as substandard most african businesses do not realize what it takes to get our products into their markets in their store shelves even at the risk of a temporary loss in profit it all boils down to promises into the future prospects or fooled as promising emerging markets that has never been realized they choose the best countries open for business based on what they can scoop out as fast as they can on demand not on what africa can gain we are the fastest growing economies after they have had their lion share with promises of crumbs in the future they sell us rosy prospects as they did with religious deliverance that we will reap our reward in heaven as long as we obey and abide by their rules on earth so there has never been any reasonable chance that foreign investment from their countries would liberate us in 60 years after independence or ever as their internal traitors support their chicanery an attractive charade for a toddler s intelligence there has always been one way flow of capital either by money laundering with their corporate firms that source raw materials in africa before and after independence most if not all have never been foreign currency earners into africa but they dip into meagre reserves to launder money back into their countries under the guise that they have to buy and import foreign materials for our factories otherwise they layoff local workers african businessmen have learned well from their foreign masters and partners most of them have never earned foreign currency for their countries but dug deep into local reserves as international companies and launder foreign reserves into shell companies how much longer is this going to take until africans realized that if they were crawling for over 60 years since independence they could have been better off than the abject poverty disillusionment and obsession the foreign investments have left them when all along africa was the source of foreign investments into europe america and asia

the u s federal reserve board s policy making committee saw much less risk of recession at its most recent meeting in december when it kept interest rates steady after three straight cuts and signalled that it expected to keep low rates unchanged through this year minutes of the december meeting released friday showed that fed officials supported keeping rates in a low range of 1 5 per cent to 1 75 per cent to cushion the u s economy from slow global growth and lingering trade tensions officials were also concerned that inflation still hadn t reached its target of 2 per cent still many fed policymakers said at the dec 10 11 meeting that the risks of a u s china trade war had diminished and that the probability of a disruptive brexit had also declined the meeting occurred two days before the united states and china reached a preliminary trade deal though press reports had already suggested that an agreement was near fed officials also noted that the u s economy was showing resilience despite the trade fight and weak global economy the minutes said changes in interest rates also suggested that the likelihood of a recession occurring over the medium term had fallen noticeably in recent months since the meeting however tensions have flared in the middle east as the u s has struck iranian forces in iraq that escalated oil prices on friday and caused the u s stock market to decline fed chairman jerome powell signalled that the central bank was comfortable with keeping rates low for the foreseeable future joshua roberts reuters low rates raise concerns yet many analysts say higher oil prices could potentially benefit the u s economy because of the sharp increase in the past decade in u s oil production higher oil prices encourage energy companies to invest in more drilling wells which boosts demand for steel pipe and other equipment from u s factories and creates jobs those trends increasingly offset the drag on consumer spending exerted by higher gas prices though the fed s policy making committee voted unanimously in favour of keeping rates unchanged several members voiced concerns about the long term impact of very low rates keeping rates so low could fuel excessive risk taking on wall street a few participants warned which could lead to dangerous asset bubbles if those bubbles were to burst it could make the next recession more severe than otherwise but a greater number of fed officials felt that the job market could still strengthen and draw more people off the sidelines into jobs without sending inflation up too much that sentiment would favour keeping rates low to further reduce unemployment and stimulate economic growth chairman jerome powell echoed that view in the post meeting news conference signalling that the central bank was comfortable with keeping rates low for the foreseeable future we have learned that unemployment can remain at quite low levels for an extended period of time without unwanted upward pressure on inflation powell said at the news conference
new york the year 2019 is ending with widespread demonstrations rising inequality and a crisis of representation in many countries the world is sleepwalking toward recession and a new crisis while depleting the environment governments and ultimately people can reverse these alarming trends in 2020 sixty one countries will have presidential or parliamentary elections in 2020 many citizens are tired of conventional orthodox policies they want change and they will choose new parties as a way to achieve this this is an important opportunity to redress the current situation but many of the new emerging leaders are far right demagogues who blame today s problems on social welfare policies migrants and the poor while aiming to remove all remaining constraints on capital as in the united kingdom many whom neoliberalism has harmed will vote for these politicians making the world a more unequal and riskier place a lot will be decided in the united states still the world s hegemonic power how us citizens many without much knowledge of global affairs vote in the 2020 presidential election will have profound consequences for the rest of the planet s citizens us president donald trump has already had a big impact on the world eroding multilateral institutions trade agreements and global initiatives as part of his america first agenda despite the populist rhetoric americans in the main have benefitted little trump s large tax cuts for the wealthy cuts to health care access and increases in the us defence budget are regressive resulting in increased inequality yet the right continues to win votes partly because it is becoming ever more radical offering out of the box unthinkable policies from building walls to exiting the european union that appeal to those who want change above all else unless social democrats advance radical and attractive progressive public policies in 2020 the radical right will continue to rise and with it the trend towards increasing inequality economic risks and environmental degradation how we got to this point is not difficult to discern four decades of neoliberal policies have eroded living conditions in most countries governments of both the left and the right advised by the international monetary fund the world bank and other organisations have been pursuing supply side policies focused on improving business competitiveness which has meant lower wages more flexible labour markets lower corporate taxation and greater income inequality while companies sharpened their competitive edge amid falling living standards and rising public debts global demand has stagnated governments have also pursued cuts in social expenditures and the privatisation of public services paradoxically most of the savings from these cuts have gone toward supporting private companies with tax breaks and bailouts in an effort to generate growth thus the average citizen has experienced a significant decline in welfare and growth has remained slow because neoliberal short term policies do not address the long term structural causes of the problem overproduction and excess capacity if the current course is not changed austerity policies will continue spreading in 2020 cutting into pensions wages social programmes and labour protections in 2020 austerity will become the new normal affecting 113 countries or more than 70 per cent of the world population and fuelling more social discontent absurdly many governments are cutting social expenditures but increasing military spending and supporting large corporations with public funds and limited regulation at a time when half of the world s population still lives in poverty defined as less than 5 50 per day this is likely to result in more protests and conflicts in 2020 austerity is not necessary even in the poorest countries there are alternatives the international labour organisation united nations women and unicef report at least eight financing options to generate resources sustainably and avoid cuts to public services for example countries can curb illicit financial flows crack down on tax evasion increase the progressivity of the tax system reduce debt service by better managing debt or adopt more accommodative macroeconomic frameworks there are many successful examples in recent times if governments were to opt out of austerity we could see more countries successfully raising revenue for national development in 2020 increasing public investments that benefit people and supporting real economic activity and human development with a view towards generating decent employment and ensuring environmental sustainability in addition to improving financial regulation and redressing financialisation processes these policies would help avoid the danger of recession and the possible economic and financial crisis predicted by institutions such as the un jp morgan and moody s even if the world avoids economic calamity in 2020 environmental devastation will continue the world is losing more than 26 million hectares of trees each year an area the size of the uk mostly tropical rainforests affecting both climate and wildlife unless adequate policies are implemented deforestation overfishing carbon emissions and waste generation are all expected to increase in absolute terms next year these are not just national issues global problems require global solutions and multilateralism needs to be strengthened not weakened to work together to form sustainable solutions to improve people s lives a better future for all is possible governments and ultimately citizens can improve the world in 2020 but if they continue obsessing about stock prices and quarterly earnings at the expense of a long term vision hiking defence spending and cutting welfare blaming migrants and the poor while allowing the rich to become richer and the environment to be further damaged it will be another long year of living dangerously isabel ortiz director of the global social justice programme at the initiative for policy dialogue at columbia university was director of the international labour organisation and

sky s ian king explains how financial markets have reacted to events in the middle east as the us kills a top iranian commander iran s own economy is largely dependent on the country s oil production but exports are limited by us sanctions there has been a common fallacy for a while that thanks to the us shale revolution the world has plenty of oil in fact the balance between supply and demand is a lot tighter than assumed which is why the crude price has jumped sharply after america s assassination of a top iranian military commander the price of a barrel of brent crude surged briefly by nearly 4 5 to 69 16 a level last seen in september last year following attacks on processing facilities owned by saudi arabia s state controlled oil giant saudi aramco those attacks which temporarily forced the kingdom to close down half of its oil production were blamed at the time on iran and there is an expectation that tehran will retaliate to the killing of qassem soleimani image major general qassem soleimani the feeling in oil markets is that iran which denied responsibility for the attacks last september certainly has the ability to hit back amrita sen of the consultancy energy aspects said one question was the speed at which iran might retaliate she told sky news s sister channel cnbc the market reaction was a kneejerk reaction because the question is how quickly iran will retaliate if you don t see anything immediate from iran you might see the price give up its gains please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0 16 fiery aftermath of deadly us airstrike jeffrey halley senior market analyst for asia pacific at broker oanda added i am struggling to see how an iranian riposte will not occur oil installations and tankers were my first thoughts advertisement the big question being asked is where any iranian retaliation may take place saudi arabia has been on a state of high alert since the attacks last september meaning that iran may find it easier to attack potentially softer targets such as dubai or abu dhabi this would also have the benefit as iran would see it of wreaking havoc in energy markets as well as potentially striking at cities full of western expatriates however ms sen said iran could seek to hit targets in neighbouring iraq as part of its response which would also have a big impact please use chrome browser for a more accessible video player 0 37 khamenei harsh retaliation awaits the us she went on iraq is now exporting 3 5 million barrels per day i think that is the biggest risk for the market right now among members of opec the cartel of oil producing countries iraq s oil production is now second only to saudi arabia itself it has been reported on friday that dozens of americans working for foreign oil companies in basra the southern city that sits at the heart of iraq s oil production and from where most iraqi crude is exported were preparing to leave it is also thought likely that iran whose own oil exports have been crippled by us sanctions will also step up its harassment of commercial shipping and oil tankers in the strait of hormuz one of the world s most important shipping routes through which around a fifth of the world s oil passes image iran s oil minister has signalled the country wants to pump and store more oil despite sanctions and technical limitations iran seized a british flagged tanker the stena impero in july last year and detained it for two months tehran s move on that occasion was in retaliation for the detention in gibraltar by britain s royal marines of an iranian tanker bound for syria in defiance of eu sanctions all this comes at a time when many economists were starting to reappraise the prospects for higher oil prices in 2020 the apparent thaw in relations between china and the us has raised hopes that a trade deal between the two countries is imminent that would provide a boost to china which alone consumes just over a fifth of global oil exports hopes of a strong economic performance from china this year have already been boosted by news of a pick up in business confidence and in new factory orders while earlier this week the people s bank of china also announced fresh stimulus measures to encourage banks to step up their lending all of that will have been seen as positive for the oil price a stronger crude price though also spells trouble for countries like germany india and japan which depend heavily on imports of oil and gas germany s economy narrowly avoided falling into recession during the second half of last year and higher oil prices over a prolonged period of time would spell trouble for the world s fourth largest economy accordingly as concerns of an escalation in the gulf and the wider middle east sparked falls in other markets the dax in germany was the heaviest faller among european stock markets with all of the main european stock markets lower on the news the dax fell by nearly 1 5 while the mib in italy was down by 1 and the cac 40 in france fell by 0 5 ironically the ftse 100 has fallen by less than the other major european stock indices because of the heavy weighting in the index of the oil majors bp and royal dutch shell both of which have risen on the back of higher crude prices image bp and shell shares helped shield the ftse 100 from losses felt in other major european markets predictably shares of airlines have fallen with shares of easyjet ryanair and international airlines group the owner of british airways all falling by between 2 to 3 on friday elsewhere shares of lufthansa fell by more than 7 in germany while shares of air france klm fell by almost as much meanwhile on the foreign exchange markets safe haven currencies like the japanese yen and the swiss franc have risen following the attacks the yen rose by 0 5 against the us dollar to hit its highest level against the greenback for more than two months on the bond markets us and german government bonds both attracted buying while gold another safe haven rose by nearly 1 5 to as much as 1 550 10 an ounce its highest level since september last year overall the question investors have to ask themselves is whether iran is capable of striking back quickly after these attacks and more pertinently whether it is capable of hitting key economic targets rather than just causing low level temporary disruption to oil supplies
by farouk martins aresa foreign investment into africa is the most deceptive and abused phrase ever used purposely to confuse people of goodwill that international corporate world are trying to do for africa what was done for europe after the war while it is true that europe and other continents got richer the face of poverty shifted from asia to africa this is reality today that most people with any form of sincerity or conscience cannot argue with what most of us do is blame africans for their own predicament from slavery to neo colonialism of course there are enough blames greed traitors and accomplices to go around it still takes two to tangle european countries have benefited right from the days of slavery to money laundering today not by passive accidents but by active designs while it is true that money laundering incurs consequences for africans caught in the process it does not negate the amount of stolen money into european and american banks or economy into the hands of legal and financial accomplices that are charging about a third of the loot as fees helped hide poor countries foreign reserves abroad foreign companies are still at it just as when economic opportunities dried up in 1800 europe and the americas they turned to far away continents looking for natural and human resources even the moroccans decided on further south into west africa to capture the gold after fighting wars that depleted their resources and left them poorer all these have become ancient history today but if we do not learn from our past we are bound to repeat the same mistake in the future africa s future started yesterday according to oxfam it is indisputable that about one trillion american dollars have been lost from africa to enrich other countries in europe and asia if that is not foreign investment or drain from africa how difficult is it to understand the reverse psychology practices of how europe under developed africa it has never been a secret since france a small country with a tiny tribal population still feeds on french speaking developing countries african foreign reserves in france treasury cannot be spent without the approval of france indeed one of their presidents so admitted publicly middle class africans especially the ones trained at the london school of economics wharton business school harvard or university of toronto have preached to us since independence that only foreign investment can save africa voila realities have taught us different lessons sixty years is a long time enough to understand the dynamics of economics somehow african markets have adopted western and eastern european economics be it capitalist or communist theory like old wine in a new bottle obviously the only missing theory has been african economics we must hastily add that it is not out of commission or omission but out of favor to old colonialists to be like them those african professors that dared criticize the cramming of communist or capitalist economic theory as unsuitable or unworkable without adaptation to african market realities were run out of town as teachers of voodoo economics the reason is not farfetched africans longed to be part of the world communities so bad we were willing to relinquish anything with african appellation or culture those that are still preaching african salvation by the way of foreign investment have not given up indeed their staunch advocates come are africans while those old enough to remember the relative economic reprieve africa had after independence they came to realize that it was only political but did not include actual economic independence the ploughing of african wealth continued as foreign investment moreover africa economic fortune declined further with the introduction of structural adjustment even when the international monetary fund and world bank expressed misgivings at a conference in ghana that they did not take the sociopolitical factor into consideration we had some african economists insisting that african countries implemented structural adjustment wrongly as the cause of the problem then came devaluations that paralyzed most african countries in the guise that once our human and natural resources become cheaper for foreign currencies they would be able to buy more and that would spur economic growth by creating more jobs those propagating what we all knew as blatantly false then and now realized that we had no commodity that would enter their market even under obama administration s agoa most of our commodities were rejected as substandard most african businesses do not realize what it takes to get our products into their markets in their stores shelves even at the risk of a temporary loss in profit it all boils down to promises into the future prospects or fooled as promising emerging markets that has never been realized they choose the best countries open for business based on what they can scoop out as fast as they can on demand not on what africa can gain we are the fastest growing economies after they have had their lion share with promises of crumbs in the future they sell us rosy prospects as they did with religious deliverance that we will reap our reward in heaven as long as we obey and abide by their rules on earth so there has never been any reasonable chance that foreign investment from their countries would liberate us in 60 years after independence or ever as their internal traitors support their chicanery an attractive charade for a toddler s intelligence there has always been one way flow of capital either by money laundering with their corporate firms that source raw materials in africa before and after independence most if not all have never been foreign currency earners into africa but they dip into meagre reserves to launder money back into their countries under the guise that they have to buy and import foreign materials for our factories otherwise they layoff local workers african business men have learned well from their foreign masters and partners most of them have never earn foreign currency for their countries but dug deep into local reserves as international companies and launder foreign reserves into shell companies how much longer is this going to take until africans realized that if they were crawling for over 60 years since independence they could have been better off than the abject poverty disillusionment and obsession the foreign investments have left them when all along africa was the source of foreign investments into europe america and asia

shoppers at a supermarket in shanghai agence france presse china has decided to keep its inflation target unchanged this year at around 3 per cent sources said suggesting policymakers will continue to roll out economic stimulus gradually and avoid more aggressive measures some analysts have speculated that beijing will raise the inflation target to 3 5 which would give authorities more room to support the world s second largest economy as growth tails off to the slowest in nearly 30 years but policy sources told reuters the government expects surging food prices to start easing in the second half of the year as the government takes steps to address meat shortages the 2020 inflation target to be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session in early march was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed door central economic work conference last month according to three sources with knowledge of the meeting s outcome the target will still be around 3 one of the policy sources said we cannot rule out the possibility that inflation may break 5 in the coming months but that could be short lived the state council information office and the national development and reform commission the state planner did not immediately respond to reuters requests for comment china s consumer price inflation cpi accelerated to a near eight year high of 4 5 in november as meat prices doubled due to a massive outbreak of african fever but producer prices have remained in deflation for five straight months the diverging price trends have complicated policymakers efforts to revive activity without risking overstimulating the economy while beijing has rolled out a series of support measures in the last two years mainly in the form of higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts leaders have pledged they will not embark on massive stimulus like that during the 2008 09 global crisis which created a mountain of debt that is still weighing on the economy china has kept its inflation target at around 3 since 2015 while food prices have spiked with staple meat more than doubling over the past year there has been little sign of a pick up in inflation across the broader economy suggesting demand remains sluggish core inflation which excludes food and energy prices has stayed largely subdued currently the cpi rise is mainly due to meat prices this is a structural not a broad spread price rise meat prices could start to fall in the second half said a second source still the government may face a tough job in keeping inflation below 3 this year policy insiders said rising inflation expectations could reinforce the government s cautious approach to further monetary policy easing but beijing s supportive stance remains intact sources said on wednesday the central bank announced its eighth cut since early 2018 in banks reserve requirements rrr or the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves in a bid to shore up the economy analysts expect at least one more rrr cut this year the people s bank of china pboc has also begun lowering key interest rates in recent months with more expected possibly before the end of this month but the cuts have been far smaller than substantial easing in the united states and many other economies over the past year policy sources have told reuters that beijing plans to set a lower economic growth target of around 6 in 2020 relying on increased state infrastructure spending to spur investment construction and jobs china s third quarter growth slowed to 6 still among the fastest in the world but its weakest expansion since the early 1990s meanwhile china stocks slipped on friday but finished the first week of a new decade higher with a five week winning streak as beijing eased monetary policy to shore up the economy even as investors cheered a thaw in sino us trade tensions the blue chip csi300 index fell 0 2 to 4 144 96 while the shanghai composite index slipped 0 1 to 3 083 79 for the week csi300 was up 3 1 while ssec advanced 2 6 both logging fifth week of gains in a row on the trade front investors were expecting a signing of a phase 1 trade deal between china and the us on jan 15 the market got another lift from beijing s latest policy support for the economy going into the new year china s central bank said on wednesday it was cutting the amount of cash that all banks must hold as reserves releasing around 800 billion yuan 114 76 billion in funds to shore up the slowing economy reuters

clearing the fog cohosts margaret flowers and kevin zeese interviewed journalist and author chris hedges about the significant events of 2019 and what activists must prepare for in 2020 and beyond hedges covered uprisings and wars in the middle east balkans and central america for twenty years as a foreign correspondent he has studied and written books about sacrifice zones the failures of the liberal class and the rise of the right in the united states he shares the wisdom he has gained from his experiences watching governments fall to inform us about what to expect and how to build power you can listen to the full interview plus current news and analysis on clearing the fog interview clearing the fog ctf what were some of the events in 2019 that you thought were of importance chris hedges ch i would say there are two the failure to address the climate emergency which is seeing an acceleration of the deterioration and destruction of the ecosystem that is quite dramatic and pronounced in california and australia would be number one even if we stopped all carbon emissions today which again the ruling elites utterly betrayed and failed us in madrid we re still going to deal with catastrophic climate change the other was the failure on the part of the democratic party to address the rupture of social bonds and deep social inequality that has torn apart the country and resulted in the election of donald trump at the end of the year after the complete failure of the mueller report which was hyped by all sorts of media organizations not only rachel maddow and msnbc but also the new york times we got this kind of mind numbing spectacle of the impeachment with that very cloying and repugnant moral posturing on the part of the democratic party what they did was selective they charged trump not with all of the most egregious impeachable offenses and constitutional violations that he carried out but with the most trivial that s contempt for congress and the attempt to get the ukrainian president zelensky to open an investigation of biden and his son in exchange for about 400 million in us aid and allowing zelenski to visit the white house if the democratic party was committed to actually defending the constitution then they would have to go back and impeach trump for a series of violations that both george w bush and barack obama routinely committed they don t want to do that so when i hear them talking about the restoration of the rule of law and see that they ignored the most serious constitutional violations which have now been normalized by both parties it s an example of at best self delusion and probably very cynical manipulation i can run through a few bush launches two illegal wars that are never declared by congress as demanded by the constitution he places the entire us public under government surveillance that s violating the fourth amendment he authorizes torture and kidnapping of foreign nationals who are not even us citizens and holds them where they re tortured in black sites and offshore penal colonies around the world obama expands the illegal wars which are now up to 11 if we count yemen edward snowden reveals that intelligence agencies are monitoring and spying on all of us downloading all of our data and metrics into government computers where they re stored for in perpetuity and nothing is done obama misuses the 2002 authorization for use of military force act to erase due process that s when he argues that the executive branch has the right to assassinate us citizens starting with a radical cleric anwar al awlaki and two weeks later his 16 year old son in essence serving as judge jury and executioner and then of course he signs into law section 1021 of the national defense authorization act which overturns the 1878 posse comitatus act that prohibits the use of the military as a domestic police force i sued him in federal court over that and then there are other again bipartisan constitutional violations including violating treaty clauses that are supposed to be ratified by the senate violating the appointments clause where you need senate confirmation and the routine abuse of executive orders watching the impeachment process was a very depressing spectacle for me because it was about the pretense of the rule of law it again exposed the fact that the democratic party will refuse to be self reflective and refuse to confront its complicity in neoliberalism deindustrialization programs of austerity massive expansion of our prison system and militarizing of our police it tries to personalize all of our problems in the figure of trump ctf you have written that the right wing has picked up revolutionary rhetoric because people in the united states and around the world see the corruption of the elites now with these right wing fascists rising do you see any possibility of the left being able to pick up that need for a revolutionary vision and plan ch well i do see the need but i don t see it happening i think that is driven by fear especially at every presidential election cycle the left the liberal class just crumbles the attraction of trump is that he rightly attacks the deep state which is real but what is the deep state the deep state is the generals the war industry the bankers the lobbyists the corporatists the intelligence agencies the government bureaucrats and the technocrats who actually run both domestic and international policy the fact is we don t control our own economy it s controlled by goldman sachs and citibank and jp morgan chase the washington post when it released the afghanistan papers recently the roughly more than 2 000 pages of internal government documents about the war in afghanistan which they obtained through a three year legal battle exposed exactly the bipartisan lies fraud deceit corruption waste and mismanagement during the 18 year conflict that was carried out by the ruling elites by the deep state the deep state that so many trump supporters have been betrayed by and turned on with a vengeance trump s attraction is that he calls them out often in very vulgar and crude terms the democratic party in pushing biden because he s been anointed by the democratic party donor class is seeking to perpetuate a system that at least half or more of the country wants to get rid of and the left has not embraced or understood that the whole ideology of the ruling elite neoliberalism and imperialism just doesn t resonate anymore they re bound to this ideology because the people funding the party recognize quite correctly that if they don t have that kind of corporate money and corporate backing they will lose power and so they d rather take the whole system down which is what they re doing this is the problem of the left it has misread power i m a strong supporter of extinction rebellion because i think they ve correctly read power we can go back for the last four decades carbon admissions have exponentially risen all of the attempts to work within the system this is 350 org and others have been an utter and complete failure and the left partly because we were so knocked off balance over the last few decades our organizations were either co opted or destroyed is just not willing to face this reality ctf putting aside the democratic party how do you see the potential for the left movement awakening to anti capitalist and anti imperialist thinking ch i don t know that the left is organized i don t know that it has yet offered a strong alternative vision to the mainstream i think it s often divided by identity politics without grasping that the fundamental issue is class this is class warfare and as warren buffett has correctly said his side is winning we also have to make it clear that they have not only marginalized us but cut down the spaces by which we can communicate that s why i m on rt what i do on rt should be on a functioning public broadcasting system but the public broadcasting system in particular pbs is a wholly owned subsidiary of the koch brothers if you go back to the 70s you could see noam chomsky howard zinn angela davis and all sorts of people who were not beholden to institutions or to corporations offering a critique of power the last national show that we had that critiqued power is bill moyers show which is now off the air and in the end was funded through a private foundation all of those sentiments are on the rise but it is yet to be translated into a political movement and if there are uprisings without that kind of vision and focus then the ruling elites can easily decapitate them ctf you worked with us back when we were organizing the occupation in washington dc throughout 2011 and that was a time of a lot of uprisings around the world the occupy movement really took off in the united states now we re seeing a rise again around the world against corruption and neoliberal capitalism do you think that has the potential to come back to the united states in another wave and what do we need to do to be prepared for that if it does ch i covered uprisings for 20 years as a foreign correspondent all around the globe the palestinian uprisings most of the revolutions in eastern europe east germany czechoslovakia romania and the street demonstrations that brought down slobodan milosevic what s fascinating is that what ignites it no one can predict even purported leaders of the opposition don t know what pushes people over the edge which is usually something very relatively in and of itself minor and even banal neoliberalism or global capitalism is a global phenomenon it has affected people in the same way one of the things we don t hear about the protests in hong kong is that especially the young are without work and social inequality is very pronounced i think that economic tyranny lies at the root of the uprisings that we ve seen not only in hong kong but in india chile and france and in iran iraq and lebanon but it also lies at the root of the rise of these right wing demagogues as we just saw in britain with boris johnson narendra modi in india and trump in the united states and so yes i think that we re not immune to this kind of social unrest and this kind of upheaval especially as the forces that created it have no regulation and no restraint student debt personal debt national debt we re about to watch the republican party again take an axe and slash social services and food stamps these corporatists know only one word and that s more and they won t stop until there s blowback the problem is that if that blowback is just kind of a release in the streets of anger and frustration and rage all legitimate without an alternative vision and without alternative structures to begin to challenge power then it can be crushed ctf when we were involved in occupy it was a different phase of the movement s development occupy was an eruption of anger the 99 versus the 1 since occupy there has been a lot of work done by various groups on new economy ideas whether it s participatory budgeting or worker owned businesses cooperatives or public banks california is the first state to do a public bank since north dakota in 1919 20 we re seeing some movement toward the beginning i think of a vision that you re describing and i think that s a potential positive the other thing that s a challenge in the united states is the electoral system because right now so many activists are getting pulled into the 2020 election particularly through the sanders campaign and a little bit through the warren campaign and somewhat in the green efforts but those are so squashed in the united states that they are hardly visible we see the election system as a kind of a mirage democracy it s molded manipulated and in the end never quenches people s needs sanders is interesting because if he loses because of a democratic primary violation that could create an eruption itself if he wins then you have someone in office you can actually push to try to get things done that may cause an eruption can the sanders campaign have that kind of an impact ch i think you could make a strong case that the nomination was stolen from sanders in 2016 people walked out of the democratic national convention but it didn t have that impact the new york times has run more than one story where they are interviewing anonymous democratic party donors who are already organizing to make sure neither sanders nor warren and i don t trust warren too much get the nomination it is the question of whether you can work from within i have long argued that the democratic party is not salvageable it s not reformable it is not in any sense a real political party in that the base has any real say maybe the sanders campaign will prove me wrong i hope they do prove me wrong but i don t think so and if sanders did get the nomination these rich donors who find trump an embarrassment and repugnant and vulgar and inept have made it clear they will support trump if sanders had won in 2016 we would have had complete paralysis because sanders would have never had the base within either the republican or the democratic party to push through the kinds of reforms he says he wants to institute i just don t think at this point our system of what sheldon wolin called inverted totalitarianism is reformable or salvageable nor do i think that electoral politics are going to bring about the kinds of radical reforms especially in terms of our addiction to fossil fuels that are urgently needed ctf what s happening in chile is really interesting because it is stronger than what anyone predicted piñera just announced that in april he will put forward discussions and planning to talk about developing a new constitution which is one of the major demands of the protesters what are your thoughts on what s happening down there ch the examples of chile hong kong and lebanon are important because these people have taken to the streets to put pressure on the ruling elites which is what we have to do that constitution was written as soon as pinochet took power by the so called chicago school the global corporatist and neo liberal milton friedman type economists on behalf of the world s ruling elites and the hands of any chilean government have been effectively tied because of that constitution there s nothing at this point that has proved to be an impediment to the further concentration of wealth in the hands of this global oligarchic elite eight families now hold as much wealth as 50 percent of the world s population we re certainly seeing during the trump administration an acceleration of the demolition of government controls and regulations the further privatizing of public lands and public services the assault on labor unions the ability of global speculators to use trillions of dollars lent to them of government money at virtually zero percent interest to do things like buy back their own stock to swell their own compensation packages the corporations are back to doing exactly what they were doing before 2008 with structured asset destruction through inflation stripping assets through mergers and acquisitions and raising levels of debt incumbency which has created this huge debt peonage on the public jamie dimon has been indicted along with jpmorgan chase more than any other bank in american history for this kind of fraud i mean really sleazy stuff like having veterans sign mortgage loans and then jacking those loans up to amounts that they can t pay we ve created another bubble the ponzi schemes are back in business in addition to creating income inequality and monopoly power that is going to create another financial collapse when it comes i don t know what will trigger it but it s not a sustainable system and what will happen then will they go back and demand more money trillions of dollars from the us treasury how will people react certainly people will react with a kind of outrage and anger but we re headed for an extremely difficult period especially because they have stripped us of all of our rights privacy due process habeas corpus and now under section 1021 of the national defense authorization act they can deploy the military into the streets and they ll use everything within their power they will not shrink from using coercion and force to maintain control and it could get pretty ugly i mean we have a thousand of our citizens right now who are shot dead by police almost all of them unarmed almost all poor people of color in american cities that s one every eight hours ctf one of the challenges on the left is understanding what s happening around the world the united states is getting more aggressive and somewhat more sophisticated in its regime change campaigns there are so many reasons for people in hong kong to protest it s a neoliberal capitalist paradise where there s almost no enforcement of business or finance crimes and people have a very wide wealth divide and inequality expensive housing and low paying jobs with no future it s just a really hard situation for the vast majority of people in hong kong so it s understandable that it s a big uprising then it s interesting to see the national endowment for democracy s role in hong kong they are spending more than a million dollars a year they have been funding anti china movements in hong kong since before the turnover of hong kong to china these hong kong protests are turning into trump save us or anti china stuff singing the star spangled banner or putting up the uk flag in the legislature saying bring us back to colonialism this is really the us targeting china ch right but it was lord salisbury who said there are no permanent allies there s only permanent power so if you look at the whole human rights drive going back to charter 77 founded by václav havel in czechoslovakia he was a non person within czechoslovakia the only way you could hear václav havel s voice was over voice of america i knew havel and havel was not a supporter of us imperialism he was a socialist in repressive situations we ll often make alliances all the points you make are true i m not arguing them but the idea that any resistance movement is somehow untainted is wrong in the whole cold war the soviet union which you know had a very deeply repressive anti democratic system backed revolutionary socialist governments such as the cuban government which i would support in terms of foreign affairs there often are contradictions moral contradictions as you correctly pointed out but i don t think that invalidates the uprisings themselves ctf the 2020s are going to be a time when major crises are culminating the climate crisis economic crisis militarism and repression what would be your advice to activists to where they should put their focus or things that they should be preparing for ch well i think extinction rebellion which is this radical climate group that just organized thousands of people to shut down city centers in about 60 cities around the globe has got it it s nonviolent occupation of bridges and roads and roundabouts to paralyze commerce and to begin to force the ruling elites to respond to the climate emergency extinction rebellion is quite clear that they re not interested in reform they re interested in rebellion they are interested in removing the ruling elites from power they will do that by breaking the law and by going to jail over a thousand people were arrested in london that s where we really have to go we have to use our numbers to paralyze the system that s the only hope that we have and i think that s what we have been seeing in countries like lebanon chile and hong kong i think especially if we talk about the climate emergency alone that is the only mechanism left to save us ctf thank you chris you can read chris on truthdig and watch him on rt sign up

across the spectrum of differing political views whether progressive nationalist populist or conservative there is a common presumption in all of their policy positions and programs that common dominator is the premise that government is to be the guiding hand in directing and remaking society in some chosen form to which and within which all in that society are to be confined and made to conform the progressives herald a new dawn of democratic egalitarianism based on the identity politics of race gender and social class the nationalists hark back to a restoration of national identity in which the state defines and determines a nation s historic qualities and characteristics for the protection and preservation of which government regulations and restrictions are to be employed populists demand a redistribution of governmental power and favoritism more into the hands of those who they say have been taken advantage of in the existing establishment system of things and american conservatives who once declared at least a rhetorical allegiance to the country s founding limited government principles seem to want nothing more than retaining or regaining political power and are willing to be as regulatory and redistributive in their practical policy decisions as the progressives they rail against lost in this ideological and political policy warfare among them for the governmental reins of plunder and privilege is the idea and ideal of classical or limited government liberalism with its defense of individual liberty free market economics civil liberties under an impartial rule of law and an ethics of non interventionism at home and abroad in the face of these competing yet philosophically complementary demands for retention and expansion of big brother over even more of our lives in a growing number of directions it is worthwhile to remind ourselves of the premises behind and the realities of the political paternalism that they jointly represent paternalism and political power first and foremost the guiding idea behind political paternalism is that the individual cannot be trusted to be a free and responsible human being those who wish to socially engineer our lives consider us too ignorant too irresponsible and too narrow in our own personal planning horizons to intelligently and reasonably take care of our own health care our own retirement our own family s education or our own spending and consumption choices these political paternalists who are proposing to enlarge the agenda of the interventionist welfare state implicitly consider themselves superior to the rest of us with arrogance and immeasurable hubris they presume to know what is good for us better than we know ourselves they are nothing less than would be tyrants and despots determined to make the world over in their own ideological image and of course all for our own good whether we want it or not in addition they are willing to use force against their fellow human beings to attain their paternalistic ends that is they believe that it is morally right for the state to use its coercive powers to take the income and wealth of some to give to others if an innocent citizen were to resist having his income and wealth redistributed the paternalists clearly believe that the state has the right to even kill him since the police agents of the state have the legitimized authority to use lethal force against those who resist its power under a variety of circumstances so someone else can have his or her food stamps or free for all health care or tuition free higher education or huge farm subsidy to compensate for the negative impact from trade wars that turn out not to be that easy to win or if this seems like an extreme or an exaggerated statement see how the government will react if on the day your income taxes are due you inform the tax authority that you are sending in a tax payment to cover your contribution for police courts and national defense but you re withholding any amount that would fund any of its redistributive programs because you consider them unnecessary and immoral you soon may be facing jail time or physical harm if you resist their confiscatory seizure of your property for unpaid taxes special interest biases and political plunder second a number of economists such as nobel laureate james buchanan have taught us that the actual politics of government intervention and redistribution have little to do with high minded notions concerning some hypothetical public good or general interest the reality of democratic politics is that politicians want campaign contributions and votes to be elected and reelected and they offer in exchange other people s money those who supply those campaign contributions and votes want the money of others which they are not able to honestly earn through the free play of open competition in the marketplace the bias in the democratic process toward political plunder is due to what is called a concentration of benefits and a diffusion of burdens that results from various government interventions suppose that in a country of 30 million people the government taxes each citizen 1 and then redistributes that 30 million among a special interest group of 30 individuals each taxpayer will have one extra dollar taken away from them by the government for the year while each of the 30 recipients of this wealth transfer will gain an extra 1 million the 30 recipients will collectively have a strong incentive to lobby influence and even corruptly sell their votes to the politicians able to pass this redistributive legislation each individual taxpayer on the other hand will have little incentive to spend the time and effort to counter lobby influence and petition members of the legislature merely to save 1 off his or her annual tax bill that ends up being earmarked for that more concentrated special interest group thus modern democracy has degenerated into a system of political plunder and special privilege at the expense of consumers taxpayers and competing producers in society the mirage of social justice third as another nobel prize winning economist friedrich a hayek persuasively argued even if we assumed that the political paternalists have the most benevolent motives in mind there is no real meaning to ideas such as social justice or politically enforced fairness they are all mirages hayek warned the market does not reward some hypothetical notion of merit or goodness the market rewards service i e did an individual succeed in offering to others some specialized product in the market system of division of labor that was valued by those others who were willing to pay a particular price for it there is in fact no objective measure of an individual s real merit or worth or need and therefore there is no impartial and unbiased way the state can bestow on each member of society some fraction of national income that reflects their socially just and deserved amount if the state which really means the individual politicians and bureaucrats holding the levers of control over such matters in government attempts such a socially just redistribution it cannot escape therefore from being intrusive arbitrary and corrupt as each and every group hopes to gain their better fair share through lobbying and pressuring those who ladle out the largess of other people s money hence it is far better to leave such issues to the private sector charity of individuals and voluntary associations who in spending their own money will do so based on their own evaluation of who may or may not deserve charitable support guided by their own personal standards of benevolence plus private charity precisely because it relies on voluntary contributions is far more efficient in their tasks than the coercive monopoly welfare state why because private charities must demonstrate to their voluntary supporters that their dollars have been spent effectively otherwise their support diminishes over time in competition with other charities and other uses the donors have for their own money perverse incentives due to moral hazard fourth the interventionist welfare state produces over time perverse incentives and behavior among the members of society economists call this moral hazard if the costs and consequences of someone s mistakes and bad judgment are paid for and subsidized by others then the person making those mistakes or acts of bad judgment has no incentive to learn from his mistakes and act more carefully and wisely in the future thus you create an incentive for such individuals to do the same thoughtless or reckless actions again in the future plus you signal to others in society that they too can act in the same irresponsible ways and have someone else the taxpayer pick up the tab for their mistakes in the future as well because of earlier government bailouts the too big to fail financial institutions on wall street believed they could act recklessly leading up to the crisis of 2008 2009 with their depositors and investors money because they were confident and were right for the most part that government would bail them out also if their creative investment strategies were to turn into big losses if individuals expect the government to plan for their old age provide their health care needs oversee the education of their children guarantee them a job monitor what they eat drink watch and read as well as cover their losses from bad decisions then why or how shall those individuals ever learn or be motivated to be more self responsible in these and related affairs of everyday life this does not make for a healthy and productive society in the longer run government deficits and growing debt fifth an expanding interventionist welfare state generates growing financial demands on the regulatory and redistributive powers of the state with no fiscal constitution imposing a balanced budget or other limits on the expenditures of the government modern democratic society has plunged further and further into deficit spending and mounting government debt we are right now witnessing that government debt grow by a trillion dollars a year with no end in sight government debt is a lien on citizens income in the future since the principle and interest is supposed to be paid off at some point as the government s ious come due thus today s deficits mean higher taxes or even more government borrowing tomorrow to at least pay the growing interest on that accumulated debt but we also need to remember that we pay for that deficit spending not only tomorrow when the borrowed sums and interest payments are supposed to be paid we pay for it in the present as well every dollar borrowed today by the government siphons off a dollar that otherwise would have been available for private sector investment and use the society s resources are finite at any moment in time those scarce resources are used either by individuals in the private sector or by those running the government they cannot be used by both of these potential users at the same time thus every dollar borrowed by the government today and the real resources that dollar s purchasing power represents in the marketplace is a dollar not being used for say capital formation technological innovation or improvements in private sector job skills so workers may earn higher wages in the future instead that dollar and the real resources it represents is used by government for current consumption government employee salaries welfare payments military interventions in faraway places or for the fuel to fly the president s air force one and a host of other government activities as a result we are that much poorer as a society due to those resources being used for current government directed consumption rather than future oriented capital formation for higher and better standards of living tomorrow by profit oriented private enterprises on a freer market the new road to serfdom all of these factors and others that could be listed show the perils of political paternalism and power lusting the interventionist welfare state has been and will continue to lead us down a dangerous new road to serfdom in which our lives are more and more controlled managed and manipulated by those in political power who claim the right to dictate how we are to live and work it encapsulates an evil immorality in which political force continues to claim the authority to deny us our individual rights to life liberty and honestly acquired property the interventionist welfare state has been creating a new feudalism with political and special interest elites who serve as the lords who rule over and ruin the rest of us the modern serfs who are expected to toil for their benefit under strangling regulations burdensome taxes and intrusive social controls in the name of political correctness and identity politics now and in the future all of us who prefer to be free men in a free society with a free market need to do all in our intellectual power to stop and reverse this reactionary counterrevolution against the ideal of human liberty otherwise our civilization may be heading for a terrible collapse that will leave nothing but tyranny and poverty for too many for generations to come

energy infrastructure industry with an emphasis on securities issued by master limited partnerships mlps which may increase price fluctuation the value of commodity linked investments such as the mlps and energy infrastructure companies including midstream mlps and energy infrastructure companies in which the fund invests are subject to risks specific to the industry they serve such as fluctuations in commodity prices reduced volumes of available natural gas or other energy commodities slowdowns in new construction and acquisitions a sustained reduced demand for crude oil natural gas and refined petroleum products depletion of the natural gas reserves or other commodities changes in the macroeconomic or regulatory environment environmental hazards rising interest rates and threats of attack by terrorists on energy assets each of which could affect the fund s profitability mlps are subject to significant regulation and may be adversely affected by changes in the regulatory environment including the risk that an mlp could lose its tax status as a partnership if an mlp was obligated to pay federal income tax on its income at the corporate tax rate the amount of cash available for distribution would be reduced and such distributions received by the fund would be taxed under federal income tax laws applicable to corporate dividends received as dividend income return of capital or capital gain in addition investing in mlps involves additional risks as compared to the risks of investing in common stock including risks related to cash flow dilution and voting rights such companies may trade less frequently than larger companies due to their smaller capitalizations which may result in erratic price movement or difficulty in buying or selling the fund is a non

holders of mlp units have the rights typically afforded to limited partners in a limited partnership as compared to common shareholders of a corporation holders of mlp units have more limited control

private equity firms raise and deploy record amounts of capital according to data analysis firm mergermarket by the halfway point of 2019 the global value of m a hit 1 8 trillion based on 8 201 transactions of that amount global private equity accounted for 1 494 deals worth 245 1 billion canada is riding this wave investment banking firm crosbie company notes that canadian m a hit a new record high in the second quarter of 2019 with 886 deals worth c 70 5 billion cross border activity accounted for 43 of canadian deals according to the canadian venture capital and private equity association in the first half of 2019 private equity firms invested c 4 89 billion in canada in 289 deals it s fair to expect that more capital held by us and other non canadian private equity funds will be invested into canada over the next several months and years factors relevant to foreign investors actors relevant to foreign investors non canadian investors must be aware of a number of potential regulatory and tax issues that arise in the context of their investments in canadian businesses regulatory issues may be triggered pursuant to the investment canada act ica canada s foreign investment regulation which applies to any acquisition of control of a canadian business by a non canadian investor where they meet certain financial thresholds acquisitions may be subject to economic review and extremely rarely prohibited if based on factors such as the nature of the acquired business and the identity of the investor the regulator determines that the transaction is not of net benefit to canada in recent years the number of acquisitions subject to economic review under the icahas declined owing to welcome increases in the financial thresholds triggering a review particularly for investors from countries with trade agreements in place with canada such as the united states and the eu most investments instead proceed by way of an administrative notification to the government with no review under the icarequired in addition even where they do not meet the financial thresholds triggering an economic review or do not constitute an acquisition of control such as minority investments investments by non canadians are also subject to potential national security review under the ica under this process investments may be reviewed and prohibited where they are deemed injurious to canadian national security in this way the icais similar to cfius in the united states investors must also be aware of applicable requirements of canada s anti trust statute the competition act canada tax issues with which non canadian investors are faced include the potential loss of a corporation s status as a canadian controlled private corporation or a ccpc and the tax advantages afforded by this status there are also structuring routes that foreign investors should explore when making an acquisition in canada including the so called leveraged equity structure which will be discussed herein i regulatory matters investment canada act the icaallows the canadian federal government to screen proposed foreign investments to ensure that they are likely to produce a net benefit to canada direct acquisitions of canadian businesses by non canadians are subject to automatic economic review if the enterprise value of the canadian business exceeds a specified threshold for 2019 the threshold for a wto investor i e an investor ultimately controlled by nationals of a wto member country is c 1 045 billion in enterprise value and will be indexed to canadian gdp growth for 2020 and onward for investors from countries party to certain trade agreements with canada which includes notably the us europe and parties to the trans pacific partnership this threshold is even higher at c 1 568 billion also subject to annual indexing lower thresholds apply in the case of other types of investors such as non wto investors or state owned enterprises lower thresholds also apply in the case of investments in cultural businesses generally businesses involved in activities such as the production sale publication or distribution of film music books newspapers or magazines if a transaction does not meet the applicable monetary threshold no pre closing notice is required from the investor to the regulator however a notification is required to be filed by the investor within 30 days after closing in most cases this notification is an administrative formality a transaction that is reviewable under the economic review sections of the icawill be approved only if the canadian government determines that the transaction is likely to produce a net benefit to canada in making this determination the government will take into account the following the effect of the investment on the level and nature of economic activity in canada the degree and significance of participation by canadians in the canadian business and the relevant canadian industry the effect of the investment on productivity industrial efficiency technological development product innovation and product variety in canada the effect of the investment on competition within any industry in canada the compatibility of the investment with national industrial economic and cultural policies and the effect of the investment on canada s ability to compete in world markets it is very common for the government to require investors to provide legally binding undertakings as a condition to receiving a net benefit to canada ruling these undertakings which will vary from transaction to transaction in light of the particular facts may include commitments to maintain employment levels in canada to appoint and maintain a certain number of canadians to board or senior management positions and to make minimum capital expenditures in canada the undertakings are typically in place for a certain number of years following closing the government will generally monitor the investor s compliance with the undertakings with periodic progress reports transactions in which the applicable monetary threshold is not met may nevertheless be reviewed by the government where it has reasonable grounds to believe that the investment could be injurious to national security this concept is not defined in the icaor its regulations though the government has released guidelines as to the factors it will consider the government has 45 days from the date it receives notice of a transaction to advise the investor that it may undertake such a review our experience since the national security review rules were implemented in 2009 is that very few transactions attract the scrutiny of the canadian government on national security grounds but any investment in canada by a non canadian investor can trigger this process regardless of whether it is reviewable or notifiable according to the rules above whether by a us investor or other whether it is for the establishment of a new canadian business the acquisition of control of a canadian business or the acquisition of a minority interest in a canadian business and the dollar value of the transaction that said investors from certain countries and into sensitive industries may attract the most scrutiny under the national security provisions of the ica notably national security review applies not only to the acquisition of control of a canadian business but also to minority investments in canadian businesses furthermore there is no minimum dollar threshold for national security review i e investments in targets with low enterprise values are nonetheless potentially reviewable the timeline for national security review is prescribed by regulation and has potential to add significant delays to the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals if the maximum periods under the regulations are fully utilized a national security review could take 200 days or longer upon the consent of the investor as there is no formal pre closing notification requirement in relation to a national security review if government approval is not otherwise required prior to closing i e the mandatory threshold for economic review is not met it is possible that an investor may learn that the transaction is subject to national security review only following closing upon receipt of a notice from the government however even if a pre closing icareview is not required prior to closing an investor may choose to file a notification in advance of closing in order to trigger the 45 day period in which government must give notice of a review or possible review under the regulations competition act canada canada s anti trust statute the competition act applies equally to canadian and non canadian investors the competition bureau which is tasked with overseeing the competition act requires mandatory pre merger notification if certain monetary thresholds are met this is determined based on a complex formula that considers several factors such as sales revenues and assets of the target and its affiliates and potentially the investor and its affiliates in the case of acquisitions of interests in partnerships or corporations certain voting interest or shareholding thresholds must also be met before a notification is triggered we have developed a merger notification assessment tool to guide companies through the process it can be found on our website and in our report canadian competition and foreign investment outlook 2019 if a transaction exceeds the applicable thresholds it will require a pre closing notification to the commissioner of competition even if the transaction does not meet the threshold the commissioner can investigate any transaction within a year after closing if it believes that the transaction would or would be likely to prevent or lessen competition substantially in a relevant market this is the same test that the commissioner uses when deciding whether to initiate an application to the competition tribunal and it is also the test that the tribunal uses in its adjudication of an application in applying the test the commissioner and the tribunal may consider a number of antitrust factors and arguments depending on facts of the case these may include the extent and availability of acceptable substitutes for any overlapping products or services supplied by the parties potential barriers to entry in the relevant market s whether the transaction would result in the removal of a vigorous and effective competitor the extent to which there would be effective remaining competition following the transaction including considering in some cases competition from foreign competitors the nature and extent of change and innovation in the relevant market and whether the business of a party to the transaction has failed or is likely to fail in the absence of the transaction in an analysis unique to canada the bureau and tribunal may also consider an efficiencies defense if raised by the parties that is where the efficiency gains likely to result from the transaction are large enough to offset any likely anti competitive effects the tribunal may not make an order in respect of the transaction the bureau which recently raised its merger review filing fee to c 73 584 maintains a steady flow of cases in 2017 2018 it concluded 253 merger reviews while the bureau s initial statutory waiting period following receipt of a notification is 30 days the majority of mergers are cleared prior to this period in 2017 2018 for instance most mergers fell into the non complex category and were cleared within the 14 day non binding service standard about 30 of mergers were classified by the bureau as complex and took on average 53 days to review slightly above the bureau s non binding 45 day service standard the bureau also has the ability to issue a supplemental information request sir similar to the us second request system under the us hart scott rodino act which can require significant documentary productions where the bureau issues a sir it triggers an additional 30 day waiting period following both parties filing of certified responses to the sir during which the transaction cannot be closed however sirs have been used sparingly and were invoked in only 13 complex merger transactions considered in 2018 it is important to note that several transactions also proceeded to close despite not receiving positive clearance once the applicable statutory waiting periods had run out a potential sign of future trends the bureau retains the ability to challenge a transaction in such a case within one year following closing ii tax matters canadian controlled private corporations non canadian investors in canadian businesses need to be aware of the tax advantages afforded to ccpcs the canadian federal income tax act tax act provides ccpcs with a range of preferential tax treatment not available to public or noncanadian private corporations including a lower effective tax rate on its first c 500 000 of net active business income the potential for individual shareholders to each claim a lifetime capital gains exemption on the sale of the shares of the corporation c 866 912 for dispositions in 2019 preferential tax treatment for employees holding stock options and enhanced and refundable investment tax credits on all or a portion of the corporation s sr ed qualified expenditure pool an sr ed credit is an important federal tax credit that applies to expenditures related to basic and applied research undertaken for the advancement of scientific knowledge and experimental development undertaken for the purpose of achieving technological advancement these credits are often significant and sometimes the only source of income for technology and science based companies equivalent credits may be available under provincial legislation as the name suggests an important factor in being a ccpc is that the corporation be controlled by canadians if a ccpc is controlled by someone other than a canadian at any point in a year it is deemed to have not been a ccpc for such entire year and will lose all the tax benefits relating to ccpc status for that year and all subsequent tax periods during which it is not canadian controlled where a non canadian acquires voting control of a ccpc ccpc status will be lost at closing non canadian investors should understand the impact that the loss of ccpc status will have on the target s balance sheet such as a substantial loss in the value of sr ed tax credits available to the company where a non canadian acquires a minority interest in a ccpc i e less than 50 of the voting shares even if a greater percentage of the economic interests is acquired there are ways to structure the acquisition and the post closing arrangements between the shareholders to try to ensure that the corporation maintains its ccpc status despite the foreign ownership in general a ccpc is a canadian private corporation that is not controlled directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever by one or more non resident persons or public corporations by referring to control the definition of ccpc captures de jure control i e legal control and by referring to directly or indirectly in manner whatsoever it also captures de facto control i e control in fact the tax act also contains various provisions that for the purposes of determining control deem persons who have certain rights with respect to the shares of a corporation to be in the same position in relation to the control of the corporation as if they had already exercised those rights two things to bear in mind first it is possible for one person to have de jure control while another person simultaneously has de facto control and second if non residents have any one of de jure or de facto control cpcc status will be lost the concept of de jure control looks at who has effective control over the affairs of the corporation effective control is established by looking exclusively at the corporation s governing statute its share register and its constating documents and by determining who has the ability to elect the majority of the board of directors and the extent to which there are restrictions on the powers of the board of directors to manage the corporation the reason being that generally under corporate law the directors of a corporation have the right to control the affairs of the corporation but since the shareholders elect the board of directors in reality the shareholder who holds more than 50 of the voting shares typically will have effective control of the corporation except where the powers of the directors are sufficiently restricted by the constating documents for the purposes of determining ccpc status the tax act not only considers whether de jure control is held by non resident persons individually but it also considers them together more specifically the tax act looks at whether a single hypothetical person would have de jure control if all the shares held by all non resident persons and all public corporations were held by that hypothetical person and whether the non residents and public corporations are related or are acting in concert the tax act provides that a person has de facto control where that person has any direct or indirect influence that if exercised would result in control in fact of the corporation note that a person does not need to own a single share in the corporation to have de facto control of the corporation a question that has often been debated is what type of influence matters for the purposes of de facto control over the years two types of influence have been considered i influence over the composition or the powers of the board of directors of the corporation and ii operational influence over the corporation influence over the composition or the powers of the board of directors is the narrower test essentially it is established by asking whether anyone has the ability to effect a significant change in the board of directors or the powers of the board of directors or to influence in a very direct way the shareholders who would otherwise have the ability to elect the board of directors operational influence is the broader test and looks at economic dependence and the ability to influence day to day operations to determine whether a person has operational control of a corporation one must consider all factors that are relevant in the circumstances and not merely whether a person has a legally enforceable right or ability to effect a change in the board of directors of the corporation courts have not clarified the breadth of the expression all factors that are relevant in the circumstances therefore there is some uncertainty regarding what factors are relevant and how they should be weighed relative to each other it is clear however that agreements between shareholders will be considered where a transaction has been structured such that the non canadian investor does not hold voting control of the corporation or the power to elect a majority of the board of directors the non canadian investor may seek to exercise control over the corporation through a shareholders agreement if pursuant to the corporation s shareholders agreement the non canadian shareholder has the right to require the corporation to take specified actions there is a heightened risk that the corporation will be held to not be controlled by canadians alternatively non canadian shareholders can hold some approval rights in a shareholders agreement and still have the corporation maintain ccpc status however care must be taken when drafting them to ensure that they are not overtly broad and run afoul of the de jure and de facto control restrictions placed on ccpc ownership for example a corporation likely would not lose ccpc status if the noncanadian shareholders approval rights related to matters that are particularly material to the value of the non canadian s investment and therefore are considered acceptable governance clauses designed to protect and enhance the rights of the investors acceptable approval rights would typically include the right to veto decisions involving winding up and dissolution of the corporation the payment of dividends acquisitions or sales of businesses incurring debt above a specified threshold that is relatively material given the size of the business salary setting for and retention of key employees and approving budgets it should be noted that any rights of non canadian investors to acquire additional shares of the corporation that would give them voting control or to require the corporation to redeem shares held by canadians that if exercised would give the non canadian voting control will be deemed to be exercised for the purposes of determining control moreover those rights are taken into account even if they are remote more specifically they do not need to be immediate absolute or under contract from a practical perspective for the purposes of ccpc status various instruments that may be used as part of an investment such as options to acquire shares redeemable shares convertible shares convertible debt put and call rights or even binding letters of intent to acquire shares from another shareholder will be considered and can result in a finding of control by non canadians even though the underlying right is not actually exercised this same deeming rule will also cause control to be acquired for purposes of ccpc status in the context of an m a transaction at the time of signing of a share purchase agreement whether or not the closing date of the transaction is delayed there are some exceptions in terms of administrative practice rights of first refusal and shotgun provisions are normally not considered for the purpose of the deeming provisions leveraged equity structures private equity investors strive to finance their acquisition with third party debt in the most efficient and tax effective manner in canada structures can be implemented that allow us private equity funds to convert up to 60 of their equity investment in a canadian corporation into intercompany interest bearing debt without a corresponding interest income accrual being realized by the funds and their investors for us tax purposes these structures often rely on the different treatment afforded to such structures under canadian and us domestic tax laws and pursuant to administrative pronouncements issued by the canadian and us tax authorities the canadian tax system looks at the legal nature of arrangements and tends to defer to form in the absence of a sham and therefore views these arrangements as being debt giving rise to deductible interest expense on the other hand the us tax system favors economic substance over legal form and often views these arrangements as equity or as taking place between two non us entities thereby avoiding annual interest accrual for the private equity funds and their investors the savings realized through these structures usually increase every year due to annual reinvestments which are typically required by third party lenders and could further increase upon future capital injections to finance add on acquisitions in canada possible future leverage recapitalization transactions and the holding period of the investment will affect the tax benefit of any such structure the tax benefit of these structures depends on the ability of the related party extending the shareholder loan to secure an interest withholding tax rate that is significantly lower than the combined canadian federal and provincial income tax rate applicable to the canadian corporation in most cases canadian withholding tax of 10 is paid on the interest on the shareholder debt considering prevailing canadian corporate income tax rates of approximately 25 31 depending on provincial revenue and salaries mix net cash tax savings achieved are typically 15 21 third party debtholders must and typically do agree to allow withholding tax and structure costs to be funded with corporate cash flow as long as the remaining portion of the interest payment is reinvested for additional debt and equity 60 40 to ensure that these structures are robust they require annual maintenance including proper governance at the level of any intermediary lending entity and flow of funds to service interest on shareholder debt to secure reduced canadian withholding tax on interest an analysis of the treaty eligibility of the private equity funds investors is mandated due to their complexity and the associated implementation costs these structures are typically suitable only for acquisitions where the equity investment of the fund into canada is sizable conclusion overall canada remains an enticing market for all private equity investors including those based in the us europe
