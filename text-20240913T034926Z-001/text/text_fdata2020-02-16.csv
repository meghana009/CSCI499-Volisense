this decision of repudiation was intrinsic to this first big movement for social emancipation which rattled the russian empire in 1905 this huge revolutionary uprising was caused by the conjunction of many factors the russian debacle in its war with japan the wrath of peasants demanding land the rejection of autocracy workers demands the movement began with strikes in st petersburg in 1905 and soon spread throughout the empire like wildfire adopting different forms of struggle in february 1918 the repudiation of the debt by the soviet government shocked international finance and sparked off unanimous condemnation by the governments of the great powers russia repudiation of debt at the heart of the revolutions of 1905 and 1917 trotsky who presided over the soviet of st petersburg capital of russia until march 1918 explained in his autobiography that the arrest of its entire leadership on december 3 1905 was triggered by the publication of a manifesto in which the elected members of the council appealed for the repudiation of debts contracted by the tsarist regime he also explained that this 1905 call for the non payment of the debt was finally realized in early 1918 when the soviet government adopted a decree for the repudiation of the tsarist debts the arrest took place a day after we had published our so called financial manifesto which proclaimed that the financial bankruptcy of czarism was inevitable and issued a categorical warning that the debts incurred by the romanovs would not be recognized by the victorious nation the manifesto of the soviet of workers delegates plainly declared the autocracy never enjoyed the confidence of the people and was never granted any authority by the people we have therefore decided not to allow the repayment of such loans as have been made by the czarist government when openly engaged in a war with the entire people the french bourse answered our manifesto a few months later with a new loan of three quarters of a million francs the liberal and reactionary press poured sarcasm over the important threat of the soviets against the czar s finances and the european bankers in later years the manifesto was successfully forgotten but it recalled itself to mind the financial bankruptcy of czarism prepared for by its whole past history coincided with the military debacle and later after the victory of the revolution the decree of the soviet of people s commissars issued on february 10 1918 declared all the czarist debts annulled this decree remains in force even to this day it is wrong to say as some do that the october revolution does not recognize any obligations its own obligations the revolution recognizes to the full the obligation that it took upon itself on december 2 1905 it carried out on february 10 1918 the revolution is fully entitled to remind the creditors of czarism gentlemen you were warned in ample time in this respect as in others the year 1905 was a preparation for the year 1917 in the book entitled 1905 trotsky described the development of events that led to the adoption of the financial manifesto through which the soviet the supreme organ of revolutionary democracy called for the refusal of payment of debts contracted by the tsar a tremendous field of action was opening up before the soviet everywhere a vast expanse of new political ground was waiting for the deep plowshare of revolution but time was short the reaction was feverishly forging its weapons and the blow was expected from hour to hour amid the mass of day to day business the executive committee hurried to put the soviet s resolution of november 27 into action it issued a proclamation addressed to the troops see the november strike and at a joint meeting with representatives of the revolutionary parties approved the text of a financial manifesto on december 2 the manifesto was published in eight st petersburg newspapers four socialist ones and four liberal ones here is the text of this historic document the government is on the brink of bankruptcy it has reduced the country to ruins and scattered it with corpses the peasants worn out by suffering and hunger are incapable of paying taxes the government gave credits to the landowners out of the people s money now it is at a loss as to what to do with the landowners mortgaged estates factories and plants are at a standstill there is unemployment and a general stagnation of trade the government has used the capital obtained by foreign loans to build railways warships and fortresses and to store up arms foreign sources have now been exhausted and state orders have also come to an end the merchant the supplier the contractor the factory owner accustomed to enriching themselves at the treasury s expense find themselves without new profits and are closing down their offices and plants one bankruptcy follows another banks are failing all trade exchanges have been reduced to the barest minimum the government s struggle against revolution is causing daily unrest no one is any longer sure what the morrow will bring foreign capital is going back home purely russian capital is also seeping away into foreign banks the rich are selling their property and going abroad in search of safety the birds of prey are fleeing the country and taking the people s property with them for many years the government has spent all its state revenue on the army and navy there is a shortage of schools roads have been neglected in spite of this there is not enough money even to keep the troops supplied with food the war was lost partly because military supplies were inadequate mutinies of the poverty stricken hungry troops are flaring up all over the country the railways are economically sick through the government s fault many millions of roubles are needed to restore the railway economy the government has pilfered the savings banks and handed out deposits to support private banks and industrial enterprises often entirely fictitious ones it is using the small saver s capital to play the stock exchange where that capital is exposed to risk daily the gold reserves of the state bank are negligible compared with the existing claims of government loans and the demands of trade turnover it will be reduced to nothing if gold coin is demanded for every transaction taking advantage of the absence of any control of the state finances the government has long been issuing loans which far exceed the country s means of payment with these new loans it is covering the interest on old ones year after year the government issues false accounts of expenditure and revenue showing both to be less than they are in reality and robbing indiscriminately to show a surplus instead of an annual deficit officials are free to rob the treasury which in any case is already exhausted only the constituent assembly after the overthrow of the autocracy can halt this financial ruin it will carry out a close investigation of the state finances and will draw up a detailed clear accurate and certified balance sheet of state revenue and expenditure budget fear of popular control which would reveal to all the world the government s financial insolvency is forcing it to keep putting off the convening of the people s representative assembly in order to safeguard its rapacious activities the government forces the people to fight unto death hundreds of thousands of citizens perish and are ruined in this fight and industry trade and means of communication are destroyed at their very foundations there is only one way out to overthrow the government to deprive it of its last strength it is necessary to cut the government off from the last source of its existence financial revenue this is necessary not only for the country s political and economic liberation but also more particularly in order to restore the financial equilibrium of the state we have therefore decided to refuse to make land redemption payments and all other payments to the treasury in all transactions and in the payment of wages and salaries to demand gold and in the case of sums of less than five roubles full weight hard cash coinage to withdraw deposits from savings banks and from the state bank demanding payment of the entire sum in gold the autocracy has never enjoyed the people s confidence and has never received any authority from the people at the present time the government is behaving within the frontiers of its own country as though it were ruling conquered territory we have therefore decided not to allow the repayment of loans which the government contracted while it was clearly and openly waging war against the entire people end of the manifesto text under the manifesto published in the press on december 2 1905 appeared the list of the following organizations who supported this appeal to refuse the payment of czarist debt and asphyxiate the autocracy financially the soviet of workers deputies the main committee of the all russian peasants union the central committee and the organization committee of the russian social democratic workers party the central committee of the party of socialist revolutionaries the central committee of the polish socialist party trotsky added a final commentary it goes without saying that this manifesto could not in itself overthrow tsarism and its finances the soviet s financial manifesto was nothing other than an overture to the december rising reinforced by a strike and by fighting on the barricades it produced a powerful echo throughout the country whereas during the month of december in the previous three years deposits in savings banks had exceeded payments by 4 million roubles in december 1905 the excess of payments over deposits equalled 90 million during a single month the manifesto extracted 94 million roubles from government reserves when the insurrection had been crushed by the tsarist hordes equilibrium in the savings banks was once more restored the denunciation of the illegitimate and odious character of the tsarist debt played a fundamental role in the revolutions of 1905 and 1917 the call not to repay debts was finally realized in the decree for the repudiation of debt adopted by the soviet government in february 1918 from tsarist russia to the 1917 revolution and the repudiation of debt the napoleonic wars ended with russia emerging as a great european power and participating in the holy alliance of three european monarchies founded on september 26 1815 in paris at the behest of tsar alexander i the alliance had won over the napoleonic empire and they wanted to consolidate their positions and protect themselves from revolutions originally the russian empire the empire of austria and the kingdom of prussia were the constituents while france where the monarchy had been restored joined in 1818 and london extended its support tsarist russia a great european power the russian empire was part of the troika which placed a bavarian prince on the greek throne in 1830 and enslaved the country to a debt at once odious and unsustainable the ottoman empire s gradual dismantling was a very important issue for moscow because russian interests in the balkans as well as movement between the black sea and the mediterranean were at stake until the 1870s london s bankers were the tsar s main sponsors german bankers replaced them once the german empire came into being and defeated france in 1871 from that moment germany replaced london as russia s main trading partner on the eve of the first world war 53 of russia s imports came from germany while 32 of their exports went there on the other hand at the financial level french bankers took the place of their german counterparts at the end of the 19th century on the eve of the first world war investors in france held 80 of russia s external debt and most of the existing russian loans had been issued on the paris market in short the capitalists of france lent to russia and invested there belgian capitalists especially the industrialists also invested heavily in russia while german capitalists exported part of their production and imported raw materials for their own stocks when the petrograd soviet adopted a financial manifesto for the repudiation of the tsarist debt russia was preparing to issue a huge new loan with the help of the french bankers and the government of france the paris bankers paid no heed to the soviet s warning the loan came through it was repudiated twelve years later first world war the first world war was waged between two conflicting camps of capitalist powers on one side were the german empire and its allies the austro hungarian empire bulgaria and the ottoman empire great britain france the russian empire belgium romania italy japan and from february 1917 the united states were in the other camp germany france great britain and tsarist russia had been preparing for war for a long time germany with its thriving economy wanted to spread its territory both in europe and in the colonial world france wanted to take revenge on germany and particularly to conquer alsace and lorraine annexed by germany following france s defeat in 1871 great britain france and russia also wanted to extend their colonial domain notably on the ruins of the ottoman empire the left in various belligerent countries had denounced the preparations for this war several years before at the stuttgart congress 1907 of the socialist international the unanimously adopted resolution had stated in case war should break out anyway it is their the socialist parties duty to intervene in favor of its speedy termination and with all their powers to utilize the economic and political crisis created by the war to rouse the masses and thereby to hasten the downfall of capitalist class rule in 1913 the extraordinary congress of the socialist international in basel pronounced a solemn warning to the governments let the governments remember that with the present condition of europe and the mood of the working class they cannot unleash a war without danger to themselves jean jaurès a great french socialist leader crisply summed up this message in the concluding sentence of his speech at the basel congress in sharpening the danger of war the governments should see that the peoples can easily make the count their own revolution would cost fewer dead than the war of others at the decisive moment in august 1914 several major socialist parties the social democratic parties of germany austria belgium france and great britain voted with the bourgeoisie for war credits to finance the war the cost in human life was enormous total deaths due to the global conflict amounted to 18 6 million 9 7 million soldiers and 8 9 million civilians the tsar s participation in the first world war caused 3 300 000 deaths in russia between 1914 and february 1917 1 800 000 soldiers and 1 500 000 civilians from the revolution of february 1917 to the october revolution when revolution broke out in february 1917 spearheaded by a massive women s strike which started on february 23 1917 the international day for women s rights the russian people wanted to get rid of the autocratic tsarist regime they wanted bread an end to the war access to land for tens of millions of deprived peasants who were forced to risk their lives in a war whose objectives were totally alien to them the new regime led by the moderate socialist kerensky succeeding the tsar refused to distribute land to the peasants wanted to carry on with the war and could not feed the people it also pledged to repay the debts contracted by the tsarist regime to foreign creditors and contracted new loans to continue the war dan one of the prominent menshevik leaders opposed to the bolshevik party described the revolutionary zeal in the months preceding october 1917 thus the masses began more and more frequently to express their discontent and their impatience with impetuous movements and ended by turning to communism strikes followed one after the other the workers sought to answer the rapid rise in the cost of living with wage rises but all their efforts failed with the continuous drop in value of paper money the communists launched in their own ranks the slogan of workers control and advised them to take the running of the factories into their own hands in order to stop the sabotage of the capitalists at the same time the peasants started to take over the big properties to chase out the land owners and to set fire to their manor houses the october revolution 1917 kerensky s policies triggered dissatisfaction which in turn led to a second revolution in october 1917 november 7 1917 according to the new calendar adopted later the new government supported by the congress of the soviets pledged to restore peace distribute land and in a bid to revive the country s economy repudiate debt and nationalize the banking sector the repudiation of debts at the beginning of january 1918 the soviet government suspended foreign debt servicing and in early february 1918 it decreed the repudiation of all tsarist debts as well as the debts contracted by the provisional government so that the war could be continued from february to november 1917 simultaneously it decided to confiscate all the assets of foreign capitalists in russia and restore them to the national estate russian public debt amounted to â 930 million roughly 50 of gdp in 1913 between the beginning of the war and bolsheviks accession to power with their left wing socialist revolutionary allies the debt soared to â 3 385 million about 3 5 times what it had been by repudiating debt the soviet government implemented the petrograd soviet s decision of 1905 which had been supported by various parties the capitals of the great allied powers responded with unanimous protest peace decree the soviet government proposed peace without annexations and without indemnities it also called for enacting the right to self determination of peoples all this involved the implementation of thoroughly innovative or revolutionary ideas regarding inter state relations the russian revolution debt repudiation war and peace in early january 1918 the soviet government suspended payment on foreign debt and in early february 1918 it decreed that all tsarist debts were repudiated as were those contracted to continue the war by the provisional government between february and november 1917 at the same time it decided that all assets of foreign capitalists in russia would be confiscated and returned to the national heritage in repudiating these debts the soviet government was implementing a decision made in 1905 by the soviet people s council of petrograd st petersburg and the various parties that supported it this triggered a wave of unanimous protest from the capitals of the major allied powers decree on peace the soviet government proposed peace with neither annexation nor compensation or reparations it also added a clause enacting the self determination of peoples this was the application of totally innovative and revolutionary principles to relations between states it turned out that the soviet government s policy simultaneously confounded and influenced that of the us president woodrow wilson who had made the right to self determination of peoples a central element of us foreign policy certainly the bolsheviks and the united states had different motives the us not having significant colonial territories saw an interest in weakening the british and german empires and the powers of belgium the netherlands and france in order to step into their shoes though using other methods their strongest diplomatic and humanitarian argument was the right to self determination of african caribbean and asian peoples still under the colonial yoke as for the bolsheviks they wanted to have done with the tsarist empire that they denounced as a prison of peoples the desire for peace was one of the basic causes of the revolutionary uprising of 1917 the great majority of russian soldiers were set against pursuing war almost all were peasants who wished to go home and work on the land moreover for many years since long before the start of the war the bolsheviks who had been members of the socialist international until its betrayal of the working classes in august 1914 had opposed the policy of preparation for war they maintained that what was needed was a common struggle to bring capitalism and its imperialist phase and colonized territories to an end to bring this orientation to bear the soviet government was forced to enter separate negotiations with berlin and its allies as in 1917 london paris and washington wished to carry on with the war the soviet government did endeavour to bring these capitals of the allied nations to the negotiating table but to no avail having signed an armistice with the german empire in mid december 1917 it managed to drag out the negotiations with berlin over five months in the hopes of seeing several populations of europe especially the german people rise up against their governments to demand peace it also vainly hoped that president wilson would support soviet russia against germany the soviet government also wanted to show international public opinion that it wished for universal peace embracing east and west and that only as a last resort would it agree to sign a separate peace treaty with berlin from december 1917 the soviet government began to make public numerous secret documents revealing how the major powers were preparing to share out territories and populations with scant regard for their right to self determination one of the most sensitive of these was an agreement between paris london and moscow dating from 1915 which established that at the time of victory the tsarist empire would be entitled to take constantinople france would recover alsace lorraine and london could take control of persia early in march 1918 the soviet government signed the treaty of brest litovsk with berlin the cost was high with the german empire taking a large portion of the western territory of the russian empire part of the baltic countries part of poland and ukraine in short the treaty would deprive russia of 26 of its population 27 of cultivated areas and 75 of its steel and iron production intervention of the allied powers against soviet russia the soviet government s call for worldwide revolution combined with its desire to end the war its repudiation of debts demanded by the allied powers and its nationalization measures convinced the western leaders that they should launch a massive attack against soviet russia to bring down the revolutionary government and restore capitalist order the foreign intervention began in the summer of 1918 and finished at the end of 1920 when the western capitals took stock of their failure and were obliged to acknowledge that the red army had taken back control of the territory fourteen countries sent troops to take part in this attack france sent 12 000 soldiers to the black sea and the north london sent 40 000 mainly to the north japan 70 000 in siberia washington 13 000 in the north with the british and the french the poles 12 000 in siberia and murmansk greece 23 000 to the black sea canada 5 300 the japanese intervention was to last until october 1922 according to winston churchill minister of war in the british government there was a total of 180 000 allied foreign troops the french government was the most bitterly hostile towards the soviet government right from the start there were several reasons for this firstly it was feared that the revolutionary movement initiated by the russian people might spread to france as much of the french population was vehemently opposed to carrying on with the war secondly the soviet decision to repudiate debt affected france more than any other country since russian loan bonds had been issued in paris and were mainly held in france it is now known that in 1917 the french government had begun secret talks with berlin hoping to conclude a peace treaty that would allow the german empire to spread eastwards to the detriment of revolutionary russia on condition that alsace and lorraine be returned to france berlin s refusal to make this concession to paris brought negotiations to an end the armistice of 11 november 1918 signed between the western capitals and berlin made provision for german troops to stay temporarily in the russian territories that they were occupying according to article 12 of the armistice germany was to evacuate all former russian territories as soon as the allies deemed it opportune in view of the internal situation of those territories the idea was to help the imperial army prevent the soviet government from rapidly regaining control over the territories they had conceded to germany under the brest litovsk treaty the allies meant to enable anti bolshevik forces to take over these territories which would then serve as a rear base while they overthrew the government the british historian e h carr shows how unpopular the intervention against soviet russia was in january 1919 when the allied statesmen assembled in paris for the peace conference discussed the occupation of russia by allied troops the british prime minister bluntly assured his colleagues that if he now proposed to send a thousand british troops to russia for that purpose the armies would mutiny and that if a military enterprise was started against the bolsheviki that would make england belshevist and there would be a soviet in london lloyd george was talking for effect as was his manner but his perceptive mind had correctly diagnosed the symptoms serious mutinies in the first months of 1919 in the french fleet and in french military units landed in odessa and other black sea ports led to en enforced evacuation at the beginning of april of the troops of several nationalities under british command on the archangel front the director of military operations at the war office reported in march 1919 that their morale was so low as to renderthem a prey to to the very active and insidious bolshevik propaganda which the enemy are carrying out with increasing energy and skill the details were disclosed much later through official american reports on march 1 1919 a mutiny occurred among french troops ordered to go up to the line several days earlier a british infantry company refused to go to the front and shortly afterwards an american company refused for a time to return to duty at the front it was in the light of such experience that the british government decided in march 1919 to evacuate north russia though the evacuation was not in fact completed till six months later winston churchill was one of the main hawks in the western camp taking advantage of the absence of lloyd george and president wilson at a summit meeting held in paris on 19 february 1919 churchill intervened to persuade the other governments to complete their intervention by directly supporting the army of the white russian generals he suggested sending them volunteers technical experts arms munitions tanks aeroplanes etc and arming the anti bolshevik forces the allies tried to persuade the new pro western german government to take part in the action against bolshevik russia despite strong pressure from the western capitals in october 1919 the reichstag the german parliament where socialists spd and liberals held the majority voted unanimously against germany s participation in the blockade on soviet russia decreed by the allies to give the full picture it should be added that at the same time certain german generals like ludendorff and especially von der goltz who led the last organized remnants of the former imperial army supported military actions in the east to help out the anti bolshevik white russian generals this with the support of the western capitals it is quite clear that both the western governments and those of the defeated central powers the german empire and austria hungary feared that revolution would spread to their own countries lloyd george wrote in a confidential memorendum early in 1919 the whole of europe is filled with the spirit of revolution there is a deep sense not only of discontent but og anger and revolt amongst the workmen against pre war conditions the whole existing order in its political social and economic aspects is questioned by the masses of the population from one end of europe to the other this fear of revolution was by no means fanciful and largely explains the violence of the attacks against bolshevik russia foreign intervention backed up the white russian generals attacks and prolonged what was an extremely bloody civil war it caused more deaths than the world war in russia the cost of the foreign was considerable in terms of human lives and of material destruction the soviet government later demanded that this be taken into account in the international negotiations regarding debt repudiation see below the economic and financial blockade against soviet russia and the blockade on russian gold from 1918 the allied powers led a blockade against soviet russia the soviet government was prepared to pay in gold to import goods of absolute necessity but none of the major banks or any government in the world could accept soviet gold without crossing swords with the allied governments in fact paris london washington brussels all considered that they had a right to russian gold to compensate russia s expropriated capitalists and repay debts this became a huge obstacle to soviet trade in the united states any person or company wishing to use gold for any transaction or to take gold into the country had to sign an official statement that the gold in their possession had nothing to do with the so called bolshevik government and that they guaranteed that the us had a right on it without any reservation it should be mentioned that after the german capitulation of november 1918 france managed to recover the heavy ransom in gold that berlin had got from russia in application of the brest litovsk peace treaty signed in march 1918 france refused to return this gold to russia considering it as part of the reparations germany owed paris the blockade of russian gold was carried on to some extent for years this was how france again managed in 1928 to get the washington authorities to prohibit a payment in russian gold for a contract between russia and a private us company the russian revolution peoples right to self determination and debt repudiation the versailles treaty was eventually signed on 28 june 1919 without soviet russia being involved even so this treaty cancelled the treaty of brest litovsk under article 116 of the versailles treaty russia could claim compensation from germany yet consistent with its demand for peace without any annexation or any claim for compensation it did not do so what mattered most to soviet russia was that the treaty of brest litovsk should be cancelled and the territories that germany had annexed in march 1918 be given back to the peoples to whom they had belonged the baltic polish ukrainian and russian peoples in accordance with the principle of peoples right to self determination upheld by the new soviet government treaties with the baltic republics poland persia and turkey this principle was also called upon in the first article of each of the peace treaties signed between soviet russia and the new baltic states in 1920 estonia on 2 february lithuania on 12 july and latvia on 11 august the peace treaties resembled one another and the independence of those states that had been forceably integrated into the tsarist empire was systematically asserted in the first or second article through such treaties russia reasserted its opposition to the domination of financial capital and its determination to repudiate tsarist debts indeed the treaty that was signed with estonia on 2 february 1920 states estonia will bear no responsibility for any of russia s debts or other obligations all claims of the creditors of russia for the share of the debt concerning estonia should be addressed to russia only similar dispositions appeared in the treaties signed with lithuania and latvia as well as asserting that peoples did not have to pay illegitimate debts that were contracted in their names though not in their interest soviet russia also acknowledged the oppressive role played by tsarist russia towards minority nations within the empire to be fully consistent with the principles it upheld soviet russia went even further in those peace treaties it committed itself to restoring to the oppressed baltic nations all property and articles of value that had been removed by the tsarist regime especially cultural and academic property such as schools libraries archives museums as well as personal goods that had been removed from the baltic territories during the first world war as compensation for war damage resulting from the involvement of tsarist russia soviet russia stated that it would grant fifteen million gold roubles to estonia 3 million gold roubles to lithuania and 4 million gold roubles to latvia as well as concessions for those three states to exploit russian forests across the borders while russian state loans to citizens of the baltic states were transferred to the newly independent governments the peace treaties signed with lithuania and latvia stipulated that claims against smallholders against the former russian agricultural banks since nationalized should not be transferred to the new governments but purely and simply cancelled the same measures also applied to estonian smallholders under article 13 of the peace treaty with estonia which stated that if when such treaties are concluded russia grants to any one of these new states or to its subjects special exemptions rights or privileges these shall be extended in full immediately and without special agreement to estonia and its subjects by signing these treaties soviet russia meant to try and break out of the isolation to which it had been confined by the imperialist powers since the october revolution while at the same time implementing principles the new state wanted to uphold the baltic states were the first to breach the blockade imposed upon russia and those peace agreements opened the way to trade contracts between the various parties in march 1921 a similar peace agreement was signed between russia the ukraine and belarus on the one hand and poland on the other this document released poland from the obligation to pay any share of the debts of the former russian empire committed russia to restoring property that had been removed by tsarist russia and specified that russia and the ukraine would pay 30 million gold roubles in compensation to poland this treaty was even more significant than the one with the baltic states as poland was seen by the allied capitalist powers as key to the isolation of russia the friendship treaty signed between soviet russia and persia on 26 february 1921 is a further token of soviet russia s determination to contribute to the emancipation of oppressed people and to their right to self determination in this treaty russia officially broke away from the tyrannical policies of tsarist russia s colonizing governments and gave up all its territories and economic interests in persia the very first article declares all treaties and conventions between persia and tsarist russia which denied the rights of the persian people to be null and void article 8 unambiguously cancelled debts owed by persia to the tsarist regime the new russian government definitively renounced the economic policy pursued in the orient by tsarist regime which consisted of lending money to the persian government not for the economic development of the country but rather for its political subservience consequently it cancelled all russian claims on persia a few weeks later the soviet government similarly renounced all liabilities including monetary that turkey had towards russia as a consequence of agreements signed by the tsarist government the french press in the pay of the tsar with the overthrow of tsarism in february 1917 and the seizing of power by the bolsheviks and their socialist revolutionary allies in october numerous previously confidential documents were made public see further on this allowed boris souvarine a franco russian communist activist to consult russian imperial archives he discovered a vast organisation of complicity with the french press that pre dated the first world war aimed at promoting tsarist bond issues to french investors this affair in which influential people were corrupted and became accomplices was denounced by the communist daily l humanité in a series of daily articles entitled the abominable venality of the french press that appeared over a period of several months during 1923 and 1924 how the tsarist regime procured the french press in order to issue bonds since the end of the 19th century the empire of the tsar had chosen paris as its preferred financial market for bond issues the bonds were purchased by many french investors and small savers at the beginning of the 20th century this funding had become a pillar of the tsarist regime that in 1904 5 was at war with japan at the same time as it sought to put down internal discontent and repress the 1905 revolutionary movement after losing the war against japan in 1906 russia made a big bond issue on the paris market arthur raffalovich diplomat and secret adviser in paris to the russian minister of finance was charged with promoting russian loan certificates up to the first world war it was his correspondence with his superiors in russia that revealed complicity in corruption and coercion between the tsarist regime and many big french newspapers mostly parisian such as le figaro le petit journal le temps and le matin big french banks notably crédit lyonnais and the banque de paris et des pays bas which has become bnp paribas as well as senators and ministers among them raymond poincaré who was to become president of the french republic i e head of the french state in 1913 was implicated for his actions while he was president of the french council i e head of the french government and foreign minister in 1912 his finance minister louis lucien klotz was also implicated at the time he was again president of the french council and foreign minister when the scandal exploded however the affair was no bother to him he remained president of the french council until 1924 and again from 1924 also holding the post of finance minister the role played by the paris stockbrokers corporation was central to the coercion pressed on the tsar s government between 1900 and 1914 the russian government distributed 6 5 million francs to the french press when the affair blew up the corruption of the press by the financial sector was far from being new a scandalous french fund raising scheme to build a canal in panama had functioned in the same way in the case of the russian issues the russian empire and the issuing banks purchased advertising in the newspapers of greater distribution that praised the russian financial situation and the solvency of the tsarist debt according to raffalovich this advertising involved censorship news of difficulties in russia s war against japan or of the revolutionary unrest in 1905 was not considered to be presentable to potential investors the documents indicate that there may also have been false subscriptions the stockbroker s corporation newspaper board members and politicians blackmailed the russian government into making bigger payments and so maximised their profits the revelations in l humanité are based on authentic documents among the incriminated newspapers only le matin initiated proceedings against the communist organ from the first day of the trial vladimir kokovtsov the tsar s finance minister almost without interruption between 1904 and 1914 and head of the government between 1911 and 1914 was called to the box a reactionary exiled in france it was not in his best interest to put the press under accusation but he did bear witness to the honesty of his former collaborator raffalovich l humanité was technically condemned to pay 10 000 francs damages compared to the 1 500 000 francs demanded by le matin and the court recognised the authenticity of the revealed correspondence finally in 1924 maurice bunau varilla the owner of le matin himself highly implicated in the affair no longer hid his sympathies for the authoritarian nationalisms coming to power in europe to resist communism he supported fascist italy and later nazi germany during the occupation of france le matin collaborated with the vichy regime after the liberation of france it was shut down russian bonds never die even though russian bonds were repudiated by the soviet government in february 1918 they were still traded right up until the 1990s french government policy and that of other governments was directly related to this life after death how russian bonds lived on after repudiation in 1919 the french government drew up a list of russian bond holders in france 1 600 000 people declared holdings russian bonds seem to have accounted for 33 of foreign bonds held by residents of france which was the equivalent of 4 5 of french wealth 40 to 45 of russian debt was held in france one of the main russian bonds to be exchanged on the paris stock market was the famous loan of 1906 which the soviet of petrograd had repudiated in advance in december 1905 this massive loan of 2 25 billion francs was issued by paris in june 1906 it was destined to enable the tsarist regime to continue repaying earlier debts and balance their books after the debã cle of the russo japanese war the credit lyonnais a french bank which had specialized in issuing russian bonds was making 30 of its revenu from this loan before 1914 during the period preceding and following the soviet government s debt repudiation 72 of bonds from the 1906 loan were held in france and being traded on the paris stock market a high degree of complicity united the tsarist regime the french government french banks issuing russian bonds mainly the crédit lyonnais but also the société générale and the banque de l union parisienne the major exchange agencies and the french press which had been bought off by the tsar s emissary bankers were making huge profits from commissions received when the bonds were issued and from speculative operations buying and selling russian bonds their sharp practice meant that the small investors bore the brunt of the risks newspaper proprietors pocketed bribes paid out by the tsar s emissary key government members also made sure they got kickbacks the tsar was a prized ally both politically and diplomatically to the french government and the big capitalist groups of france who invested in russia as did belgian capitalists during the war it was the french government who paid out the interest owing to each bond holder at a rate of 5 the sum of interest payments made by the french government on behalf of the russian empire was then added to the russian debt to france thus when the tsar was overthrown by the people in february 1917 it was a blow for the french government who had to place all their hopes on the provisional government who claimed that debts contracted by the tsar would be honoured things went from bad to worse when the bolsheviks and their allies the leftwing socialists were brought to government by the soviets in november 1917 when the soviet government suspended debt payments in january 1918 the french government again paid the interest on russian bonds to bond holders when the soviet government repudiated all the tsar s debts and those of the provisional government france decided to resort to force and prepared to send troops to russia from july1918 four months before the armistice was signed with the german empire the government sent french troops to join forces with the british troops that had taken murmansk in northern russia then more soldiers were sent to occupy arkhangelsk after the signature of the armistice with berlin france sent troops to the black sea with warships to bomb the red army s positions this caused a mutiny among french sailors the attack against soviet russia was obviously not only due to the repudiation of debt the various powers that took part wanted to eradicate a hotspot of revolutionary contagion but the financial interests of france and its capitalists constituted a powerful motor too the french government gave the white russian generals financial support in their struggle to defeat the bolsheviks because they had announced that they would honour the tsar s debts paris also supported polish and ukrainian politicians and soldiers and those of the baltic republics who had won their independence or were fighting for it in the hopes that the governments of the new states would honour at least part of the tsarist debt paris took it very badly when from 1920 the soviets signed treaties with the baltic republics and poland to the effect that they considered that those countries should take no responsibility for the tsarist debts what happened to russian bond holders when debt repudiation was made public in february 1918 in france in september 1918 the government proposed to exchange russian bonds for french debt paper russian bond holders could acquire bonds for the new loan that the french government was making in july 1919 the french government repeated the operation in rome london and washington the authorities did the same they exchanged russian bonds respectively for italian british or us bonds as for the japanese government it indemnified japanese holders of russian bonds at a rate of 100 clearly in acting in this way the governments of these countries came to the rescue of the bankers who should have been held responsible for financing the tsarist regime and been made to bear the consequences of the repudiation of odious debt in the case of the french the french government had actively shared responsibility with the bankers who supported the tsar s regime the french government had systematically encouraged the most affluent of the middle class to acquire russian bonds it is important to note that in france a large portion of russian bonds were not exchanged for french bonds russian bonds paid better dividends than french bonds with an interest rate of 5 in 1906 when the average rate for french government bonds was 3 between 1918 and 1922 the financial press and the government put it about that the soviet government was about to fall and that the successors would honour the tsarist debt moreover at a conference in genoa and on other occasions the same press insinuated that moscow had finally agreed to acknowledge the debt the ensuing situation was surrealistic bonds issued by a government that no longer existed repudiated bonds went on being bought and sold on the paris stock market this is a perfect example of fictitious capital in the period 1918 1919 the price of russian bonds oscillated between 56 5 and 66 25 of their face value they had originally been sold at 88 of their face value the price of sovereign french bonds at that time oscillated between 61 and 65 the difference between the price of repudiated russian bonds and that of french bonds was thus slim speculators and the bankers who were at the top of the list were certainly doing very well if they could buy at 56 when small holders were offloading them frightened by rumours circulating in the press and originating with the bankers and then sell them on at 66 diplomatic manoeuvers around russian debt repudiation for five weeks in april and may 1922 a summit conference was held britain s prime minister lloyd george played a central role in it as did louis barthou the minister of the french president raymond poincaré the main aim of the meeting was to persuade soviet russia both to acknowledge the debts it had repudiated in 1918 and to cease calling for a global revolution the genoa negotiations 1922 there were other points on the agenda of the conference attended by delegates from 34 countries though not the united states but none gave rise to much debate among them were the adoption of monetary regulations especially regarding the gold exchange standard system which was adopted that year in the absence of the united states decisions on this issue were made elsewhere the conference was hosted by five major powers great britain which had just been overtaken by the united states as the first world power france the third world power after the defeat of germany belgium which had been the fifth world power before the war in terms of exportation japan whose empire was expanding rapidly in east asia and italy of the five host powers one japan still had troops occupying soviet siberia it only withdrew them permanently six months after the end of the conference in october 1922 the other 12 countries which had sent troops in 1918 to overthrow the soviet government and put an end to the revolutionary experiment had ceased occupation of soviet territory in 1920 in fact the utterly demoralized foreign troops had been withdrawn when their governments had regretfully noted that the white russian generals had been irrevocably defeated by the red army and that no amount of foreign intervention would remedy that it then became necessary to use diplomacy and blackmail where arms had failed the major powers thought that the conference would bring the soviet government round to recognizing the repudiated debts in view of the dramatic humanitarian and economic situation in russia civil war had bled the country dry and from summer 1921 catastrophic harvests had caused terrible famine the western capitals believed the soviet government to be on its knees and were convinced they would get what they wanted by making the new loans and investments russia needed conditional upon the acknowledgment of previous debts and compensation for expropriated western companies france remained the most aggressive power regarding both soviet russia and germany with the support of the belgian authorities as for great britain less affected by the debt repudiation it was more open to dialogue with moscow and had signed an anglo russian trade deal in 1921 which ended the blockade and meant de facto recognition of soviet russia for its part the soviet government was ready to repay part of the debts contracted by the tsar on several conditions that the other powers give soviet russia official de jure recognition that they grant state to state i e bilateral loans that they encourage private firms affected by the expropriation of their subsidiaries to accept concessions to exploit natural resources especially in the remotest areas of siberia as compensation the soviet government thus hoped that foreign capitalists would invest fresh capital of their own money in activities that would fortify the soviet economy furthermore the government would not hear of setting up multilateral bodies to manage loans investments or related legal disputes soviet government intended that soviet russia should remain entirely independent of foreign powers there was no question of giving up any part of its sovereignty if these conditions were met moscow promised to resume payment of part of the tsarist debt within a thirty year time frame the soviet delegation clearly asserted several times throughout the conference that it was ready to make this concession to reach an agreement but that they basically considered that soviet russia was fully within its rights to repudiate all tsarist debt as well as debt contracted by the provisional government between february and october 1917 finally the conference ended in disagreement and the soviet delegation maintained the repudiation consideration of the special relationship that came about between berlin and moscow after the treaty of versailles in june 1919 is crucial to understanding how the conference was organized the government in berlin was composed of a coalition between the socialists the social democratic party or spd the centrists the ancestors of angela merkel s christian democratic union and the liberals the ancestor of the present day free democratic party and was fundamentally pro western and anti soviet nevertheless under the onus of having to pay the huge reparations imposed by the treaty of versailles which meant a staggering debt berlin was inclined to dialogue with moscow and come to agreement this tendency was reinforced by the desire of big german industrial companies including aeg and krupp to sell their production on the russian market having been their main trading partner since the 1870s as we saw on the way from moscow to genoa the soviet delegation had made an extended halt in berlin to carry out negotiations and meet with the german authorities before coming face to face with the host powers in the italian city in the middle of the conference of genoa while the host powers adopted an uncompromising attitude towards moscow there was a sudden coup de théã tre the german and soviet delegations had met in the neighbouring town of rapallo and signed an important bilateral agreement which has gone down in history as the treaty of rapallo it is very interesting to go over how the conference of genoa was conducted the negotiations that took place and the arguments used by the different sides the major powers who hosted it wanted to put maximum pressure on soviet russia by claiming that a fundamental objective of the conference was for all countries to acknowledge their public debt and for compensation to be paid the major powers asserted in the convocation that mutual confidence could only be restored if the nations or the governments of the nations wishing to obtain foreign credit would freely commit themselves to acknowledging all public debts and securities that had been or would be contracted by the state municipal authorities or other public bodies and also to recognize their obligation to return restore or failing that compensate all foreign interests for loss or damage caused by the confiscation or sequestration of their property immediately georgy chicherin head of the soviet delegation retorted that the economic reconstruction of russia and work intended to end economic chaos in europe would be taking a wrong and dangerous direction if the most economically powerful nations were to crush russia under demands way beyond its capabilities as in what that country saw as its odious past instead of creating the requisite conditions for its economic revival and facilitating its march forward to the future in the ensuing discussion with the soviets who asserted that their people and their new government could not be expected to take on debts contracted by a previous despotic regime lloyd george replied that when a country undertook contracutal obligations towards another country or towards nationals of that country for pledged securities that contract could under no circumstances be repudiated each time a country changed government unless that country restitute the assets received in 1922 creditor powers again attempt to subjugate the soviets western governments presented a full list of demands aimed at solving in their favour the litigation over debt repudiation and expropriations decreed by the soviet government those demands were presented in genoa on 15 april 1922 five days into the conference in a document entitled london experts report on the russian issue western demands on moscow article 1 said the russian soviet government shall accept the financial obligations of its predecessors viz the imperial russian government and the russian provisional government towards foreign powers and their nationals the form and contents of the whole text clearly indicate that it listed a number of impositions by western powers onto the soviet government in the same article we find a provision that directly contravened the treaties soviet russia had signed in 1920 1921 with the baltic republics and with poland i e countries that had achieved independence after the fall of the tsarist regime whereby as we have seen those states no longer had to pay tsarist debts the same applies to the question whether and if so to what extent new states which have been recognised as such and which were formerly part of russia as well as states which have acquired part of the former territory of russia should undertake part of the obligations dealt with in these provisions article 3 claimed that the soviet government was responsible for damages resulting from the tsarist regime article 3 the russian soviet government shall undertake liability for all actual and direct losses whether arising out of breach of contract or otherwise suffered by nationals of other powers due to the action or negligence of the soviet government or its predecessors that was in flagrant contradiction with moscow s position article 4 granted almost all powers to bodies outside the soviet authorities the liabilities under the preceding articles will be determined by a russian debt commission and by mixed arbitral tribunals to be set up annex 1 specified the composition and competence of the russian debt commission it was clear that the russian government would be in minority position annex i russian debt commission 1 a russian debt commission shall be established consisting of members nominated by the russian government and members nominated by the other powers together with an independent chairman chosen from outside by agreement among the other members or in default named by the league of nations either through the council or through the permanent court of international justice â the commission would be entitled to issue new russian bonds to pay former tsarist debts and to compensate foreign capitalists whose companies had been nationalized the commission will have the following functions a to constitute and prescribe the procedure of the mixed arbitral tribunals to be set up in accordance with the provisions of annex ii and to issue such instructions as may be necessary in order to secure uniformity in their proceedings b to issue new russian bonds in accordance with the provisions of annex ii to persons entitled thereto under awards of the mixed arbitral tribunals to holders of existing state bonds and other bonds and stock for which the new russian bonds are to be given in exchange and to persons entitled thereto in respect of funded interest and repayment of capital dominated as it was by creditors the commission was given exorbitant powers since it could even decide what revenues had to be used to repay the debt to determine if necessary among the revenues of russia those which should be specially assigned to the service of the debt for example an allocation of certain taxes or of royalties or dues upon undertakings in russia should occasion arise to control if the commission thinks fit the collection of all or part of these assigned revenues and to deal with the proceeds the host nations wanted soviet russia to agree to a supervisory institution on the same pattern as that which had been imposed on tunisia egypt the ottoman empire and greece during the second half of the 19th century this was also very much like what has been imposed on greece since 2010 annex iii gave full powers to issue debt bonds to the debt commission in which the russian soviet government was in a minority position 1 all accepted claims for monetary compensation against the russian soviet government will be met by the issue of new russian bonds up to the amounts fixed by the mixed arbitral tribunals the terms of issue of the bonds together with all questions arising out of the conversion of existing bonds and out of new issues will be determined by the russian debt commission 2 the bonds shall carry a rate of interest to be determined by the russian debt commission whereas the russian soviet government had clearly stated that it would not take on any debt contracted after the 1staugust 1914 because it would be at war the text of the memorandum handed to the soviet delegation said that in view of the serious economic condition of russia such creditor governments are prepared to write down the war debts owed to them by russia the soviet counter attack the treaty of rapallo 1922 the london report presented in the previous chapter was such a deliberate provocation on the part of western powers that the soviet delegation immediately got in touch with the german delegation which paris and london had somehow prevented from fully attending the genoa conference france and britain were hoping that they could coax the soviet russians into accepting the conditions mentioned above or at least some of them to strengthen their position when negotiating with germany afterwards the russian issue clearly was a priority joffé one of the people in charge of the soviet delegation phoned the germans at 1 a m on easter sunday 16 april 1922 to suggest they should meet at once and try to reach a bilateral agreement the biographer of the then german minister for economy walther rathenau writes that the members of the german delegation met in their pyjamas in rathenau s hotel room to decide whether they would accept the soviet invitation they did and sixteen hours later on sunday 16 april 1922 at 5 p m the treaty of rapallo was signed between germany and soviet russia the treaty included mutual waiving of financial claims including german compensation after soviet nationalisations on condition that the government of the russian socialist federal soviet republic does not satisfy claims for compensation of a similar nature made by a third party it is important to note that soviet russia remained fully consistent with the position that the soviet government had adopted in its peace proposal in the very wake of the revolution peace without either annexation or compensation as we know in march 1918 the german empire had imposed drastic conditions on russia with the treaty of brest litovsk as it annexed russian territories and demanded a heavy war ransom in june 1919 that treaty had been cancelled by the treaty of versailles in which western powers amputated the german republic of large stretches of its territories and demanded heavy compensations in the treaty of rapallo soviet russia signed a peace agreement that included mutual waiving of compensation while article 116 of the treaty of versailles granted russia a right to financial compensation from germany this step taken by soviet russia was also consistent with the treaties it had signed with the baltic republics and poland in 1920 1921 another provision in the treaty of rapallo said that germany would help to boost trade between the two countries in a nutshell the treaty of rapallo signed on the suggestion of the soviet delegation was a strong response to the dominant and aggressive behaviour of the western powers next the soviet delegation took the time to communicate its official answer to the western powers in response to the demands they had formulated on 15 april genoa 1922 proposals and counter proposals on the tsarist debt on 20 april 1922 chicherin announced the soviet response to the western powers proposals of 15 april it indicated that the russian delegation are still of the opinion that the present economic condition of russia and the circumstances which are responsible for it should fully justify the complete release of russia from all her liabilities mentioned in the above proposals by the recognition of her counter claims in spite of their disaccord over the exorbitant claims of the western powers the russian delegation said they were prepared to make concessions concerning the debt contracted by the tsarist regime before the entry into the war on 1st august 1914 they made a number of proposals it was proposed once agreement was reached to start debt repayments after a delay of thirty years the resumption of payments arising out of the financial engagements accepted by the russian government including the payment of interest will begin after a period of years from the date of the signature of the present agreement the russian delegation would only sign agreements with the other governments if they fully recognised the soviet government and they granted loans not to repay existing loans but to build the russian economy this would permit a breathing space for the use of fresh money and old debts repayments would resume thirty years later when the economy would have become sufficiently strong to bear them the western powers counter proposals on 2 may the hosting nations made new proposals although there were some small concessions notably a delay of five years before resuming repayments they demanded new unacceptable political conditions the first article stated all nations should undertake to refrain from propaganda subversive of order and of the established political system in other countries than their own the russian soviet government will not interfere in any way in the internal affairs and will refrain from any action which might disturb the territorial and political status quo in other states this meant that the soviet government would renounce its calls to colonised peoples to struggle for their right to self determination the soviet union would give up its right to support independence movements such as in india the african colonies of the different empires particularly the british and the french it would also have to relinquish its support for strikes and other forms of struggle outside in own borders the first article also stated it will also suppress all attempts in its territory to assist revolutionary movements in other states this meant that it would relinquish its support for the 3rd communist international that had been created in 1919 and had its headquarters in moscow on the debt question article 2 reaffirmed the position of the western powers the russian soviet government recognizes all public debts and obligations which have been contracted or guaranteed by the imperial russian government or the russian provisional government or by the soviet government itself towards foreign powers paragraph 2 of article 2 refused the soviet demand for compensation for the losses of life and materials caused by the aggressions of foreign powers during and after the revolution the text said the allies can admit no liability for the claims against them set up by the russian soviet government for loss and damage suffered during the revolution in russia since the war article 6 called for the creation of mixed arbitral tribunals this commission shall consist of a member appointed by the russian soviet government a member appointed by the foreign holders two members and a president appointed by the president of the supreme court of the united states or failing him by the council of the league of nations or the president of the permanent court of international justice at the hague this commission shall decide all questions as to the remission of interest and as to the mode of payment of capital and interest and will take into account in so doing the economic and financial condition of russia to summarise the host states replaced the russian debt commission they had proposed on 15 april by an arbitration commission that would have extensive powers and in which russia would be in minority the soviet reply reaffirmed the right to repudiate debt on 11 may the soviet delegation released a declaration that marked the failure of the genoa negotiations and forcefully reaffirmed the right to repudiate debt chicherin said it may be observed that more than one of the states present at the genoa conference has in the past repudiated debts and obligations which it had contracted and that more than one has confiscated or sequestered the property of foreign nationals as well as of its own nationals without for that reason being exposed to the ostracism inflicted upon soviet russia chicherin pointed out that a regime change through revolution results in rupture with the obligations of the former regime the russian revolution needs no justification before an assembly of powers many of whom count more than one revolution in their own history revolutions which are violent ruptures with the past carry with them a new juridical status in home and foreign relations revolutionary governments are not bound to respect the obligations of governments which have lapsed sovereign peoples are not subject to tyrants agreements chicherin continues the french convention proclaimed in 1792 that the sovereignty of peoples is not bound by the treaties of tyrants in accordance with this declaration revolutionary france not only tore up the political treaties of the former regime with foreign countries but also repudiated her national debt she consented to pay only one third of that debt and that from motives of political expedience this was the tiers consolidé the interest of which did not begin to be regularly paid until the beginning of the nineteenth century this practice which has been elevated to the rank of doctrine by eminent legal authorities has been followed almost universally by governments born of a revolution or a war of liberation the united states repudiated the treaties of its predecessors england and spain on the basis of historical precedents chicherin held that soviet russia was within her rights to nationalize foreign owned property on russian territory the governments of states victorious during the recent war seized the debts of nationals of vanquished states in their own territory and abroad russia therefore cannot be compelled to assume any responsibility towards foreign powers and their nationals for the cancellation of public debts and the nationalization of private property to the western powers indemnities claims chicherin retorted another question of law is the russian government responsible for damages caused to the property rights and interests of foreign nationals by reason of civil war apart from those which were caused to these persons by the acts of the government itself that is the cancellation of debts and the nationalisation of property here again the judicial doctrine is entirely in favour of the russian government revolution as all great popular movements being assimilated to force majeure does not confer any title of indemnity upon those who have suffered from it when foreign nationals supported by their governments demanded from the tsarist government the repayments of losses caused to them by the events of 1905 and 1906 the government rejected their demands basing its refusal upon the fact that not having accorded damages to its own subjects for similar losses it could not place foreigners in a privileged position chicherin concluded this part of his argumentation with thus from the point of view of the law russia is in no wise obliged to pay the debts of the past to restore property or to compensate their former owners nor is she obliged to pay other indemnities for damages suffered by foreign nationals whether as a result of legislation adopted by russia in the exercise of her sovereignty or as a result of the revolutionary events after which the head of the soviet delegation repeated the willingness of soviet russia to make concessions if they would permit agreements to be made nevertheless in a spirit of conciliation and in order to arrive at an understanding with all the powers russia has accepted to recognise a part of the debt chicherin showed his profound understanding of jurisprudence in insisting practice and theory agree in imposing the responsibility for damages caused by intervention and blockade upon the governments which instituted them without citing other cases we shall limit ourselves to recalling the decision of the court of arbitration at geneva of september 14th 1872 condemning great britain to pay to the united states 15 5 million dollars for the damages caused to that country by the privateer alabama which in the civil war between the north and the south gave help to the latter the intervention and the blockade of the allies and neutrals against russia constituted an official act of war on their part the documents published in annex 2 of the first russian memorandum prove with evidence that the chiefs of the counter revolutionary armies were such only in appearance and that their real commanders were foreign generals sent especially for the purpose by certain powers these powers not only took direct part in the civil war but were its authors in an annexed document as sack reports the soviets contended that the foreign powers which participated in the intervention against them in 1919 1920 were liable to pay for losses which russia suffered as the result of the civil war and revolution the soviet delegation presented to the conference a bill of such losses which by far exceeded according to their computation all the claims of the powers and their nationals against the soviet government chicherin reaffirmed that russia was ready to make concessions if granted real loans in its desire to reach a practical agreement the russian delegation adopted a policy of most far reaching concessions and declared itself prepared to renounce conditionally its counterclaims and to accept the engagements of the former governments in exchange for a number of concessions on the part of the powers the most important being real credits placed at the disposal of the russian government amounting to a sum to be agreed upon in advance unfortunately this engagement of the powers has not been carried out the head of the russian delegation rejected the hosting states pretensions to repayments of loans granted to the provisional government to continue a war that the people refused moreover the memorandum raises again the whole question of war debts whose cancellation was one of the conditions of the renunciation by russia of her counterclaims on the hosting states will to impose on russia mixed arbitral tribunals chicherin replied that if such a commission was created the sovereignty of the russian state becomes the plaything of chance it can be defeated by the decisions of a mixed court of arbitration composed of four foreigners and one russian which will decide in the last instance whether the interests of foreigners are to be subject to the restoration restitution or compensation finally chicherin denounced the fact that powers such as france defended tooth and nail the repayments to a few big capitalists without any consideration for the small savers to whom russia was willing to pay indemnities the russian delegation notes moreover that the interested powers reserve all their solicitude for a small group of foreign capitalists and prevent very many foreign capitalists from enjoying the facilities and guarantees which the russian government would be ready to grant them the interest of the mass of small holders of russian bonds has also been sacrificed it is surprising that powers like france amongst whose citizens the majority of these small holders are to be found should have subordinated their interests to those of certain groups that demand the restitution of property chicherin concluded on the hosting states responsibility for the failure of the negotiations he affirmed that for an agreement to be reached it would have been necessary that the foreign powers who organised the armed intervention in russia would cease to hold towards russia the language of a victor to the vanquished russia not having been conquered the only language which could have led to a common agreement was that which states adopt toward each other when negotiating upon a footing of equality the popular masses of russia could not accept an agreement in which concessions were not balanced by real advantages debt lloyd george blames the soviets in the final plenary conference lloyd george the british prime minister made a revealing reply there is a real sympathy for russia s condition if russia is to get help russia must not outrage the sentiments if they like let them call them the prejudices of the world what are these prejudices i will just name one or two because they were all trampled upon in the memorandum of may 11th the first prejudice we have in western europe is this that if you sell goods to a man you expect to get paid for them the second is this that if you lend money to a man and he promises to repay you you expect that he will repay you the third is this you go to a man who has already lent you money and say will you lend me more he says to you do you propose to repay me what i gave you and you say no it is a matter of principle with me not to repay there is a most extraordinary prejudice in the western mind against lending any more money in that way it is not a question of principle i know the revolutionary temper very well and the revolutionary temper never acknowledges that anybody has got principles unless he is a revolutionary but these prejudices are very deeply rooted they are rooted in the soil of the world they are inherited from the ages you cannot tear them out and if you are writing a letter asking for more credits i can give one word of advice to anybody who does that let him not in that letter enter into an eloquent exposition of the doctrine of repudiation of debts it does not help you to get credits it may be sound very sound but it is not diplomatic i do implore you as a friend of russian peace as a friend of co operation with russia as one who is in favour of going to the rescue of those great and gallant and brave people i implore the russian delegation when they go to the hague not to go out of their way to trample upon those sentiments and principles which are deeply rooted in the very life of europe chicherin after deploring that he had been prevented from submitting to the conference the question of disarmament responded to lloyd george the british premier tells me that if my neighbour has lent me money i must pay him back well i agree in that particular case in a desire for conciliation but i must add that if this neighbour has broken into my house killed my children destroyed my furniture and burnt my house he must at least begin by restoring to me what he has destroyed it must be particularly noted that during the negotiations on other points of the agenda the soviet delegation had regularly called for decisions to be taken in favour of a general disarmament france violently refused that the matter even be discussed it was out of the question to reduce spending on armaments of course this policy was very far from the feelings of the french people but there was a right wing belligerent government that directed its anger against germany as well as against russia not to mention the colonised peoples in 1921 france tried again to create an alliance with romania who had annexed bessarabia a territory of the former russian empire and poland to menace soviet russia what was more the soviet delegation proposed that all the nations be invited to the genoa conference particularly the colonised peoples who would represent themselves workers organisations should also have been invited the soviet delegation was critical of the general propositions in economic matters chicherin declared that chapter vi of the report of the economic commission which deals with labour questions opens with a general remark stating the importance of the assistance of the workers in the economic restoration of europe yet we do not find in this chapter what would be most necessary to the working classes we do not find a mention of the legislation for the protection of workmen leaving aside the question of unemployment we do not find either any proposal concerning co operative societies although the latter are an instrument of the highest value for the improvement of the conditions of the working classes it is to the highest degree to be regretted that in the course of the labours of the first sub committee the proposal about co operatives should have been rejected but there is something else article 21 which mentions the conventions of the labour conference of washington deprives those conventions of a great part of their practical importance by confirming the right of the members not to ratify them this final phrase of article 21 which the russian delegation in vain tried to suppress is explained by the desire of certain governments such as switzerland not to accept the eight hour day the russian delegation considers the eight hour day as a fundamental principle of the welfare of the workers and raises a formal objection against the liberty explicitly given to governments not to apply it after the failure of the genoa negotiations the host states and russia agreed to meet again a month later at the hague to find a last chance agreement the meeting held on 20 july 1922 was also a failure france and belgium now supported at a distance by washington who was absent hardened their positions still further reasserting debt repudiation ends with success before the genoa conference soviet russia had managed to sign bilateral treaties with poland the baltic republics turkey and persia more importantly it had managed to sign a trade agreement with the uk signed in 1921 this agreement had sanctioned the soviet laws of nationalization before uk courts and this meant that companies that traded with russia no longer ran the risk of getting into trouble during the genoa conference russia also succeeded in signing a treaty with germany whereby each party renounced any demand for compensation see it might have been anticipated that the failure in 1922 of the conferences at genoa and the hague would result in the capitalist powers adopting a more intransigent position towards moscow in fact the opposite occurred the soviet government had obviously been clever in its manoeuvres the various capitalist countries all considered separately that they had to sign agreements with moscow since the russian market provided a significant outlet and the country had lots of natural resources under the pressure of local private companies every capital was keen to sign an agreement with moscow in order to prevent other powers from seizing the opportunities offered by the russian market in 1923 24 despite the failure of the genoa conference the soviet government was recognized de jure by the uk italy the scandinavian countries france greece china and a few others in 1925 japan also recognized the soviet government paris drastically reduced its demands in france a decree issued on 29 june 1920 had established a special commission for the settlement of russian affairs that was to liquidate and recover all funds from the former russian state whatever their origin the french government cancelled this commission six days before it recognized the soviet government on 24 october 1924 this truly was a victory for moscow a few months earlier the labour government in the uk had signed an agreement with the ussr through which britain accepted soviet claims for compensation for damages resulting from british intervention in the civil war between 1918 and 1920 though lloyd george had stated at the genoa conference that this was out of the question the british government even promised that under certain conditions it would guarantee the issue of a soviet loan bond on the london financial market less than two years after the failure of the genoa conference even though the ussr maintained its repudiation of debts the british government was about to guarantee a soviet loan on 24 september 1924 the soviet leader kamenev could write in the pravda the treaty with england is an effective basis for the express recognition of our nationalization of land and of industry of the repudiation of debts and of all other consequences of our revolution when the conservatives came back to power a few months later they refused to ratify the treaty however a major british company committed itself to invest in gold mines and officially renounced any claim to compensation for the nationalization of its assets in 1918 from 1926 in spite of debt repudiation european private banks and governments started to grant loans to the ussr on 26 june 1926 the ussr signed a credit agreement with german banks in march 1927 the midland bank in london lent gbp 10 million in october 1927 the municipality of vienna granted a loan of ats 100 million in 1929 norway granted a loan of nok 20 million the republican leaders in the us were fuming state secretary kellogg exposed the europeans conciliatory attitude in his speech to the republican national committee on 14 april 1928 no state has been able to obtain the payment of debts contracted by russia under preceding governments or the indemnification of its citizens for confiscated property indeed there is every reason to believe that the granting of recognition and the holding of discussions have served only to encourage the present rulers of russia in their policy of repudiation and confiscation eventually under the presidency of franklin d roosevelt the united states recognized the ussr de jure in november 1933 on 13 february 1934 the us government established the export and import bank with a view to financing trade with the soviet union a few months later not wanting to be excluded from the soviet market france also offered loans to the ussr for it to buy french products alexander sack who opposed repudiation of debts and was fiercely against the soviet regime concluded his study on diplomatic claims against the soviets with the following sentences that clearly indicate that it is perfectly possible to repudiate debt without defaulting or being isolated on the contrary at the twentieth anniversary of the soviet regime the foreign claims against it present the melancholy picture of petrification if not abandonment the soviet union boasts of being now one of the most powerful industrial countries it has a favorable balance of trade and ranks second in the gold production of the world its government is now universally recognized and commercial credits are extended to it practically for the asking yet it has not recognized nor paid any claims arising from its decrees of repudiation confiscation and nationalization conclusion the present study focuses on the repudiation of debt by the soviet government it shows that the decision went back to a commitment taken during the 1905 revolution it includes an analysis of the international context peace treaties the civil war the blockade the genoa conference and the several loan agreements signed afterwards in spite of the confirmed repudiation of former debts there was not room to discuss the later development of the soviet regime the gradual smothering of any criticism the regime s bureaucratic and authoritarian degeneration disastrous farming policies notably the forced collectivization under stalin and in the field of industry stalin s enforcement of terror in the 1930s see box what happened to the members of the delegation representing the soviet government in genoa illustrates the tragic development of the regime and the consequences of stalin s policy it consisted of george chicherin adolph joffe maxim litvinov christian rakovsky leonid krasin apart from the last one who died of illness in london in 1926 what happened to the others is revealing george chicherin was disgraced in 1927 1928 adolph joffe committed suicide on 16 november 1927 leaving a farewell letter to trotsky which was a true political testament his funeral was one of the last authorized big public demonstrations against stalin on 3 may 1939 maxim litvinov was violently dismissed from his position the gpu state political administration rounded his ministry his assistants were beaten and interrogated since litvinov was a jew and a fervent partisan of collective security replacing him with molotov increased stalin s power and facilitated negotiations with the nazis these resulted in the german soviet non aggression pact in august 1939 with its tragic consequences after the nazi attack on the ussr in 1941 litvinov was back in an official position christian rakovsky had been trotsky s comrade already before the first world war and had opposed bureaucracy from the early 1920s he was executed by the gpu on stalin s order in 1941 such tragic evolution shows once again that repudiating odious debt is not enough to solve the many problems affecting society there is no doubt about that for debt repudiation to be useful it must be part of a consistent set of political economic cultural and social measures that make it possible to move towards a society that is liberated of all the various forms of oppression it has suffered under for millennia conversely many countries can hardly consider launching this kind of transition while attempting to repay odious debts inherited from the past we can find lots of illustrations in the course of history and the latest is the subjection of greece to her creditors impositions since 2010 and the terrible consequences of the greek government s capitulation in july 2015 as it insisted on repaying the debt in order to obtain debt relief epilogue in 1997 six years after the dissolution of the ussr boris yeltsin signed an agreement with paris to put an end to litigation over russian bonds the 400 million us dollars france received from the federation of russia in 1997 2000 are a mere 1 of the amounts claimed from soviet russia by the french creditors represented by the state we should also stress the fact that the agreement between russia and the uk signed on 15 july 1986 made for a 1 6 compensation of the bonds updated value such very low compensation rates again indicate that a country can indeed repudiate its debts without major consequences in august 1998 as it was affected by the asian crisis and the consequences of capitalist restoration russia unilaterally suspended its payment of the debt for six weeks its external public debt amounted to usd 95 billion 72 billion of which to private foreign banks 30 billion to german banks and 7 billion to french banks including crédit lyonnais and the remainder mainly to the paris club and the imf complete suspension of payment followed by a partial suspension over the following years led the various creditors to agree to a haircut that varied between 30 and 70 russia which was going through a recession before suspending payment experienced an annual growth rate of about 6 afterwards 1999 2005 joseph stiglitz who had been the world bank s chief economist between 1997 and 2000 points out empirically there is little evidence in support of the position that a default leads to an extended period of exclusion from the market russia returned to the market within two years of its default which was admittedly a messy one involving no prior consultation with creditors thus in practice the threat of credit being cut off appears not to be effective two sentences to sum up it is possible to repudiate or unilaterally suspend debt payment and to stimulate the economy this is not enough to solve all problems but in some circumstances it can be both useful and necessary acknowledgements the author is grateful to pierre gottiniaux nathan legrand brigitte ponet and claude

significantly global trade is no longer a strong driver of economic growth the final data for 2019 is not available but preliminary wto numbers suggest a maximum increase in global trade volume of between 1 and 1 4 percent in 2019 that s down from 4 percent in 2018 making it the weakest since the global financial crisis moreover the ratio of global trade growth to gdp growth was less than one to one compared to the roughly equal rates since 2009 and the higher proportions that characterized much of the post world war ii period also foreign direct investment fell by 1 percent in 2019 the third decline in a row according to the u n conference on trade and development unctad economists are uncertain as to why this is changing but links between trade and investment do function as an engine for enhanced productivity and growth animal spirits are alive and well those numbers suggest a lack of business and investor confidence accounted for much of the slow growth in 2019 as 90 percent of advanced economies and 60 percent of emerging market and developing economies decelerated for 2020 the hopes for improvement are based on possible waning trade tensions particularly amid the u s and china s phase one trade agreement the certainty of brexit after last month s british elections and suggestions that some larger emerging market economies are registering higher growth the phase one deal trade deal however not only failed to address basic issues but also retained existing tariffs albeit at a lower level for some moreover a comprehensive deal is unlikely especially if the united states fulfills its threats to enforce the terms of the phase one deal aggressively in the end the imf estimates that the cumulative effect of u s china trade tensions will reduce global gross domestic product by 0 5 0 8 percent by year s end other challenges in the u s china relationship could include further efforts at financial and technological decoupling together the two countries account for 40 percent of the global economy but each is moving to restrict technology from the other and engineer its own technology standards including those for 5g networks the inefficiencies in competing standards will hinder productive investments as companies worldwide will have to follow bifurcated rules and regulations all while preparing for an even deeper divergence in the market s leaders what s more the prospects for a de escalation in trade tensions elsewhere are not encouraging despite a cease fire with france over digital taxation u s president donald trump used an appearance at davos to reiterate his threat to place tariffs on eu automobile exports and potentially start a new trade war and while brexit will proceed on jan 31 the european union and the united kingdom have yet to work out the nature of their future relationship protectionism among g 20 countries has already affected 1 trillion worth of trade flows or around 7 percent of the global goods trade since 2018 in addition regulatory restrictions affecting foreign direct investment increased by more than a third over the same period according to unctad progress on other trade agreements such as between the european union and the common market of the south mercosur has stalled while the wto dispute mechanism is in disarray partly as a result the oecd business confidence index has recorded more than a year of declines to fall to its lowest level since 2009 similarly most other global business sentiment indicators are barely above recession levels the resulting lower investment spending together with slack productivity holds back potential economic output apart from fundamentals investment depends in part on what economist john maynard keynes called animal spirits his term for business confidence as an unknown or unmeasurable factor because of flagging investment consumption in the united states and europe is the last main pillar supporting growth in advanced economies that however could also fall by the wayside if declining business confidence slows hiring or wage growth eroding the favorable dynamics between still resilient consumer spending and improved business spending on which the imf pins much of its optimism emerging markets as much as two thirds of the imf s projected increased growth depends on an uptick in a small number of large emerging markets including argentina brazil india mexico russia saudi arabia and turkey growth figures however remain subpar in all with the imf now admitting that a slowdown in india is a major drag on emerging markets moreover growth in those countries is mostly noncorrelated so it is not certain that a pickup in one will affect others in addition the number of policy options they have to respond to downturns could diminish under market pressure or financial stress growth remains robust in plenty of small countries mostly in africa but none are large enough to make an impact on the global growth rate
by jeff miller theeconomic calendaris modest and the trading week is holiday shortened the most important reports all relate to housing prices sales and plans with markets viewed as fully or excessively valued by many there are some renewed interests in finding some attractive remaining sectors while some political or geopolitical news may well claim the spotlight even onfinancial news that said this is the closest to a normal week for stock analysis that i have seen in a very long time i expect many to analyze the data and ponder is it too late to invest in housing stocks last week recap my last installment of wtwa either through operator or software error overwrote the prior week s post it therefore carries the wrong date of february 2 2020 but it is last week s story i ll replace the actual 2 2 20 post soon in the meantime you can check out both stories on seeking alpha i apologize for the error and the inconvenience last week i focused on the headshaking in the pundit community the markets were not following their perception of fundamentals how could stocks rally in the face of so many problems that was a good guess for the weekly theme such stories were frequent and popular appearing throughout the week i also followed up on my prior coronavirus work if you read the themes in my two prior posts you will have a solid background in what is happening and how to follow developments coronavirus update as noted above readers should not have been surprised by the various updates on the coronavirus china s coronavirus figures don t add up this never happens with real data most have concluded that the unexpected increases are the result of improved diagnostic techniques but uncertainty about data still remains dr ed yardeni monitoring the key indicators has this conclusion the markets must figure that the coronavirus outbreak will be contained soon and go into remission as did sars mers and ebola if that doesn t happen then there will be a vaccine that will make us feel better it won t be a miracle cure coming from a drug company rather it will be injections of more liquidity into the global financial markets by the major central banks gdp impact from the wsj survey shows most seeing only a small impact in q1 gdp in the us but acknowledging downside risks to forecasts gdp potential impact from freight disruption menzie chinn econbrowser the possible effects on earnings are showing up on conference calls john butters factset the factset study included a search of transcripts of the 364 s p 500 companies that have conducted conference calls of these 364 companies 138 38 cited the term coronavirus during the call at the sector level the industrials 26 information technology 26 and health care 24 sectors have seen the highest number of companies discussing coronavirus on earnings calls of all 11 sectors only 34 included the impact in modified guidance 47 did not include an impact often saying that it was too early or too difficult to estimate the story in one chart i always start my personal review of the week by looking at a great chart this week i am featuring investing com s version if you go to the interactive chart online you can see the news behind each of the n callouts the market gained 1 6 for the week the trading range was only 2 0 as you can see from the chart much of the gain came on monday with a trading range of only 1 for the remainder of the week you can monitor volatility implied volatility and historical comparisons in my weekly indicator snapshot in the quant corner below noteworthy my new daily newspaper the arizona republic is part of the usa today network it is far different from the trib and i am learning a lot about my new state i also see tidbits like this one hidden accounts secret debts and quiet overspending why are we hiding our personal finances from loved ones about 44 of u s adults admit to hiding a bank account or debt or to spending more money than their partner would be comfortable with according to a new study from creditcards com which surveyed 1 378 adults who are married in a civil partnership or living with their partner privacy and control are the main reasons in the interest of privacy and a semblance of control i will not comment on mrs oldprof s audit process the news each week i break down events into good and bad for our purposes good has two components the news must be market friendly and better than expectations i avoid using my personal preferences in evaluating news and you should too new deal democrat s high frequency indicators are an important part of our regular research this report is fact based and consistent with the choice of indicators consideration of three different time frames helps to clarify economic changes this week shows an unusual pattern positive long and short term indicators but a neutral nowcast ndd highlights current weakness in production sector indicators the baltic dry index rail steel but continuing strength in consumer spending mortgage applications showed continuing strength up 1 1 on the week refinancing also increased to the highest level in seven years diana olick cnbc the good s p earnings growth for the first time since q4 2018 john butters factset david templeton horan accurately observes that the growth is much needed since recent market gains have been driven by multiple expansion mortgage delinquencies decreased in q4 2019 no matter what metric you pick the story is favorable from calculated risk quoting mba s marina walsh the vice president of industry analysis added walsh signs of healthy conditions were seen in other parts of the survey the foreclosure inventory rate the percentage of loans in the foreclosure process was at its lowest level since 1985 furthermore states with lengthier judicial processes continued to chip away at their foreclosure inventories and it also appears that with home price appreciation and equity accumulation distressed borrowers have had alternative options to foreclosure nfib small business optimism for january increased to 104 3 from december s 102 7 michigan sentiment registered 100 9 for february s preliminary reading this beat expectations of 99 2 and january s 99 8 jill mislinski has the story and the most helpful chart of this series gallup polling shows record optimism for the year ahead hotel occupancy is lower by 1 4 year over year calculated risk gasoline prices are increasing the bad the jolts report showed a decrease in job openings this was naturally universally treated as bad news for the labor market my past efforts at explaining this have not been enough perhaps a separate post would help meanwhile the key indicators are the ratio of jobs to job seekers still above one the quit rate still high and the beveridge curve which shows the relationship between the unemployment rate and the vacancy rate one helpful interpretation is that with more entrants to the labor force the job openings grow fast enough to absorb them i m scoring this as bad but i don t really believe it david templeton horan adds that the decline in openings is coming from exceptionally high levels industrial production declined 0 3 in january in line with expectations and slightly better than december s downwardly revised 0 4 brian wesbury who usually sees the bright side and is also usually correct attributes the soft start to 2020 to warm weather that pushed down utility output and the boeing problems read the full post to see some of the problems with this important data series the ugly federal debt the latest budget proposal has landed despite the continued economic growth the deficit will go over 1 trillion and that is using very optimistic assumptions about future growth the week ahead we would all like to know the direction of the market in advance good luck with that second best is planning what to look for and how to react the calendar theeconomic calendaris lighter than usual but we have a holiday shortened week housing reports are the most important by contrast the ppi report is the least important of the inflation indicators there are fans of the leading economic indicators and fed fans will be parsing the last fomc minutes we will also get earnings reports from 51 companies in the s p 500 77 have already reported despite the conclusion of the new hampshire election and the impeachment process there always seems to be some fresh and unpredictable political news briefing com has a good u s economic calendarfor the week here are the main u s releases next week s theme unlike last week there are few candidates for the weekly theme putting aside the possible political or geopolitical stories all nearly impossible to predict i am expecting and hoping for a return to discussion and analysis of the economic data so many were wrong about the housing market that the strong rally and underlying reasons have gotten little attention with the overall market movements a bit less dramatic the punditry is beginning to consider the best places to invest i expect many to be asking is it too late to invest in housing stocks background analyzing housing data presents a special set of problems the 2007 08 bubble and subsequent crash left deep scars on homeowners and investors alike the temptation to fight the last war is nearly irresistible the subject is very complicated so much of the analysis is wrong it is also easily spinnable if you are on a mission to present a viewpoint it is easy to massage the data to fit i ll explain how this works and offer some ideas for finding investments among the chaos many readers appreciate the format where i put at least some of my analysis in this section so i ll try that again i m not going to call out all of those with erroneous forecasts but many of these contentions were documented in these prior posts and have survived for years despite evidence to the contrary weighing the week ahead springtime for housing weighing the week ahead is the housing rally over weighing the week ahead the millennial effect on the housing market popular viewpoint jeff s take much of the work on housing invokes the bubble era one of the most profitable models for investment writers is confirming reader biases it is easy to take a long list of factors and tick off some that seem to demonstrate similarity with current conditions most popular are the fed keeping interest rates too low lax lending standards and low down payments but there are many more there have been many predictions of an imminent crash including a prominent cnbc expert contributor and some serial bubble finders testing this proposition should be easy look at foreclosure rates delinquency rates and affordability data all have been improving for ten years lending requirements are too strict preventing many from qualifying yes this is the opposite of what bubble callers say the criteria have tightened up so the demand is properly lower than it would otherwise be the economy is too weak to support housing demand this claim is popular among serial recession predictors if you start with the wrong conclusions about the economy your housing conclusion will also be mistaken the housing market is too weak to support the economy this is another example of taking an apparent relationship and asserting causation it is great fun to set the direction in order to prove a point once again looking at the correct data helps to solve the problem new construction is much more important to job creation and economic growth than is the sale of existing homes home prices are too high since there is always a market clearing price the assertion that prices are too high is a value judgment often the statement is too high for young buyers as usual this generalization is not useful analysis young buyers have differing needs incomes and wealth if prices were lower generally reflecting smaller homes they would be more affordable for all buyers home prices are too low for builders to make profits builders charge enough to make a profit and attempt to keep costs down there is too much supply of foreclosed homes once true now not so much calculated risk has monitored distressed sales describing it as a distressing gap which eventually would narrow this has been a helpful and accurate analysis far better than using conditions from a decade ago inventory is too low to meet demand this statement is true but does not make the point that the housing market is weak businesses strive when the demand is strong relative to the supply tax policy is driving down prices in many home markets this is true the limitations on deductions for taxes and mortgage interest have increased costs for homeowners especially in high tax states this creates pressure on home prices here are a few supporting charts for the points above they do not fit comfortably in the table format but i am confident readers will see the relevance key takeaways investors need to know which sources are authoritative on specific topics calculated risk established credibility during the housing bubble bill has been flexible in adjusting his viewpoint to fit the changing facts sadly that is pretty rare so finding good sources is a challenge i also recommend the excellent z report which combines proprietary data and expert analysis i ll describe my own conclusions in today s final thought quant corner and risk analysis i have a rule for my investment clients think first about your risk only then should you consider possible rewards i monitor many quantitative reports and highlight the best methods in this weekly update featuring the indicator snapshot both long term and short term technical indicators remain neutral but weakened despite the rally the c score remains in a zone which suggests that we watch for confirming data like others we don t see much of that the featured sources bob dieli business cycle analysis via the c score brian gilmartin all things earnings for the overall market as well as many individual companies georg vrba business cycle indicator and market timing tools the most recent update of georg s business cycle index does not signal recession doug short and jill mislinski regular updating of an array of indicators great charts and analysis including regular updates of the big four the full post provides charts of the decline from peak levels a recession requires a significant decline not just a small apparent rollover that said the december weakness stands out as does the decline in industrial production guest sources paul schatz shows the flaw in simple versions of the january barometer this is a nice explanation of the right way to test such a proposition hints don t include the indicator period in the results compare valid results with other randomly selected time periods insight for investors investors should understand and embrace volatility they should join my delight in a well documented list of worries as the worries are addressed or even resolved the investor who looks beyond the obvious can collect handsomely best of the week if i had to recommend a single must read article for this week it would be lyn alden schwartzer s record stock valuations analyzed while she describes this as an update on market valuation there are several investment lessons she begins with an oft neglected step describing what normal is like and why that is so with that in mind it is easier to consider the variation in asset classes she uses gold as an asset class to provide a comparison to stocks from there she collects evidence to identify risks in various asset classes there are a number of interesting conclusions high stock valuations are not explained by increases in foreign exposure among us companies her conclusions will surprise many comparing stocks and bonds she finds both historically expensive with that in mind and using cape she concludes that equities are fairly priced relative to treasuries in a no recession scenario next what about catalysts for stock valuations to revert to the historical mean how about a recession renewed inflation or higher corporate tax rates she analyzes each and also includes some comments on the coronavirus and the possible impact on earnings she sees risks as elevated in recent weeks but sees some bottom fishing ideas as suitable choices as more becomes known she also sees us gdp growth as slowing but positive and is concerned about year over year payroll growth grinding lower i am recommending this article for a simple reason i personally disagree with much of the argument but not the conclusions each position has logic and reasoning and is well worth your consideration personally i hate using cape don t like ancient data don t base plans on future ten year periods and have little interest in gold i don t see how you can value stocks without considering inflation expectations and or interest rates despite this i share her market concerns and the basic strategy stock ideas dr brett has another post that is ostensibly directed at traders but is extremely helpful for investors as well how overconfidence derails our trading he explains the trap the consequences and a simple technique for helping to avoid the problem the full list of dividend aristocrats as of the end of 2019 motley fool the table of the 57 stocks and the number of consecutive annual dividend increases is quite interesting want yield blue harbinger does a stress test on a popular holding at t when the market crashes he emphasizes the importance of the dependable dividend stone fox capital is less enthusiastic at t worse wireless outcome possible blue harbinger analyzes an mlp candidate for those who don t mind getting a k 1 and a bdc it is wise to have expert analysis before you invest in a bdc rather than jumping at the 9 yield paid monthly the post combines a good lesson with the recommendation the great rotation as the coronavirus impacts are assessed the market has turned more cautious on the economy from the time frame of our four themes this is economic noise today s post summarizes the key economic effects these will make the emerging changes a little more difficult to spot and the process will take a little longer i study the partial great rotation portfolio about 50 invested to track market reactions the results were mixed this week i continue to proceed cautiously mostly because there is no real rush lyft lyft not a viable long term investment concludes stone fox capital walmart wmt announcing earnings tuesday morning brian gilmartin explains why he is concerned about valuation stock sectors with the greatest impact from the coronavirus barron s warns about consumer stocks industrials and technology naming some specific examples watch out forfinal thought i wrote a brief spotlight paper on housing in september which i offered to readers at no charge i covered the following which indicators to use hint not prices and not case shiller attractive mortgage rates demographic changes more buyers coming calculated risk has a relevant update showing why the level of immigration is also an important consideration pressure on immigration is a drag on the outlook and also on the economy it is something to watch closely one element of my conclusion was the value in choosing companies that understood the market and adjusted their offerings i mentioned two homebuilder stocks saying the upside was 60 or more this required merely a change in sentiment not the fundamentals the stocks have risen 35 and 40 in five months but i still own them i see more to come with some creativity readers can think of related stocks that benefit from home sales renovations furniture appliances and more with parts of the market becoming very expensive this kind of analysis is becoming more important finding sectors that are improving but still have room to run is a proven strategy that fits the times great rotation hint of the week i m getting reader questions about the great rotation i have described the themes for several months but there are always some new readers i am using this approach in a few client accounts as well as my own i am excited about it it is not yet an official program for my firm but i hope it will be soon until then readers can opt in

in the great successor washington post reporter anna fifield s very uneven and very poorly edited book about north korean dictator kim jong un she indicated that among other things kim passed his childhood days listening to whitney houston while frequently dressed in nike garb more modernly fifield reports that kim brings an apple macbook with him when he travels on one of his many jets about what s been written so far some readers might be nonplussed didn t the u s long ago impose a trade embargo on north korea if so why does kim enjoy very american plenty the answer is simple there s no accounting for the final destination of any good that u s companies are forbidden to sell inside north korea is of no consequence when it s remembered that the feds do not control those whom u s companies are free sell to so long as they re selling their wares u s companies are ultimately selling to north koreans who desire u s products and who have the means to purchase them and how do north koreans exchange goods and services including that which is u s produced according to fifield the u s dollar is still the preferred currency for north korean businessmen since it is easier to convert and spend you read that right the economy of one of the u s s foremost enemies is liquefied by u s dollars that the dollar facilitates exchange in pyongyang and that it does so without the help of the federal reserve is a statement of the obvious simply stated money is a consequence of production not a driver of it individuals produce in order to exchange what they produce with others which explains why the dollar factors into so much global trade precisely because the dollar can be exchanged for goods and services the world over its role in global trade and investment is of the 90 kind all of which brings us to judy shelton s nomination to the federal reserve board up front what s previously been said should exist as yet another reminder that the fed s presumed ability to influence economic outcomes is exponentially more theoretical than real that the u s dollar liquefies the economy of this most econmically isolated country speaks to how overstated the fed s power is credible money finds production period that the fed can t limit dollars flowing to their highest use in north korea should have even the mildly sapient questioning why so many pundits politicians and economists focus so much on the fed stateside if the central bank can t keep dollars from refereeing trade and investment in a police state does anyone seriously think the fed can tighten or loosen access to dollars in the u s the question answers itself so while all this breathy excitement about the fed is silly and something that future historians will marvel at it s still easy to energetically support shelton for the fed board the fed employs more economists than any other entity in the world these economists almost unanimously believe that economic growth causes inflation so it will do the fed good to have someone inside who thinks differently shelton knows well that economic growth is actually a consequence of investment and investment is what brings about falling prices how fun to see what s calcified and ludicrous economists also almost unanimously think that empowering nancy pelosi and kevin mccarthy to spend with abandon is the path to prosperity to be shaken up by the unafraid shelton she should be confirmed yesterday thank goodness shelton doesn t think like economists thinking about the nominee more broadly the discussion of shelton within the pundit class would be quite a bit more productive if those who presume to talk money understood that no one trades it or exchanges it underlying all transactions that involve money is the exchange of real goods services and labor always money is merely an agreement about value among producers that facilitates the exchange of actual things thus explaining yet again why the dollar is the currency of choice in a country whose official currency is the won the problem is that the won commands little in north korea and nothing outside of it since financial transactions are yet again always about the exchange of goods and services for goods and services the currency refereeing these exchanges must once again be seen as exchangeable for market goods all of this rates stress given shelton s past support for a gold defined dollar to be clear she s long been a supporter of just such a currency as she put it in her classic 1994 book money meltdown going on a global gold standard would provide a much more democratic international monetary system than the one that exists today statements like this are all over the book that they are speaks to shelton s possession of common sense the latter something that s very challenging to find inside the marriner eccles building on washington d c s constitution avenue or for that matter any of the other fed branches around the country shelton s support for stable money is an explicit statement from her that she understands money s sole purpose as a medium of exchange nothing else shelton s support for a gold defined dollar is an acknowledgement of a simple truth previously stated no one trades money currency exchanges signal the exchange of goods services and labor let s say it again always given this statement of the supremely obvious it s only natural that the goal among serious people when it comes to currencies is that they be as stable as a measure of value as possible and for those who say a gold defined dollar or a stable dollar pick your commodity would limit the ability of the fed to act during recessions you re showing how little you understand money to say that a dollar with a stable definition exists as a barrier to central bankers politicians and economic growth is the equivalent of some dope saying that a slow second keeps his 40 yard dash times at 6 seconds and is keeping him out of the nfl as a consequence seconds measure objectively money measures objectively nothing else of course this too is a pointless discussion when it s remembered that the fed s policy portfolio doesn t include the dollar s exchange rate in short shelton s support of the gold standard and dollar price stability would only be relevant if she were being appointed treasury secretary and for those readers absolutely convinced the fed manages the dollar s value despite all evidence revealing the exact opposite don t forget that the fed operates under an implied consensus rule 4 3 votes or even 5 2 votes by fed board members are the major exception to the rule shelton would be but one believer in a gold defined dollar translated even if it were true that the fed controlled the dollar s value the fed is short about four or five sheltons if the goal is a return to the gold standard this is true even if shelton ultimately replaces jerome powell some object to shelton because her views have evolved with those of the man who appointed her this is true but it s also irrelevant about it being true in a wall street journal interview from 2019 shelton recalled u s auto workers telling her in the 1980s that we can compete against the best in the world but we can t compete against the central bank of japan in particular shelton made the point more than once that currency devaluation by countries makes their products more competitive globally in shelton s 2019 words nations gain a price advantage over competitors by devaluing their currencies that s what she was referencing while discussing japan except that what she referenced isn t true and the source supporting the previous claim is shelton s previously mentioned 1994 classic money meltdown contrary to modern commentary from shelton about japan s central bank devaluing the yen versus the dollar the fed nominee knows well what really happened and the truth will inform her thinking while at the fed or it should writing about the 1985 plaza accord in meltdown shelton observed that if the success of it were judged by the steep descent in the dollar s value as measured against other currencies in the ensuing months there can be no denying that the plan worked 36 pages later shelton noted that the yen was at 358 to the dollar in 1970 265 yen to the dollar in 1973 184 in 1978 129 in 1988 and 105 in 1993 shelton described the dollar s steep drop against the yen in the 1980s as a final outcome of the deliberate government effort engineered by baker and darman to lower the value of the dollar against the yen baker was treasury secretary at the time and darman was his 2 translating all this shelton has tailored her views to fit those of the president appointing her and trump incorrectly believes that the dollar has soared against the yen since the 1980s no not at all arguably something similar is at work with interest rates or the fed s role shelton is too smart to believe that price controls work that s why her modern stance in favor of so called fed ease is so easy to read as politics in play if we ignore what s true that the fed can t control access to credit in the first place the idea that it could expand credit access by lowering the fed funds rate is as silly as the belief that artificially low apartment rent controls will lead to apartment abundance no not at all and the fed can t create easy credit shelton knows this politics is once again at work and that s ok the fed has long been a politicized institution and so it remains under president trump it says here that shelton doesn t need to compromise her views on the dollar and interest rates but she knows her own situation better than yours truly furthermore her compromises or evolving opinions that have some up in arms are a distraction from the much bigger truth about the economics profession it s populated by the near monolithically incorrect it s not just that they believe against all evidence that growth causes inflation or that government spending stimulates growth as opposed to it being a consequence of it economists also near unanimously believe world war ii ended the great depression yes they believe that maiming and killing boost economic progress the economics profession is increasingly ridiculous and so is the fed ridiculous when it s remembered how many economists are in its employ shelton will greatly improve an institution and an economics discussion that s degenerated into the wildly silly and that can t hurt her existence will surely trigger some on the left and that can t hurt either all that plus she s a remarkably gracious person confirm judy shelton at the fed

spread the love in early march the united states of america sanctions imposed unilaterally on zimbabwe in 2003 will expire but this does not mean that the us is going to remove the noose from the neck of zimbabwe the us senate s foreign relations committee has called for a review of the sanctions on zimbabwe with a call for more names to be added to the sanctions list to deter human rights abuses senators jim risch the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee and chris coons a member of the sub committee on africa and global health policy have sent a letter to treasury secretary steven mnuchin and secretary of state mike pompeo requesting that the us department of the treasury update the list of sanctioned persons in zimbabwe given the developments in zimbabwe over the last two years we urge you to consider enhancing the tools at your disposal including the use of targeted sanctions to incentivise changes in behaviour by the government of zimbabwe the two senators wrote an update to the list of the specially designated nationals and blocked persons list should incorporate a balance of new designations with appropriate removals to justify the illegal actions of the white house which uses a sanctions policy to exert pressure and change unwanted regimes us ambassador in botswana craig cloud on january 28 met in gaborone with sadc executive secretary stergomena tax just after the meeting the us embassy in botswana tried to spin the meeting by falsely claiming that a cloud and tax had agreed that corruption and not sanctions was causing zimbabwe s problems they also added a hash tag itsnotsanctions that was used by the us embassy in zimbabwe on october 25 last year when sadc nations rallied behind zimbabwe in the call for the removal of the illegal western sanctions ambassador cloud and dr tax also discussed how failed economic policies and corruption have created the current economic crisis in zimbabwe itsnotsanctions the us embassy claimed but tax was quick to expose the falsehood saying sadc did not share the said position this was not part of what was discussed might be the position of the embassy but definitely not sadc s position she said tax also reiterated the need to further engage on reforms that will lead to zimbabwe s economic recovery on the contrary in a statement on its twitter handle the regional body said sadc es dr tax met with the ambassador of usa to botswana h e craig cloud where dr tax reiterated sadc s call for the immediate removal of sanctions on zimbabwe the need to further engage on reforms that will see a recovery of the country s economy read the tweet this statement by tax shows that sadc is not going to change its stance in august last year sadc resolved to set aside october 25 as the solidarity day against illegal sanctions imposed on zimbabwe and resolved to conduct various activities in their respective countries on the day to call for the immediate removal of the economic embargo the regional campaign widened beyond the regional bloc to the entire continent when the african union voiced its objections to the sanctions imposed on zimbabwe calling for their immediate removal internationally china cuba and the non aligned movement made strong calls for the removal of the sanctions and the situation with the coverage of the meeting of the american ambassador in botswana and the sadc executive secretary clearly shows how the americans wishful thinking and use twitter as an official channel for disseminating false information the same us embassy in botswana tweeted the 5 so called facts about us sanctions in zimbabwe 1 us sanctions largely target those who engage in corruption violate human rights and undermine the democratic institutions or process 2 targeted sanctions do not prohibit trade between the us and zimbabwe 3 zidera and targeted sanctions are different the us has never invoked zidera 4 the sanctions list is a living document 5 failed economic policies and corruption not sanctions hinder zimbabwe s economic growth however in contrast to the loud statements of the americans the facts stubbornly speak of the destructive effect of american sanctions on zimbabwe sanctions have been detrimental to zimbabwe s economy as they have dragged economic progression backward and worsened socio economic conditions of the general populace ever since they were imposed in the early 2000s meant to choke zimbabwe s economy these sanctions аге two dimensional the first being zidera and the second is referred to as а targeted sanctions programme it is imperative to note that sanctions have negatively affected the economic prosperity of zimbabwe several government officials and companies in which zimbabwe had interests were placed оп а sanctions list among them was the industrial development corporation idc а wholly state owned enterprise at the time idc had interests in а broad range of zimbabwean companies such as olivine sable chemicals chemplex and zimbabwe fertiliser company which have been under performing as а result of sanctions these companies had no access to credit lines as а result of western sanctions standard chartered ordered idc to close its accounts with the bank standard chartered s fears were not unfounded economists have estimated that zimbabwe state enterprises account for 14 of the country s gdp making them а key component of the economy typically state enterprises are key to any economy s growth and largely depend on foreign loans for their capital expenditure such loans have mostly dried up due to restrictions which are encompassed in zidera thanks to zidera zimbabwe has not been receiving enough foreign direct investment due to the fact that most firms and companies аге handicapped so the us has maintained its theory that the sanctions are targeted only some entities and individuals in zimbabwe and not directed against the people of zimbabwe is it so but the reality of the situation is that western sanctions harm primarily the financial services sector and lead to a reduction in foreign investment so necessary for the development of the economy of the republic it s only a few banks which can take zimbabwe s risk zimbabwe is under sanctions and the sanctions are in three parts the first one is zidera which says no one should give zimbabwe development finance be it the international monetary fund imf world bank or african development bank secondly there is ofac which says that the transactions from zimbabwe should be scrutinised for compliance risk the third is zimbabwe s exclusion from the african growth and opportunity act whose purpose is to assist the economies of sub saharan africa and to improve economic relations between the united states and the region which means we do not have market access these three pillars have placed immense constraints on the zimbabwean economy the real effects of the sanctions have been to cut off zimbabwe from the global banking system here is a situation where the global financial markets have been de risking zimbabwe the country s constrained access to international financing has been worsened by the fact that the country has lost over 100 foreign correspondent banks since 2008 and this is one of the causes of the currency crisis but with a currency crisis creating long term productive capacity becomes a mammoth task major export earners like mining agriculture and tourism are frustrated through increased costs of doing business in addition to restricted access to international markets consequently zimbabwe s economy today is half its size as evidenced by capacity utilization which hovers below 50 that means around us 20 billion of economic potential was lost last year alone now imagine zimbabwe is approaching 20 years under sanctions by comparison the us estimates of lost receipts from corruption in zimbabwe were around us 1billion at the same time western countries say that despite sanctions they are increasing support for zimbabwe through various assistance programmes external aid instead of investments in fact perpetuates poverty it is actually washing out much needed investments which would otherwise ignite economic growth boost job creation and support self sustenance if direct investments come to the country over a number of years zimbabwe will be self sufficient and not reliant on any foreign humanitarian support but this is absolutely not beneficial to the west so called programmse of assistance actually benefit donor countries as in return they earn considerable soft power and gain significant leverage over the economic affairs of the host governments the fact is the losses from the effects of sanctions alone far exceed the cash handouts dished out by westerners for this reason there is no doubt that in late february early march the united states will extend or perhaps even toughen anti zimbabwean sanctions and the european union will follow the american example doing everything for the prosperity of democracy in zimbabwe and those who doubt the good intentions of the west implemented through sanctions can read tweets by american officials the standard share

zimbabwe s economy is vulnerable with its growth trends now 2 below the average of sub saharan africa s economic expansion partly due to exchange rate misalignment volatile weather patterns and unsustainable fiscal deficit a new report has revealed by mthandazo nyoni zimbabwe s economy is vulnerable with its growth trends now 2 below the average of sub saharan africa s economic expansion partly due to exchange rate misalignment volatile weather patterns and unsustainable fiscal deficit a new report has revealed according to the 2019 needs assessment report for zimbabwe compiled by the african development bank united nations and world bank the country is faced with a precarious macro fiscal environment formerly one of the most advanced economies in sub saharan africa the zimbabwean economy today is among the most vulnerable with erosion of its industrial and agricultural base the report reads in part the economic growth trend is now some two percent below the average of sub saharan africa partly resulting from exchange rate misalignment volatile weather patterns and unsustainable fiscal deficit the united nations recently predicted that zimbabwe s economy will go down by 5 5 in 2019 and expects that it will fall by a further 2 5 in 2020 on the other hand the world bank says the economy fell by 7 5 in 2019 but may rebound by 2 7 in 2020 the government projected a 6 5 decline in 2019 and a 3 growth in 2020 but due to the looming drought the figures might be hard to achieve zimbabwe had double digit growth rates shortly after dollarisation in 2009 but confidence started to evaporate in 2012 coinciding with the commodity supercycle ending which particularly hit the mining sector and the investment to gdp ratio declined sharply the report noted that bank lending recovered dramatically after dollarisation but poor investment choices led to a sharp increase in non performing loans that reached over 20 of the loan portfolio in september 2014 it said the decline in zimbabwe s growth coincided with a gradual depreciation of the south african rand against the united states dollar which had an immediate impact on zimbabwe s competitiveness zimbabwe used the us dollar between 2009 and 2019 at a time when south africa was its largest trading partner the government last year announced the return of the zimbabwe dollar as the sole legal tender albeit with inadequate foreign currency and mineral backing causing the currency to lose value within a short period of its introduction meanwhile the report noted that the liquidity shortages and the existence of separate currencies severely affected the economy it said bond notes introduced in november 2016 did not help increase cash supply and liquidity and shortages of foreign currency intensified further following the separation of real time gross settlement rtgs local currency accounts from nostro foreign currency accounts in october 2018 the zimbabwe dollar has plunged more than 85 since it was reintroduced as legal tender last year the country is reeling under economic hardships characterised by hyperinflation low salaries excessive power cuts dire shortage of maize meal and low production pushing citizens and businesses to the edge the report produced after intensive consultations with various government agencies the private sector civil society and development partners was prepared following a request from the government the exercise was carried out between march 2018 and august 2019 the new government has been seeking to re engage fully with the international community attract foreign direct investment and restore confidence in politics governance and the economy of the country
source xinhua 2020 02 16 17 02 16 editor xuxin video player close stephen roach senior fellow at yale university s jackson institute of global affairs speaks during an interview with xinhua in new haven the united states feb 6 2020 xinhua xu yuan by xinhua writers xu yuan and deng xianlai new haven the united states feb 16 xinhua it is encouraging that china has acted aggressively to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus disease covid 19 while maintaining transparency in its communication with the public a u s economist and china expert has said the coronavirus will not create new uncertainty to the china u s bilateral trade relationship as washington is respectful of the fact that bringing the epidemic under control is a priority for china at the moment stephen roach senior fellow at yale university s jackson institute of global affairs said in an interview with xinhua days before the u s china phase one trade deal took effect friday short lived shock actions taken by the chinese government to isolate the disease especially within the confines of hubei province and in hubei s capital city of wuhan in particular are encouraging said roach former chairman of morgan stanley asia and chief economist at morgan stanley the new york based investment bank the government reacted very strongly and correctly he said regarding the chinese government s interactions with the public as the situation unfolds the expert said authorities have been open and aggressive and transparent in conveying the sense of concern in particular roach spoke highly of the government moving more aggressively to build new hospitals in wuhan where the coronavirus is believed to have originated on the economic impact of the coronavirus roach said he is an optimist in the chinese economy adding that while the country is expected to experience an economic shock in the first half of the year due to the infections it will be followed by a rebound and possibly a sharp rebound once the virus is under control this is exactly what happened in early 2003 with the sars outbreak there was no reason to believe that won t be the case this time as well he said the people s bank of china the country s central bank has responded swiftly to buttress the economy amid the coronavirus outbreak by injecting additional liquidity into the market a measure roach said will calm the market but will not necessarily trigger recovery the recovery he added will occur on its own roach noted that at present there are still plenty of opportunities for chinese policymakers to adopt monetary and fiscal stimuli in the absence of inflation risk which i think is still a reasonable bet to make it would be appropriate to see the central bank continue to be accommodated even as china resorts to whatever tools necessary to arrest a potential economic slowdown right now roach s advice is for the country not to lose sight on the benefits of the structural reforms which the chinese government has been implementing for over a decade i m still very optimistic on the prospects for the chinese economy roach said the key is to not let a terribly unfortunate event like this detract from the ongoing reforms that are so vital for china at this point in time further elaborating on this viewpoint roach suggested that beijing stay on course of shifting from a growth model relying on exports and investments to internal private consumption from manufacturing to services from imported to indigenous innovation that s all very positive for china going forward roach predicted that the coronavirus will inflict a surprisingly tough toll on the world economy his estimate is that the disease as it transmits across borders will take global gdp growth in 2020 down into the mid 2 percent area so that would technically be right on the brink of a new global recession but again i just want to stress that the economy goes down sharply and then comes back sharply roach said so the global impacts i think will be short lived the coronavirus roach said will undoubtedly disrupt global supply chains severely but the fear that supply chains will move away from china is premature dead wrong most likely roach stressed the common threat the virus poses to people all around the world no country is in oasis when the world is dealing with a tough set of circumstances he said urging countries to move out of their political roles and focus on what s best for the people for humanity not new uncertainty the covid 19 outbreak in china came at a time when washington and beijing signed the phase one deal aimed at resolving their economic and trade disputes the agreement came into effect friday roach said the coronavirus will not become a new source of uncertainty in the china u s trade relationship as the united states is aware that dealing with the epidemic is of utmost urgency for china at present i think the u s is very respectful of china s need to address this as forcefully as possible the multiple rounds of negotiations resulting in the phase one deal served a useful purpose of bringing a lot of tough issues out into the open roach said adding that the deal under which both sides agreed to a ceasefire or truce on punitive tariffs is a welcome relief from escalating tensions yet there s still a lot of unfinished business in resolving the differences he said china announced on feb 6 that it will cut in half the rate of additional tariffs on some 75 billion u s dollars worth of u s products a move that followed a pledge made on jan 22 by the united states trade representative s office to halve tariffs from the current 15 percent to 7 5 percent on some 120 billion dollars of chinese goods imposed during the trade dispute both reductions took effect friday washington s obsession with the trade balance with china is ill advised since you can t address or fix a multilateral trade problem with a bilateral u s china solution roach said citing the latest data that shows the united states had trade deficits with 102 countries in 2019 the data that just came out for full year 2019 underscores the fact that while the chinese deficit narrowed by some 74 billion dollars deficits have widened with seven of the 10 largest economies in the world roach said so we went deeper into deficit what s more countries with which u s trade deficit has increased happen to be higher cost producers said roach if you re diverting trade away from your low cost platform in china to your higher cost producers that taxes the american consumer and that s a very negative outcome if it keeps going u s trade imbalances with china and other countries derive from a macroeconomic problem that reflects our lack of saving and the need to borrow surplus savings from abroad roach said adding that reducing the u s budget deficit is the remedy it s the single greatest source behind our shortfall of domestic savings and right now that situation is going from bad to worse he said
jerome powell told congress wednesday that the federal reserve has no recourse but to print more money when the next downturn hits that s because low interest rates are not really a choice anymore a fact of reality with low interest rates already baked into the fabric of the u s economy and financial system the fed can never go back to a normal policy regime at least not without major repercussions i ll let the recently twitter banned zerohedge translate that for you the federal reserve can never again allow price discovery to take place without toppling the house of cards it has created since 2008 basically powell just admitted that the great u s economy can t survive on anything but low interest rates and that aggressive quantitative easing is the only cure when recession hits all semantics of course powell left out the fact that the fed has already returned to qe albeit under a different name since september the central bank has been purchasing short term treasurys and mortgage backed securities to save the overnight repo market from imminent doom the size of the repo operations exploded at the start of 2020 a clear sign there s something seriously wrong with the plumbing of the financial system remember when the repo bonanza was supposed to be temporary well chairman powell told congress on tuesday that the operations will continue until at least april the fed won t disclose which bank s is under the most stress but we have some ideas the real reason the fed can t raise interest rates is because such a regime would topple an economy built on massive debt last month the congressional budget office cbo predicted the u s budget deficit to exceed 1 trillion when the fiscal year ends on sept 30 the same cbo expects the deficit to grow by an average of 1 3 trillion between 2021 and 2030 with the appropriate rounding that s a cumulative gain of 13 1 trillion over the next decade alt aria hidden true since debt serviceability largely depends on interest rates any substantial i e one percentage point rise in rates could have a catastrophic impact on financial stability much of the economy is financialized thanks to the fed so rising interest rates could disrupt all the paper wealth that has been created since the financial crisis financial assets relative to gdp is an obscene ratio 5 6 according to bank of america and the fed so monetary policy needs to accommodate all the investors who entrusted their financial future to the stock market and other ballooning assets let s also not forget what happened the last time the central bank raised interest rates it triggered a bear market in the s p 500 a 20 plunge in the stock market culminating in december 2018 was all that was needed for the fed to commence its walk of shame beginning in january 2019 and ending in july when it slashed rates for the first time since 2008 the fed would go on to cut rates two more times after that the fed is now stuck in paralysis keep rates low and let the bubbles grow unleash helicopter money when the next recession hits erode u s dollar hegemony either way

soviet collapse he has also contributed essays tothe los angeles times the national interest american diplomacy the diplomat the journal of american culture andthe prague post popular impressions of jimmy carter tend to fall into two broad categories many see him as a failed president who mismanaged the economy presided over a national malaise allowed a small band of iranian militants to humiliate the united states and ultimately failed to win reelection his final gallup presidential approval rating stood at 34 equal to that of george w bush among postwar presidents only richard nixon 24 and harry truman 32 left office with lower approval ratings as the political scientist john orman suggested some years ago carter s name is synonymous with a weak passive indecisive presidential performance for those who hold this view carter represents everything that made the late 70s a real bummer his supporters meanwhile portray him as a unique visionary who governed by moral principles rather than power politics they point out that he initiated a groundbreaking human rights policy forged a lasting middle east peace agreement normalized relations with china pursued energy alternatives and dived headlong into the most ambitious post presidency in american history both perspectives have their merits yet although even carter s admirers would rather ignore his economic record than defend it popular memory of his economy is off the mark contrary to the prevailing wisdom by many indices the u s economy did relatively well during carter s presidency and he took his role as steward of the public trust seriously he kept the national debt in check created no new entitlements and steered the nation clear of expensive foreign wars whatever else one may think about the man it is no exaggeration to say that jimmy carter was among the last of the fiscally responsible presidents although there is no single measure for evaluating a president s economic performance if we combine such standard measures as unemployment productivity interest rates inflation capital investment and growth in output and employment carter s numbers were higher than those of his near contemporaries ronald reagan richard nixon gerald ford and george h w bush what may be surprising notes the economist ann mari may is not only that the performance index for the carter years is close behind the eisenhower index of the booming 1950s but that the carter years outperformed the nixon and reagan years average real gdp growth under carter was 3 4 a figure surpassed by only three postwar presidents john f kennedy lyndon johnson and bill clinton even though unemployment generally increased after the 1960s the average number of jobs created per year was higher under carter than under any postwar president particularly noteworthy was carter s fiscal discipline although keynesian policies were central to democratic party orthodoxy carter was a fiscal conservative who touted balanced budgets and anti inflationary measures by and large he stuck to his campaign self assessment i would consider myself quite conservative on balancing the budget on very careful planning and businesslike management of government under carter the annual federal deficit was consistently low the national debt stayed below 1 trillion and gross federal debt as a percentage of gdp peaked below forty percent the lowest of any presidency since the 1920s during his final year in office the debt to gdpratio was 32 and the deficit to gdp ratio was 1 7 in the ensuing twelve years of reagan and bush 1981 1993 the debt quadrupled to over 4 trillion and the debt to gdp ratio doubled the neoliberal policies popularly known as reaganomics had plenty of fans but in the process of lowering taxes reducing federal regulations and increasing defense spending conservatives all but abandoned balanced budgets the debt increased by a more modest 32 during bill clinton s presidency clinton could even boast budget surpluses in his second term before it ballooned by 101 to nearly 11 7 trillion under george w bush not only did bush entangle the u s in two expensive wars but he also convinced congress to cut taxes and to add an unfunded drug entitlement to the 2003 medicare modernization act during the obama presidency the debt nearly doubled again to 20 trillion obama and bush s respective totals depend in part on how one assigns responsibility for the fy2009 stimulus bill under president trump the national debt has reached a historic high of over 22 trillion and policymakers are on track to add trillions more in the next decade there are a few major blots on carter s economic record inflation was a killer indeed much of carter s reputation for economic mismanagement stems from the election year of 1980 when the misery index inflation plus unemployment peaked at a postwar high of 21 98 the average annual inflation rate during carter s presidency was a relatively high 8 lower than ford s 8 1 but higher than nixon s 6 2 and reagan s 4 5 the annualized prime lending rate of 11 was lower than reagan s 11 6 but higher than nixon s 7 6 and ford s 7 4 economist ann mari may concurs that while fiscal policy was relatively stable in the carter years monetary policy was highly erratic and represented a destabilizing influence at the end of the 70s carter s defenders note that he inherited a lackluster economy with fundamental weaknesses that were largely beyond his control including a substantial trade deficit declining productivity the great inflation that had begun in the late 1960s vietnam war debts the federal reserve s expansionary monetary policy growing international competition from the likes of japan and west germany and a second oil shock it was jimmy carter s misfortune writes the economist w carl biven to become president at a time when the country was faced with its most intractable economic policy problem since the great depression unacceptable rates of both unemployment and inflation a one two punch that came to be called stagflation in response carter chose austerity throughout the 1970s federal reserve chairmen arthur f burns and g william miller had been reluctant to raise interest rates for fear of touching off a recession and carter was left holding the bag after carter named paul volcker as fed chairman in august 1979 the fed restricted the money supply and interest rates rose accordingly the prime rate reaching an all time high of 21 5 at the end of 1980 all the while carter kept a tight grip on spending our priority now is to balance the budget he declared in march 1980 through fiscal discipline today we can free up resources tomorrow unfortunately for carter austerity paid few political dividends as the economist anthony s campagna has shown carter could not balance his low tolerance for keynesian spending with other democratic party interests his administration took up fiscal responsibility but his constituents wanted expanded social programs meanwhile his ambitious domestic agenda of industrial deregulation energy conservation and tax and welfare reform was hindered by his poor relationship with congress the carter administration might have shown more imagination in tackling these problems but as many have noted this was an age of limits carter s successors seem to have taken one major lesson from his failings the american public may blame the president for a sluggish economy but when it comes to debt the sky s the limit

joe renouard teaches at the johns hopkins university school of advanced international studies in nanjing china his most recent book is human rights in american foreign policy from the 1960s to the soviet collapse he has also contributed essays tothe los angeles times the national interest american diplomacy the diplomat the journal of american culture andthe prague post popular impressions of jimmy carter tend to fall into two broad categories many see him as a failed president who mismanaged the economy presided over a national malaise allowed a small band of iranian militants to humiliate the united states and ultimately failed to win reelection his final gallup presidential approval rating stood at 34 equal to that of george w bush among postwar presidents only richard nixon 24 and harry truman 32 left office with lower approval ratings as the political scientist john orman suggested some years ago carter s name is synonymous with a weak passive indecisive presidential performance for those who hold this view carter represents everything that made the late 70s a real bummer his supporters meanwhile portray him as a unique visionary who governed by moral principles rather than power politics they point out that he initiated a groundbreaking human rights policy forged a lasting middle east peace agreement normalized relations with china pursued energy alternatives and dived headlong into the most ambitious post presidency in american history both perspectives have their merits yet although even carter s admirers would rather ignore his economic record than defend it popular memory of his economy is off the mark contrary to the prevailing wisdom by many indices the u s economy did relatively well during carter s presidency and he took his role as steward of the public trust seriously he kept the national debt in check created no new entitlements and steered the nation clear of expensive foreign wars whatever else one may think about the man it is no exaggeration to say that jimmy carter was among the last of the fiscally responsible presidents although there is no single measure for evaluating a president s economic performance if we combine such standard measures as unemployment productivity interest rates inflation capital investment and growth in output and employment carter s numbers were higher than those of his near contemporaries ronald reagan richard nixon gerald ford and george h w bush what may be surprising notes the economist ann mari may is not only that the performance index for the carter years is close behind the eisenhower index of the booming 1950s but that the carter years outperformed the nixon and reagan years average real gdp growth under carter was 3 4 a figure surpassed by only three postwar presidents john f kennedy lyndon johnson and bill clinton even though unemployment generally increased after the 1960s the average number of jobs created per year was higher under carter than under any postwar president particularly noteworthy was carter s fiscal discipline although keynesian policies were central to democratic party orthodoxy carter was a fiscal conservative who touted balanced

stock market crash talking points after negotiating a series of economic and geopolitical risks in 2019 the s p 500 rounded out the year more than 30 higher although many risks have been resolved or put on pause key uncertainties remain global trade conflicts lackluster global growth political uncertainty and possible inflation will look to erode equity returns in the year ahead but can they overwhelm various tailwinds including the major global central banks when will the stock market crash equities in the developed world particularly in the united states rounded out the decade with a strong showing as key risks subsided and an accommodative monetary policy backdrop allowed stocks to soar with 2020 in focus there is evidence for a continuation higher what is a recession signs causes impact investors still some investors harbor concerns over the stock market s health and stability in the year ahead but can the headwinds work to outweigh the benefit of looser monetary policy and easing risk trends here are some of the themes that could spark a stock market crash in 2020 global trade conflicts slowing global growth much of 2019 was plagued with fears of slowing global growth a theme exacerbated by trade wars mainly between the us and china that worked to drive uncertainty and delay some businesses from making capital outlays in turn slipping global trade and prolonged policy uncertainty exerted further pressure on the already slowing economies of the world as growth forecasts tapered off the case for higher equity valuations was undermined as future profit outlooks fell beneath previous expectations that being said an initial phase one trade deal between the united states and china reached at the end of 2019 worked to assuage such fears and sparked the year end rally into the new decade similarly us economic data has hinted that the slowdown in the manufacturing and service sectors has leveled off further still data from factset suggests the s p 500 will see bottom up eps growth despite the headwinds it would be within reason then to suggest trade wars and slowing global growth will take a back seat as catalysts of risk aversion in 2020 however the fluidity and unpredictability of trade negotiations will likely keep them in the headlines and deserving of a spot on the risk radar nonetheless although trade headlines and tariffs may not cause the stock market to crash outright an expanded trade war perhaps one between the united states and the european union could work to compound other uncertainties that the dow jones and s p 500 will have to negotiate like the presidential election cycle political uncertainty the us election cycle another hot button issue that will dominate headlines and likely maintain a spot at the forefront of investor concern is the upcoming presidential election in the united states as candidates vie for the support of the american people their polling results and corresponding policy promises will surely spark stock market turmoil especially if an anti business candidate appears likely to enter the white house as it stands president trump is a relatively pro business president slashing corporate taxes and exploring further reductions for the middle class the president has given the equity market reasons to rejoice apart from his pressure for lower interest rates and quantitative easing but has also created a lot of turmoil through his trade policy still the trump administration has said its broader goal has been to expand the us economy and promote growth in part by balancing trade relationships with other nations read more stocks may turn defensive with us presidential election eyed therefore if a candidate that promises to raise taxes while aiming to reform sectors like healthcare and technology surges in the polls an adverse reaction in the broader market could be expected furthermore particularly acute damage could be dealt to the targeted industries to be sure the efficacy or greater good for the american populace produced by one policy framework versus another is up for debate but any indication a business friendly candidate president trump or otherwise will lose out to a candidate whose plan s will constrict growth will surely weigh on stock valuations thus the us election cycle will its spot as a top risk to watch as the year progresses the inflation threat finally and perhaps most importantly is the threat of inflation as the world s major central banks continue to inject money into their respective economies in pursuit of economic growth inflation has remained dormant fed chairman jerome powell has effectively taken rate hikes off the table until the united states sees a material and consistent rise in inflation consequently there is a very real possibility of further rate cuts if growth continues to disappoint and that potential has likely been factored into some analyst s equity price targets in 2020 therefore a sustained uptick in inflation could pull the rug out from under the major equity markets in 2020 as central banks shift their focus from promoting economic expansion to quelling inflation by raising interest rates as it stands many wall street analysts and talking heads have argued inflation is muted because it is simply being calculated incorrectly as many of the ingredients for rising inflation are present in the economy how to invest during a recession investments strategy low unemployment wage growth loose monetary policy and a substantial government deficit are typically contributing factors to rising inflation yet the fed s preferred measure of inflation core pce remains comfortably beneath the 2 target therefore should inflation rise the fed would likely be forced to consider higher interest rates which would undermine a main driver of the equity gains established in 2019 such a reversal in monetary policy could spark an abrupt shock to equity demand and valuations that being said there are few signs inflation is on the rise and that is precisely why it may pose such a threat since it is arguably an underappreciated risk an unexpected uptick could deliver the necessary spark to ignite a crash unlike the other themes that will likely offer persistent pressure but may be less likely to result in an abrupt reevaluation of growth forecasts and asset prices that would devolve into a crash recommended by peter hanks gold could benefit in an inflationary environment get my guide will the stock market crash in 2020 at the onset of 2020 and the advent of the new decade however it seems unlikely such a crash will take place anytime soon as i discussed above a crash would likely require a collection of persistent pressures working to overcome the effects of accommodative monetary policy an unexpected rise in inflation or something completely unknown at present recommended by peter hanks download the 2020 equity forecast get my guide still years of low interest rates have distorted the traditional risk reward profile and could see an eventual crash create a greater unraveling in risk assets that being said it is nearly impossible to forecast such an event so investors should be mindful of their risk exposure and employ proper risk management techniques regardless of the shorter term equity outlook written by peter hanks junior analyst for dailyfx

while there s agreement that the wealthy should pay more there are distinctions among the field members of the media watch the broadcast of the democratic presidential primary debate feb 7 at saint anselm college in manchester n h charles krupa associated press by steven pressman for the conversation it s hardly surprising that if a democrat wins the white house taxes on wealthy americans and corporations will probably go up how they ll go up is the more interesting question the 2020 democratic presidential candidates generally agree the u s economy faces a variety of challenges record high income inequality decaying infrastructure failing public schools climate change that is already leading to fires and floods and a lack of health insurance for millions of americans to name a few to remedy these problems every candidate has proposed raising government revenue by increasing taxes on the rich in one way or another whether through higher income tax rates a wealth tax or changing how investment income is treated here is a brief look at the tax plans of the top eight candidates in the polls and what economists like me think about them individual income taxes president trump s 2017 tax reform law reduced the top individual income tax rate from 39 6 percent to 37 percent every democratic candidate running to replace trump agrees that it should be raised most suggest returning it to 39 6 percent a few think it should go higher bloomberg proposes an additional 5 percent surcharge on income above 5 million yielding a 44 6 percent rate while vermont sen bernie sanders wants a top rate of 52 percent for taxes on lower and middle income americans the candidates generally say they plan to leave the current rates in place or lower them the candidates focus on taxing the wealthy because they say the richest americans have benefited greatly from u s tax policy in the recent past and are no longer paying their fair share the question that economists ask when assessing such policies is when do high tax rates have negative economic consequences such as by discouraging productive work because uncle sam takes such a big chunk of each extra dollar they earn the standard economic argument for lower marginal tax rates is that it provides incentives for people to work hard and be productive but it s not clear at what rate that happens and 37 percent does not seem to be the tipping point for perspective every year from 1940 to 1980 the top marginal tax rate was at least 70 percent yet productivity growth and economic growth were both robust over this period investment income a related issue is should investment income such as dividends capital gains and carried interest be taxed at a lower rate than labor income currently investment income is taxed at a top rate of 20 percent as opposed to the 37 percent tax on labor income with other rate differentials at lower incomes the democratic candidates all want to end the practice of taxing investment income at a lower rate than labor income i believe there are good reasons to do so as do many other economists primarily a lower tax rate incentivizes the wealthy to find ways to convert earnings from labor into capital income to reduce their tax bill and believe it or not private equity managers who typically earn hundreds of millions of dollars a year have all their earnings classified as capital income cutting their tax bill in half corporate income tax the 2017 trump tax bill also cut corporate taxes from 35 percent to 21 percent with proponents arguing it would spur business investment and economic growth several studies however found little or no evidence of this impact and the 2017 tax bill reduced corporate tax revenues as a share of gdp to 1 1 percent from the 50 year average of 1 9 percent putting a larger proportion of the tax burden on individuals this is why all the democratic candidates propose raising corporate tax rates some such as former vice president joe biden and minnesota sen amy klobuchar want to raise the rate some while others such as mayor pete buttigieg and massachusetts sen elizabeth warren would restore the pre trump 35 percent rate similar to the individual tax finding the optimal corporate tax rate can be tricky generally speaking changes to corporate taxes have little impact on the u s economy so raising them shouldn t slow growth higher corporate taxes do however reduce stock prices since corporations will pay more money to the government and less to shareholders as dividends thereby reducing incentives to own stock shares this can hurt less wealthy americans with investments in retirement plans and mutual funds a wealth tax sens sanders and warren argue the super wealthy should pay even higher taxes to reduce inequality and to cover their bigger spending plans most americans agree warren wants to slap a 2 percent tax on net worth in excess of 50 million and a 3 percent tax on fortunes in excess of 1 billion sanders would go further he suggests a tax of 1 percent on net worth over 32 million that would get progressively higher rising to 8 percent on wealth over 10 billion economists are not huge wealth tax fans they think it would spark tax evasion and for this reason not likely lead to much additional revenue more than that a wealth tax may be unconstitutional even if congress were to pass such a tax it would immediately be challenged in the courts the supreme court would likely hold it unconstitutional as was the case with the individual income tax which required the 16th amendment to the u s constitution be passed before it could be implemented carbon tax carbon taxes are taxes on polluting activities such as the use of gasoline or electricity economists across the political spectrum tend to support taxing carbon because it creates incentives for consumers and businesses to spend money in ways that reduce carbon emissions and slow climate change it would however increase the cost of driving flying and heating one s home it would also increase the price of all goods transported long distances and whose production requires a good deal of energy this regressive side to the tax is why sanders doesn t support carbon taxes though most of the other candidates do as an example yang s 40 per ton tax would cost the average american family 2 000 a year besides helping the environment the entrepreneur says a carbon tax would help finance his basic income guarantee turning the page with few exceptions the democrats running for president seem to be on the same basic tax policy page they all want to raise more revenue by taxing capital income at the same rate as labor income and increasing rates on the wealthy and on corporations they differ over the extra taxes such as on carbon wealth and financial transactions whatever combination of these tax changes might be enacted if a democrat wins the white house in 2020 and congress is controlled by the democrats the rich will almost certainly lose their large gains under trump steven pressman is a visiting professor of economics at colorado state university this article is republished from the conversation under

as one of the probable sources of cosatu s idea of tapping into the vast resources of the government employees pension fund gepf the alternative information and development centre aidc would like to address some of the main concerns to the proposal that are now attracting so much publicity aidc s research into the public investment corporation pic and the gepf goes back to 1998 as part of our then campaign against the apartheid debt for which the new anc government had accepted full liability we would additionally like to address an issue that has not been addressed the climate crisis while the connection between the eskom crisis and its threat to the whole economy has been widely recognised neither eskom s singular contribution to climate change nor it s critical potential role in mitigating the climate catastrophe has figured much if at all in the critiques of cosatu s proposal two main concerns are common to the alarm being expressed first the morality of picking on a government employees pension fund as the vehicle for addressing the public problem that is eskom second the danger of exposing the pension fund to risk when as with all pension funds it has a fiduciary duty to safeguard the fund by prudent investment strategies the first concern about the morality of using the gepf for public purposes is entirely understandable this is because it is virtually unknown that a substantial amount of the gepf s current assets come from public money it was the late gavan duffy whose pioneering research from 1998 first drew attention to this unexpected reality even less well known is that the pensions were a sticking point in the 1993 negotiations over the peaceful transition to democracy in his autobiography my own liberator a memoir 2017 the former deputy chief justice dikgang moseneke writes about his experience as a member of the technical committee that drafted the interim constitution of 1993 he tells us perhaps the trickiest part of the interim constitution came right at the end of the drafting process we came to learn that the securocrats in the police and army would not support the transition unless two matters had been resolved a constitutionally sanctioned process of amnesty for past crimes that were politically inspired and pensions page 302 and that was all he said about pensions however aidc s aforementioned research into the apartheid debt fills in the pieces to which moseneke intriguingly alludes it is important to note at the outset that the about to be detailed changes to the pension fund were a political decision that had nothing to do with the actuarial requirements of the pension fund in 1989 the largest of 10 public pension funds the government service pension fund was shifted from a pay as you go scheme to a fully funded scheme in anticipation of the demise of apartheid this guaranteed huge pensions for out going apartheid state officials and reassured them that pensions will be guaranteed the shift was orchestrated by the apartheid government and as we have seen accepted by the anc as one of the costs of the peaceful transition bradley steyn provides further information about the changes to the state pensions in his book undercover with mandela s spies 2019 171 he argues that this decision was endorsed by both fw de klerk and nelson mandela according to steyn fw de klerk insisted on the changes to satisfy the base of the national party which predominantly consisted of civil servants mandela wanted to mitigate against mass job losses as well as to placate what steyn referred to as freaked out whites the net result was the publicly funded bloating of the pension fund at the expense of financing a more redistributive developmental agenda it is not possible to give a precise number to the quantum of public money that now sits in the gepf without full access to the data nevertheless one can say with certainty that the state directed significant amounts of state resources to the fund through inflated employer contributions over the period at an average interest rate of 8 the public share of the fund has compounded to several hundreds of billions of rands the government effectively borrowed from itself to finance the shift the capital costs plus the interest on the debt that government owed to itself has been paid by taxpayers the question then arises why should public money not be used in the public interest this does not mean giving a get out of jail free card to corrupt officials and mismanagement at eskom or the pic for that matter in fact eskom s finances and debt should be publicly disclosed and audited including the illegitimate 3 75 billion world bank loan to build the giant coal power station medupi in 2010 second those implicated or complicit in impugned transactions must have their day in court and if found guilty must swap their suits for orange overalls finally the funding must come on condition that eskom is retained as a vertically and horizontally integrated entity without which south africa will not be able to transition to renewable energy at the scale and pace required to meet even it s very modest climate change commitments this argument is fully developed in a soon to be published research report transform eskom a public sector path to renewable energy a collaborative undertaking involving the national union of metalworkers of south africa the national union of mineworkers trade unions for energy democracy in new york and the transnational institute in amsterdam this brings us to the second main concern the dangers of over exposing the pension fund to risk here there are a number of critical points despite claims to the contrary the financial position of the gepf is healthy in spite of bad probably corrupt investments made by its asset manager the pic like for example sekunjalo and steinhoff as it stands today with more than r1 8 trillion in assets the gepf is 108 funded hence it is in a position to cover the pensions of every current pensioner and the pensions of all future retirees who are currently working and contributing to the fund until the day they die even if the impossible situation of everyone withdrawing their pensions at once had to occur r1 663 billion 100 in pensions would be paid out and r137 billion 8 of the r1 8 trillion in assets would remain moreover according to the government employees pension law the fund may be 90 funded and as far as international standards go the fund may be as low as 80 funded and credit rating agencies only consider the pension fund to be weak if it falls below the 60 level given this the fund could safely free up anywhere between r 300 billion and r800 billion with no additional risk to the pension fund at all but of course everyone does not retire at once rather each year some retire while others join the labour force that s why it s possible as it had been done historically everywhere for a pension fund to be structured as a pay as you go scheme where the contributions from current workers cover the benefits paid to pensioners who had previously contributed to the fund consequently pay as you go pension funds don t accrue huge surpluses turning to the gepf in particular contributions received have either matched or exceeded the total amount of benefits paid until 2013 when this balance was upset by fund members being encouraged to cash in their savings even though there has been a substantial increase in the amount of benefits paid out from r57 9 billion in 2013 2014 to r85 8 billion in 2014 2015 the gepf continued to make a surplus of close to r440 billion from 2010 to 2019 at an average of about r48 billion per annum given all this it is virtually unthinkable that utilising the gepf s surpluses would bankrupt the fund in fact the gepf has demonstrated a reassuring resilience in times of crisis and has indeed continued to grow despite the 2008 9 global financial crisis some analysts dispute that the gepf s financial position is as healthy as we describe they claim that the fund is underfunded in essence the claimed theoretical underfunding is linked to the increased risk associated with the over concentration of the pic investments in the stock market this concern is valid given that in 2018 the pic invested about r1 trillion of its total investments in the jse moreover this increases by an additional r30 r35 billion every year through these investments the gepf is effectively supporting high share prices propping up one of the most overvalued stock exchanges in the world this risky and irresponsible investment strategy is easily rectified rather than boasting about the fund being the biggest investor in the jse where nearly two thirds of its assets are invested it would be far safer for the pic to redirect this investment to government bonds in saying this we are not unmindful that the withdrawal of pic investments will have a debilitating effect on the share price of the corporations vulnerable to a share correction in the short term indeed this is almost certainly one of the reasons why cosatu s proposal has not been welcomed however given that the return on the investments on the jse have been moderate even if the pic were to lend eskom money at concessionary rates it would still lead to savings in the long run in its bid to capitalise eskom with a r250 billion loan from the gepf s fund cosatu has accepted an economic policy position historically held by the international labour movement in relation to the use of public workers pension funds now that cosatu has recognised this some people are objecting to this in the name of protecting poor pensioners they claim that overpaid union workers should foot the bill rather than pensioners however it s not workers who make up the bulk of the wage bill at eskom and other soes the wages incentives and bonuses of eskom managers and directors are massive in comparison to workers wages shouldn t the managers and directors take a cut given that they ought to be responsible for the management of eskom furthermore at the risk of being repetitive it s worth reminding that it s not just pension money it is also public money besides which pension money is not at risk in any way but if it s all so simple why are there all these big nos as cosatu s mathew parks says people s fears are legitimate however neither cosatu nor aidc are proposing that the pension fund gives eskom a great big donation nor is it a raid on public sector pension money given that eskom needs saving if only because it threatens the whole economy and that the poor always pay whenever something goes wrong then at least in this way the poor pay the least amount of costs from their actual pocket a lot of the financial risk is mitigated and very importantly workers and the public get to weigh in on what the transition to a low carbon economy looks like in this way it is not a free lunch as sadtu general secretary and pic board member mugwena maluleke says cosatu is not proposing a blank cheque but an investment option that wants to save the country from economic collapse the enormous anxiety in the investor community includes the establishment of a precedent that eventually requires prescribes other pension funds and investors to invest a percentage of their overall investment in government bonds given the enormity of the eskom crisis that everyone now acknowledges isn t it time for business to contribute in addressing the public need rather than what many would see as their private greed the principal executive officer of gepf abel sithole is reported to have said that he will only consider recapitalising eskom if the government puts in place a credible business plan for restructuring the power utility together with strict repayment terms and conditions this is critical however in the context of mass unemployment and proposed retrenchments why do we celebrate propping up the jse for the purpose of serving such narrow elite interests why do we insist that public servants and the government continue to make contributions to a bloated pension fund that s not serving the interests of pensioners workers or the public interest should we not be investing in job creation programmes aimed at building houses a public transport system that works and critically a new electricity system run on renewables moreover after cosatu s move the public sector unions have a stronger position with which to negotiate from in trying to come to an agreement with treasury on how to deal with the problem of the state debt for instance they can now authoritatively say that debt repayment should not crowd out service delivery or that debt repayments should not lead to retrenchments or wage freezes they can also ask why treasury is gratuitously borrowing so much capital at market rates from the private finance industry subjecting the state to private lenders is to place it in a riskier financial situation because loans denominated in foreign exchange potentially require higher repayments instead it could borrow more from pic the surpluses hoarded at the pic will now maybe be recognised as a valuable resource available to save eskom to save the economy and to enable south africa to play its proper role in saving humanity from the climate crisis cosatu s proposal is receiving cautious support from some economists and business circles it remains to be seen whether cosatu s proposal will be accepted by the government but at the very least it is important that this debate is in the public discourse this crucial moment calls for an informed and constructive discussion rather than a knee jerk reaction dm dominic brown is economic justice

yves here even if you don t agree with bob hertz s prescription for medical debt his typology of various types of debtors and the political and practical problems they pose provides a good foundation for further analysis by bob hertz a health care essayist the recent proposal by sen bernie sanders to cancel 81 billion of medical debt is a very good start but it is only a start the rip medical debt group which buys old medical debts and then forgives them is absolutely in the right spirit its founders craig antico and jerry ashton deserve great credit for keeping the issue of forgiveness alive unfortunately over 88 billion in new medical debt is created each year most of it still held by providers or sold to collectors or embedded in credit card balances tragically none of this has to happen in france a visit to the doctor typically costs the equivalent of 1 12 a night in a german hospital costs a patient roughly 11 german co pays for the year in total cannot exceed 2 of income even in switzerland the average deductible is 300 u s patients face cost sharing that would never be tolerated in germany says dr markus frick a senior official if any german politician proposed high deductibles he or she would be run out of town in australia a recent proposal to establish the equivalent of a 5 co pay for primary care visits fueled such an outcry that the federal government was forced to withdraw the idea americans may be forced to take second jobs just to pay medical debt meanwhile the highly taxed europeans get free medical care and are counting their weeks of paid vacation what is wrong with this picture these nations have shown that cost sharing is not necessary to keep health care spending at a level well below that of the united states they rely on higher taxes and price controls and yet are those really worse than widespread patient debt us medical debt comes primarily from these sources the uninsured high deductibles out of network bills claim denials specialty drugs emergency room care zombie debts purchased by collectors in this essay we will show that a substantial number of these debts can be cancelled or greatly reduced today these groups run up the most medical debts group no 1 the poor and the uninsured including those who still do not get medicaid in red states a tennessee couple earning 13 000 annually gets no help whatsoever on medical bills they can barely afford food or rent so of course they incur medical debt every time they are sick over 20 of these families do not have a checking or savings account over 30 are not working at all if they do work they cannot afford to join the employer s plan six full years after the aca there are still close to 30 million adults in the us who are uninsured about seven million are undocumented immigrants another seven million are actually eligible for medicaid if they do get sick about four million could benefit from the aca but are unaware of the benefits up to five million are kept out of both medicaid and the aca in the red states described above another two to three million make too much for aca subsidies this is a hard group to help no states besides california want the undocumented to get help no cities outside liberal enclaves like seattle and new york care about health insurance for restaurant and service workers the poor rarely vote so ignoring them does not trouble conservatives politics are often dominated by seniors who will approve a conservative message about getting rid of socialized medicine while they themselves enjoy the federal socialism of medicare not to mention social security electricity phone infrastructure and the defense spending that comes to red state residents from the federal government group no 2 the under insured who have high deductible insurance and no savings why are they walking around with deductibles they cannot afford at some employers this is the only health insurance which is offered even where there is a choice of plans people with smaller incomes often select the cheaper high deductible coverage if you are healthy a high deductible plan to save money on insurance premiums may be a decent gamble at first but if you have a chronic illness you will pay the entire deductible each year and will probably build up debt only a minority of employers offer assistance to pay the deductibles sometimes this group pays 500 a month or more for a porous health plan which then leaves them with thousands in debt if they are hospitalized many families are living right on the edge financially and they have trouble with all their debts not just medical default rates are growing on car loans and credit cards as well they often face utility shutoffs and repossessions a recent study of insurance claims showed that 49 of patient out of pocket costs per healthcare incident were below 500 39 were 501 1 000 and 12 were more than 1 000 that generates an enormous amount of medical debt group no 3 the well insured who may still get huge out of network bills some of their debts are out and out fraud if a hospital says they are in network then all their contractors should be in network or else we have an illegal bait and switch these surprise bills should be cancelled details to follow in 2011 9 years ago new york studied more than 2 000 complaints involving surprise medical bills and found the average out of network emergency bill was 7 006 insurers paid an average of 3 228 leaving consumers on average to pay 3 778 for an emergency in which they had no choice out of network assistant surgeons who often were called in without the patient s knowledge on average billed 13 914 while insurers paid 1 794 on average surprise bills by out of network radiologists averaged 5 406 of which insurers paid 2 497 on average medical debt can be cruel and dispiriting and it is also incredibly inefficient the cost of creating a bill sending a bill following up negotiating a settlement paperwork for charity care financial counseling a possible lawsuit and rarely getting repayments over years the sheer administrative expense is enormous the average recovery on hospital bills sent to individuals is 15 3 non hospital providers recover an average of 21 8 of each bill no wonder some providers prefer medicaid it only pays about 50 or less of their normal charges but that is far more than they will get in actual collections there are two overarching models for financing health care one is the bernie sanders model paternalistic you get insurance whether you choose it or not sympathy for the poor minorities and migrants you never know when you might be among them collectively bargained usually with large payroll taxes no pre existing conditions clauses hospitals are financed mainly by taxes not user fees patients are not in debt though governments often are cost control through price controls and rationing the sanders model accepts the use of coercion to pay for health care for that matter the singapore health model that is praised by conservatives is filled with coercion including public hospitals forced savings for hsa s and taxes forcatastrophic insurance at some point we are all going to get sick so letting us decide when to buy insurance is somewhat of a fool s paradise millions will always make bad choices and be left to suffer we need to be protected against our own stupidity coercion is needed the only real issue is when and where even wealthy societies can benefit from forced savings for example a mandatory hsa deposit of 3 of income would eliminate most of the medical debts discussed in this essay the other is the paul ryan newt gingrich model based on individual choice no mandates on employers to provide quality coverage no mandates on individuals to buy quality coverage if they want to gamble going uninsured in order to save money that is their call hospitals financed by user fees insurance premiums and private savings no interference with anyone making money on health care even those who prey on medical debtors medical bankruptcy is ok because the fear of it motivates the purchase of health insurance cost control theoretically through competition faith in free markets taxes on workers are lower although the savings seem to be siphoned off in premiums co pays and deductibles the ryan model is frankly darwinian when you get close to it the uninsured frankly are usually people who make mistakes like poor budgeting failing in school losing their jobs or being born to non rich parents persons with no money get much less care and will die sooner those who do not buy insurance when they are healthy will suffer later on eventually it all starts to sounds like culling the herd the ryan model therefore expects a lot from private charity begging is preferable to new taxes democratic legislators have also established medicare medicaid and schip to smooth out the inevitable rough edges medical debt is an obvious consequence of the libertarian model it can only be reformed by importing controls and rules from the sanders model the ideal image of high deductible insurance features a judicious patient with at least 10 000 in hsa savings getting bids on each procedure and therefore driving down costs they might even have non urgent care done abroad which would force american hospitals to compete on price they might decline an unnecessary treatment or diagnostic test to save money even if hospitalized they can say to the provider i am paying cash what is your best offer the amish who do not buy insurance but save prodigiously actually use this method this has some basis in fact cash for medicine however millions of americans have no cash and no bargaining skills some diseases may not wait for patient shopping a desperate patient goes to the nearest hospital and then juggles utility bills and high interest charge cards to pay down medical bills and then begs for help from relatives or even sadder from gofundme the average holder of an hsa account is under age 45 healthy and with an average income of 75 000 whereas in low wage america a consumer driven health plan is a consumer indebted reality financial casualties among patients do not seem to lead to lower health care prices providers are just as likely to raise their prices in order to cover the bad debt they are taking on drug companies certainly do not lower their prices when their customers suffer doctors may want to forgive some patient debts but there is a limit how often they can do this and still cover the expenses of their practice in some cases it is actually and idiotically illegal for physicians to waive the deductibles therefore i advocate the following attacks on medical debt phase one we must cancel balance bills and surprise bills if there was no prior disclosure in most cases providers will not have the right to collect anything more than what the insurers pay them phase two we must cancel the older inactive zombie debts that are being purchased by collection agencies this line of business must terminate providers throughout the country are selling uncollected medical debt for pennies on the dollarto collection agencies who aggressively attempt to force patients to pay the full amount due these debt collectors harass patients at work and at home deploying unscrupulous tactics even after the statute of limitations on the debt has expired debt collection lawyers can file hundreds of suits a day often with little evidence that the alleged debt is actually owed once a lawsuit is filed the process is stacked against defendants the overwhelming majority of whom are not represented by an attorney and collectors have a big advantage in small claims courts which provide very limited due process protections to debtors the debt buyer industry has a bad reputation and for good reason they are typically far more aggressive than the original creditors or their hired debt collectors there is nothing redeemable about the junk debt buying business per senator sanders forcing additional stress and hardship on someone for the crime of getting sick is immoral unconscionable and un american we will eliminate past due medical debt of course all cancellations of unconscionable debt must be income tax free phase three debts can also be reduced by expanding the affordable care act subsidies should be tied to low deductible gold plans subsidies should be available at all income levels not just stopping at 400 of poverty we can let families join the aca exchanges if their workplace plans do not cover spouses and children i e solving the family glitch phase four we must create a subsidized guarantee issue cost sharing reduction insurance that would be available to any american not just those who have low incomes and a silver plan under the aca this policy would cost about 125 a month and it would pay your deductibles similar to the medicare supplement plans that seniors can purchase rates can be kept stable by government reinsurance again just like medicare the cost of reinsurance might be 50 billion a year but we spend that much and more to lower the cost of supplements and drug plans for seniors low deductible health plans have just become too expensive for many american businesses and consumers adding on a separate policy to pay deductibles is not a perfect solution but it is a workable one here are specific regulations to continue the assault on debt rule 1 no balance bills or out of network charges will be valid without arm s length prior disclosure if a procedure can be scheduled it can be quoted every other industry gives price quotes that are the basis of a valid contract with fees and charges spelled out and remedies if unavoidable extra costs appear a medical provider who does not offer a quote when requested will not be able to enforce payment no prior disclosure means no patient liability for scheduled procedures of course this solves the surprise bill problem if extra fees are not disclosed in advance then the patient may not be billed extra also if an insurance claim is denied the patient is not liable the provider and the insurer can fight it out for emergencies when no contract is possible providers can only charge an average of what they actually collect from all insurers networks are completely irrelevant i would call this statutory protection you shouldn t need to buy expensive insurance just to be protected from price gouging these laws must be national and they must be enforced some hospitals will continue to send balance bills even if they are illegal therefore we must have a patient financial protection bureau with the power to nulllfy price gouging we need officials who are willing to assess fines harassment audits bad publicity and even federal takeovers if needed price gouging happens much less to persons over age 65 incidentally medicare advantage ma patients are not responsible for out of network charges in emergency care settings federal law also limits how much providers can bill the patients in traditional medicare in most medical situations although specialty drugs create their own bankruptcy issues rule 2 emergency care must not be subject to insurance deductibles co pays such as 250 for er care would be acceptable but nothing more in other words even if you have a plan deductible of 4000 or more any emergency will be covered at 100 otherwise we get awful scenes such as occurred on the boston subway a woman s leg got stuck in the gap between the train and the platform it was twisted and bloody she was in agony and weeping but she begged that no one call an ambulance it s 3000 she wailed i can t afford that i have terrible insurance r ule 3 the uninsured will be charged medicare rates for hospital care all existing chargemaster bills must be cancelled never to return the largest bills are almost never collected anyways wage garnishment generally doesn t bring in very much for hospitals either in a recent study of virginia hospitals the average total revenue from garnishment was 0 1 of the hospital s annual cash flow the average award for hospitals that won lawsuits against patients was just 1 400 hospitals who serve the poor and uninsured do have a legitimate problem however hospital bad debts are running over 50 billion per year some hospitals do offer 70 discounts to the uninsured and they still must deal with bad debt the solution is not meaner collections it is more help from government medicare s current aid to hospitals for patient bad debt are stingy and insufficient i would favor a small tax on the uninsured the aca mandate was not a bad idea but the money that is raised should go toward hospital care a person who has money but stays uninsured will still receive emergency care and a tax to pay for this is not out of place rule 5 limits must be placed on debt collectors some non profitand public hospitals aggressively sue low income patients for medical bills at least until the media catches them doing it they sue people who would actually be exempt under their own charitable guidelines some have evenfiled lawsuitsagainst their own employees to collect unpaid medical bills charity care guidelines should be national universal and generous with harsh punishments given to hospitals that ignore them the national consumer loan center has made a good start in their proposed model medical debt protection act which would ban the following 1 any action causing an individual s arrest 2 causing an individual to be subject to a writ of body attachment 3 setting a lien or ever foreclosing on an individual s real property 4 garnishing the wages or state income tax refund s of a patient who is eligible for financial assistance lawsuits for medical debt must disappear no more attorney fees would be allowed and no interest charged either under our new laws and regulations here is a sample of what will happen to individual medical debtors 1 the debtor brought their child to the emergency room and was billed 25 000 hospitals use a complex confusing chargemaster based billing system to get more money from insurers the list price is set unreasonably high then the insurers negotiate a discount up tp 80 some insurers even bill for this re pricing which is pure financial waste in any event when some hospitals see a chance to collect their invented rack rates from the uninsured they go for it aggressively it is true that a stubborn patient can sometimes reduce their debt through negotiation but no one has to negotiate with the fire department americans are used to posted prices not haggling and especially not haggling in medicine this bill for 25 000 should be denied at the state health agency the hospital can collect on the medicare fee schedule 2 the patient had to use an out of network hospital due to complications after surgery and was billed 50 000 extra this event could not have been scheduled in advance the patient had no choice in the matter therefore no extra fees are due the out of network provider must accept the standard insurance reimbursement as payment in full the out of network providers especially the ones owned by wall street use a predatory price gouging business model the medical profession itself should have cracked down on them long ago 3 the debtor is being harassed by debt collectors over a 40 000 hospital bill from six years ago there will be a firm statute of limitations on medical debt after a fixed period of perhaps five years the debt must be legally cancelled so it can never be sold or re sold to anyone all interest and legal fees will also be cancelled lawyers who enforce medical debts can find honest work instead 4 the debtor put 100 000 on high interest credit cards to pay for cancer drugs and now cannot cover the charge card payments they will probably have to declare bankruptcy the pricing practices of big pharma unfortunately needs a more complex reform and not a moment too soon very high drug costs are a major reason for the rising premiums and resulting high deductibles in comprehensive health insurance however bankruptcy only works well for one time high medical expenses if you have a chronic illness that will cost 1 000 a month for the rest of your life bankruptcy is only a temporary reprieve 5 the patient received a hospital bill for 50 000 after their insurance company already paid the hospital 100 000 the hospital cannot bill extra if they did not allow the insured to approve the extra fee in an arm s length quote and transaction no extra payment need be made here 7 the patient had a battery of tests of investigate his dizziness and now faces a hospital bill of 15 000 these tests could have been performed in a much cheaper location the hospital should only be allowed to recover what an outside clinic would charge we can go much further toward site neutral reimbursement which hospitals violently resist 8 the patient had a successful surgery but the insurance claim was denied due to coverage issues the hospital is now pursuing them for 35 000 if a claim is denied and the patient could not have known this was likely the patient will not be liable this has been true in medicare for decades right now patients are often asked to pay disputed medical bills while insurers and providers attempt to resolve the dispute if an individual does not pay the bill during this time it can be turned over to collections before receiving medical care most consumers sign consent forms agreeing that they are responsible for any medical bills their insurance company does not cover in full this must end 8 the patient needed an ambulance after a stroke and was billed 2800 for a 10 minute ride ambulance service should be a government function paid for by taxes no different than fire or police this applies to air ambulances also the taxes required would be about 15 billion a year which is a rounding error in federal health spending ambulance fees must be capped at the standard medicare amount of 450 perhaps with an increase of about 30 all of which should be paid by government 9 the debtor did not pay a 600 medical bill while they were unemployed they were sued for the debt but did not make a court appearance next time they got a traffic ticket they were put in jail until they paid the medical bill no lawsuits should ever occur on small medical debt and no arrests either 10 the patient owes their dentist 2 500 for past treatments and needs addition dental care that they cannot pay for at this time or ever this is a major area of medical debt at least 12 of overdue bills but unfortunately we do not have a quick solution the patient must look to the following safety nets dental schools most of these teaching facilities have clinics that allow dental students to gain experience treating patients while providing care at a reduced cost dental hygiene schools may also offer supervised low cost preventive dental care as part of the training experience for dental hygienists conclusion the only way to fully eliminate medical debt would be a comprehensive single payer plan which allowed no fees at the point of service however such a plan would require setting all prices for all doctors hospitals labs and drug companies all providers would have to be satisfied in advance with what the government is going to pay them on each procedure countries like germany accomplish this through collective bargaining japan france taiwan israel and scandinavia also have national fee schedules however i do not think you could get all the providers in toledo to agree on one schedule much less every provider group in america single payer would also require new income and payroll taxes of at least ten per cent more than we pay now if we want first dollar coverage most single payer countries have a 10 20 sales tax as well the europeans are not shy about taxing the middle class for health care based on consumer surveys there are between seven and ten million households with over 10 000 in medical debt however there are about 20 million households who earn over 200 000 a year and would have to pay higher taxes to solve this problem it took a historic financial crisis plus a fair amount of democratic self delusion just to get obamacare passed one congress after another has refused to impose relatively tiny cuts in medicare reimbursements therefore the best we can do for now is to cancel the unconscionable debts provide more federal funding for emergency care create supplemental insurance that will pay the deductibles a summary of our full scale assault
promises made promises kept has been one of president trump s frequent boasts in his campaign for a second term so it was a little awkward this week when his own proposed budget acknowledged in the fine print that several of his key promises haven t been kept at all when trump ran in 2016 he promised that if congress enacted big tax cuts for corporations economic growth would soar to 4 or more i actually think we can go higher he said he promised to balance the federal budget in eight years a longstanding republican aim that those economic growth rates could make possible neither goal is being met not even close in 2017 a republican congress approved trump s corporate tax cut it gave the economy a boost but only a temporary one growth reached 2 9 in 2018 but slowed to 2 3 last year it s running about 2 now according to private sector economists that has extended the long economic expansion that began under president obama as well as reduced unemployment and raised wages all good things but it s far short of trump s initial 4 promise and it s done nothing to balance the federal budget quite the contrary trump s tax cut ballooned the deficit by about 1 trillion a year and his new budget forecasts that pace to continue to which trump s budget chief said as he unveiled the new budget this week never mind this president is a promises made promises kept kind of president russell vought the acting director of the office of management and budget told reporters the promises are still there he said they ve just been scaled back they re also still wildly unrealistic trump s proposed budget forecasts 2 8 growth this year growing to a steady 3 after that those numbers are way above reputable economists estimates with 3 growth vought said the federal budget could come into balance 15 years from now in 2035 that s 10 years later than trump promised but who s counting his pie in the sky growth number is what budgeteers call a magic asterisk a statistical device that allows a president to claim that he s meeting his goals even when he s not obama and earlier presidents used them too but trump s election year budget plan uses a second magic asterisk to make the deficit look better it assumes that the federal reserve will keep interests low for the next 10 years which will reduce the cost of interest on the national debt that s a wish more than a forecast and a third magic asterisk maybe the biggest it assumes congress will enact all of trump s proposed cuts in domestic spending from obamacare and medicaid to environmental protection and the centers for disease control and prevention that s not going to happen house democrats have promised to resist draconian cuts in the social safety net health and the environment just as they did last year and the year before republicans in the senate have rejected many of trump s proposals too including cuts in farm subsidies and foreign aid many of his domestic spending proposals represent other broken promises when he ran last time trump pledged he would not touch medicaid he promised to replace obamacare with a better cheaper health insurance plan he vowed to protect clean air and clean water he s done none of those things presidents budgets are often little more than a wish list that congress politely ignores but trump s new budget with that mountain of magic asterisks is wholly untethered from reality but maybe that s not the point as trump reportedly told campaign donors last month who the hell cares about the budget his 2016 campaign promises were always unrealistic you can t cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time without cutting spending so deeply that even republicans will blink so trump blames democrats for failing to embrace the republican agenda of gutting domestic programs we have not been able to make progress because democrats in congress have opposed his previous budgets vought said we hope that changes we probably need to have a national election before it does translation if trump wins a second term and the gop takes control of the house those budget cuts will begin to look possible many moderate democrats want to be fiscally responsible just as republicans once were and still might be under a different president but if a democrat wins the white house the first thing gop leaders in congress will do is demand a balanced budget and claim that democrats are responsible for the 1 trillion deficit trump bequeathed them all the democratic presidential candidates say they would reverse trump s tax cuts republicans will say it s bad for growth and unfair to hardworking corporations they ll claim the only way to reduce the deficit is to cut domestic spending don t listen trump s fantasy budget proposal shows how cynical that argument is doyle mcmanus is a columnist for the los angeles times
it is u s presidential election season this is an important time for investors to be monitoring events that are unfolding in the political realm why because the person that holds the office of president of the united states is charged with among many things directing the execution of fiscal policy that has a meaningful impact on capital markets including both stocks and bonds for example the s p 500 would likely be in a very different place today had senator bernie sanders won both the democratic nomination and the presidency back in 2016 as a result we must assess the policies either being applied by current office holders or debated by those that aspire to the office to understand the potential risks and opportunities for our investment portfolios an interesting transformation continues to unfold the republican party has closely identified itself for many years with the principles of fiscal conservatism at the core of this philosophy are the principles of lower taxes fiscal responsibility reduced government spending increased government operational efficiency smaller federal budget deficits if not outright budget surpluses reducing the national debt promoting free trade deregulation and privatization reflections from the 2016 campaign trail then candidate trump seemed to fully uphold these principles of fiscal conservatism while campaigning for president one such example weâ ve got to get rid of the 19 trillion in debt well i would say over a period of eight years and iâ ll tell you why â donald trump march 2016 campaigning versus governing what is interesting is that while we have seen lower corporate taxes and individual taxes for many along with shifts toward deregulation and privatization we have seen the exact opposite of many of these fiscal conservative principles since the current administration has taken office the shift away from free trade to protectionism and tariffs is well documented consider the following others reduced government spending government spending is not falling nor is the pace of growth in government spending slowing instead the increase in government spending has accelerated on a year over year basis with each successive year of the current administration for example federal government spending in the u s increased by over 5 in 2019 which marked its highest rate of increase in roughly a decade smaller federal budget deficits the federal budget deficit has not trended toward surplus instead the size of the budget deficit has increased measurably with each passing year under the current administration from 665 billion in 2017 to 779 billion in 2018 to 984 billion in 2019 and this trend is set to continue in 2020 with a projected federal budget deficit in excess of 1 trillion according to the congressional budget office reducing the national debt the federal debt is not falling under the current administration it is not on track to be eliminated by 2024 as previously suggested instead it has increased by more than 3 trillion or one sixth in just over three years since the current administration took office particularly counterintuitive from a fiscal conservative perspective what makes these major expansions in government spending federal budget deficits and national debt all the more notable under the current administration is that they have all taken place in the midst of the longest albeit sluggish economic expansion in u s history itâ s not as though these fiscal activities can be justified by notably and persistently weak economic conditions instead this should be a time under fiscal conservative thinking that government spending should be getting slashed that federal budgets should be running in surplus and that the national debt should be declining instead we are seeing the exact opposite â when you hit 24 trillion and weâ re going to be there very soon because itâ s building up very quickly when we hit that 24 trillion number we become greece on steroids i mean we have a lot of problems in this country â donald trump august 2015 do we have a lot of problems in this country now then with the national debt now at an estimated 23 3 trillion and steadily rising we are now effectively the â greece on steroidsâ that then candidate trump once warned about just over five years ago who the hell cares about the budget â donald trump january 2020 looking ahead to november 2020 for those fiscal conservatives focused on reduced government spending smaller federal budget deficits and lowering the national debt it does not appear that they will see any relief to the opposing trends on these metrics seen in recent years in fact it appears that all of these conditions could considerably deteriorate further in the coming years under the current administration if trends over the past four years and estimates from the congressional budget office are any guide looking at love it is notable then that president trump is able to maintain his remarkably high job approval rating among voters in the republican party despite the stark contrast in fiscal policy from what members in his party have traditionally valued according to gallup his approval ratings among republicans have consistently been in the mid to high 80s to low 90s since the start of 2018 and it reached as high as 94 in the most recently completed poll from january 16 29 2020 given this sudden and massive departure from economic policies upheld by the republican party for so long one would imagine a greater degree of dissent among its voters toward the current administration what this near universal approval potentially signifies then is that the republican party may ironically no longer be looked upon to reliably carry out fiscal conservatism for its conservative voters as it has to varying extents in the past unlikely bedfellows where then does the voter and or investor that values fiscal conservatism turn after all global history is filled with examples of countries that have assertively embraced increased government spending massive budget deficits and soaring national debt during all points of the business cycle only to eventually confront economic and financial market instability while the democratic party that has historically been assigned by its detractors the pejorative of â tax and spend liberalsâ seems an unlikely place the fact that the current gop administration has apparently abdicated from this role does not rule out the possibility that the opposition party could fill it and as the last six years of the clinton presidency in conjunction with the gop led congress in the late 1990s with its free trade agreements deregulation privatization fiscal budget surpluses and shrinking national debt showed drawing sweeping generalizations about how either party will govern fiscal policy at any point in time is misguided who then if anyone based on their stated policy proposals senators sanders and warren are both clearly highly unlikely to fit the bill for fiscal conservatives nothing can be ruled out but highly unlikely nonetheless one democratic candidate in michael bloomberg who has risen to third place in the polls at 14 2 and second place in the betting odds at 34 6 according to the latest realclearpolitics averages does stand out from a fiscal conservative perspective however this is based on his track record as new york city mayor and his long time self proclamation as a fiscal conservative as evidenced by his past comments including the following from many years ago now â to me fiscal conservatism means balancing budgets â not running deficits that the next generation can t afford it means improving the efficiency of delivering services by finding innovative ways to do more with less it means cutting taxes when possible and prudent to do so raising them overall only when necessary to balance the budget and only in combination with spending cuts it means when you run a surplus you save it you don t squander it and most importantly being a fiscal conservative means preparing for the inevitable economic downturns â and by all indications we ve got one coming â michael bloomberg 2007 of course campaigning for president and governing as president are two very different things when it comes to fiscal policy as demonstrated by our current president and mayor bloomberg does have a history of raising taxes and endorsing protectionist policies that run counter to traditional fiscal conservative beliefs as a result only time will tell and any such considerations may be rendered moot if his late starting candidacy does not find traction from the upcoming super tuesday primaries on march 3 keeping an open mind when considering the upcoming

president uhuru kenyatta with president donald trump at the white house washington dc early this month president uhuru kenyatta has had progressive trade negotiations with leaders of the united kingdom and the united states two of the largest economies in the world his participation in the uk africa investment summit in january and subsequent meeting with us president donald trump has laid the foundations for further private sector investments in kenya this is taking place alongside discussions regarding the formation of a new us kenya trade deal these efforts continue the government s approach to trade that has defined uhuru s presidency with the aim of improving the living standards of the country s citizens it also has a bigger picture of increasing kenya s profile on the international economic stage during the 2017 jamhuri day celebrations uhuru unveiled his plan for kenya s development under the so called big four agenda enhancing manufacturing promoting food security introducing universal health coverage and building affordable housing by committing to achieve these ambitious milestones however the government set itself up for a bumpy ride the transformation of the kenya into an industrialising middle income economy has faced a host of challenges despite numerous bilateral as well as regional trade agreements in place such as the east african community common market the volume of exchanged goods and services has barely increased business conditions furthermore kenya s trade balance remains negative meaning that it imports more from other countries than it exports this means that more money is leaving the country than coming in as the world trade organisation observed in the past this was largely the result of the poor quality of infrastructure in kenya and east africa the lack of expansive networks of high quality roads and railways hampered the movement of goods directly stemming from this was increased cost of kenyan goods that made them less competitive in the global market uhuru s policies now seem to be built on realisation that the negotiation of new deals with partners abroad has to be complemented by the improvement of business conditions at home he has fostered friendly relationships with all major powers on the international scene close cooperation with china for instance helped finance the standard gauge railway in addition the government in partnership with the world bank and other development institutions has sponsored the expansion of the country s road network as a result of the government s ongoing efforts we have seen the steady rebalancing of our trade flows with exports gradually increasing in comparison to imports co operation with countries such as the uk and the us has meant that kenya can make use of cutting edge productive technologies to enhance its manufacturing sector with an ever evolving infrastructural background our country is now seeing increased competitiveness of its products continued foreign direct investment into kenya s manufacturing sector as well as infrastructural development is necessary for bolstering the economy only with a strong and competitive economy can we hope to see what uhuru and his government pledged to bring as part of the big four plan as the country continues on its current path set out by the leadership there is no doubt that the goals will be realised the writer is a banker and comments on topical issues
when we hear of political movements in favor of decentralization and secession the word nationalist is often used to describe them we have seen the word used in both the scottish and catalonian secession movements and in the case of brexit sometimes the term is intended to be pejorative but not always when used pejoratively as by the critics of brexit the implication is that the separatists seek to exit a larger political entity for the purposes of increasing isolation throwing up greater barriers to trade and pursuing a more autarkic economic policy in other words we re supposed to believe that efforts at decentralizing political systems leads to states becoming more oppressive and more protectionist but there s a problem with this claim and with connecting protectionist nationalism to decentralization and secession the act of breaking up political bodies into smaller pieces works contrary to the these supposed goals of nationalism that is when a political jurisdiction is broken up into smaller independent units those new units are likely to become more reliant on economic integration and trade not less this dependency increases as the country size becomes smaller if the goals of the nationalists include economic autarky and isolation nationalists will quickly find these goals very hard to achieve indeed this is true for at least three reasons one economic self sufficiency is costly and difficult economic self sufficiency i e autarky has long been a dream of protectionists the idea here is that the population within a given state benefits when the residents of that state can cut themselves off from other states while still maintaining a high standard of living fueled by the false notion that imports represent economic losses for an economy protectionists seek policies that block or minimize the importation of foreign goods large countries can pull this off for a little while for countries with vast agricultural hinterlands large industrial cities and innovative service sectors it is possible to move toward economic reliance on only domestic foodstuff domestic raw materials and domestic industry over time however protectionist states begin to fall behind the rest of the world which is presumably still engaging in international trade it will become increasingly clear that the protectionist states are not keeping up in terms of their standards of living this will have geopolitical implications as well since protectionist countries will become relatively impoverished and relatively less innovative compared to other states protectionist states thus lose relative power both economically and militarily we saw this at work in latin america for instance when it was in the thrall of dependency theory during the mid twentieth century the idea was that countries could become wealthier and more politically independent by reducing trade the strategy failed miserably the process is the same with small countries but the effects of protectionism become more apparent more quickly after all a small country that lacks a diverse economy or a large agricultural sector will quickly find itself running out of food skilled labor and raw materials moreover a small country without close ties to other nations will quickly find itself in a very dangerous geopolitical position perhaps not surprisingly empirical studies have found that small countries tend to be more open to international trade than larger countries and that indeed this is the only way for them to prosper as gary becker noted during the period when new post soviet states were entering the global marketplace small nations are proliferating because economies can prosper by producing niche goods and services for world markets small countries can t offer the world a wide variety of goods and services but they can specialize and offer at least some goods or services for which there is global demand without doing this small states have little hope of raising their standards of living this is why economists enrico spolaore and alberto alesina concluded in 1995 that smaller countries will need more economic integration in order to benefit from independence this all suggests that the need to integrate becomes greater the smaller the state and that the need for economic openness and integration are even greater for microstates the smallest of the small states william esterly and aart kraay found in 1999 for example that in spite of the widely held view that small states suffer from their openness financial openness may help microstates insure against the large shocks they receive this is in part due to the fact that financial openness allows countries to share risks with the rest of the world the impetus for small states to pursue open trade policies exists even in the presence of potentially threatening larger states in his study of how trade is affected by state size stephen krasner notes that small states are likely to opt for openness because the advantages in terms of aggregate income and growth are so great and their political power is bound to be restricted regardless of what they do two smaller countries seek tax competition and tax arbitrage trade isn t the only place where small states look to lessen regulatory burdens and tax burdens smaller states also have a habit of competing with larger states by lowering tax rates as recounted by gideon rachman in the financial times numerous small states were integrating into the european economy in the late 1990s and early 2000s accoridng to rachman small and nimble nations slashed taxes and regulation to attract foreign capital and business the irish set some of the lowest corporation tax rates in europe the balts and slovaks went for flat taxes iceland became an improbable financial centre international capital flooded into the smalls did this mean that smaller states in general at least those with easy access to europe tended to embrace lower tax tax rates the answer appears to be yes in a 2012 study author franto ricka concludes capital tax rates in the eu countries are positively related to their size partly because small countries choose a lower tax on capital than larger countries with which they compete while large states can rely on economies of scale to keep capital from defecting in response to tax increases small states have no such advantage thus small states must be as ricka puts it tougher competitors for scarce capital moreover ricka found that the presence of small countries and the tax competition they created drove down tax rates in the larger countries not surprisingly large states have attempted to pressure small states into raising tax rates and embracing so called tax harmonization in early 2019 for example european commission president jean claude juncker pushed the idea of ending the ability of eu members to veto changes in tax policy so as to make tax rates across eu countries more equal the relatively small states of ireland and hungary have long opposed such efforts malta has vehemently objected as well europe isn t the only place with small states looking to attract capital with low tax rates small island nations in the caribbean also function as tax havens and have earned the ire of the european union s leadership when it comes to tax rates it s the large states and especially unions of large states like the eu that are the drivers behind efforts to raise taxes worldwide the efforts threaten to end the havens offered by smaller states looking to attract capital that would likely ignore small states otherwise three small states actually perform better finally as an added motivation to small states to lower trade barriers and tax rates there is the empirical evidence showing that small states can achieve higher growth rates and higher standards of living through more liberal economic policy economist gary becker in 1998 noted since 1950 real per capita gdp has risen somewhat faster in smaller nations than it has in bigger ones becker concluded that the statistics on actual performance show that dire warnings about the economic price suffered by small nations are not all warranted smallness can be an asset in the division of labor in the modern world where economies are linked through international transactions of the fourteen countries with populations over 100 million only the us and japan are wealthy moreover easterly and kraay write controlling for location smaller states are actually richer than other states in per capita gdp microstates have on average higher income and productivity levels than small states and grow no more slowly than large states the only penalty of smallness being the relatively higher gdp growth rates volatility due to trade exposure nor are the indicators favoring small states based only on numbers like income and productivity nick slater at current affairs observes that tend to live longer out of the top ten countries in terms of life expectancy nine could be considered microstates of these switzerland is a bit of a stretch but its population is still smaller than new york city s it can also be good for your bank account the quality of life in european microstates like luxembourg lichtenstein and san marino is perhaps the highest in the world now this isn t to say that smallness is a foolproof strategy for economic success there s a reason easterly and kraay control for location in their comparisons other research suggests that small and remote countries tend to be uncompetitive but even in africa small states outperformed large states in economic growth according to a 2007 report from the world bank the resilience of small states was likely due to the greater economic flexibility observed in them and thanks to political stability this stability it is believed stemmed in part from the fact that smaller african countries are less ethnically fractionalized unilateralism doesn t mean protectionism all too often opponents of decentralization and secession insist that whenever a region member state or nation is allowed to go its own way it will immediately raise trade barriers raise taxes and forget the benefits of international cooperation yet in recent decades there is scant evidence to suggest that this is a likely outcome in practice it appears far more likely that seceding countries and territories will move away from economic nationalism and toward a more open economy
last fall the third most powerful figure in the u s government house speaker nancy pelosi had a phone call with a man who is undoubtedly one of the most hated people among her base of democratic party supporters the famed consumer advocate and former independent presidential candidate ralph nader their phone call took place as the democrats were preparing to launch a narrowly focused impeachment case against donald trump on the call nader laid out a strategy for attacking trump that he believed could have resulted in his actual removal from office nader who has spent his life working to implement a wide range of consumer and environmental protections argued that it would be a mistake to focus solely on the ukraine phone call instead nader suggested that pelosi orchestrate a public prosecution of trump s crimes against ordinary americans what he called kitchen table issues nader beseeched pelosi to go after trump on issues far more pressing than ukraine to millions of americans regardless of their political affiliation he suggested subpoenaing witnesses who could testify to trump s destruction of life saving consumer protections environmental protections workplace safety protections in his destruction of social safety net protections for children pelosi nader says did not take any of his advice trump s popularity has risen in the aftermath of his acquittal as he continues his victory tour and purges dissidents from his administration as the democratic presidential primary process intensifies the institutional democratic party appears once again to be doing everything in its power to hurt the effort to unseat trump the attempt to purchase the democratic nomination by former new york city mayor michael bloomberg is being aided by a democratic national committee that ran a dirty operation against sen bernie sanders in 2016 nader also believes that the bloomberg candidacy has at its core an effort to block sanders from winning the nomination perhaps by forcing a brokered convention it s armageddon time for the democratic party nader said if bernie wins the election against trump should he get the nomination it has to be a massive surge of voter turnout which will sweep out a lot of the republicans in the congress so he will have a much more receptive congress it will sweep out the corporate democrats in the democratic national committee and it will reorient the democratic party to where it should be which is a party of by and for the people that s why they want to fight him nader joined intercepted to discuss the failed impeachment move against trump and the state of the democratic primary nader ran for president in 2000 2004 and 2008 and throughout his career has been one of the most important voices for justice as well as environment and consumer protections in u s history his latest book written with the consumer advocate mark green is called fake president decoding trump s gaslighting corruption and general bullsh t what follows is the extended transcript of the excerpt of the conversation broadcast on intercepted jeremy scahill ralph nader welcome back to intercepted ralph nader thank you jeremy js so i want to begin with the big picture of this impeachment fiasco that we ve just gone through and while we have trump on his victory tour talking about his acquittal we also have this other phenomenon which is that the corporate elite democratic party is trying to crush bernie sanders s candidacy let s begin with the impeachment and your assessment of the strategy that nancy pelosi and the democrats employed in going after trump rn well i and others beseeched her months ago to go with a strong full hand of impeachable offenses and send it to mcconnell and have them reflect kitchen table issues because she always used to say we need kitchen table issues to increase the polls from 50 or 52 percent for impeachment and removal up higher well that didn t happen we did see that major committee chairs wanted to put a bribery provision in she turned that down they wanted to expand the obstruction in defiance of subpoenas a critical impeachable offense beyond the ukraine matter she turned that down we had congressman john larson put in the congressional record on december 18 12 impeachable offenses of which ukraine was one and the democrats were basically subjected to one person s decision nancy pelosi the house speaker well she gambled and lost badly not only obviously he was acquitted but polls went up for trump which was astounding nobody s really explained that yet so now the question is will the committee chairs whose expanded recommendation to her was rejected will they now come back to her and say round two now round two is quite explicit and quite effective she has stated repeatedly that she thinks trump is a liar a crook a thief and he should be in prison it s a pretty good start she also stated she wants the five committee chairs to continue their investigations into the corruption and wrongdoing and refusal to enforce the laws on behalf of the health safety and economic well being of the people that s the banking committee the oversight committee judiciary committee etc and if they do that they are going to run up against a trump stonewall for further information witnesses which means they re going to be obligated to issue subpoenas which will be defied that is a per se impeachable offense the house went against nixon the third article of impeachment was he defied one subpoena so when trump defies these subpoenas for witnesses and documents speaker pelosi will have to face up to the constitution the constitution does not require her to go to court that s a tutorial that a lot of democrats need to be taught congress s power is plenary they can enforce their own subpoenas even by use of an antiquated tradition of a sheriff and a prison they can enforce their own subpoenas so they can go to the floor no witnesses are needed clean cut trump you defied the subpoenas you defied the essential power of congress without which all other authorities are debilitated if they cannot get information under the constitution from the executive branch how debilitated will be the war power the appropriations power the tax power the confirmation power you defied it you re going to be impeached these subpoenas would be associated with all kinds of kitchen table issues where people have a stake in these impeachments didn t have a stake much in ukraine important as that is it s too remote but they do have a stake in for example his destruction of life saving consumer protections environmental protections workplace safety protections in his destruction of social safety net protections for children js but are those impeachable offenses rn yes they are when they re associated with corruption and treading in other words this isn t just normal deregulation what they re doing now to the epa is stripping it of its capacity to enforce the law they re pushing out scientists they re downgrading other professionals they re cutting budgets without congressional authority and they re run by people who have conflicts of interest and are corrupt some of them have already left like scott pruitt it s the failure to execute the laws that s one of the impeachable offenses in the constitution now if nancy pelosi doesn t do that trump will go all over the country all over his tweets all over the obsequious media with his disparaging nicknames and taunting and gloating i told her in a conversation i had with her three months ago i said nancy you know what he s gonna do he s gonna say nancy pelosi had the majority in the house and she had all these crazy charges and she didn t want to get them through you know why she couldn t get them through because they re all lies they re all fake i did nothing wrong js what did she say to you when you said that rn when you have the president of the united states doing this with essentially no rebuttal the reason why trump stays where he is in the polls is he s a soliloquist he s a slanderist soliloquist with no rebuttal look at the nicknames he gives all these people and they never give many nicknames back the only way you deal with a bully who gives you nicknames like crazy bernie and low iq maxine waters is to give him his own medicine decadent donald draft dodging donald dangerous donald dumb donald low iq donald illiterate donald that s the only way some say well we don t want to get in the mud with him well that s an interesting comment but not when the new york times washington post and all the main media repeat verbatim his nicknames without giving the target of the nicknames any right of reply that s unethical journalism js ralph what did pelosi say to you when you were laying all of this out rn she said several things she said that i want an airtight case and she thinks ukraine is an airtight case number two she thought the public attention span couldn t endure multiple impeachment charges and number three i think she cut a deal with her 12 blue dog democrats who are in swing districts that that was the only thing she was going to bring forward they could have had a national security military sheen about it that insulated them js why did nancy pelosi meet with you given the way that you re to this day vilified by the establishment democratic party for daring to run for president multiple times rn well it wasn t a meeting it was a telephone conversation i think because they re interested in what i have to say i mean i could give them all kinds of strategies to landslide donald trump if they would listen i could show them how to argue their case i m just giving you an example jeremy you ve got some currency in the democratic party now for universal basic income i mean andrew yang most prominently and it s viewed as a giveaway and simply pandering to the people how do you argue universal basic income in addition to alleviating dire poverty in addition to increasing consumer demand for goods and services which stimulates the economy far better than a corporate tax cut well one way is you say hey these corporations have already had universal basic income what do you mean yeah what do you think massive corporate subsidies handouts giveaways and bailouts are they re massive universal basic income giveaways they are not only getting all these taxpayer freebies but they also get trillions of dollars in the last decade of free government research and development which built silicon valley and built the biotech nanotech a lot of the aerospace and pharmaceutical industries that s pretty good universal basic income apart from the tax credits they get for doing the research that companies should be doing anyway in a so called capitalist society so they don t know how to argue full medicare for all i put out 25 ways life in canada because they have single payer full health care compared to life in the united states it isn t just you know a matter of un affordable health insurance it s the removal of anxiety dread and fear it s the situation in canada where you re not afraid to change your jobs because you might lose your health insurance it s a situation where you re not ripped off by inscrutable sheets of computerized billing which total about 350 billion dollars according to professor malcolm sparrow an applied mathematician at harvard imagine one tenth of the entire health expenditure is corporate crime it s crime on medicare crime on medicaid crime on insurance companies because of the billing frauds that they re paying for crime on individual patients and payers they don t know how to argue it that s why once in a while i get through on a phone call js you know you re laying out a much broader strategy for what charges should have been brought against trump and of course criticizing the strategy that they ended up employing but at the same time mitch mcconnell runs that senate with an iron fist it seemed clear from the jump that only romney and maybe one or two others would have jumped ship and in the end it was just romney so is the strategy you re advocating putting forth those charges getting an impeachment on those charges sending it to the senate for trial as a way of educating the public or revealing these crimes because it seems very unlikely in this day and age that more than one or two republicans no matter how much evidence was out there would have jumped ship on trump over the issues you re describing they love that form of deregulation and they seem to not really care at all about the overt corruption that we re witnessing rn not when they re preceded by dozens of highly televised house committee hearings on the misuse of presidential power that is harming in kitchen table manners where people live work and raise their families the american people js but these people aren t watching msnbc c span or cnn i mean fox news is the single most powerful news entity as well as social media and as trump has said he s his own media outlet i mean i see it ralph as part of the problem is there is such low trust in media such low approval ratings of the democrats in congress that it doesn t matter if you hold those hearings given the media landscape today this is not like the 70s where it s every single night on the news it s people are seeking out information they want not seeking out the truth rn wrong analysis js all right correct me rn when you see the kind of witnesses that the house could have brought the kind of empathy that kind of resonance just the way they did when they brought some of those civil servants you have to admit their testimony reached a lot of people fox has its own constituency so the other networks the other cable the social media the newspapers the word of mouth these are very easy abuses by trump to understand unlike the more arcane diplomatic situation with ukraine js right rn and what s really important here is she wanted to tie up the republicans in knots in the senate and she only used one knot she used one finger out of ten that could have been curled into a tough fist with very perceived abuses of the constitution of protective statutes of income preservation and of turning over by trump turning over the u s government to wall street you know how wall street polls jeremy 90 percent of the people when they were asked two three years ago wanted to break up the big banks that s a lot of conservatives wall street over main street it s an unbeatable presentation to get to the american people you get left right combination here let s not subsume our factual imaginations to this polarization it s exaggerated because it s a divide and rule strategy with any broader rebuttal where people work live and raise their families where they all bleed alike from rip offs from being denied health care from usurious interest rates payday loan rackets installment loan rackets rental abuses all that will come out because they re not enforcing the law now remember the committee hearings do not have to be impeachment hearings at all they re just regular investigations so they can range broad far and deep and to watch what trump is doing to make america fail and then when the subpoenas are defied that s when it turns into an impeachable offense after the hearings also they won t be able to in the senate block witnesses they blocked witnesses because people like dershowitz gave them the plausible argument well everything that the democrats say is true about what trump did if it was all true it didn t reach an impeachable offense status so that gave them an out they can t get an out when it deals with all these other impeachable offenses which are violations of different clauses of the u s constitution js ralph how has this strategy that you ve been describing that nancy pelosi did end up implementing in just going very narrowly over the ukraine issue and then trump now on his victory lap how does this impact the broader move at the ballot box to try to defeat donald trump rn it produces slippage by the democrats they ve already acknowledged it in the last two weeks you see the democrats cannot defeat donald trump by themselves because they don t use all the arguments and all the issues there has to be a parallel get out the vote civic initiative in every precinct in every place in those key six or seven swing states now there s a group in kentucky which you may know about called ditch mitch and it started about six months ago it s a pac it is not affiliated with the democratic party its sole purpose is to elaborate mitch mcconnell s horrific record against kentucky interests and kentuckians and get out the vote get out the vote ok so that s the formula there has to be a parallel movement to get out the vote against trump because the democrats are not listening it s almost impossible to get through to tom perez the chairman of the democratic national committee i ve had people who ve run for major office they can t even get his ear much less sit in his office to give them advice when mark green and i just came out with this book fake president which is more than a book to be read it s a book to be used like a resource book by field organizers by activists and mark who you know who s upstanding democrat went to try to see him he couldn t see him couldn t even get an appointment couldn t even get him on the phone i mean you know mark is you know was almost mayor of new york bloomberg beat him with huge money in the last few weeks he s written the two major policy tracks two giant volumes for the democratic party in prior elections and he can t even get through congressman john larson tells me he can t even get through to perez it s very hard to get through to any of these people they think they know it all and what kind of know it all the caution of nancy pelosi has brought her defeat in four out of the five congressional elections 2010 12 14 16 squeezed through in 2018 with the help of progressive candidates but it s not exactly confirmation that her cautious approach is winning for her it illustrated itself in the senate debate recently over the ukraine impeachment articles js you know we have this and it s ongoing this debacle in iowa and it does seem like there was some dirty pool at play there you just talked about tom perez at the same time you have the sort of establishment democratic party and figures like you know he s not so significant in many ways right now but his history is worth reminding people of james carville who was one of the brains behind clinton s ascent to the presidency basically having an aneurysm over the notion that bernie sanders could be the democratic nominee your current assessment of how tom perez the establishment elite of the democratic party are mobilizing against bernie sanders in particular but also against anyone with a truly progressive policy platform rn well the democratic corporate establishment deep in the democratic national committee and the super delegate fiasco imagine nobody elects them but they can tip the balance undermined bernie in 2016 there are strong arguments to say that he did really win iowa and nevada before he landslided hillary in new hampshire but that s the past but they re at it again they have to stop bernie sanders and elizabeth warren because their hegemony is over if one of those people gets elected and they want to continue dialing for corporate dollars they want to continue obama s record setting fundraising from wall street which exceeded his republican opponents imagine he got more money from wall street than john mccain in 2008 he even got more money from romney s venture capital firm so that s the internal struggle this business about socialism that s just a cover but they re willing to immolate themselves this year and let trump win by basically stereotyping any kind of progressive legislation as socialism now for example the argument should be by the progressive democrats look here s what we mean by socialism it s what led the western european countries and canada to a higher standard of living higher equality it means full health insurance it means a living wage it means retirement security it means protecting people from serious erosions of their rights as workers it means the ability to repeal the taft hartley act and reflect majority desires in the retail trades like walmart to join unions and so on but if you want more examples people well let s see the post office that s socialism public drinking water departments all over the country i guess that s social and public libraries i guess that s socialism public electric utilities over 1 000 of them around the country including jacksonville florida how about the tennessee valley authority deep in red state territory you think you can repeal that by conservative voters in tennessee and alabama they d run you out of town so they don t know how to argue this and here s the umbrella argument jeremy look it s a choice between trump s corporate socialism which you cannot dis elect and throw the rascals out because it s wall street controlling washington or democratic socialism where if you don t like it if you don t like law and order to corporate domination of your lives and the corporate state which franklin delano roosevelt called fascism in a message to congress in 1938 you can always throw the rascals out that s the difference and what is corporate socialism it s seizing your tax money and bailing out the crooks in wall street in 2008 with trillions of dollars corporate socialism is shoveling out your hard earned dollars to company subsidies handouts giveaways etc anti market quotas and above all it s taking your money away by giving it to tax breaks for the rich and powerful which creates huge deficits that are going to be paid by your children and your grandchildren instead of putting the trillion and a half dollars of trump s tax cut including cutting his own family s taxes into rebuilding america into rebuilding schools and public transit and water and sewage systems and bridges and highway and airports and ports that s the way you argue it jeremy js what is given your history in electoral politics and the way that you ve been treated by the democratic party establishment if you take that history that you ve lived and then you look at hillary clinton s interventions in this current electoral cycle where they you know the hagiography on hulu just premiered at sundance and she you know this line gets floated that nobody likes bernie you take that and then you look at pete buttigieg coming out of the mckinsey world the sort of consiglieres of capitalism and then you have michael bloomberg just pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into ads i was just recently in puerto rico and watched ad after ad after ad of bloomberg saying he s already rebuilding puerto rico but what is the emerging elite democratic corporate wing of the democratic party strategy in this primary what are they trying to do who are they going to get behind in your assessment rn they have to block as i said bernie sanders they have to block elizabeth warren they have to block universal basic income proposals like andrew yang and basically they like people like joe biden you know he comes out of the corporate state out of the obama world out of the clarence thomas enabler chairman of the senate judiciary committee mistreating anita hill and and he comes out of that they like him and if he falters they ll go for bloomberg because they know he s got a lot of money to go up against the republicans it s just redux it s corporate state democrat redux that is they re almost identical in military and foreign policy with the republicans they re almost identical and booming bigger military budgets and lathering the military industrial complex with whatever they want they re almost identical with avoiding applying law enforcement to wall street their rhetoric is a little different but we talk about the rhetoric in realistic terms rhetoric doesn t really matter politically so what their record is they have never introduced into congress any comprehensive corporate crime enforcement the corporate crime laws are absurd they re obsolete their fines are you know nickels and dimes and they cut the enforcement budgets of all these agencies to begin with so they can t even enforce against fraud on medicare for example 60 billion a year billion with a b they bring back about two three billion that s all they don t have enough prosecutors all that is deliberate all that is part of the rep dem consensus the two party duopoly that stereotypes third parties and when they start seeing an insurgence in their own party they go to work on it behind the scenes tipping close primary elections they go to work on them by slandering them by stereotyping them and the most interesting person emerging here is pete buttigieg because he s coming on almost like a new obama or a new clinton this kind of smooth moderation he s signaling with his fundraising parties with billionaires and millionaires that he s going to be acceptable to them js oh that s my favorite line is when pete buttigieg says hey we have to include the billionaires let s not exclude people let s include people he has the audacity to make that argument and very i don t recall any pushback against that particular line that he keeps deploying when people ask him about the 40 odd billionaires who are financing his campaign rn well bernie obviously pushed back in the recent debates i don t mind billionaires if they support universal basic income or i don t mind billionaires who support the stronger enforcement of corporate crime but his billionaires are basically clinton type billionaires wall street billionaires remember he came out of mckinsey and company that s the essence of the wall street establishment this giant consulting firm js you know at the same time you have i mentioned hillary clinton earlier but hillary clinton also really early on in tulsi gabbard s candidacy for the democratic nomination smearing her as essentially a russian agent tulsi gabbard is of course suing her for defamation now i have a lot of problems with some aspects of tulsi gabbard s history her record her relationship with some very frightening individuals in india some of her positions on gay marriage gay rights that have now shifted and i think she has some questions to answer about some of her positions on syria but it reminds me also of how you were treated and i m wondering what your assessment is of that preemptive strike against tulsi gabbard by hillary clinton to say hey this is the new jill stein this is who the russians have chosen rn well you know she s not gonna do very well at all in the new hampshire primary i think hillary clinton if she continues berating tulsi gabbard s afraid that she ll go independent and so called take away some votes in key states i don t think that s going to happen js she says she won t you know she says she s not going to do that in fact she even rn the more serious attack is the use of the word electability if they can t use the word democratic socialism they use the word electability to marginalize main progressive candidates in the democratic primary now this is basically a symptom of the defeatism of the democratic party how can anybody running for president against this relentless savage sexual predator this constant liar on matters of serious import to the american people separating millions of people from reality into his commercialized fantasy this person who s a bigot and a racist and he follows up with actions reflecting that how can the democrats even raise the issue of trying to find a candidate who s electable against this person that s just a technique to marginalize progressive candidates and they use the words moderate and centrist and leftist and extremist to pursue the same strategy to mainstream their corporate democratic primary candidates for example joe biden is called a moderate joe biden for example has supported wars abroad that are unconstitutional why is that a moderate joe biden has been to toady the big banks why is that a moderate joe biden has supported corporate type policies on consumer bankruptcy limiting them and credit card insurance gouging why is that considered moderate or centrist why is it considered leftist to support universal health insurance and a living wage and cracking down on corporate crime those received enormous results in the polls left right support 65 70 75 80 90 percent why is that considered extreme or leftist because the progressive democrats don t know how to argue their case jeremy they don t know how to argue and now they re so tired going five events a day in the primary flying in that they can t think anymore i ve been through that kind of pressure they can t think anymore their wind up speeches are getting stale they are repeated they re not infused with the kind of new facts and new ranges to open it up they ve got to raise the issue of 300 billion dollars a year from a tiny less than 1 percent tax sales tax on wall street transactions they can say look people you go into a store and you got to pay 6 7 percent on necessities of life how come someone buys 100 million dollars of exxon options or stock and doesn t have to pay a cent see and then you take that 300 billion and you put it back into dealing with student loans wall street basically disenfranchised a whole generation of young americans by collapsing the economy in 2008 and these people are owed that kind of transfer of sales tax for their technical training their student loans they don t open it up as a result the media which follows them it gets jaded they hear the same wind up it s a good wind up but it s too repetitive and it excludes a whole range of factual conditions on the ground that will alert more and more millions of people to say to themselves she s on my side he s on my side and they don t do that therefore they don t generate any news even though they re in the eye of the media during the primary season day after day js we know that there were very dirty tricks played in the 2016 primary by hillary clinton and the dnc against bernie sanders i think iowa the iowa caucus made a lot of sanders supporters believe that that already is happening right now not just the overt kind of war against the sanders and to a lesser extent but still there warren candidacy but if you have a dnc that is willing to rig its own primary what is bernie sanders path not just to winning that nomination but then running a national campaign against a humongous war chest that trump already is amassing rn well he s doing pretty well without our advice huh jeremy it s really quite remarkable js he is but we re only you know we re only at the very beginning of this and i m referencing what they did in 2016 i mean he basically has to fight the dnc and trump simultaneously rn well bernie doesn t like to appear like a sore loser so he doesn t complain in 2016 about what happened in the casinos where votes were counted can you imagine in nevada and in iowa first of all he has to attack the caucus system the caucus system is a form of voter suppression let s face it i mean how many people can take out four or five hours travel to a location stay there at night leave their kids so it s a form of voter suppression js we can barely get people to just go and vote in a poll you know in a normal one person one vote rn just a normal primary like new hampshire so he lost an opportunity after 2016 to go after them although he did change some rules he reduced the number of super delegates which is a way the corporate democrats jab in at the end to tip the close race between their candidates and progressive candidates and now the super delegates only kick in at the democratic national convention on the second round but still they can be decisive and you know the super delegates are members of congress who are democrats and former democratic governors etc they haven t been elected to anything as far as this election is concerned but they can decide the outcome js if sanders does get the nomination what will that mean for the democratic party i mean would it be akin to you know to sort of what the tea party and ultimately trump did to the republican party i m not drawing a comparison between their individual policies or their morality in terms of bernie and trump but in terms of what it does to the party it seems to me like bernie winning would effectively shatter parts of the democratic party for the better like get rid of some of these toxic elements that dominate that party rn i think you re right if bernie wins the election against trump should he get the nomination it has to be a massive surge of voter turnout which will sweep out a lot of the republicans in the congress so he will have a much more receptive congress it will sweep out the corporate democrats in the democratic national committee and it will reorient the democratic party to where it should be which is a party of by and for the people that s why they want to fight him js finally ralph what about the state of third party organizing in this country i mean the last truly successful runs were your runs i mean i think that the you know the green party has been just decimated and i think has made some strategically very unwise decisions in recent campaigns but is there a future for third party organizing in this country given what is happening right now with the ascent of donald trump and the threat of an even more authoritarian second term if the democrats lose rn well two responses and by the way your listeners if they want more of what they ve been hearing and my background they can go to my website nader org if they want to see how a progressive campaign on issues that both parties take off the table they can go to my still open votenader org from the 2008 campaign to see what issues we espoused to have majority support that were taken off the table for even discussion by the democrats and republicans i see two scenarios here for third parties one they proceed as they are proceeding maybe get some more votes to nudge the major party that s closest to their views in the right direction that happened in the 19th century when some of the smaller parties never won a national election but they push the two parties on things like anti slavery the 1840 run by the liberty party and women s suffrage industrial labor farmer parties people s party so that s one scenario a second scenario if the democrats lose to the worst president in history the crudest the most overt disgusting foul mouthed corporate toady who s destroyed the rule of law and constitutional observance if they lose to him i can see the republican party breaking open i can see some reminiscence of the republican party being created in 1850s splitting and replacing the whig party in an era of billionaires who are willing to fund new parties that is not out of range they will call it a new centrist party something the way bloomberg has been talking about and then the third and this is the one the democrats got to be really afraid of a progressive third party with hundreds of millions of dollars in their war chest enough to get five to 10 12 15 percent so this is really armageddon time for the democratic party they ve been losing and losing to the worst republican party in history i mean teddy roosevelt dwight eisenhower senator robert taft would have been aghast at the extreme nature of this republican party the stupidity the ignorance the bigotry the corporatism the self serving enrichments etc they re a mirror of trump which is why they clap for him in the white house and i can see if the democrats lose this one there s going to be a lot of fissure and a lot of splits the civic community in this country environmental consumer workers civil rights civil liberties housing tenant groups are excluded from the electoral arena all you gotta do is look at judy woodruff on pbs the news hour she interviews reporters she doesn t interview leaders who know what you re talking about of civic groups the civic community has got to stop being passive and demand that they have a role in the deliberations and in the media coverage of these campaigns because they know a lot that the candidates don t know they know even a lot more that the reporters don t know and they are the seed corn for american democracy since day one in the 18th century js ralph nader thank you very much for being with us rn thank you jeremy
when we hear of political movements in favor of decentralization and secession the word nationalist is often used to describe them we have seen the word used in both the scottish and catalonian secession movements and in the case of brexit sometimes the term is intended to be pejorative but not always when used pejoratively as by the critics of brexit the implication is that the separatists seek to exit a larger political entity for the purposes of increasing isolation throwing up greater barriers to trade and pursuing a more autarkic economic policy in other words we re supposed to believe that efforts at decentralizing political systems leads to states becoming more oppressive and more protectionist but there s a problem with this claim and with connecting protectionist nationalism to decentralization and secession the act of breaking up political bodies into smaller pieces works contrary to the these supposed goals of nationalism that is when a political jurisdiction is broken up into smaller independent units those new units are likely to become more reliant on economic integration and trade not less this dependency increases as the country size becomes smaller if the goals of the nationalists include economic autarky and isolation nationalists will quickly find these goals very hard to achieve indeed this is true for at least three reasons one economic self sufficiency is costly and difficult economic self sufficiency i e autarky has long been a dream of protectionists the idea here is that the population within a given state benefits when the residents of that state can cut themselves off from other states while still maintaining a high standard of living fueled by the false notion that imports represent economic losses for an economy protectionists seek policies that block or minimize the importation of foreign goods large countries can pull this off for a little while for countries with vast agricultural hinterlands large industrial cities and innovative service sectors it is possible to move toward economic reliance on only domestic foodstuff domestic raw materials and domestic industry over time however protectionist states begin to fall behind the rest of the world which is presumably still engaging in international trade it will become increasingly clear that the protectionist states are not keeping up in terms of their standards of living this will have geopolitical implications as well since protectionist countries will become relatively impoverished and relatively less innovative compared to other states protectionist states thus lose relative power both economically and militarily we saw this at work in latin america for instance when it was in the thrall of dependency theory during the mid twentieth century the idea was that countries could become wealthier and more politically independent by reducing trade the strategy failed miserably the process is the same with small countries but the effects of protectionism become more apparent more quickly after all a small country that lacks a diverse economy or a large agricultural sector will quickly find itself running out of food skilled labor and raw materials moreover a small country without close ties to other nations will quickly find itself in a very dangerous geopolitical position perhaps not surprisingly empirical studies have found that small countries tend to be more open to international trade than larger countries and that indeed this is the only way for them to prosper as gary becker noted during the period when new post soviet states were entering the global marketplace small nations are proliferating because economies can prosper by producing niche goods and services for world markets small countries can t offer the world a wide variety of goods and services but they can specialize and offer at least some goods or services for which there is global demand without doing this small states have little hope of raising their standards of living this is why economists enrico spolaore and alberto alesina concluded in 1995 that smaller countries will need more economic integration in order to benefit from independence this all suggests that the need to integrate becomes greater the smaller the state and that the need for economic openness and integration are even greater for microstates the smallest of the small states william esterly and aart kraay found in 1999 for example that in spite of the widely held view that small states suffer from their openness financial openness may help microstates insure against the large shocks they receive this is in part due to the fact that financial openness allows countries to share risks with the rest of the world the impetus for small states to pursue open trade policies exists even in the presence of potentially threatening larger states in his study of how trade is affected by state size stephen krasner notes that small states are likely to opt for openness because the advantages in terms of aggregate income and growth are so great and their political power is bound to be restricted regardless of what they do two smaller countries seek tax competition and tax arbitrage trade isn t the only place where small states look to lessen regulatory burdens and tax burdens smaller states also have a habit of competing with larger states by lowering tax rates as recounted by gideon rachman in the financial times numerous small states were integrating into the european economy in the late 1990s and early 2000s accoridng to rachman small and nimble nations slashed taxes and regulation to attract foreign capital and business the irish set some of the lowest corporation tax rates in europe the balts and slovaks went for flat taxes iceland became an improbable financial centre international capital flooded into the smalls did this mean that smaller states in general at least those with easy access to europe tended to embrace lower tax tax rates the answer appears to be yes in a 2012 study author franto ricka concludes capital tax rates in the eu countries are positively related to their size partly because small countries choose a lower tax on capital than larger countries with which they compete while large states can rely on economies of scale to keep capital from defecting in response to tax increases small states have no such advantage thus small states must be as ricka puts it tougher competitors for scarce capital moreover ricka found that the presence of small countries and the tax competition they created drove down tax rates in the larger countries not surprisingly large states have attempted to pressure small states into raising tax rates and embracing so called tax harmonization in early 2019 for example european commission president jean claude juncker pushed the idea of ending the ability of eu members to veto changes in tax policy so as to make tax rates across eu countries more equal the relatively small states of ireland and hungary have long opposed such efforts malta has vehemently objected as well europe isn t the only place with small states looking to attract capital with low tax rates small island nations in the caribbean also function as tax havens and have earned the ire of the european union s leadership when it comes to tax rates it s the large states and especially unions of large states like the eu that are the drivers behind efforts to raise taxes worldwide the efforts threaten to end the havens offered by smaller states looking to attract capital that would likely ignore small states otherwise three small states actually perform better finally as an added motivation to small states to lower trade barriers and tax rates there is the empirical evidence showing that small states can achieve higher growth rates and higher standards of living through more liberal economic policy economist gary becker in 1998 noted since 1950 real per capita gdp has risen somewhat faster in smaller nations than it has in bigger ones becker concluded that the statistics on actual performance show that dire warnings about the economic price suffered by small nations are not all warranted smallness can be an asset in the division of labor in the modern world where economies are linked through international transactions of the fourteen countries with populations over 100 million only the us and japan are wealthy moreover easterly and kraay write controlling for location smaller states are actually richer than other states in per capita gdp microstates have on average higher income and productivity levels than small states and grow no more slowly than large states the only penalty of smallness being the relatively higher gdp growth rates volatility due to trade exposure nor are the indicators favoring small states based only on numbers like income and productivity nick slater at current affairs observes that tend to live longer out of the top ten countries in terms of life expectancy nine could be considered microstates of these switzerland is a bit of a stretch but its population is still smaller than new york city s it can also be good for your bank account the quality of life in european microstates like luxembourg lichtenstein and san marino is perhaps the highest in the world now this isn t to say that smallness is a foolproof strategy for economic success there s a reason easterly and kraay control for location in their comparisons other research suggests that small and remote countries tend to be uncompetitive but even in africa small states outperformed large states in economic growth according to a 2007 report from the world bank the resilience of small states was likely due to the greater economic flexibility observed in them and thanks to political stability this stability it is believed stemmed in part from the fact that smaller african countries are less ethnically fractionalized unilateralism doesn t mean protectionism all too often opponents of decentralization and secession insist that whenever a region member state or nation is allowed to go its own way it will immediately raise trade barriers raise taxes and forget the benefits of international cooperation yet in recent decades there is scant evidence to suggest that this is a likely outcome in practice it appears far more likely that seceding countries and territories will move away from economic nationalism and toward a more open economy
by alasdair macleod via goldmoney com zerohedge com sun 02 16 2020 this article posits that the spread of the coronavirus coincides with the downturn in the global credit cycle with potentially catastrophic results at the time of writing analysts are still trying to get to grips with the virus s economic impact and they commonly express the hope that after a month or two everything will return to normal this seems too optimistic the credit crisis was already likely to be severe given the combination of the end of a prolonged expansionary phase of the credit cycle and trade protectionism these were the conditions that led to the wall street crash of 1929 32 given similar credit cycle and trade dynamics today the question to be resolved is how an overvaluation of bonds and equities coupled with escalating monetary inflation will play out this article sees worrying parallels with the collapse of john law s mississippi scheme exactly 300 years ago by tying in the purchasing power of his livres to the value of his mississippi venture law ensured they both collapsed together in the space of only six months the similarities with our keynesian experiment are too great to ignore could a simultaneous collapse of fiat currencies and financial assets happen again if so both the money bubble and financial asset bubble could be fully deflated into worthlessness by this year s end the epidemic ring a ring o roses a pocket full of posies a tishoo a tishoo we all fall down some folk attribute this old nursery rhyme to the plague in england of 1665 but it seems singularly appropriate for coronavirus or covid 19 about which as yet we know little its origin is allegedly a mutation of a virus from a snake bat or pangolin alternatively one school of thought believes it escaped from a biological warfare laboratory in hunan at the time of writing officially the ratio of reported deaths to reported recovered is about 23 which has been declining as time progresses while the fatality rate is expected by western analysts to level out at about 3 5 4 of those infected its spread is probably much more serious than admitted with the chinese being accused of playing the crisis down to be fair it will have been hard for the authorities to keep up with its rapid spread coming during the chinese new year holiday when most factories have closed anyway there is some confusion about the economic impact officially the public holiday ended on 30 january but nearly all factories were still closed a week later and their reopening will be gradual at best not only do chinese factories supply the world with consumer goods but they are integral to global supply chains hyundai in south korea has already been forced to close all its factories due to lack of chinese components and other car makers around the world have expressed similar difficulties for all intents and purposes china is shut and therefore its economy is not functioning and the longer this goes on it is increasingly difficult to see when if ever past normality will return china s experience threatens to be repeated elsewhere in which case the world with closed factories and people severely restricted in their human interactions faces the deepest global economic slump since medieval times when the plague ravished europe ring a ring o roses indeed meanwhile financial assets stand close to all time highs this is undoubtedly due to money and credit being pumped into financial markets at a quickening pace and while bond yields are suppressed by freely available money it seems economic actors prefer not to hold bank deposits relative to the risk of holding equities just when this viral epidemic materialised the financial system was already on life support and at its weakest the credit cycle is due to turn down and the dynamics behind it suggest it could be worse than the lehman crisis which was broadly contained to financial entities and residential property prices this time the banks have accumulated worrying levels of junk debt directly and indirectly through collateralised loan obligations money markets are badly stretched with liquidity having miraculously disappeared central banks are flooding them with new money even before the periodic banking and systemic crisis has occurred but all this extra central bank money achieves is to drive financial asset values even higher it will be a mistake to blame the financial and economic events that follow on the coronavirus but inevitably this is what those who have relied on a failing monetary system will do as to the course of the coronavirus epidemic only time will tell with financial markets already teetering on the edge of a systemic and economic crisis the timing of its emergence could pull the trigger on a global financial and economic collapse the credit cycle and asset inflation we should remind ourselves that the credit cycle which is the manifestation of banking psychology in changes in the availability of credit is on the turn there are three distinct classifications of credit demand affected the non financial economy speculators particularly large hedge funds and governments commentary by financial pundits almost exclusively concerns the non financial economy with monetary policy officially targeting consumer prices and employment the encouragement of banks to lend is part of it by creating an artificial boom banks are further persuaded to increase their lending at suppressed rates leading to a misallocation of capital resources prices of consumer goods then begin to rise and interest rates with them undermining the basis of business calculation sensing increased loan risk the banks begin to restrict the expansion of bank credit which only increases credit risk even more banks begin to panic withdraw revolving credit facilities and consequently they drive the economy into a slump that is a brief summary of the classic credit cycle but it bears little relation to that of today instead of bank credit being predominantly deployed for production it is increasingly taken up by financial intermediaries lending to consumers furthermore consumers have reduced their deferred consumption in the form of savings which in former times were integral to the workings of the credit cycle and despite central bank propaganda about being primarily interested in the non financial economy this sector has become progressively demoted relative to the funding needs for financial speculation in order to maintain asset values and sustain government borrowing today in the us uk and many other developed economies with the exception of pension and insurance funds savings as an economic force have virtually disappeared the majority of consumers are now living pay day to pay day and continually in debt with respect to their current spending predominantly at the expense of ordinary people wealth and real income have been increasingly transferred from productive individuals to governments the banks and their favoured borrowers through monetary debasement the effects of monetary debasement have been concealed by statistical method leaving consumers considerably worse off than slavish followers of government statistics are generally aware the rest here
best of all when you join us today you can lock in both a 250 special member discount that could go away in the near future then we d like to invite you to be among a select group of canadian investors who will get to test drive a historic new investment solution that we believe could help you make 2020 your most profitable year yet all while being able to collect a steady stream of incredibly tax efficient bonus income cheques every few months in amounts like 120 130 and even 945 dear fellow investor i don t know about you but if there s one thing i find incredibly frustrating and occasionally even downright discouraging about trying to grow rich by investing in stocks it s this if you ask 100 of the most successful investors on the planet what the single biggest key to becoming a stock market millionaire is you ll likely get 100 different answers some will tell you to focus all your attention on valuation others believe it s all about management revenue growth return on equity book value or competitive advantages still others say that timing allocation risk management or even technical analysis is the secret you name it and someone out there believes they ve found the one true path to life changing profits frankly it s almost enough to make you want to swear off investing all together and it s precisely why a closed door conversation i was recently a part of here at the motley fool stopped me dead in my tracks and made me completely rethink how i invest my hard earned money more importantly it s also why i asked to be the one who reached out to you today with this special invitation the simple and proven method that supercharged returns and actually reduced risk you see as a longtime follower and employee of the motley fool i ve always believed that buying and holding great companies for the long term is my best bet for turning the cash i have into the wealth and security i ve always wanted for myself and my family and given that you re reading this right now i think it s probably safe to assume you believe the same thing but it wasn t until the conversation i just mentioned that i realized there was one crucial aspect missing from many of the companies i personally own and just how much of an impact this could have on my wealth over time here are a few of my top holdings can you spot the one thing all of these stocks are missing blackberry spin master upwork canada goose lightspeed pos mongodb charlotte s web viemed healthcare yext enwave corporation don t beat yourself up if you haven t spotted it yet but suffice it to say that many of the stocks you own probably lack this crucial return boosting volatility reducing quality as well but don t worry because over the next few minutes i m not only going to lay out exactly what this vital yet often overlooked characteristic is and why it could prove so incredibly important to your and my future financial success but also show you a quick easy and cost effective way to begin harnessing the awesome power of this often overlooked wealth boosting mechanism in your own portfolio and in the process potentially set yourself up to enjoy gains 17x or even 65x higher than regular stock investing all while experiencing less volatility and receiving steady cash payouts along the way first i need to get back to the jaw dropping statistic that made me completely rethink how i invest my money like i said it happened during a recent closed door meeting here at the motley fool global headquarters my colleagues were deep into a discussion about how we could better serve the needs and wants of canadian investors like you when someone mentioned a study they had recently come across from rbc capital markets we pulled it up online to have a look for ourselves and as soon as we did the room fell silent that s because we discovered that between 1986 and 2015 non dividend paying stocks in the s p tsx composite index returned hard working investors like you and me an average compound return of 0 5 per year yes you read that right over a nearly 30 year period those stocks that didn t pay a dividend on average ended up losing money year after year after year as an investor you might find that rather disheartening i know i certainly did at first but hold that thought because there s a major silver lining namely that while those non dividend paying stocks ended up costing investors like you and me money over that time period their dividend paying counterparts would have earned us an average compound return of 9 7 per year if you take the time to put pencil to paper and do the math you ll see that that amounts to an 17x higher return on your money yet incredibly it s only part of the story because not only did dividend payers outperform by a margin of 17 to 1 but they did so with 44 less volatility than non dividend payers you better believe that got my attention and it even inspired me to do a little further research on my own believe it or not what i discovered ended up shocking me even more you see using data from legendary yale economist and nobel laureate robert schiller i calculated that over the past century the s p 500 index in the u s is only up about 900 once you factor in inflation for a long term focused investor like me i found that number to be downright disappointing and i ll bet you will too but then i ran a few more calculations and discovered this were you to have simply reinvested your dividends over that time period your return would have skyrocketed to an amazing 58 623 that s a 65x difference as of 01 09 17 i don t know about you but that s all the proof i need of just how important dividends are to successful long term investing not to mention how essential they may be to helping investors like you and me reach even our loftiest financial goals i mean just imagine what would you do if you knew you could boost your investment returns by 17x or even 65x would you build your dream vacation home in cottage country or finally get that new luxury car you ve had your eye on for so long perhaps you d treat your family to a long vacation somewhere exotic like tanzania or thailand or spend your winters sailing around the caribbean on your own boat or heck maybe even just retire a few years early so you could kick back and do nothing at all for a change they re all exciting ideas to be sure and i hear my friends and colleagues talking about them all the time as for me i d probably just rest a little easier knowing that my wife and family would be well taken care of should anything ever happen to me frankly it s also why i wanted to be the one who reached out to you with this special invitation today on that note please allow me to properly introduce myself my name is jared george and like you i m a hard working investor who s always on the lookout for ways to grow the cash i have into the wealth i want mostly just so that i can help set my family up for a lifetime of comfort and security but if i m being honest also so that i can make some of my own lifelong dreams come true too like owning my own boutique cafe one day which is why i jumped at the chance to come work at a company like the motley fool where i could not only earn money but also discover the very best ways to put that money to work for me and i have to say after taking the time to really dig and do some research on the wealth building power of dividends i ve begun to completely rethink how i m going to invest my money going forward my guess is after reading this you may want to too of course what i ve shown you so far have all just been historical returns and when it comes to investing there are simply no guarantees plus let s face it finding great companies that can both grow the underlying value of your investment and pay a steady and possibly even increasing dividend over time is no easy task especially not if you have a family and full time job like i do and i imagine you may as well worse if you re not careful you could wind up buying a dividend payer that looks rock solid one day and sinks like a stone the next i ve seen it happen time and time again with my own eyes investors get lured into buying a flavour of the week stock sporting an eye popping yield and they do so without really putting in all the time and effort it takes to properly vet a stock then before they know it not only are they not getting anywhere near the dividend payouts they signed up for or any payouts at all but they also wake up one day to discover that the underlying stock has completely tanked as well take these now infamous u s dividend payers for instance annaly capital management nyse nly in the summer of 2011 this once ultra popular mortgage reit traded at well over 18 per share share and for a brief time yielded an incredible 25 but then rising interest rates became a major concern and before long both the company s share price and its dividend payout had both been more than cut in half dryships nasdaq drys in november of 2008 this dry goods bulk shipper was yielding as much as 18 and its shares were trading above 23 per share but then a massive global recession and subsequent market meltdown hit resulting in dryships ultimately having to suspend its dividend altogether and causing its shares to sink over 90 transocean nyse rig in 2014 shares of this deep water drilling specialist traded as high as 48 per share and at one point yielded as much as 15 but investors who weren t paying close enough attention to why that yield was so high or didn t fully appreciate the impact sinking oil prices would have on the company were forced to sit by and watch shares fall all the way under 10 per share and the dividend disappear entirely as of 01 16 17 and then of course there s the case of the well known canadian company bombardier tsx bbd b as you may well know this plane and train manufacturer paid a steady dividend for over seven years and often yielded north of 3 before mounting struggles and the sudden departure of its ceo forced it to cancel its dividend altogether in 2015 not to mention caused its shares to promptly nosedive and then continue to languish for years to come granted even the best investors out there occasionally have some losers in their portfolios but you and i both know that if you really want to reach your loftiest financial goals you simply must avoid dividend disasters like these at all costs and with so many uncertainties looming on the horizon today about everything from rising interest rates to the health of the global economy to the geopolitical landscape it may seem harder than ever to navigate the complicated world of successful dividend investing which is why in just a moment i ll give you the chance to claim a copy of a brand new special report we just put together called 5 warning signs of a dangerous dividend this report is a 29 value but i ll show you how to claim a free copy just ahead it s also why i wasn t particularly surprised when in that very same meeting i mentioned earlier it was announced that a whopping 98 9 of motley fool canada readers and premium members like you said they wanted more guidance on which dividend stocks to buy and when of course whenever we have data that so strongly suggests our members are seeking new and different services we do our very best to help them out ever since we walked out of that eye opening meeting everyone here at motley fool canada has been working tirelessly to develop a dividend focused premium investment service that can help lead anyone from a timid beginner to a seasoned pro to what we believe to be the absolute best dividend paying stocks the canadian markets have to offer with a minimum amount of time and effort required on your part we call this unique new solution dividend investor canada and it s headed up by an all star team of highly experienced foolish investors including motley fool canada s chief

canada like that you won t even have to wait a single day after joining us to begin loading your portfolio up with what our team believes to be the very best and most promising dividend stocks the market has to offer that s because the instant you accept this invitation you ll get immediate access to the 42 stocks the dividend investor canada team has recommended so far already beating the market since the service first launched in 2017 which actually brings up an important point while the dividend investor canada team has plenty of experience investing both inside and outside canada the stocks they officially recommend for this service will only be canadian based dividend payers why is that well the simple answer is we re not only seeking to lead you to investments with higher returns and lower volatility but also those that may be the most tax efficient for you but the more thorough answer is that as us based corporate dividends flow across the border into our non rrsp canadian investment accounts uncle sam steps in and takes a 15 slice and once this rather significant withholding tax is considered you ll see why the team has chosen to only focus on canadian based dividend payers for their official scorecard however rest assured that even though the team will only officially be recommending canadian based stocks they ll still always be looking to keep you informed about the very best dividend opportunities that come across their radar be it foreign or domestic these may simply come in the form of weekly updates special one off bonus reports which of course you ll be given priority access to completely free of charge or even as part of our exclusive monthly dividend examiner feature which the team will provide you with each fourth thursday of the month of course this is just one of the many valuable members only perks you ll enjoy when you join us today but i think it s one of the most interesting and useful that s because the team will provide you with an in depth yet easy to follow breakdown of one specific dividend stock where they ll closely and thoroughly examine both its current dividend paying ability and its future dividend growth potential you can think of this as the investment world equivalent of an expert scouting report on your favourite nhl superstar or up and coming junior prospect occasionally dividend examiner will focus on a stock that the team has already added to the scorecard but other times it may focus on well known and widely held dividend payers they think could be in real trouble given the fortune destroying dividend disasters i outlined above i m sure you can see why i think this could prove particularly valuable either way it s one members only perk you ll never want to miss and it actually brings us to another of dividend investor canada s most intriguing and most unique features why our wild cards could be so incredibly helpful legendary investor and self made multi billionaire warren buffett once said that there were only two rules to successful investing rule no 1 never lose money rule no 2 never forget rule no 1 yet many investors spend so much time focusing on which stocks to buy that there s no time left over to focus on which stocks to avoid and that can have some truly devastating consequences as we discussed earlier that s right from time to time the team will be identifying a single dividend stock they think you shouldn t buy and giving you their full rationale behind what makes this the kind of dividend payer you may want to avoid at all costs personally i can t wait to see which stock they select and if i might hold it in my portfolio and if it s not a stock to avoid at all costs the team could recommend anything from their favourite u s based dividend payer to their favourite small cap dividend payer to their favourite thinly traded dividend payer you ll just have to go ahead and join us to find out and given that you ve read this far i can only assume you re giving it some real thought in which case i d remind you that when you join us today you re not only entitled to a 250 special member discount but also free access to 5 warning signs of a dangerous dividend how to find great dividend stocks and tax facts dividend tax considerations every canadian should know a 87 value plus you ll be fully protected by our 30 day 100 membership fee

zimbabwe is buffeted by lack of cohesion lack of strategic planning buffeted by inconsistencies incapacitation to deal with the current problems and as we speak we have a serious crisis emanating from policy problems the bottom line is our country is in a state of paralympic and the obligation to institutional reforms is in a bad state honestly for the past three years the government awarded a tender to sakunda holdings to bankroll the government on command agriculture and zimbabwe government spend almost 9 billion usd and today we read headlines government to import maize from uganda is this true who would believe such a bizarre where over 9 billion is spent on a non existing project what happened to command agriculture what happened to the 5 9 billion released by the treasury between 2017 2018 no receipt or voucher and today the same person is now in the process of importing maize from uganda i think it is important for the government to give an update review on what happened to the 9 billion usd before any talk on importing maize with 9 billion we could have imported maize that could have lasted for the next 20 years or even more with grain in stock for reserve public accounts committee chaired by tendai biti who is also the lawmaker for harare east made apparent several attempts to have tagwirei summoned before the committee and his efforts have been fruitless not even a single official from sakunda has reported to parliament for public appearance this is where the problem of policy inconsistency comes in when someone receives money from the treasury and he is failing to account over 9 billion united states dollars usd this is the same person who has been contracted to purchase government vehicles amounting to over 500 million usd we have dema project which is lying idle the government of zimbabwe lost over 1 3 billion which went into the drainage without any trace we have procurement of fuel amounting to over 900 million usd we have

person can buy such properties vast of land grabbing almost all state projects without proper investment laws mining policy x taxation laws not even a single deal has been declared public and the nature surrounding all these deals have been made public my simple question is who owns zimbabwe is the state captured or we have a serious policy crisis a few years ago we had a head of state who owned over 13 farms mines properties within and outside the country and this was only made public after his death what about those who are in charge of the current instruments of power some have

one farm lest he had over 13 farms around the country the fact remains the same our country has been looted and it is dry what is the role of the opposition what is the role of civil society in all this mess what is the role of researchers and policy makers in zimbabwe not even a single has the parliament of zimbabwe discussed the nature of all these days muthuli ncube who is responsible for the

treasuries in the near future what about the future generation of this country one of the key projects is the construction of the new parliament in mt hampden this project is good but how much did it

las cruces sun news these letters appeared in the feb 16 print edition of the las cruces sun news cowboy up and kick him out as a young kid in the 40 s and 50 s except for a few soldiers and aviators from wwii there were not many folks i could identify as heroes the big exception was the cowboy every saturday i would take my 10 cents and head to one of two theaters in our small town and take in a western or two my heroes were gene autry roy rogers hopalong cassidy col tim mccoy and a few others the cowboy was one you could look up to an honest no nonsense man that could be trusted cowboys could spot an imitation a pretender a person that could not be trusted the cowboy was the kind of guy you wanted to know wanted for a friend and wanted to be his sidekick the cowboy defended his ranch his town his territory and the american way it s with this in mind that i have been shocked recently to learn of an organization known as cowboys for trump yes there are numerous problems in this country mostly caused by our politicians those on both sides of the major parties politicians who are more concerned about party and pocketbook than doing what is right for this country and adhering to the constitution trump is an unethical self centered draft dodging racist sexist lying moron men like him in history are named mussolini chavez mugabe and hitler successful businessman ha he started life with a silver spoon and hasn t done much better numerous bankruptcies have followed him he s nothing but a landlord would you trust him with your business not one major corporation would hire him come on cowboys there are better men than trump find a hero we can all support i want to see a stetson on the head of a hero in the white house not a loser us army ret harry c mccaffrey retired us army independent las cruces redraw school districts this is an open letter to the lcps school board i have recently seen the enrollment numbers for our 4 local public high schools and was shocked to see the disparity full disclosure my sons graduated from mayfield high school in 2005 and 2010 so i do have an allegiance to the school and feel as though my sons received a high quality education there at the time my sons attended mhs there was quite a bit of overcrowding with approximately 2 500 students attending classes my understanding is that now there are less than 1 400 students and the projections are for that number to continue to drop as the city moves eastward the other 3 high schools have somewhere around 2 000 students each i understand that the students in the elks club area are bused to centennial when mayfield and on ate where they used to attend are so much closer to their residences this ridiculous idea has to be wasting taxpayer dollars this is a problem that is imminently fixable our lcps school board needs to redraw the boundary lines and even up the numbers in the 4 high schools and do it before the next school year begins any student who is going to be a senior should be able to attend their current high school everyone else should attend the school in their district subject to the magnet situations already in existence the low numbers at mayfield negatively affect students in academic and sports related activities with the current enrollment disparity mayfield students are at a great competitive disadvantage this is a situation caused by the lcps school board and one which they can fix if they have the guts to do so dave hooker las cruces stop double taxing social security in new mexico taxing social security benefits undermines the purpose of the social security act which was designed to lift seniors out of poverty not to fund state government social security should always be exempt from state taxes as

during the oil industry s boom while enforcement had all but disappeared in its first year the lujan grisham administration and the legislature have begun to turn things around and to strengthen the ability of regulatory agencies to protect public health and the environment however those agencies need more funding to effectively oversee oil and gas operations and protect all new mexicans from oil and gas pollution the legislature has an opportunity and a responsibility this month to adequately fund energy and environment agencies after years of budget cuts those agencies need new staffing and resources to ensure oil and gas operations are safe and responsible a recent report from the groundwater protection council showed new mexico s oil conservation division experienced a five fold increase in oil and gas permitting applications while contending with staff losses of 40 to 60 percent it described ocd as being in a near crisis situation due to financial and staffing constraints

pinos altos distortions about the economy trump and his supporters claim the economy is booming for everyone they constantly tout stock market indexes and the low unemployment rate actually most american families earn their income from wages and there has not been meaningful wage growth in 50 years most of the benefits of this economy have gone to the top 10 percent especially the top 1 percent about 84 percent of american stocks are owned by the top 10 percent the unemployment rate does not measure those people who have dropped out of the work force or part time workers who want to have full time work work force participation has dropped several thousand since the great recession in 2009 10 economic mobility is very difficult today for two main reasons lack of training in needed skills and high cost of housing in urban centers other developed countries like canada western europe japan and australia provide retraining programs for people who lose their jobs in fields where there is demand like health electricians plumbers mechanics computer specialists etc not in the u s we cut corporate and high earners taxes hoping it will trickle down never has and never will if minimum wage had kept up with inflation it would be at least 22 an hour today a father and mother with two children each working for 10 to 13 an hour without benefits are barely keeping their heads above water and have difficulty satisfying basic needs like housing food transportation and child care forget about health care and setting aside money for college education and retirement now imagine

the central bank of ireland has forecast that gdp will grow by 4 8pc in 2020 which leaves the political parties facing tough choices the result of the 2020 general election was at the front and centre of investors minds this week with the share prices of irish banks home builders and even government bonds hit by the uncertainty the key concern was that sinn féin s success will put it on a more equal footing in talks to form the next coalition government and if it sticks to some of its policies ireland s gdp growth and health of the public finances could be hurt however it is worth remembering radical policy changes in parties manifestos more often than not struggle to make it into programmes for government which inevitably require compromise sinn féin s success appears to have come as a surprise to it as much as anyone else so identifying where sinn féin s true red lines are is exceptionally difficult previous episodes suggest nothing is sacred in 2011 labour ran on promises to burn bondholders re negotiate the eu imf programme and rule out tax rises for those earning less than 100 000 none of these promises came to fruition sinn féin s only record in government is in northern ireland a period which included the stormont house agreement a deal to allow an independent corporate tax rate in return for spending cuts back in 2016 eliminating the universal social charge was flavour of the month a goal the state clearly couldn t afford but still made it into several parties manifestos the central bank of ireland published its new forecasts for gdp to grow by 4 8pc in 2020 last week reminding the political parties the economy is operating close to full capacity this unpopular message means difficult choices have to be made throwing public money at health or housing is now more likely to be inflationary rather than succeeding in addressing voters concerns suffice to say not a message that resonated during the election boxing them in many will have despaired at the auction politics on offer during the election however beneath the surface there has been some improvement in the tenor of the debate election promises were boxed in by the department of finance s conservative economic projections building in a slowdown in the economy a 2bn safety margin for oecd corporate tax reforms and accounting for demographic pressures on spending and pre committed capital expenditure in broad terms fianna fáil and fine gael s policies are similar using the 11bn fiscal space to implement a four to one ratio of spending increases to tax cuts sinn féin stood out signalling it would spend around 15bn financed by tax increases on higher earners and companies but also by running smaller budget surpluses so at least the parties fiscal plans now add up a modest improvement on previous elections the initiatives to help improve public scrutiny of the public finances are bearing some dividend between boston and berlin it isn t often understood that ireland s tax benefit system is among the most redistributive in the developed world this means income taxes for average or low incomes are among the lowest in the oecd but rise above the oecd average for higher incomes this is exceptional those who argue for greater public service provision along the lines of the nordic model rarely acknowledge this would involve asking those on low incomes to pay more tax hence the political parties have not yet determined whether ireland is truly closer to boston or berlin leaving us somewhere in the middle of the atlantic close to where the titanic sank this is precisely what happened during the celtic tiger era true the construction sector and banks were to blame but the fiscal crisis also reflected an unsustainable bubble in public sector pay and current spending while politicians revelled in narrowing the tax base lifting thousands of workers out of the tax net the 2020 election campaign served up similar fare here sinn féin was to the fore advocating sharp income tax rises above 100 000 substantial increases in employers prsi and other business taxes the proposals would make ireland even more reliant on the multinational sector and the highly skilled workers it employs a risky strategy not only for the public finances but also ireland s broader growth strategy however fine gael s policy of raising the higher rate threshold to 50 000 should also raises eyebrows with fianna fáil more modest in their commitments social housing empty promises perhaps the most ridiculous auction politics on offer during the election were on social housing fianna fáil s commitment to build 50 000 social and affordable homes was quickly usurped by fine gael at 60 000 sinn féin blew the competition out of the water with 6 5bn of our money promised to build 100 000 new social housing units by 2025 these ambitious plans have been set in the context of a construction sector which managed to build only 21 000 houses both public and private in 2019 construction sector wages are already rising with clear evidence of capacity constraints and skill shortages the damage from last cycle hasn t been repaired for example cso national accounts shows the value of machinery and equipment held by construction sector firms was valued at 3 2bn in 2018 down 60pc in real terms from a decade ago clearly enormous investment will be needed in construction not only to deliver demand for private housing but also social housing it may also be necessary to free up the work permit regime to allow construction workers from non eu countries however there was little discussion of how to build capacity within the construction sector during the campaign merely lavish spending promises of course there is the suggestion the ó cualann model which has so far delivered a negligible number of houses can be quickly scaled up to deliver sinn féin s targets for social housing even if and it s a big if sufficient public land could be found there simply isn t sufficient capacity in the construction sector to deliver 100 000 homes by 2025 would need public procurement of social housing to outbid first time buyers incentivising construction firms to move away from private residential development this would not only be highly inflationary but not sustainable politically there are myriad reasons why local authorities have been slow to manage public land and facilitate social housing perhaps a lack of accountability expertise inertia ideological opposition lengthy procurement processes and nimbyism are all at play i m not sure what the true answer is but the land development agency is surely a positive development providing co ordination between local authorities and semi state bodies and is slowly getting results are there any other bright ideas speaking on morning ireland this week lorcan sirr said the next minister for housing would have to be more like vladimir putin to face down resistance to new housing policies however i am still reminded of those who say a michael o leary type figure should be put in charge of the hse talented as he may be i suspect he would flounder unable to overcome independent minded hospitals trade unions and vested interests with limited ability to hire and fire and allocate resources where they are needed ultimately tough talk is just that and does not form a coherent plan to overcome the complex factors often related to local government which have held back both private and public housing delivery conall mac coille is chief economist at davy

insurance because it s too expensive she was among several voters who told the associated press on saturday they made bernie sanders their first pick and elizabeth warren second judd says the candidate who wins the democratic nomination will get her vote in november and she says she understands why some democrats believe the party is better off with more of a mainstream nominee but the 33 year old who lives in a valley north of reno says she needed to cast her ballot for someone who is serious about tackling the cost of health insurance which she says rivals her housing costs jennifer

hong kong cnn if it weren t for the novel coronavirus outbreak xu mingxi would have been in class at a prestigious new york university this week instead the 22 year old has spent the past three weeks confined to his family s apartment in wuhan the chinese city at the center of the outbreak which is currently on lockdown to prevent the virus spreading but even if xu could leave home the united states where he s studied for the past four and a half years won t let him in over 1 000 kilometers 620 miles away in beijing alex who asked not to use her real name for fear of online retribution is in a similar situation she s spent the past two weeks at home with her mom and grandpa being delivered groceries by community leaders she s worried she won t be able to fly to sydney to study later this month and may have to delay her law degree by a semester as novel coronavirus spreads over 60 countries have imposed travel restrictions on chinese citizens hoping to limit their exposure to the virus that has killed more than 1 600 people almost all in mainland china and infected over 68 000 worldwide both australia and the us have put temporary bans on foreign nationals who visited china in the 14 days prior to their arrival that has locked xu and alex out of their studies and they are by no means alone in 2017 an estimated 900 000 chinese tertiary students studied abroad around half of those went to either the united states or australia contributing billions of dollars to their economies money that those countries now stand to lose it is not clear how many of the 360 000 chinese students studying in the us were outside the country when the us travel ban hit on january 31 shortly before many universities were due to resume but when australia imposed its restrictions at the start of february authorities estimated that 56 of chinese students about 106 680 people were still abroad term was due to begin in late february or early march for australia it couldn t have come at a worse time it s exactly the time of the year in which people are coming from china to australia said andrew norton a professor in the practice of higher education policy at the australian national university the virus outbreak coincided with the lunar new year the most important holiday in the chinese calendar when many students go home to see their family a city on lockdown at first it was just a normal holiday period for xu catching up with friends in wuhan and eating food the coronavirus outbreak didn t seem like a huge issue timeline how events unfolded december 8 the first patient of wuhan coronavirus developed symptoms december 31 the first cases reported to the world health organization january 1 the market in wuhan where the outbreak is believed to have started shuts down for disinfection january 8 chinese scientists identify the pathogen as a new strain of coronavirus january 23 authorities put wuhan into partial lockdown january 31 us announces it will deny entry to foreign nationals who have traveled in china in the last 14 days february 1 australia bans all travellers entering from mainland china source cnn reporting xu wore a mask and avoided the area around the seafood market linked to the outbreak which is only a few kilometers from his house then on january 23 the night before he was set to fly back to new york wuhan authorities announced they were locking down the city there was still time to leave but xu decided not to go he thought he would be safer inside wuhan and that the lockdown wouldn t last long on january 27 his graduate program in interactive telecommunications at new york university nyu restarted on january 31 the us government announced it wouldn t let any foreign nationals flying from mainland china into the country xu was told he could take classes remotely but to him it wasn t worth paying 62 000 per year in course fees for distance learning he decided to take a break this semester that will delay his graduation by six months the situation in australia the university of sydney where alex studies is making allowances for chinese students those affected by coronavirus travel bans can study remotely start their semester a few weeks late or defer their degree alex will defer this semester if she hasn t been able to fly back by mid march she pays about 45 000 australian dollars 30 280 each year more than local students who are eligible for reduced fees when australia imposed its travel ban on february 1 it was effective immediately while the who has advised against such measures australian prime minister scott morrison said our medical advice is it s in the interest of australians to do so at the time there were 80 chinese people in transit including 47 students australian border force commissioner michael outram told the abc that 18 decided to go back to china while the others were put into self isolation for 14 days this was a very difficult situation for the students of course we recognize that outram said they were caught between you know an epidemic in china and coming to australia and having issues raised with their visas a man walks on an empty street in wuhan china on february 13 2020 getty images getty images asiapac getty images david a 24 year old studying engineering at the university of sydney who has been in self imposed quarantine at his home in southern guangdong province for weeks said the australian government s actions made him feel completely neglected i m a taxpayer i do my part in society i ve donated blood said david who asked not to use his real name for fear that his comments could hurt his chance of getting an australian visa after all the things i ve done you still consider me not part of your society the logistical problems created by the virus are not short term issues universities will need to work out how to accommodate the backlog of students like xu and alex who have been delayed as well as students who would have taken those courses anyway and some universities just won t have capacity norton said protesters hold placards during a rally against an inbound travel ban on foreign travellers from china in sydney on february 7 2020 bianca de marchi epa efe shutterstock what this means for the universities if thousands of students are forced to forgo this semester universities in australia and the united states stand to lose billions of dollars in australia 23 3 of universities total revenue came from international students in 2017 and chinese students made up over 38 of all international enrollments in 2018 in total international education contributed 37 6 billion australian dollars 25 billion to the australian economy in the 2018 2019 financial year in the us chinese students contributed 14 9 billion to the us economy in 2018 according to government data norton the professor of higher education policy at the australian national university believes that most chinese students in australia will need to delay their study by at least a trimester or semester that means that in the short term universities in australia face an estimated 2 to 3 billion australian dollar cash flow hit from students who can t make it to class he said the government realizes this will have huge economic costs that effect them as well as the universities and tourism providers he said in the us there had already been weakening demand from chinese students partly due to tensions on american campuses amid the ongoing trade war said rahul choudaha a us based analyst of international student trends and a visiting scholar at the center for studies in higher education at uc berkeley it s kind of a very unexpected unwanted undesirable speed bump he said it s also an issue facing universities outside of the united states and australia south korea for instance has around 70 000 chinese students at its universities the new semester kicks off in march but already many universities have opted to delay the start of semester by two weeks to accommodate students living in cities on lockdown a man wears a protective mask as he walks in wuhan on february 13 2020 getty images getty images asiapac getty images anger at chinese people the coronavirus crisis struck at a time when hostile debates over chinese communist party influence on australian and us campuses were already complicating life for chinese students overseas chinese students have been accused of stealing american secrets to diminish us influence especially as the trade war between china and american rages in australia politicians have raised concern over whether the chinese influence on campus is limiting free speech for chinese people in australia and the us that public debate has sometimes been alienating now the coronavirus outbreak has prompted more anti chinese sentiment while stuck at home alex has been taken by the different reactions to the outbreak on china s heavily controlled internet and the internet beyond the so called great firewall in china there are messages of support for wuhan but internationally she s seen anger directed at chinese people it s waves and waves of hate she said pointing to online commentators who argued that chinese people deserved the outbreak because they eat bat something that has not been linked to the outbreak i felt misunderstood i felt abandoned i felt i don t matter alex says that on her social media feeds the situation has been turned into a chinese versus australian dichotomy when really it s about the virus versus people she s afraid that when she gets back to australia she could be the target of racial abuse people who look chinese are paying the price just because other people are scared she said economic hit already experts are predicting that the economic hit of the coronavirus could be much more significant than the sars epidemic in 2003 if china s economy is struggling chinese parents may have less money to spend on educating their children overseas david believes that the perceived animosity toward chinese students in australia may result in students opting to go elsewhere when parents are looking at which country to send their children they don t just look at the quality of education but also at how welcoming and stable a society is he says as the quality of china s own universities continues to improve staying at home could also become a more attractive proposition said choudah the higher education analyst a few days ago a fellow chinese national asked alex whether she would recommend studying law in australia alex answered honestly she s torn studying abroad can be a positive experience she said but it also carries the risk of racial abuse especially now that people of asian origin are viewed with suspicion as the virus spreads xu isn t worried about negative reactions when he is finally able to go back to new york after all as a wuhan native he now faces potential discrimination within china too

bernie sanders laced into billionaire former new york mayor michael bloomberg at a democratic party dinner in las vegas while bloomberg was campaigning in virginia sanders rattled off a list of bloomberg heresies against the democratic party implementing racist policies like stop and frisk in new york opposing the minimum wage or higher taxes on the wealthy during the obama administration the simple truth is that mayor bloomberg with all his money will not create the kind of excitement and energy we need to have the voter turnout we must have to defeat donald trump sanders said it was a rare attack by name from sanders bloomberg is skipping the nevada caucuses and did not go to the clark county democratic party dinner where sanders and other 2020 contenders spoke at a saturday campaign event in virgina bloomberg told a crowd of more than 900 that he s running a campaign focused on defeating president donald trump and that to win in november we absolutely have to win this commonwealth i am running to defeat donald trump and i am running to restore honor to our country to build a country that we re proud of and to start getting things done to start putting the word united back in the united states of america he said 9 10 p m former vice president joe biden delivered a fiery speech at the clark county democratic party gala a week before the nevada presidential preference caucuses as he drew sharp distinctions with bernie sanders on guns and healthcare biden didn t call sanders name saturday night as he stood in a casino ballroom and recalled the worst mass shooting in modern american history that occurred several hundred yards away in 2017 then the former vice president alluded to the sanders senate vote for a 2005 law that gave gun manufacturers immunity from civil lawsuits related to gun violence it s a horrible horrible decision biden said asking the audience to imagine big tobacco having legal immunity he recalled meeting parents of children killed in school shootings i will not rest until they re able to sue the gun manufacturers he said biden later turned to health care again without naming sanders biden repeated a recent argument from the power culinary union that a single payer medicare for all system would eliminate union members health coverage won through collective bargaining biden touted his idea to add a public option to existing health insurance markets 5 10 p m some nevada democrats who made bernie sanders their first choice in the state s early caucus voting say they think he has a better chance of being elected president now than he did in 2016 solana kline of reno says she supported sanders last time too but didn t think he could win so she opted for hillary clinton because she was more mainstream kline says the whole political climate has changed since then and sanders vs donald trump would be viewed more as good vs evil clinton carried nevada in 2016 but sanders won in washoe county which includes reno and sparks brian feeney says sanders has more support and is better positioned to win this time around the 42 year old behavioral analyst who works with children with autism at the university of nevada reno says he may consider the green party candidate if sanders isn t the democratic nominee margaret hines of reno also backed clinton in 2016 but says sanders is inspiring voters to take back their power from leaders in washington she doesn t think vanilla is going to do it this time 4 15 p m paul kiser is among the nevadans who had the candidates electability on their minds when they cast their early ballots saturday ahead of the feb 22 presidential caucus the 62 year old retiree from reno says he settled on pete buttigieg because he s progressive but reasonable kiser backed hillary clinton in 2016 and plans to support the candidate who wins the democratic nomination but he isn t sure bernie sanders appeals to a broad enough spectrum of voters to beat president trump and doesn t think elizabeth warren has proven she s viable he says joe biden represents too much of the party s old guard randall chicola says it came down to a coin flip when he listed sanders first and warren second the 33 year old graduate student at the university of nevada reno says those who dismiss the progressives ignore the fact that a right wing extremist is president chicola says republicans don t bat an eye at spending 1 trillion on tax cuts but claim that spending money on health care or lowering student debt is extreme 3 30 p m a number of early caucus voters in northern nevada said health care was their top priority when they decided which democrat to put on the top of their ballot lindsy judd says her family currently has no health insurance because it s too expensive she was among several voters who told the associated press on saturday they made bernie sanders their first pick and elizabeth warren second judd says the candidate who wins the democratic nomination will get her vote in november and she says she understands why some democrats believe the party is better off with more of a mainstream nominee but the 33 year old who lives in a valley north of reno says she needed to cast her ballot for someone who is serious about tackling the cost of health insurance which she says rivals her housing costs jennifer cole a 48 year old librarian from reno listed health care and housing as her two top issues when she settled on warren as her favorite she put pete buttigieg second and amy klobuchar third on her ballot 1 40 p m early caucus goers in nevada waited more than an hour in line outside an afl cio union office precinct site in a las vegas suburb on saturday for their chance to fill in paper ballots for a democratic challenger to president donald trump a retired chicago municipal worker charlene wortman said the wait was worth it to try to save democracy the 71 year old woman said she wanted to see parity for health care before she died with more than 100 people in line and just two volunteers working to sign in voters at the door some asked precinct captain matt kimball if they could help kimball was busy and upbeat

powerful union in las vegas is the culinary union it s not going to endorse before next saturday s caucuses in nevada but biden believes he has strong appeal with rank and file members because of his

as predicted in this space back in december phase one of the bloomberg 2020 media coronation is well underway the former mayor of new york city has spent years funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to non profits cultural institutions the academy and political candidates now it has paid off with a bumper crop of endorsements in the process he has collapsed former vice president biden s support in the african american community in south carolina over just several news cycles yet the so called news coverage of bloomberg s rise to presidential candidate has largely been vacuous horserace punditry and on trump and bloomberg tweeting at each other what i have yet to see is the talking heads debating whether great wealth on the scale of the fortunes of bloomberg and trump should disqualify one from holding our nation s highest public office uperiority and closeness to a higher transcendent power conversely being poor has always been seen as a sign of moral defect in america how else do you explain the way we criminalize the homeless or how we throw people in prison for being behind on paying their medical bills as recently documented by propublica historically our government was the place the population turned to for protection against the predations of the slave masters and the robber barons yet in the 21st century there s a growing clamor to hand the oval office over to a cyber oligarch like bloomberg as if he were an antidote to the last billionaire the media machine foisted on us the media has consoled itself that donald trump s abusive gyrations are merely a function of his unique eccentric personality without examining how a lifelong fixation on wealth could be the manifestation of a pathology that pathology has had severe repercussions for the nation and the world it is very possible based on his behavior that michael bloomberg who has accumulated tens of billions of dollars more than trump suffers the same pathology could it be that vast wealth accumulation on the scale we are talking about is itself a manifestation of the malignant narcissism that s plaguing the current occupant of the white house really in order to make that much money off of other people s labor by giving people less and taking more for yourself you have to lose compassion for those other people to accumulate more and more said dr harriet fraad a psychotherapist and host of the podcast capitalism hits home faith family and america s future what happens to billionaires is that they are no longer earning to buy this or that have this or that or even to be free of economic worry and anxiety they are motivated to accumulate more and more for themselves which becomes for them winning as mayor bloomberg exhibited a unique capacity to be utterly detached from the human misery in his vicinity you may not have a feel for it unless you were on the streets of new york city like i was working for wnyc during those bloomberg years in neighborhoods of color it was like apartheid the nypd went from inflicting around 80 000 stop and frisks in 2002 bloomberg s first year to 685 700 by 2011 after massive protests the city relinquished its racist policy slightly and the number of stop and frisks went down a mere 532 900 the next year in 2013 u s district court shira scheindlin ruled the practice as executed by the nypd as unconstitutional the phrase stop frisk is an benign sounding white liberal euphemism for the process of shoving innocent young men of color against a wall and patting down or worse these random encounters driven by an actual quota system escalated into police sanctioned assaults the jailing of innocent people lost scholarships lost jobs and broken lives the scale of bloomberg s policy and the social and physical harm it reaped deserves its own reparation committee a little reported aftermath of stop and frisk during mayor mike s tenure settling civil suits related to police misconduct cost city taxpayers 1 billion dollars it was a loser policy all the way around for the young people of color victimized for the taxpayers the criminal justice system and even the police themselves mayor bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street said new york city police benevolent association president pat lynch after bloomberg s first apology back in november we said in the early 2000s that the quota driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities lynch went on to say bloomberg s misguided policy inspired an anti police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence but even as bloomberg was pressing stop and frisk in communities of color he was block and tackling for his pals over on wall street who were in the midst of pillaging main street and mlk blvd ironically it is the hyper anxiety over winning that has so many voters traumatized by the prospect of four more years of trump suspending their critical faculties and overlooking bloomberg s very real electoral vulnerabilities they are reflexively turning to bloomberg as a sure bet to beat the don in november as children lost in the forest of tyranny they figure mayor mike will be their daddy warbucks who will save them from the orange menace hence they push back when i raise the issue about mike bloomberg s failure to disclose his taxes for 12 years while he was mayor and his cynical ploy of applying for a extension on his legally required federal election commission disclosure forms until after super tuesday you wouldn t find anything if he did disclose said a news media executive working as a consultant for bloomberg 2020 another journalist not on the bloomberg payroll but an elizabeth warren backer worried any deep press inquiry of the former mayor would help the don s re election what bloomberg apologists don t get is that it is not just about what one might find in those tax filings it s about a candidate having the humility to submit themselves for inspection to the voters out of respect for them in the introduction to the re issuing of his book trump nation the art of being the donald journalist and top bloomberg advisor tim o brien described trump s base he has won the allegiance of a voting bloc that mainstream political media and business institutions overlooked for the better part of a decade working class post industrial americans thrown to the ground by the forces of economic globalization and the long uprooting of the 2008 financial crisis o brien s timeline is off by a couple of decades or more the elites were oblivious to the circumstances of the american people for much longer than that since the 1970s the american working class has been robbed of meaningful wage growth which was substituted with household debt at the same time the billionaire class captured our politics at the state and national level and flipped the script on taxation so that financiers and the super rich paid less in taxes than the majority of the country that earned their daily bread by the sweat of their brow and while generation after generation of americans fought and died for our country the bi partisan succession of global free traders reagan bush clinton bush obama helped american multinationals betray the heartland and abandon her cities and all of this was subsidized by our tax code and an ever expanding military that made the world safe for the spawning of the global corporate behemoths that successfully played the world s nations off of each other it s this globalization of wealth and debt that has made mike bloomberg one of the world s wealthiest men and he s running now to protect that pyramid he sits atop the psycho social wounds from several million foreclosures and 20 trillion in household wealth stolen by mayor mike s wall street pals endures even though trump s tenure has only accelerated wealth inequality there s a public and media narrative he s delivered for his people and it would not take a media genius to tie mayor mike to wall street s unprosecuted crime wave what s the one tool they all needed as they foreclosed on america and played tax dodgeball in the caymans while buying our politics that s right their ever handy bloomberg terminal which according bloomberg professional services is a global icon sitting on the desks of 325 000 of the world s most influential decision makers that gives these titans of finance real time pricing to make a killing on their assets so mayor mike is going to save the planet but he needs more time on his forms early on in the bloomberg launch there was some push back from the neoliberal crowd when nina turner a national co chair for senator bernie sanders described bloomberg as an oligarch maybe after binge watching rachel maddow for years most democrats think oligarchs can only be russians who are friends with putin

upcoming free trade agreements fta are viewed mainly as opportunities to expand foreign direct investment fdi economists said ser percival k peña reyes an economist at ateneo de manila university said in an interview that an fta with south korea will help strengthen the government s infrastructure program i think an fta would benefit us in tourism in investments especially in infrastructure we re undergoing build build build and who has a lot of resources to spend south korea has a lot of know how on infrastructure south korea last year pledged 355 million to support green infrastructure in southeast asia the country also committed 1 billion in 2018 to help fund philippine infrastructure projects he said south korea tends to favor investing in singapore and malaysia if they really want a new industrial policy they should invest in all of southeast asia he said university of asia and the pacific economist and former tariff commissioner george n manzano said securing export access requires investment the primary motive would be to secure export access to markets particularly large markets he said but added that the agreements increase the comfort level of partner countries and make the philippines more attractive to fdi the philippines this year is taking on new free trade agreements ftas including the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep among southeast asian countries and their major trade partners amid continued negotiations with south korea trade talks with the united states may be delayed following the termination of the visiting forces agreement the conclusion of rcep talks which was expected at the asean summit in bangkok last year was delayed to 2020 after resistance from india the thai government said in november that the signing is expected to take place this month the economists said ftas improve resilience in the face of geopolitical shifts with mr manzano saying that the agreements increase certainty in light of changes in the world economy an fta assures you of continued access to a partner s economy mr manzano said describing the agreements as insurance policies fta insulates a partner country in the sense that the tariff concessions negotiated before would have to be respected regardless of economic conditions mr peña reyes said global trade tensions and the introduction of artificial intelligence threatens the country s main revenue sources remittances and outsourcing we cannot just be relying on these sources for consumption he said we need to find a way to attract more fdi the long term stake used to build capital goods mr manzano said that agreements like the rcep may have an incremental effect on exports as the country already enjoys market access to many of the countries in the partnership industries also face risks as the philippines allows more imports mr manzano said it is possible some part of the agriculture sector may be subject to more competition from the us challenging the government to improve competitiveness both economists said that opportunities and risks are in the details industries will discover how they will fare only after the details of the agreements are released but they are concerned about whether the philippines makes full use of the concessions and opportunities made available in the agreements it s not automatic that just because you joined it you ll benefit mr peña reyes said jenina p ibañez
the latest on the 2020 presidential campaign all times local 5 10 p m some nevada democrats who made bernie sanders their first choice in the state s early caucus voting say they think he has a better chance of being elected president now than he did in 2016 solano kline of reno says she supported sanders last time too but didn t think he could win so she opted for hillary clinton because she was more mainstream kline says the whole political climate has changed since then and sanders vs donald trump would be viewed more as good vs evil clinton carried nevada in 2016 but sanders won in washoe county which includes reno and sparks brian feeney says sanders has more support and is better positioned to win this time around the 42 year old behavioral analyst who works with children with autism at the university of nevada reno says he may consider the green party candidate if sanders isn t the democratic nominee margaret hines of reno also backed clinton in 2016 but says sanders is inspiring voters to take back their power from leaders in washington she doesn t think vanilla is going to do it this time 4 15 p m paul kiser is among the nevadans who had the candidates electability on their minds when they cast their early ballots saturday ahead of the feb 22 presidential caucus the 62 year old retiree from reno says he settled on pete buttigieg because he s progressive but reasonable kiser backed hillary clinton in 2016 and plans to support the candidate who wins the democratic nomination but he isn t sure bernie sanders appeals to a broad enough spectrum of voters to beat president trump and doesn t think elizabeth warren has proven she s viable he says joe biden represents too much of the party s old guard randall chicola says it came down to a coin flip when he listed sanders first and warren second the 33 year old graduate student at the university of nevada reno says those who dismiss the progressives ignore the fact that a right wing extremist is president chicola says republicans don t bat an eye at spending 1 trillion on tax cuts but claim that spending money on health care or lowering student debt is extreme 3 30 p m a number of early caucus voters in northern nevada said health care was their top priority when they decided which democrat to put on the top of their ballot lindsy judd says her family currently has no health insurance because it s too expensive she was among several voters who told the associated press on saturday they made bernie sanders their first pick and elizabeth warren second judd says the candidate who wins the democratic nomination will get her vote in november and she says she understands why some democrats believe the party is better off with more of a mainstream nominee but the 33 year old who lives in a valley north of reno says she needed to cast her ballot for someone who is serious about tackling the cost of health insurance which she says rivals her housing costs jennifer cole a 48 year old librarian from reno listed health care and housing as her two top issues when she settled on warren as her favorite she put pete buttigieg second and amy klobuchar third on her ballot 1 40 p m early caucus goers in nevada waited more than an hour in line outside an afl cio union office precinct site in a las vegas suburb on saturday for their chance to fill in paper ballots for a democratic challenger to president donald trump a retired chicago municipal worker charlene wortman said the wait was worth it to try to save democracy the 71 year old woman said she wanted to see parity for health care before she died with more than 100 people in line and just two volunteers working to sign in voters at the door some asked precinct captain matt kimball if they could help kimball was busy and upbeat but told the volunteers they had to have training in line on a sunny comfortable winter day sisters kathylan tilley of las vegas and maurine amie of henderson said they

marked himself as uncommitted as he cast an early vote ballot in nevada s caucuses on saturday reid so far has decided not to endorse in the democratic presidential race he tells reporters outside a caucus site at an east las vegas library that he didn t cast his vote for any candidate in particular because he has so many friends running for president and he admires the work they re all doing he says nevada s caucuses will be a breath of fresh air after what he calls the debacle with iowa s caucuses the leadoff contest the new hampshire primary was last tuesday nevada s caucuses are next saturday ___ 12 05 p m the democratic national committee has set its qualifying thresholds for the feb 25 debate in south carolina and for the second time in a row the party is setting rules that would provide former new york city mayor mike bloomberg with a path to the stage candidates can qualify based on either polling requirements or delegate thresholds from previous state nominating contests but candidates don t have to meet both on polling candidates must reach 10 support in at least four national polls or some combination of four polls taken nationally and in south carolina they also could qualify by reaching 12 in just two south carolina polls any qualifying polls must be released publicly between feb 4 and feb 24 candidates also could qualify if they ve earned a delegate in any previous contest from iowa and new hampshire that qualifies pete buttigieg bernie sanders joe biden amy klobuchar and elizabeth warren bloomberg is skipping the four early states so has no delegates but the billionaire businessman is approaching the polling thresholds the rules are patterned after those that the party s chairman tom perez already announced for wednesday s debate in nevada perez took some heat for dropping as a requirement having a minimum number of grassroots donors bloomberg isn t raising any money and is relying on his personal fortune and never could have qualified under such rules but perez also has gotten pressure from some campaigns that want bloomberg on the debate stage to face the same scrutiny that other candidates have endured for months bloomberg hasn t yet qualified for the nevada debate there s a tuesday deadline to meet the requirements ___ 12 p m does democratic presidential candidate joe biden think he needs to win nevada s caucuses next saturday his answer is that he has to do well in order to mount a comeback for the race for the 2020 nomination after back of the pack finishes in iowa and new hampshire biden is in las vegas and he spoke to about 100 campaign volunteers gathered at a middle school gym for a latino organizing event after the event reporters asked him whether he has to win the caucuses he said no i don t think i have to but i think we have a shot at winning biden finished a disappointing fourth in iowa and fifth in new hampshire that puts considerable pressure on him in nevada and especially south carolina he says the two states more diverse electorates are better for him than the overwhelmingly white makeup of iowa and new hampshire ___ 11 40 a m democratic presidential candidate joe biden is criticizing president donald trump s immigration policies and rhetoric on immigration biden is in las vegas where he s drawing a roar from about 100 campaign volunteers gathered at a middle school gym for a latino organizing event the former vice president says everybody knows how donald trump is we gotta let him know who we are biden is leaning heavily on the minority populations in nevada and the upcoming south carolina primary as his springboard back into contention in the 2020 primary he s thanking the volunteers emphasizing the importance of the latino vote and promoting his relationships with labor unions one powerful union in las vegas is the culinary union it s not going to endorse before next saturday s caucuses in nevada but biden believes he has strong appeal with

finish their education and would benefit the economy she doesn t think every billionaire would go along with the so called wealth tax warren says billionaires have gone on tv and cried others have run

headed into 2020 the combination of the sino us trade truce and a dovish fed set the stage for the dollar to extend declines logged in the fourth quarter providing a fillip to the reflation trade and bolstering global growth in the process or at least that was the thinking for some market participants but you know what they say about the best laid plans the narrative made sense the â phase oneâ trade deal and dozens of rate cuts from central banks around the world ostensibly laid the groundwork for the global economy to play catch up to donald trumpâ s maga machine as the economic performance gap between the us and the rest of the world closed one pillar of dollar strength would crack meanwhile the fed all but promised to persist in messaging that suggested the bar for rate hikes is impossibly high while the bar for additional cuts is fairly low fast forward nearly two months into 2020 and the greenback is on pace for its best start to a calendar year in half a decade thereâ s no mystery here the coronavirus outbreak suggested the global economy was on the verge of succumbing to an â out of the frying pan and into the fireâ dynamic no sooner had the trade war abated than a new threat to growth and commerce emerged because it seems highly likely that the economic fallout from the virus will disproportionately affect ex us economies the assumption now is that us economic outperformance will continue leaving one of the key pillars of dollar strength intact heisenberg meanwhile the necessity of policy easing in other locales to offset the assumed deleterious effects of the virus means the monetary policy divergence between the us and its global counterparts could widen anew even if the fed continues to deliver dovish forward guidance for evidence of that look no further than the euro fxe which is sitting near the lowest levels in years after a string of disappointing data suggested the blocâ s economy was stumbling even before the epidemic began to spread across china the euro area economy barely expanded in q4 data out late last month showed growth decelerated to a minuscule 0 1 pace qoq less than the 0 2 the market was looking for marking the worst quarter in nearly seven years france and italy unexpectedly contracted heisenberg in germany the situation is dire indeed â for the euro area in particular the virus shock may extend the streak of weaker than expected activity data raising questions about whether a durable recovery has actually taken hold â goldmanâ s zach pandl said thursday â apart from benefiting from its status of a safe haven the dollar is also supported by the ongoing expansion of the us economy â rabobankâ s piotr matys wrote this week adding that recent data has seemingly â confirmed that the us continues to outpace its g10 peers in terms of economic activity itâ s worth noting the bloomberg dollar index broke above the downside trendline that capped gains since october constructive technical signal may embolden the usd bulls â this dynamic is at the heart of some arguments for why the fed will ultimately be forced to keep easing perhaps until they hit the lower bound if they donâ t a stubbornly strong greenback will simply import the worldâ s disinflationary impulse at a time when a trio of fed cuts has already failed to reinvigorate inflation expectations heisenberg adapted from deutsche bank s stuart sparks haven demand for usd assets amid the wuhan outbreak only exacerbates the situation this is potentially bad news for global growth folks as discussed at length recently by deutsche bank s aleksandar kocic the current setup is conducive to catalyzing bull flattening in the us curve which only amplifies the disinflationary signal to markets heisenberg previously any negative correlation between the dollar and the curve was due primarily to bear flattening and bull steepening as a stronger economy raised the odds of tighter fed policy stronger dollar and vice versa weaker dollar as short rates fall in anticipation of easier policy now that mode has changed as deutsche bank wrote this week the interaction between the dollar and the curve slope is now â a result of persistent dollar strength and its dampening effect on inflation expectations â for their part goldman suggests the impact on global growth from the virus will be â 10 times as large as a major us hurricane â and when it comes to the disruptions to work in china the fallout from the epidemic is set to approximate â the entire us workforce taking an unplanned break for two months â a stronger dollar will be both a symptom and an aggravating factor in all of this creating a non virtuous loop something invesco asset managementâ s arnab das reiterated at a conference in miami recently â when the fed shifted gears to easing and cutting rates all it really did was open the door for everybody else to either cut rates or increase the size of balance sheets or both â he remarked â so the interest rate differential monetary policy differential balance sheet differential arguments in favor of a weaker dollar havenâ t worked either those issues are still going to be there for some time to come this is a great time to recall something socgenâ s kit juckes said back in december before anyone was worried about a pandemic â the worldâ s a nicer place when the dollarâ s on the back foot â
speech national s economic plan for 2020 global situation the world is an uncertain and difficult place right now more uncertain and difficult than it has been for some while trade wars and geopolitics define the relationship between china and the united states and threaten our economic stability and our ability to sell new zealand to the world recent tensions in the middle east have seen our friends across the western world call for cooler heads to prevail but the threat to security and stability in the region remains just across the tasman our friends are experiencing devastating bush fires which will have impacts for them for us and our economy and coronavirus is both a global health emergency and an economically significant event more and more serious the longer it continues new zealand is by no means immune but our growth has begun slowing before we even start with these international factors new zealanders are doing it tougher facing more tax cost and red tape our economy is slowing and as a result new zealanders are worse off at a time of global uncertainty when international events have direct impacts on our way of life we cannot underestimate the need for a strong economy led by a competent government with a track record of delivering to protect and buffer us by most measures we should be doing much better our commodity prices are high and our terms of trade are near the best they have ever been from our primary sector through to our technology and innovative sectors new zealand should be booming and the envy of the world advertisement scroll to continue reading we should be a confident aspirational nation that is ready to tackle the global challenges head on and succeed in short we should be in a much better situation relative to global uncertainties and headwinds the question i m asking jacinda ardern is why aren t we the economy because jacinda ardern s government has failed to deliver on its promises has piled on the tax cost and red tape made things more uncertain domestically at a time of global uncertainty and as a result new zealand has become a country of lost opportunities the economy is all about its people the workers the business owners the self employed the volunteers and the retirees they deserve a government that does what it says it will that delivers with certainty and removes barriers and burdens like tax cost and red tape three years ago our economy was growing at nearly four per cent a year and we are now almost half of that and falling we have slipped to the seventh lowest gdp per capita growth in the oecd we are behind countries like chile hungary poland latvia estonia lithuania spain and even greece yes i said seventh lowest spot when we slip so far down the chain it s having a real impact on you and your family particularly as we move into global turbulence the protection isn t there just the tax cost red tape and uncertainty this all means it s harder to get ahead it means that promotion or a pay rise might take longer to get it s harder for you and your family to plan for the future and to save indeed for increasing numbers it s harder to even pay the next bill and stay afloat in short back pockets are shrinking it s harder to get ahead under jacinda ardern in fact right now someone on the average wage in new zealand is almost 4000 a year worse off thanks to jacinda ardern s government the median rent is up 2600 a year because of the government s added taxes and regulations on landlords higher petrol taxes have made it 200 a year more expensive for the typical person to fill up their car and cancelled tax cuts have cost the average earner over 1000 a year under the last national government your after tax income grew twice as fast as australia yet under jacinda ardern s nz they ve grown slower than australia in comparison if our gdp per capita were as good as australia s the average kiwi would be 35 per cent richer that doesn t happen by accident it doesn t take a country the size of australia to achieve it it happens when you have a strong economy focussed on you led by a competent government with a track record of delivering as economic development minister and associate finance minister i saw how real this is whereas two years ago companies were taking on new staff to keep up with demand they re now laying people off because they don t have the workers and more often than was the case the work either and the government has piled tax cost and red tape so the risk isn t worth the reward for businesses the government s own data shows this job growth has dropped from the 10 000 new jobs a month under national to less than 1000 a month in less than two years jacinda ardern s government has taken 15 years of projected surpluses and taken us into deficit and i hate to tell you the bad news but once a labour government is in deficit it doesn t get back to surplus all of this matters because it affects you and your back pocket it s about your financial security and making sure you can look after your families in good times and bad it s about you being able to live without worrying about the next bill or paying for your next tank of petrol or your next shopping trolley it s about ensuring the future you dream of for your family becomes a reality it s about building the roads and the public transport that gets you home on time at night it s about schools and hospitals having the resources they need to teach your children and take care of your family it s about police having the resources to deal with gangs and serious crime so you and your family are safe it s about business feeling confident to take you on and give you a shot and then a pay rise it s about getting up in the morning and seeing new zealand ambitious and confident about itself again i will not accept this is as good as it gets we should be doing much better hopes and wishes are one thing but kiwis deserve certainty and a government that gets things done national s focus is simple and resolute 1 we will keep taxes and red tape low and grow incomes to help with your cost of living 2 we will be responsible managers of the economy 3 we will focus on growing the economy for all 4 we will invest more in core public services like health and education 5 finally we will create more jobs and opportunities for all new zealanders to do this today i am announcing five key measures that i want the sixth national government s first term to be measured by they are things that matter to kiwis because they impact us in our everyday lives 1 new zealand s economic growth is back to at least three per cent per annum 2 new zealand s growth rate per person is in the top half of the oecd 3 we are reducing the after tax income gap with australia 4 more new zealanders feel they can reach their potential at home rather than overseas 5 we have revived business confidence so that businesses feel like they can take more risks and create opportunities for you and your family ultimately it is what we will do that counts the most over the next few months i will be announcing our comprehensive economic plan the five major planks to it are five packages on 1 tax relief 2 regulation reduction 3 infrastructure 4 small business 5 families most of these won t surprise you for instance on tax we have already announced our plans to index tax brackets to the cost of living repeal the auckland fuel tax and introduce no new taxes but we recognise we need to do more we will announce our full tax plan that will see people on the average wage better off and keeping more of what they earn people on the average wage shouldn t be paying almost 33 per cent in the dollar on regulation you can t pile more regulation red tape and more tax and cost onto business like jacinda ardern s government has and expect new zealand to succeed we have already promised to cut red tape and regulation we will light a regulations bonfire in our first six months of government and cut two regulations for every new one we create but we recognise we need to do more on infrastructure we not only need to build the roads to get you and your family home on time but invest in the social infrastructure our country needs in world class hospitals and schools we won t be afraid to use the private sector to partner with government to deliver projects that matter to us all that means we can deliver more roads more rail more transport and more social infrastructure faster and better we will have new thinking on infrastructure and you will see a clear vision and plan from us of how we see new zealand unlike labour we won t flip flop we believe in infrastructure and have the competence and track record to do what we say we will to actually deliver on small business we have already promised to repeal employment law changes that this government has made and restore 90 day trials to all businesses but your back pocket is hurting just as much as our families are and we need to something about that as well finally on family incomes and cost of living tax relief is one part of how your family can get ahead we know we need to do more we need to raise incomes and get people into jobs and we need to attack the cost of living we need to stop rents rising because of bad government policy petrol going through the roof because of more taxes and levies and that a surprise bill doesn t come at your expense on your next supermarket shop if we do all of this not only will new zealand be in a better position but you and your family will be too you ll be better protected and buffered from international uncertainties with more money in your pocket i firmly believe we can do this but it s in stark contrast to what s happening right now when i hear about the company in hawke s bay who are locking their tools up and laying off workers because the pipeline of infrastructure projects has dried up that means less pay fewer jobs and it means it s less likely you ll get home on time through to the mum of a new born in kawarau who for the first time in her life had to go to the foodbank to get help because jacinda ardern s government has raised taxes costs and red tape and ripped money out from your back pocket she s not the only one demand for emergency grants has spiralled because people can t fill their trolleys like they used to city missions are saying demand now is much worse than it ever used to be there is a clear choice this election between a government that has stumbled its way into deficit and debacle and has us badly positioned because of the tax cost red tape and uncertainty as the world becomes more uncertain and difficult and national who has a plan and track record of getting new zealand back on track creating financial stability for you and your family and building a brighter future i firmly believe new zealand s best days lie ahead of us i know those tradies being laid off in hawke s bay can help build the infrastructure we need to grow new zealand and create opportunities the mum of the new born wants to be able to not only fill her trolley but create the financial stability and dignity for her and her family that comes with a strong economy one that creates opportunities for her baby and her family she shouldn t have to make the choice between groceries or shoes she should be making the choice of how many after school activities she wants to sign her child up to there are tens if not hundreds of thousands of kiwis up and down new zealand who are worse off because jacinda ardern s government has left them behind we are a better country than these past two years we are better than this conclusion national s view is that the 2020s should be new zealand s decade it should be a time where our kids go to the best schools in the world where we build the world class infrastructure and create more opportunities for new zealanders where we live in one of the safest countries in the world and we have the money to invest where it really matters to you and your family when i look forward to 2030 when my oldest son emlyn will turn 18 and be preparing to take on the world on his own i want new zealand to be a place where he and all of his classmates have every opportunity to succeed to be world beaters this government is a failed experiment a failed experiment is fine when you re in high school science not when you re running the country so now is our chance this election is the most important in a generation new zealand can be better much better our ambition as a country can never be too great for what we need to achieve because five million new zealanders need a government that will put them and their families at the heart of everything we do global uncertainties and headwinds need not hold us back as a nation if we have the leadership with the track record competence plan and ambition to see it through all we have to do is choose this i want to be a prime minister who delivers a strong growing economy world class public services infrastructure that gets you and your family home on time safety from gangs and serious crime and a country that is once again ambitious and aspirational about its future and ready to tackle the challenges of the 2020s head on scoop media

as predicted in this space back in december phase one of the bloomberg 2020 media coronation is well underway the former mayor of new york city has spent years funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to non profits cultural institutions the academy and political candidates now it has paid off with a bumper crop of endorsements in the process he has collapsed former vice president biden s support in the african american community in south carolina over just several news cycles yet the so called news coverage of bloomberg s rise to presidential candidate has largely been vacuous horserace punditry and on trump and bloomberg tweeting at each other what i have yet to see is the talking heads debating whether great wealth on the scale of the fortunes of bloomberg and trump should disqualify one from holding our nation s highest public office the pro side might argue american culture is defined by gluttony avarice excess and the luxury of having it all so why shouldn t our leaders even our key spiritual beliefs rooted in our protestant work ethic and calvinist worldview see the accumulation of great wealth as a sign of inherent moral superiority and closeness to a higher transcendent power conversely being poor has always been seen as a sign of moral defect in america how else do you explain the way we criminalize the homeless or how we throw people in prison for being behind on paying their medical bills as recently documented by propublica historically our government was the place the population turned to for protection against the predations of the slave masters and the robber barons yet in the 21st century there s a growing clamor to hand the oval office over to a cyber oligarch like bloomberg as if he were an antidote to the last billionaire the media machine foisted on us the media has consoled itself that donald trump s abusive gyrations are merely a function of his unique eccentric personality without examining how a lifelong fixation on wealth could be the manifestation of a pathology that pathology has had severe repercussions for the nation and the world it is very possible based on his behavior that michael bloomberg who has accumulated tens of billions of dollars more than trump suffers the same pathology could it be that vast wealth accumulation on the scale we are talking about is itself a manifestation of the malignant narcissism that s plaguing the current occupant of the white house really in order to make that much money off of other people s labor by giving people less and taking more for yourself you have to lose compassion for those other people to accumulate more and more said dr harriet fraad a psychotherapist and host of the podcast capitalism hits home faith family and america s future what happens to billionaires is that they are no longer earning to buy this or that have this or that or even to be free of economic worry and anxiety they are motivated to accumulate more and more for themselves which becomes for them winning as mayor bloomberg exhibited a unique capacity to be utterly detached from the human misery in his vicinity you may not have a feel for it unless you were on the streets of new york city like i was working for wnyc during those bloomberg years in neighborhoods of color it was like apartheid the nypd went from inflicting around 80 000 stop and frisks in 2002 bloomberg s first year to 685 700 by 2011 after massive protests the city relinquished its racist policy slightly and the number of stop and frisks went down a mere 532 900 the next year in 2013 u s district court shira scheindlin ruled the practice as executed by the nypd as unconstitutional the phrase stop frisk is an benign sounding white liberal euphemism for the process of shoving innocent young men of color against a wall and patting down or worse these random encounters driven by an actual quota system escalated into police sanctioned assaults the jailing of innocent people lost scholarships lost jobs and broken lives the scale of bloomberg s policy and the social and physical harm it reaped deserves its own reparation committee a little reported aftermath of stop and frisk during mayor mike s tenure settling civil suits related to police misconduct cost city taxpayers 1 billion dollars it was a loser policy all the way around for the young people of color victimized for the taxpayers the criminal justice system and even the police themselves mayor bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street said new york city police benevolent association president pat lynch after bloomberg s first apology back in november we said in the early 2000s that the quota driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities lynch went on to say bloomberg s misguided policy inspired an anti police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence but even as bloomberg was pressing stop and frisk in communities of color he was block and tackling for his pals over on wall street who were in the midst of pillaging main street and mlk blvd ironically it is the hyper anxiety over winning that has so many voters traumatized by the prospect of four more years of trump suspending their critical faculties and overlooking bloomberg s very real electoral vulnerabilities they are reflexively turning to bloomberg as a sure bet to beat the don in november as children lost in the forest of tyranny they figure mayor mike will be their daddy warbucks who will save them from the orange menace hence they push back when i raise the issue about mike bloomberg s failure to disclose his taxes for 12 years while he was mayor and his cynical ploy of applying for a extension on his legally required federal election commission disclosure forms until after super tuesday you wouldn t find anything if he did disclose said a news media executive working as a consultant for bloomberg 2020 another journalist not on the bloomberg payroll but an elizabeth warren backer worried any deep press inquiry of the former mayor would help the don s re election what bloomberg apologists don t get is that it is not just about what one might find in those tax filings it s about a candidate having the humility to submit themselves for inspection to the voters out of respect for them in the introduction to the re issuing of his book trump nation the art of being the donald journalist and top bloomberg advisor tim o brien described trump s base he has won the allegiance of a voting bloc that mainstream political media and business institutions overlooked for the better part of a decade working class post industrial americans thrown to the ground by the forces of economic globalization and the long uprooting of the 2008 financial crisis o brien s timeline is off by a couple of decades or more the elites were oblivious to the circumstances of the american people for much longer than that since the 1970s the american working class has been robbed of meaningful wage growth which was substituted with household debt at the same time the billionaire class captured our politics at the state and national level and flipped the script on taxation so that financiers and the super rich paid less in taxes than the majority of the country that earned their daily bread by the sweat of their brow and while generation after generation of americans fought and died for our country the bi partisan succession of global free traders reagan bush clinton bush obama helped american multinationals betray the heartland and abandon her cities and all of this was subsidized by our tax code and an ever expanding military that made the world safe for the spawning of the global corporate behemoths that successfully played the world s nations off of each other it s this globalization of wealth and debt that has made mike bloomberg one of the world s wealthiest men and he s running now to protect that pyramid he sits atop the psycho social wounds from several million foreclosures and 20 trillion in household wealth stolen by mayor mike s wall street pals endures even though trump s tenure has only accelerated wealth inequality there s a public and media narrative he s delivered for his people and it would not take a media genius to tie mayor mike to wall street s unprosecuted crime wave what s the one tool they all needed as they foreclosed on america and played tax dodgeball in the caymans while buying our politics that s right their ever handy bloomberg terminal which according bloomberg professional services is a global icon sitting on the desks of 325 000 of the world s most influential decision makers that gives these titans of finance real time pricing to make a killing on their assets so mayor mike is going to save the planet but he needs more time on his forms early on in the bloomberg launch there was some push back from the neoliberal crowd when nina turner a national co chair for senator bernie sanders described bloomberg as an oligarch maybe after binge watching rachel maddow for years most democrats think oligarchs can only be russians who are friends with putin

continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content details on the reasoning behind the reductions are not yet available though the u s has lowered tariffs in much smaller increments in the past the magnitude of the current proposed reductions isn t surprising given the severe increases in b c log costs td securities analyst sean steuart said in a note to investors log costs have spiked 35 per cent in b c amid forest fires and an ongoing outbreak of the mountain pine beetle that has affected more than 18 million hectares of forest as a result the province has applied high stumpage rates to companies cutting trees on crown land canadian producers suffering through extensive layoffs and mill closures have consistently argued that their products are fairly traded and should be sold tariff free across the border just like any other commodity the duty should be zero because our industry is not subsidized susan yurkovich president b c lumber trade council we re happy to see the duties might be going in the right direction but the number should be zero because our industry is not subsidized said susan yurkovich president of the b c lumber trade council current u s duties will remain in place until a final decision is made and canadian companies will not receive any refund or credit for duties already paid until the dispute is resolved cibc analyst hamir patel said in a research note advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the duties were imposed in 2017 prompting canada to issue complaints at the world trade organization and under the north american free trade agreement in september a nafta panel of u s and canadian representatives

the appointment of new judges to the appellate body the top court that might rule on the case even if duty rates are ultimately lowered canada will continue to fight the imposition of any tariffs on

as predicted in this space back in december phase one of the bloomberg 2020 media coronation is well underway the former mayor of new york city has spent years funneling hundreds of millions of dollars to non profits cultural institutions the academy and political candidates now it has paid off with a bumper crop of endorsements in the process he has collapsed former vice president biden s support in the african american community in south carolina over just several news cycles yet the so called news coverage of bloomberg s rise to presidential candidate has largely been vacuous horserace punditry and on trump and bloomberg tweeting at each other what i have yet to see is the talking heads debating whether great wealth on the scale of the fortunes of bloomberg and trump should disqualify one from holding our nation s highest public office the pro side might argue american culture is defined by gluttony avarice excess and the luxury of having it all so why shouldn t our leaders even our key spiritual beliefs rooted in our protestant work ethic and calvinist worldview see the accumulation of great wealth as a sign of inherent moral superiority and closeness to a higher transcendent power conversely being poor has always been seen as a sign of moral defect in america how else do you explain the way we criminalize the homeless or how we throw people in prison for being behind on paying their medical bills as recently documented by propublica historically our government was the place the population turned to for protection against the predations of the slave masters and the robber barons yet in the 21st century there s a growing clamor to hand the oval office over to a cyber oligarch like bloomberg as if he were an antidote to the last billionaire the media machine foisted on us the media has consoled itself that donald trump s abusive gyrations are merely a function of his unique eccentric personality without examining how a lifelong fixation on wealth could be the manifestation of a pathology that pathology has had severe repercussions for the nation and the world it is very possible based on his behavior that michael bloomberg who has accumulated tens of billions of dollars more than trump suffers the same pathology could it be that vast wealth accumulation on the scale we are talking about is itself a manifestation of the malignant narcissism that s plaguing the current occupant of the white house really in order to make that much money off of other people s labor by giving people less and taking more for yourself you have to lose compassion for those other people to accumulate more and more said dr harriet fraad a psychotherapist and host of the podcast capitalism hits home faith family and america s future what happens to billionaires is that they are no longer earning to buy this or that have this or that or even to be free of economic worry and anxiety they are motivated to accumulate more and more for themselves which becomes for them winning as mayor bloomberg exhibited a unique capacity to be utterly detached from the human misery in his vicinity you may not have a feel for it unless you were on the streets of new york city like i was working for wnyc during those bloomberg years in neighborhoods of color it was like apartheid the nypd went from inflicting around 80 000 stop and frisks in 2002 bloomberg s first year to 685 700 by 2011 after massive protests the city relinquished its racist policy slightly and the number of stop and frisks went down a mere 532 900 the next year in 2013 u s district court shira scheindlin ruled the practice as executed by the nypd as unconstitutional the phrase stop frisk is an benign sounding white liberal euphemism for the process of shoving innocent young men of color against a wall and patting down or worse these random encounters driven by an actual quota system escalated into police sanctioned assaults the jailing of innocent people lost scholarships lost jobs and broken lives the scale of bloomberg s policy and the social and physical harm it reaped deserves its own reparation committee a little reported aftermath of stop and frisk during mayor mike s tenure settling civil suits related to police misconduct cost city taxpayers 1 billion dollars it was a loser policy all the way around for the young people of color victimized for the taxpayers the criminal justice system and even the police themselves mayor bloomberg could have saved himself this apology if he had just listened to the police officers on the street said new york city police benevolent association president pat lynch after bloomberg s first apology back in november we said in the early 2000s that the quota driven emphasis on street stops was polluting the relationship between cops and our communities lynch went on to say bloomberg s misguided policy inspired an anti police movement that has made cops the target of hatred and violence but even as bloomberg was pressing stop and frisk in communities of color he was block and tackling for his pals over on wall street who were in the midst of pillaging main street and mlk blvd ironically it is the hyper anxiety over winning that has so many voters traumatized by the prospect of four more years of trump suspending their critical faculties and overlooking bloomberg s very real electoral vulnerabilities they are reflexively turning to bloomberg as a sure bet to beat the don in november as children lost in the forest of tyranny they figure mayor mike will be their daddy warbucks who will save them from the orange menace hence they push back when i raise the issue about mike bloomberg s failure to disclose his taxes for 12 years while he was mayor and his cynical ploy of applying for a extension on his legally required federal election commission disclosure forms until after super tuesday you wouldn t find anything if he did disclose said a news media executive working as a consultant for bloomberg 2020 another journalist not on the bloomberg payroll but an elizabeth warren backer worried any deep press inquiry of the former mayor would help the don s re election what bloomberg apologists don t get is that it is not just about what one might find in those tax filings it s about a candidate having the humility to submit themselves for inspection to the voters out of respect for them in the introduction to the re issuing of his book trump nation the art of being the donald journalist and top bloomberg advisor tim o brien described trump s base he has won the allegiance of a voting bloc that mainstream political media and business institutions overlooked for the better part of a decade working class post industrial americans thrown to the ground by the forces of economic globalization and the long uprooting of the 2008 financial crisis o brien s timeline is off by a couple of decades or more the elites were oblivious to the circumstances of the american people for much longer than that since the 1970s the american working class has been robbed of meaningful wage growth which was substituted with household debt at the same time the billionaire class captured our politics at the state and national level and flipped the script on taxation so that financiers and the super rich paid less in taxes than the majority of the country that earned their daily bread by the sweat of their brow and while generation after generation of americans fought and died for our country the bi partisan succession of global free traders reagan bush clinton bush obama helped american multinationals betray the heartland and abandon her cities and all of this was subsidized by our tax code and an ever expanding military that made the world safe for the spawning of the global corporate behemoths that successfully played the world s nations off of each other it s this globalization of wealth and debt that has made mike bloomberg one of the world s wealthiest men and he s running now to protect that pyramid he sits atop the psycho social wounds from several million foreclosures and 20 trillion in household wealth stolen by mayor mike s wall street pals endures even though trump s tenure has only accelerated wealth inequality there s a public and media narrative he s delivered for his people and it would not take a media genius to tie mayor mike to wall street s unprosecuted crime wave what s the one tool they all needed as they foreclosed on america and played tax dodgeball in the caymans while buying our politics that s right their ever handy bloomberg terminal which according bloomberg professional services is a global icon sitting on the desks of 325 000 of the world s most influential decision makers that gives these titans of finance real time pricing to make a killing on their assets so mayor mike is going to save the planet but he needs more time on his forms early on in the bloomberg launch there was some push back from the neoliberal crowd when nina turner a national co chair for senator bernie sanders described bloomberg as an oligarch maybe after binge watching rachel maddow for years most democrats think oligarchs can only be russians who are friends with putin

sifelani tsiko agric environment innovations editor prices of staple maize meal in most sadc countries continue to increase with the entire region grappling with a rise in grain prices both in south africa and globally according to the latest food price monitoring and analysis fpma report of the food and agriculture organisation the latest report indicates that prices of maize are rising largely because of weak production prospects for the 2020 crops tight supplies and weakening currencies particularly in zimbabwe in zimbabwe the fao said food inflation rates were significantly high throughout 2019 with prices of maize meal continuing to generally increase in december through to january despite introduction of subsidies on maize prices however remained generally more than 12 times higher on a yearly basis this was mainly the result of sustained currency weakness and low domestic cereal supplies caused by a drought reduced 2019 harvest and shortages of foreign exchange that stifled the country s capacity to import grains said the report in zambia price increases of maize grain and maize products eased in january but remained nearly twice their year earlier levels following steep hikes since mid 2019 driven by a drought induced shortage of cereals further upward pressure was provided by currency weakness and higher energy prices that inflated production costs for millers the fao said prices of maize grain were up to twice their year earlier levels in mozambique as the reduced 2019 harvest caused by extensive cyclone damage continued to exert upward pressure while in malawi prices of maize grain continued to rise in january with sharper gains in southern markets the monthly increases reinforced the higher year on year levels with the national average price of maize grain almost double its year earlier value in order to incentivise producers to release stocks onto the market the buying price of maize was recently raised by mwk 70 to mwk 310 per kg according to the latest food inflation analysis in south africa wholesale prices of maize grain recorded a small increase in january due to tight supplies from the previous year s crop and concerns over planting delays of the 2020 crop prices which were at comparable levels to their values in january last year are expected to be influenced primarily by weather conditions until the start of the harvest in april with forecasts indicating a higher likelihood of below average precipitation prices of maize in import dependent eswatini broadly mirror trends in south africa the country s main supplier of cereals and as of december they were at similar levels compared to the previous year in namibia which is also reliant on south african grain supplies to fulfil its import requirements prices of maize meal were at lower levels on a yearly basis at the end of 2019 in madagascar retail prices of rice held steady in december as a result of adequate supplies from the first season harvest and were down from a year earlier reflecting the recovery in crop production in 2019 that bolstered national availabilities in zimbabwe prices remained more than 12 times higher on a yearly basis the extremely high levels were mainly the result of sustained currency weakness and low domestic cereal supplies caused by a drought reduced 2019 harvest and shortages of foreign exchange that has hampered the country s capacity to import grains the fao said production expectations for the 2020 crop the fao noted have also been curbed by a continuation of poorly distributed rains and a lack of purchasing power by farmers due to soaring inflation rates which has restricted their access to inputs and led to a reduction in the planted area if the 2020 harvest remains at a well below average level for a second consecutive year prices of grain are expected to come under sustained and strong pressure in the coming months the fao warned international prices of wheat mostly increased in january overall supported by strong export demand and concerns over production prospects for the 2020 crops in some key producing countries in the united states of america historically low plantings of winter wheat crops contributed to the upward pressure on prices with the benchmark us wheat no 2 hard red winter f o b rising for the fourth consecutive month and averaging usd 237 per tonne more than 5 percent higher than in december in argentina prices increased by more than 10 percent month on month mainly due to the strong pace of sales amid tighter exportable availabilities although official crop estimates are still to be released agricultural experts say preliminary investigations indicate that maize grain production is likely to be below last year s levels in most sadc countries on the back of erratic rains and rising input prices reduced harvests are likely to intensify food insecurity in 2020 increasing the number of people in need of assistance extreme drought that hit the entire region sharply reduced the 2019 harvests leading to increased food imports for most sadc countries average cereal output for 2019 is estimated at 30 2 million tonnes about 2 1 million tonnes below the previous five year average in southern and eastern africa aggregate cereal outputs in 2019 are estimated to have declined by 2 9 million and 2 8 million tonnes respectively year on year on account of extreme weather events including dry weather conditions in both sub regions and two cyclones in southern africa sadc recorded the lowest rainfall in nearly four decades in the 2018 2019 cropping season leading to increased food insecurity and water shortages in the region the world food programme wfp estimates that a record 45 million people mostly women and children in the 16 nation sadc bloc are gravely food insecure following repeated drought widespread flooding and economic disarray wfp is providing lean season assistance to 8 3 million people grappling with crisis or emergency levels of hunger in eight of the hardest hit countries zimbabwe zambia mozambique madagascar namibia lesotho eswatini and malawi as of january 2020 wfp had secured just us 205 million of the us 489 million required for this assistance and had been forced to resort heavily to internal borrowing to ensure food reaches those in need
members of the media watch the broadcast of the democratic presidential primary debate friday feb 7 2020 at saint anselm college in manchester n h ap photo charles krupa with dozens of debates a caucus and a primary behind them local democratic voters are reassessing their favorite candidates in the winnowing field day reporters conducted email interviews this week with registered voters who had agreed to share their thoughts on the presidential race this story concentrates on the democratic field future articles will include interviews with supporters of president donald trump if you d like to join the conversation fill out the form at the end of the online version of this story while many of those who contacted the day have settled strongly behind a candidate particularly sen bernie sanders and former south bend mayor pete buttigieg the top two finishers in iowa and new hampshire others are still considering two or more of the democratic candidates nevada democrats will caucus and south carolina will hold a primary this month the primaries and debates have helped to narrow my choices said mark j bancroft of pawcatuck bancroft said he is leaning toward moderate candidates buttigieg amy klobuchar and mike bloomberg his top reasons for voting include one big one among democratic voters removing president trump from office and returning respect and decorum to the presidency but he also is making a choice based on candidates stance on climate change the environment and healthcare the candidates at this point have yet to discuss to my satisfaction a road to recovery on any of the topics he said michael j gaffey of old lyme another voter leaning toward bloomberg and klobuchar cited pragmatism as a key consideration he wants to remove trump and the gop control of the u s senate but he is also concerned about improving obamacare changing america s diplomatic policies reducing the deficit and addressing global warming bob salen of niantic said he believes trump should be defeated at all costs he is leaning toward joe biden and buttigieg though he thinks bloomberg is a possibility as well at this point i have some leanings he said but ultimately they have to be able to defeat trump salen s top issues include getting real about taxes and spending including the national debt nobody is addressing these issues honestly he said he also wants to make sure the next president protects the social security and medicare safety nets restores trade and global political alliances and aggressively addresses climate change i am an unaffiliated voter who now feels that the gop is completely gone into the trump camp and becoming as corrupt as he is salen said in an email the democrats are too busy attacking each other instead of coming up with policies and plans they come together on a practical progressive john w bill sheehan a member of the waterford board of finance said he is planning to vote for klobuchar if she s still in the race at the time of the connecticut primary which will be held april 28 senator klobuchar is a practical progressive who has won votes in trump favorable districts and works across the aisle in the senate sheehan said she has also shown the grit to stand up to the incumbent during the campaign sheehan said he met klobuchar who finished a strong third in new hampshire in new london when she made a local appearance for hillary clinton s 2016 campaign another waterford resident ed pellegri jr said he considers himself an independent but registered as a democrat to be able to vote in the primary republican primaries are usually a foregone conclusion he said pellegri said he hasn t made up his mind on a candidate to support but has eliminated biden and sanders issues of importance to him include gun control medical costs and wage disparity he d also like to see reins on congress including term limits and job benefits more in line with what other federal workers receive susan menghi of waterford said her top issues include combating climate change humane immigration policies gun safety and healthcare humanity has been broken by our current political state led by a complete narcissist she said and we need to re learn to treat others how we want to be treated menghi said she is still deciding between sanders and elizabeth warren i feel that these two candidates best understand how our american citizens need to be taken care of she said we all deserve an adequate piece of the american pie of all the issues being raised in the campaign menghi said her no 1 priority would be free universal healthcare under a single payer system there s plenty of government waste that can be cut to pay for it as well as rolling back tax cuts on the wealthy and corporations she said healthcare is a basic human right because it s something that everyone will need as some point staunch sanders supporters front running sanders has plenty of support locally greg kotecki of new london said medicare for all is one of his top policy priorities as are labor rights a higher minimum wage and less radical supreme court appointments bernie has covered all these issues throughout his campaign kotecki said still he worries that sanders faces an uphill battle clearly the corporate democratic machine fears the changes proposed by sanders and has attempted to stop him and his campaign he said george blahun of waterford another sanders supporter said he would like to see social security put on sound financial footing he also wants medicare for all and a greater spotlight on climate change i will support anyone the democratic party nominates he added some advocates of sanders said that they were surprised by how well he is doing in the polls and that they were pleased he challenged the iowa results while critics have said sanders is too liberal to win a general election william keating of new london contends he is the most electable option and the best hope for defeating trump he is a candidate voters can invest their hope in and therefore he is a candidate for whom voters will actually organize around and most importantly show up to vote for keating wrote in an email i think he will continue to do well as the primaries go on but i do not think it is a given race he has the ability to galvanize the independent voter but as trump hysteria ramps up during the primaries democrats may not give him the chance jason morris of norwich said he s content with sanders performance thus far akin to other sanders supporters his appreciation for the vermont senator is driven by policy i m a navy veteran that used to write off all politics saying they re all puppets and bought by the rich and corporate but that was changed forever when occupy wall street began in september of 2011 morris wrote in an email i agreed strongly that we are struggling under socialism for the rich and rugged capitalism for the 99 that our education system is also being guided by money and profit motive with charters and technology that our healthcare and pharmaceutical industries are preying on the sick and poor and money in politics is a root cause to a lot of this corruption and suffering sanders calling card is economic inequality and most everyone who provided answers to the day mentioned it in some form including patricia vener saavedra of hamden who touched on both economic and environmental topics climate change needs to be addressed because on a dead planet no one can survive vener saavedra wrote wealth comfort health disparities need to be addressed as a socialist i don t believe that there should be haves and have nots aside from climate change reformed public education economic inequality money in politics and healthcare likely sanders voters said their most important issues are a higher minimum wage jobs women s reproductive freedom and personal choice student loan debt investment in infrastructure reinstatement of former president barack obama s wall street reforms and reinstatement of the trump rollbacks on wildlife protections vener saavedra also mentioned what other sanders backers hold up as the main difference between him and not only the democratic presidential field but all politicians integrity voters argued that sanders integrity stems from his conviction to them he s had the same moral and political stances on all of his policies for decades and he s never bent to outside pressure to change those stances adam rose of mystic said as much the issues most important to me are healthcare particularly medicare for all making college more affordable the environment particularly the green new deal and the economy ensuring corporations and wealthy individuals pay their fair share rose wrote in an email both bernie sanders and elizabeth warren talk about these issues but bernie has been on message for the past 30 40 years and the candidate i trust the most to stick to his agenda buttigieg supporters stress health care integrity norwich resident bill kenny said buttigieg first attracted his attention because the candidate was a mayor buttigieg talks extensively about empowering middle class and working americans so they can thrive which when i look to my left and right on my street in my neighborhood and across my city is what i have for neighbors kenny said i think we ve had enough government by and for the 0 1 kenny noted that as a retiree he has private insurance from his former employer but too many people don t have insurance he called buttigieg s support for what the candidate calls medicare for all who want it a balanced and thoughtful position between those who would eliminate private insurance for a government only system and those want only market force insurance coverage leaving the sick and the poor to die kenny said buttigieg hasn t yet spoken as extensively as he would like on climate change or on how we find a balance between a national defense policy that protects us while deterring our foes and reassuring our allies stonington resident john groton said the most important issues to him are health care the environment and gun laws ones the candidates are talking about what nobody is talking about he said is the growing budget deficit that trump has taken to a whole new level also a buttigieg supporter groton thinks his preferred candidate has done very well so far similarly mary kay michaels of niantic commented in an email i think pete is performing remarkably well considering he s a young outsider and is running against the washington old guard his campaign strategies seem to be on target as he has a slight edge in the overall number of acquired delegates at 66 important issues to michaels are health care social security and medicare medicaid there are countless issues since trump was elected candidates need to and are addressing i e unifying the country immigration the arts education nato taxes etc she said in the end she said she ll support any candidate the democratic party nominates as she wants trump out of the white house
guest garry rayno the new hampshire legislature often is like turning a huge ship it has to be done very slowly yes the 424 members of the general court have acted quickly on some issues like the bankruptcy of public service of new hampshire years ago but not often the house last week and this week will put off one of the major issues it needs to address and has needed to solve for some time diminishing revenues for the state highway fund which pays for state road and bridge work for years the state has made the fund solvent with baling wire and string like selling sections of road to the turnpike system but the slight of hand is about to be exposed the house public works committee voted 17 3 to approve plaistow rep norm major s house bill 1649 to establish a road usage fee to capture some of the highway fund revenue lost due to fuel efficiency and electric powered vehicles through the gas tax in committee the bill had unanimous republican support as member rep john graham r bedford a bill sponsor urged his colleagues to face the music if they want their roads and bridges maintained however when the bill went before the full house last week support from both parties was weak an attempt to table the bill failed on a 206 120 vote while approving it failed on a 173 144 vote before a voice vote killed the bill neither party wanted responsibility for raising vehicle registration fees in an election year or to appear to be targeting auto owners who do the right thing and purchase hybrid electric or fuel efficiency vehicles major s bill would have charged a road usage fee based on a vehicle s miles per gallon rating from the u s environmental protection agency the more efficient the vehicle the higher the fee until it reaches 150 for vehicles that do not burn fossil fuel major s proposal has not changed much in the last five or six years but has yet to pass the house this week lawmakers will also act on house bill 1650 which also attempts to refill the highway fund but uses a vehicle s weight and miles driven to set the usage fee the house public works committee voted 15 4 to recommend the bill be killed saying there were too many issues that needed to be addressed or were unworkable there is no reason to believe the fate of hb 1650 will be any different than hb 1649 and another two year session will pass without lawmakers recharging the highway fund with enough revenue to fill the reservoir last year the fund collected 226 4 million but garnered 249 million in 2008 more problems ahead when lawmakers raised the gas tax on july 1 2014 from 18 to 22 2 cents a gallon the first increase since 1991 it dedicated most of the new money to finishing the i 93 expansion project between salem and manchester lawmakers were able to do that by moving some garvee grant anticipation revenue vehicles bonds for the sarah mildred long bridge project in portsmouth and other projects to cover i 93 construction costs in order to dedicate most of the gas tax money increase to the expansion the state also used a federal low interest loan program called transportation infrastructure finance innovation act tifia for rural areas the state received a 200 million loan to finance work on other roads and bridges and block grants to cities and towns that amounted to about 33 million a year allocated to the non i 93 expansion projects the loan is for 15 years and the state has begun paying back some of the money but the debt service increases from about 2 1 million a year to 23 4 million in fiscal year 2027 and continues for eight years that is money that will have to come from the highway fund and that will curtail a lot of other work once those payments begin unless something is done to increase the revenue the sooner something is done the more likely the department of transportation does not fall further behind on maintenance work and may begin to address the backlog that has been building for some time while the average driver appreciates good roads and bridges commerce depends on it including the pervasive tourism industry bipartisanship the house technology science and energy committee acted on yet another net metering bill before gov chris sununu s state of the state speech where he urged bipartisan cooperation the committee s work would appear to be a test for the governor on his pledge as the bill the committee crafted contains the key provisions in two of the three bills sununu touted earlier this session as a way to embrace clean energy development while holding the line on electric rates while there have been bipartisan attempts to expand what is called net metering which allows small electric producers to sell their excess electricity to utilities sununu has vetoed every one including the latest last week again claiming it would raise the price for consumers although lawmakers from both parties believed they had addressed his concerns the proponents of this bill claim to have made a compromise when in fact it still would result in hundreds of millions of dollars in higher electric rates for our citizens sununu wrote in his veto message these costs would be felt most by low income families and seniors in new hampshire and that is not acceptable earlier he touted three bills all introduced by republican house members that concerned small producers like homeowners larger producers like municipalities and limited how much a small producer could sell to a utility and required them to pay distribution costs to the electricity this week the house takes up house bill 1218 sponsored by rep howard moffett d canterbury which expands the net metering program to larger producers of up to five megawatts of electricity just two days after gov sununu vetoed senate bill 159 we went right back to work and i am encouraged with the renewable energy legislation passed by our committee today said rep robert backus d manchester committee chair after days of public hearings and multiple work sessions we have crafted another compromise bill combining three bills two supported by gov sununu to meet the governor more than halfway today moffett noted two of the bills were included in their entirety while the third was not included because it would have the legislature set the price of the excess electricity instead the committee believes that responsibility should rest with the public utilities commission moffett said noting the bill also would have the puc monitor the effects of increased electricity on residential rates report to lawmakers annually and immediately begin proceedings if it sees an increase or cost shifting this bill offers not just municipalities but also new hampshire businesses the opportunity to use their own home grown renewable power to lower energy costs by using zero cost fuel and avoiding unnecessary transmission charges moffett said while protecting our environment by promoting a shift to small scale clean distributed energy resources however the reaction of the republican members of the committee would indicate the fate of hb 1218 may be same as the other net metering bills while the aforementioned additions do make some modest reforms to the original bill they do not address the major problem with this bill and all the net metering legislation offered over the past few sessions said committee member rep michael vose r epping namely setting the price for net metering credits too high bipartisanship is a precious commodity in the legislature this session distant dome by veteran journalist garry rayno explores a

john thelin is a professor at the university of kentucky and author of a history of american higher education johns hopkins university press 2019 in 2018 he joined with patricia albjerg graham dean emerita of harvard to present a congressional briefing on the higher education act of 1965 free college is a visible and volatile issue in the democrat candidates presidential campaign platforms bernie sanders has showcased this proposal since 2016 others notably elizabeth warren have since echoed the chorus no democratic candidate today can afford to ignore the issue even if it means taking time to impose strict limits pete buttigieg for example argues that federal tuition aid applicable at state colleges should be confined to assisting students from working and middle class families what is the historical origin of free college in presidential platforms one intriguing clue comes from the 1947 report commissioned by then president harry truman titled higher education for american democracy the six volume work drafted by a blue ribbon panel and chaired by the president of the american council on education invited readers to look toward equalizing opportunity it made the bold case that the american people should set as their ultimate goal an educational system in which at no level high school college graduate work or professional school will a qualified individual in any part of the country encounter an insuperable economic barrier to the attainment of the kind of education suited to his aptitude and interests was this truly the federal government s blue print for the free college campaign promises of 2020 the prose from 1947 resembles the proposals that speechwriters now craft for democratic candidates heading in to the primaries on close inspection however the 1947 presidential report was a false hope or at very least a promise delayed for today s federal free college proposals that s because president truman put the report aside in order to focus on cold war defense spending it was comparable to a script for a movie that never went into production by the president or congress important components of the task force s recommendations were fulfilled over the next two decades but these reforms were implemented through scattered state initiatives with little if any commitment from the federal government starting in 1951 major federal funding for higher education was concentrated in such agencies as the new national science foundation and the national institutes for health high powered federal support for research and development flourished while national plans for college access were tabled the historic reminder is that creating and funding colleges has been and remains the prerogative of state and local governments this legacy was reinforced in 1972 when several national higher education associations lobbied vigorously for massive federal funding that would go directly to colleges and universities for their operating budgets much to the surprise of the higher education establishment these initiatives were rejected by congress in favor of large scale need based student financial aid programs including what we know today as pell grants originally basic educational opportunity grants and numerous related loan and work study programs this was a distinctively american model of portable need based aid to individual students as consumers the net result was that some but hardly all college applicants made gains in college access affordability and choice states not the federal government have been the place where issues of low tuition and college costs have been transformed into policies and programs california was an important pioneer its original state constitution of 1868 included explicit provision that the university of california would not charge tuition to state residents this continued into the twentieth century the only modification came about in 1911 when the legislature maintained the no tuition policy but did approve a student fee of 25 per year for non academic services the state s public regional colleges voluntarily followed the university of california s no tuition example the state s junior colleges which were funded by local property taxes as extensions of a town s elementary and secondary schools also were free to qualified residents less well known is that no tuition sometimes was a practice and policy outside california s public institutions stanford university for example did not charge tuition when it first admitted students in 1891 nationwide the no tuition practice gained some following elsewhere rice institute which opened in 1910 charged no tuition to any enrolled student until 1968 berea college in kentucky and a cluster of other work colleges did not charge tuition but did expect students to work on campus to defray costs the more widespread practice at colleges in the united states was to keep tuition low at the historic private east coast colleges such as harvard and brown tuition charges remained constant between 1890 and 1910 at about 120 to 150 per year indexing for inflation that would be a charge of about 3 200 today all this took place without any federal programs in the decade following world war ii california along with states in the midwest and west invested increased tax dollars into public higher education usually charging some tuition for state residents while working to keep price relatively low such was not the case in all states pennsylvania vermont and virginia for example represented states with relatively low tax revenues for public institutions whose revenues depended on charging students relatively high tuitions comparable to a user s fee after 1960 massive expansion of higher education enrollments and new campus construction in california meant that the state s expensive free college programs state programs were unsustainable by 1967 state legislator and future governor george deukmejian stumped the state making the case to local civic groups that california could no longer afford its no tuition policy at its public four yearinstitutions this added support to governor ronald reagan s 1968 campaign to impose tuition the immediate compromise was technically to maintain no tuition but to have public campuses charge substantial student fees this ended in 1980 when the university of california first charged tuition of 300 per academic year for an in state student combined with a mandatory student services fee of 419 this trend continued so that by 2011 12 annual tuition and fees for a california resident were 14 460 and out of state students at the university of california paid 37 338 an added state expense was that california had extended student choice by creating state scholarship programs that an eligible student could use to pay tuition at one of the state s independent private colleges it became an attractive model nationwide by 1980 when at least thirty state legislatures had funded state tuition assistance grant programs applicable to a state s public and private accredited colleges declining state appropriations for higher education in california and other states signaled a reconsideration of free college as sound affordable public policy why shouldn t a student from an affluent family pay some reasonable tuition charge did no tuition increase affordability and access from modest income families research findings were equivocal at best connecting the historical precedents to current presidential free college proposals eventually runs into serious concerns foremost is that presidential candidates must be aware of the traditional sovereignty of state self determination on higher education policies in some states taxpayers and legislatures decide to fund higher education generously other states do not why should a federal program over ride state policies why should taxpayers in a state that supports public higher education generously also be asked to pay high federal taxes to shore up state institutions in another state where legislators and voters do not how much federal subsidy should we give to lowering tuition pricewhen a state institution does not demonstrate that it has worked at keeping operating costs down also free college proposals today may unwittingly limit student choice if the tuition buy downs are limited to selected institutional categories such as public colleges and two year community colleges
after a pullback ahead of full year 2019 results i was ready to pull the trigger likely thanks to berkshire hathaway s brk a 0 12 brk b 0 32 portfolio managers warren buffett owns 8 of brazilian digital payments upstart stoneco stne 4 52 it isn t the typical buffett holding but new stocks like this have become more common in recent years and that s a good thing the emerging market fintech play was a big winner in 2019 as it rallied 116 since its late 2018 ipo though shares are only up 28 in spite of massive growth and the company s own outlook for its rapid expansion to continue i ve been watching stoneco for some time now and the stock took another breather ahead of its fourth quarter 2019 earnings report the valuation is high but not surprising considering the small company s prospects so it was about time i pulled the trigger fast growth open space and a pullback you can think of stoneco as the lusophone version of square sq 1 41 the company was brazil s first non bank merchant payments company and though big brazilian bank itau unibanco holding announced it was getting into the digital payments space early in 2019 stoneco has been unfazed through the first three reported quarters of 2019 the point of sale digital payments and software company has grown revenues by 71 to 442 million there is plenty left in the tank though a developing economy brazil is a huge opportunity 2019 estimates peg household spending in the country at about 1 trillion using an exchange rate of 1 to 4 35 brazilian real on feb 12 2020 but the vast majority of transactions are still in cash as they are in other emerging markets electronic payments are just getting rolling and stoneco s more recent entry into the software credit and banking industries means it has tens of billions of dollars a year worth of space to disrupt and expand in brazil not to mention the rest of south america if it decides to expand beyond its home turf to further emphasize the opportunity ahead of stoneco the number of active customers increased 83 year over year to 429 000 through the third quarter of 2019 this company has momentum on its side what i like best about the stock though is that even though it s in high growth mode it s profitable adjusted free cash flow revenue less cash operating expenses and capital expenditures was 52 8 million through the first three quarters of 2019 a nearly 13 profit margin adjusted net income margin of 32 5 is also up from the 17 8 rate through the comparable period in 2018 all of that growth does come at a premium the stock trades for 20 9 times trailing 12 month sales a high price to sales multiple is par for the course for a company growing as fast as stoneco it s cheaper than it s been in the recent past though shares are down over 10 from all time highs set in january 2020 nevertheless even with a small pullback investors are pricing in the assumption the company will be able to maintain its fast pace of expansion for the foreseeable future my strategy entering new growth stocks ahead of fourth quarter 2019 earnings due out in late february or march 2020 i decided to finally take on a small position emphasis on small stoneco stock s 10 retreat from highs is nothing small high growth companies like this can be extremely volatile and growth that misses investor expectations for the closeout of 2019 could send shares into a tailspin so could a 2020 outlook from management that shows slower than hoped for revenue expectations thus my initial position in stoneco is just shy of half a percent of my total investment portfolio as i usually do with new to me growth stocks i start very small and add to the position in small chunks over time eventually building out a position that s 1 to 2 of my total portfolio value assuming nothing changes with the long term growth potential or financial health of the company given the inherent volatility in stocks like this and especially stoneco as it s an emerging market stock there should be plenty of big swings to take advantage of the purchase of stoneco is also in keeping with my goal to increase my investment in the digital payments industry this year given the company s leadership in brazil s fast developing digital economy this buffett stock looks like a worthy addition for the long haul

escalating costs and ongoing deficits at uconn health are forcing the administration of gov ned lamont to question whether the state can afford to continue subsidizing the public teaching hospital a vast complex of 26 buildings spread across 209 acres in farmington the state last year picked up 244 million of uconn health s 1 billion budget this year state funding is on pace to total 286 million despite this infusion and a 255 million state financed facility expansion that was expected to help make the institution more fiscally sustainable the health center is facing a significant deficit next year at the same time expenses have mushroomed by 54 over the last decade melissa mccaw the democratic governor s budget chief said uconn health has requested a 50 million increase in state funding next year 75 million more the following year and an additional 100 million the next but the lamont administration is not prepared to support that 41 boost in funding without first doing a forensic review of the hospital s finances she said when we look at the longer term trajectory the question is how are we going to afford that and is that the right level of growth mccaw told the legislature s budget writing committee last week during their first meeting of this year s legislative session is that the appropriate ending result for a public hospital that s the type of question we have to ask at issue is who should pay the cost of providing health and retirement benefits for staff state taxpayers or revenue generated by uconn health from the medical students and patients it serves uconn health currently covers about 60 of those costs itself but officials there say the state should be covering substantially more of these costs just as it does for every other state agency jeffrey p geoghegan the chief financial officer of uconn health said the university can t afford the raises the state negotiated with the unions and the steady increase in health and retirement costs we just don t have the revenue to pay those dollars anymore so the state has to pay it it either comes from patients or tuition dollars or from other sources and we just can t raise it to the extent to cover these costs so yes the state needs to pick up more and more of it said geoghegan while state lawmakers sort out what level of state aid is appropriate long term the governor and legislature last spring agreed to somewhat stabilize uconn health s finances by boosting state aid by 33 million for the current fiscal year in the budget lamont released last week the governor proposed maintaining that 33 million support next fiscal year but labeled it temporary his administration also made a point of highlighting the institution s deep fiscal challenges and noted that the institution is one of the state s fastest growing expenses there s an ongoing conversation with respect to the financial viability of the uconn health center mccaw said on the opening day of this year s legislative session the lamont administration s public statements about uconn health have generated mixed reactions from legislative leaders state rep greg haddad the co chairman of the legislature s higher education committee told mccaw he is frustrated with the administration s insistence that uconn health needs a state bail out because it s in massive debt what we have here is a public institution a public hospital a public medical school and dental school and i think as a result of that there is an expectation that there should be a public subsidy for those entities said haddad d storrs i think we need to take seriously the responsibility we have to maintain the excellence at public institutions in connecticut senate republican leader len fasano has a completely different take we should have never done the uconn health center hospital said fasano r north haven it has come back to haunt us it has not made money and it is not making money what s causing the bleeding uconn health officials insist its financial problems are linked to the fiscal sin of past administrations and legislatures who promised benefits to future retirees but didn t put away the money to pay for them that bill has now come due and is tacked on as an added operating cost providing the health and retirement benefits to a doctor with a 100 000 salary cost uconn health 31 300 in 2004 today the cost is 60 000 over the next three fiscal years the amount the state must pay toward those promised health and pension benefits is projected to increase by 8 a year if the state paid those costs for us we would be running surpluses or at least breaking even we do not feel like we have a structural deficit said andrea keilty chief of staff at uconn health not so says the lamont administration only about one quarter of the uconn health center s uchc fiscal loss of 262 million this year can be blamed on those unfunded liabilities the administration insists we certainly understand uchc like the state government in general is grappling with the impact of legacy costs but the system has other growing structural financial concerns that must be addressed and not purely through state subsidies chris mcclure spokesman for the governor s office of policy and management wrote in a statement we will continue our work to better understand the appropriate level of resources they need and pursue opportunities to best position uchc financially for decades to come nearly every aspect of uconn health is in the red and reliant on state aid according to figures presented by mccaw during her budget presentations last week the school of medicine is 67 million in the red while outpatient medical services is 62 million in deficit the hospital is the only entity in the larger operation that is funding itself without a state subsidy but the lamont administration s insistence that it is closing deficits at uconn health is upsetting to officials there we just really disagree with that characterization as it being a subsidy or a loss said keilty the state should be looking at that funding as a way to provide beds for those in mental health crisis caring for low income residents or hosting the only dental school in the state keilty added what s the solution the state has spent hundreds of millions of dollars in recent years renovating and constructing new buildings for the hospital medical school and research staff in an effort to inject fiscal stability into uconn health university leaders for years have said john dempsey hospital was too small and outdated to be financially viable but three separate attempts failed between 2008 and 2010 to overhaul the campus or merge the hospital with a larger network in 2011 gov dannel p malloy had better luck and led the passage of legislation to spend 255 million to build a new patient tower garage and outpatient center and renovate the hospital s existing patient tower and research facilities at the time the university said these improvements would help double research spending at the health center state lawmakers also allocated 291 million in 2011 to help the jackson laboratory build a genomics institute on campus as uconn health heads into the fifth full year since the new facilities opened officials there acknowledge they are still facing significant deficits unless the state steps up figures provided by uconn health show the institution faces a 19 million deficit next year a 2 structural shortfall the governor s proposed budget would cause that shortfall to increase by about 5 million while uconn officials say they need an infusion of state funding others are demanding that it find an outside partner to help rightsize its finances once and for all almost three years ago the legislature ordered uconn health to seek to establish public private partnerships with hospitals or other private entities but officials say no other hospitals or organization presented a suitable plan to team up with the farmington complex that sits on a hill with a distant view of the capital city there is no silver bullet the solution is more difficult to arrive at said keilty but the health center remains open to such a possibility it s an ongoing exploration we are not actively talking to partners right now but we have been working with the administration to develop plans fasano the republican minority leader of the state senate questions how aggressively uconn health sought outside partnerships you are asking the beast itself to analyze itself to determine how it can sell itself and it doesn t want to be sold so you re not going to get the right result fasano said in an interview we need to move uconn health out we need to sell it or get together with somebody have someone else else run it but it should not be a leech on the connecticut budget the way it has been the problem we have here is that it s not their money if this was a private company and they were going into debt like this they would say we cannot make it but because they can go to the mothership and suck some more money out of the state budget to run it there is no need for them to cut salaries or reduce staff uconn health s expenses have grown rapidly over the last 10 years from 778 million in 2010 to 1 2 billion this year this 420 million 54 spike would be even higher if the nearly 100 million contract to provide health care to prison inmates wasn t discontinued last fiscal year about one third of these increased costs are tied to retirement and health benefits mccaw the governor s budget chief told the appropriations committee the time has come to find other ways to offset state funding by looking at whether the state is subsidizing the medical school too heavily and whether doctor s caseloads are too low is this the right level of support some of that is data oriented and some of that is our own philosophical views about what we want to do here in the state of connecticut she said but i must ask the question should a student go to medical school get a degree and leave the state of connecticut and only have paid 5 of their medical school tuition i don t know if that s the right balance uconn officials say they ve done the comparison and the tuition they currently charge is already on the higher end while workloads would need to be negotiated with the unions health center officials also say they ve done what they can to rein in costs but they cannot scale back the retirement and health costs those benefits were set during negotiations between the governor s office and the state employees bargaining coalition and were approved by the legislature it s a difficult position for us to be in we calculate the impact but we don t have a seat at the table we are just stuck with the results of those negotiations said keilty but fasano and republicans insist uconn health stays largely silent during debates about employee contracts until it needs more money from the state to pay for the cost of those new contracts where was uconn when the debate was happening said fasano and now they want more money unbelievable jacqueline rabe thomas is a reporter for the

emerita of harvard to present a congressional briefing on the higher education act of 1965 free college is a visible and volatile issue in the democrat candidates presidential campaign platforms bernie sanders has showcased this proposal since 2016 others notably elizabeth warren have since echoed the chorus no democratic candidate today can afford to ignore the issue even if it means taking time to impose strict limits pete buttigieg for example argues that federal tuition aid applicable at state colleges should be confined to assisting students from working and middle class families what is the historical origin of free college in presidential platforms one intriguing clue comes from the 1947 report commissioned by then president harry truman titled higher education for american democracy the six volume work drafted by a blue ribbon panel and chaired by the president of the american council on education invited readers to look toward equalizing opportunity it made the bold case that the american people should set as their ultimate goal an educational system in which at no level high school college graduate work or professional school will a qualified individual in any part of the country encounter an insuperable economic barrier to the attainment of the kind of education suited to his aptitude and interests was this truly the federal government s blue print for the free college campaign promises of 2020 the prose from 1947 resembles the proposals that speechwriters now craft for democratic candidates heading in to the primaries on close inspection however the 1947 presidential report was a false hope or at very least a promise delayed for today s federal free college proposals that s because president truman put the report aside in order to focus on cold war defense spending it was comparable to a script for a movie that never went into production by the president or congress important components of the task force s recommendations were fulfilled over the next two decades but these reforms were implemented through scattered state initiatives with little if any commitment from the federal government starting in 1951 major federal funding for higher education was concentrated in such agencies as the new national science foundation and the national institutes for health high powered federal support for research and development flourished while national plans for college access were tabled the historic reminder is that creating and funding colleges has been and remains the prerogative of state and local governments this legacy was reinforced in 1972 when several national higher education associations lobbied vigorously for massive federal funding that would go directly to colleges and universities for their operating budgets much to the surprise of the higher education establishment these initiatives were rejected by congress in favor of large scale need based student financial aid programs including what we know today as pell grants originally basic educational opportunity grants and numerous related loan and work study programs this was a distinctively american model of portable need based aid to individual students as consumers the net result was that some but hardly all college applicants made gains in college access affordability and choice states not the federal government have been the place where issues of low tuition and college costs have been transformed into policies and programs california was an important pioneer its original state constitution of 1868 included explicit provision that the university of california would not charge tuition to state residents this continued into the twentieth century the only modification came about in 1911 when the legislature maintained the no tuition policy but did approve a student fee of 25 per year for non academic services the state s public regional colleges voluntarily followed the university of california s no tuition example the state s junior colleges which were funded by local property taxes as extensions of a town s elementary and secondary schools also were free to qualified residents less well known is that no tuition sometimes was a practice and policy outside california s public institutions stanford university for example did not charge tuition when it first admitted students in 1891 nationwide the no tuition practice gained some following elsewhere rice institute which opened in 1910 charged no tuition to any enrolled student until 1968 berea college in kentucky and a cluster of other work colleges did not charge tuition but did expect students to work on campus to defray costs the more widespread practice at colleges in the united states was to keep tuition low at the historic private east coast colleges such as harvard and brown tuition charges remained constant between 1890 and 1910 at about 120 to 150 per year indexing for inflation that would be a charge of about 3 200 today all this took place without any federal programs in the decade following world war ii california along with states in the midwest and west invested increased tax dollars into public higher education usually charging some tuition for state residents while working to keep price relatively low such was not the case in all states pennsylvania vermont and virginia for example represented states with relatively low tax revenues for public institutions whose revenues depended on charging students relatively high tuitions comparable to a user s fee after 1960 massive expansion of higher education enrollments and new campus construction in california meant that the state s expensive free college programs state programs were unsustainable by 1967 state legislator and future governor george deukmejian stumped the state making the case to local civic groups that california could no longer afford its no tuition policy at its public four yearinstitutions this added support to governor ronald reagan s 1968 campaign to impose tuition the immediate compromise was technically to maintain no tuition but to have public campuses charge substantial student fees this ended in 1980 when the university of california first charged tuition of 300 per academic year for an in state student combined with a mandatory student services fee of 419 this trend continued so that by 2011 12 annual tuition and fees for a california resident were 14 460 and out of state students at the university of california paid 37 338 an added state expense was that california had extended student choice by creating state scholarship programs that an eligible student could use to pay tuition at one of the state s independent private colleges it became an attractive model nationwide by 1980 when at least thirty state legislatures had funded state tuition assistance grant programs applicable to a state s public and private accredited colleges declining state appropriations for higher education in california and other states signaled a reconsideration of free college as sound affordable public policy why shouldn t a student from an affluent family pay some reasonable tuition charge did no tuition increase affordability and access from modest income families research findings were equivocal at best connecting the historical precedents to current presidential free college proposals eventually runs into serious concerns foremost is that presidential candidates must be aware of the traditional sovereignty of state self determination on higher education policies in some states taxpayers and legislatures decide to fund higher education generously other states do not why should a federal program over ride state policies why should taxpayers in a state that supports public higher education generously also be asked to pay high federal taxes to shore up state institutions in another state where legislators and voters do not how much federal subsidy should we give to lowering tuition pricewhen a state institution does not demonstrate that it has worked at keeping operating costs down also free college proposals today may unwittingly limit student choice if the tuition buy downs are limited to selected institutional categories such as public colleges and two year community colleges

several studies show that presidential elections depress sales activity in the second half of the year and potentially slow down price appreciation getty campaign ads are already airing debates and town halls are being held democratic primaries and caucuses are underway some eight months away from voting day the 2020 election cycle is ramping up however while some presidential hopefuls are laying out their housing policies the impact of the electoral process on residential real estate is yet to fully unfold across the nation the market still seems set on its normal trajectory in january nationwide inventory continued to decline while median listing price climbed to nearly 300 000 according to realtor com last month marked a re acceleration in price gains as an increasing number of cities posted yearly growth of over 10 still research and industry experts agree that the closer the election gets the more likely its effects on housing regardless of who the candidates are in general presidential races breed uncertainty in the housing market which alters attitudes among home shoppers sellers and investors and thus sways sale volumes and values why affects the market more than any other elections is simply because people fear change says matt laricy managing broker of the matt laricy group in chicago whenever people get nervous they don t make rational decisions they make emotional decisions on a large scale though that behavior tends to mature with the progression of the election year and intensifies in the second half of that year how predictable the outcome of a presidential election appears to be can also influence real estate sentiments when an incumbent arises as a likely winner cementing the continuation of familiar policies the housing market may experience less jitters said arlene reed a real estate agent with warburg realty in new york city when the election result evades easy forecasts people get a little tentative reed says there s some uncertainty how the new president s policies will affect the economy the stock market taxes sales slide down but prices may not budge in a recent study that analyzed the last 13 presidential election years which stretch back to the 1980s meyers research a housing consultancy firm found out that new home sales record a drop in median sale activity of 15 from october to november when the nation chooses its president in the year following the election the traditional seasonal decline in the sales of new construction abodes is only 8 appraiser jonathan miller owner of miller samuel made a similar observation for manhattan s co op sales in a data crunch he originally conducted for the real estate publication the real deal between 2008 and 2019 co op sales began to dip in july of federal election years both midterms and presidential elections leading to a nearly 13 weaker market in september even though the election is at federal level and we re looking at the local market it s still very visceral to consumers miller says in most markets though the rebound is quick if not instantaneous as pent up demand gushes out after clarity dawns in the oval office in december and in the following year the sales that are lost during november are recovered says ali wolf director of economic research for meyers research it isn t that consumers say i m nervous and i never want to buy they say i m nervous let s just wait to see how things play out chart courtesy of jonathan miller miller samuel the impact of presidential elections on prices seems less clear cut because any fluctuation in sale volumes occurs for only a limited number of months prices may not have enough time to reflect that change in new york city miller says it really takes anywhere from one to two years in sales pattern to have a permanent change or a significant change in price direction this year daryl fairweather chief economist at online brokerage redfin says prices may not budge much buoyed by a consistently tight inventory fairweather said that prices are pretty stable lawrence yun chief economist at the national association of realtors and fellow forbes com contributor echos that assertion saying that he hope the price increase in 2020 is more moderate at 3 or 4 compared to past years if prices do post smaller gains in 2020 however the presidential election might be one factor for that in 2012 analyzing data by the california association of realtors movoto a real estate technology company concluded that in presidential election years price appreciation falls about 1 5 behind the gains made in the year preceding and the one following the vote potential winners and losers the effects of presidential elections on residential real estate usually reverberate louder in the upper echelons of the market yun says upper income people will probably wait until after the election compared to more middle class everyday people just because any changes to a new tax law or new regulations could have a bigger impact for them during a presidential election many foreigners also choose to postpone purchasing property in the u s as the rules that govern the tax and residency implications of such an action could change with the arrival of a new administration laricy says he has several international clients who have already decided to wait out the outcome of the november vote however with today s favorable economic outlook when it comes to mortgage rates unemployment and consumer confidence the upcoming presidential election might do little to impede first time buyers or those shopping for lower to median values homes they re really more concerned about do i have a job is the economy going to continue to grow wolf says who gets elected can impact that but as long as there s not some wild policy those groups will generally continue to fare well in an election year or not
with the stock market flirting with record highs and 30 000 in view for the dow jones industrial average this is a good opportunity to check under the hood of your investment portfolio to see what you actually own if you have a 401 k plan and haven t evaluated it in a while now s the time to do that because you might be less diversified than you think many investors want broad diversification as it helps to spread risk among hundreds if not thousands of stocks bonds and other assets many have bought funds such as those pegged to the standard poor s 500 index that hold slices of 500 stocks that s normally good diversification which helps to explain the popularity of s p 500 index funds and their emergence in workplace 401 k type programs but there are times when diversification runs in reverse especially as big powerful stocks rise in value to take up bloated shares of these funds and drive an outsize amount of their investment performance such trends can be great while they last but they invariably cool off the coronavirus outbreak is a health emergency but is it disastrous for your 401 k learn more best personal loans the 2020 tax filing season here s what you need to know a possible danger with funds pegged to the s p 500 and some other indexes is that the stocks they own aren t equally weighted rather they re weighted by the stock market value of each one that means bigger more valuable corporations exert more impact on overall investment performance right now a handful of giants are tipping the scales the five biggest stocks weigh in at around 17 of the entire s p 500 meaning the other 495 stocks account for the remaining 83 two giants in particular apple and microsoft combine for 9 of the total all this is fine if the giants continue to surge but if things reverse they could drag down the funds dependent on them taking down your portfolio with them the current concentration of top five stocks is the highest since before the dot com bubble burst in 2000 wrote john petrides a portfolio manager at tocqueville asset management in a new report investors might remember that things didn t work out so well back then for a lot of stocks and the indexes and funds that held them darlings of the s p 500 over the past three years six companies in particular have driven the market higher petrides said in an interview these are the faang stocks facebook amazon apple netflix and google along with microsoft he said the two biggest holdings apple and microsoft are more valuable than four entire sectors or industry groups energy companies utilities real estate stocks and those in basic materials such as metals wood products and chemicals indexes like the s p 500 are passive meaning there s no portfolio manager pruning branches when certain stocks shoot up toward the sky this isn t necessarily bad as active fund managers who make bad judgment calls could wind up selling way too early but it does create risks that many investors may not have considered petrides added tax help get free personal service from these irs sanctioned programs industry concentration happening too driven by these big stocks a few industry groups or sectors are exerting outsize influence too stocks in technology communication services combine for about 34 of the entire s p 500 if you include amazon which is categorized as a consumer stock the concentration is closer to 36 petrides said a high concentration in certain industry groups isn t uncommon but we have seen this story play out before petrides wrote in his report in 1999 for example technology and telecom stocks weighed in at nearly 40 of the s p 500 s total value but then came the dot com bust financial stocks had a run later reaching 22 in 2007 before the collapse of bear stearns and other sector weakness brought them down energy companies rose to 16 the next year but the development of shale oil and other factors deflated their momentum since the second quarter of 2012 the combined market values of the five biggest technology companies excluding netflix have swelled by 374 to 5 5 trillion reported refinitiv an information and technology company so far in 2020 through feb 11 the big five were up 12 a good annual gain in most years long term trend petrides argument isn t new other investment advisers have sounded the same alarm for months yet giant stocks have continued to charge along it thus can seem easy to dismiss the warnings especially with a favorable economic backdrop helping to propel the market but that doesn t mean the warnings are wrong possibly just premature the long upward ride of these giant stocks has boosted their valuations and that of many indexes petrides added stocks in the s p 500 currently have an average price earnings ratio around 18 meaning their shares are trading at 18 times what wall street analysts think the companies will earn per share over the next year or so this compares to more normal valuations around 15 or 16 implying that the stocks and indexes are a bit pricey much of that is justified petrides said based on low interest rates meager yields on bonds a competitor to stocks a healthy economy rising dividend payouts and other factors still there s less room for error when stocks are pricey switch to other investments so what to do one possibility is to sell off some of your large stock dominated index funds selling isn t easy to stomach when prices are on a roll or if selling would lock in taxable gains but it s something to consider another option is to divert new investment dollars to other areas one possibility in petrides view are foreign stocks and markets where valuations are more modest yet long term growth prospects still reasonably bright though many stocks in the s p 500 are multinational these are still american companies the only international exposure an investor in the s p 500 gets is through each individual company s geographical diversification he wrote coca cola for example derives more than half of its revenue from foreign nations it s easy to gain broad instant exposure to actual foreign companies by investing in any of hundreds of international and global mutual funds and exchange traded funds you also could invest in areas of the u s market that aren t dominated by giant companies any of hundreds of small company funds could do the job we re certainly not expecting giant stocks to collapse any time soon said royce investment partners a manager of small stock funds in a recent commentary but we do think a performance pause at their current high valuations could occur allowing small and micro cap stocks to catch up focus on diversification the key point is to remain broadly diversified and resist falling in love with today s stock market darlings and the funds that hold them petrides an active stock manager who doesn t follow a passive or indexing approach believes now is a time to be cautious many people have embraced index funds such as those holding the s p 500 stocks and for good reason over the long haul this has been a highly successful strategy but given elevated valuations the lack of foreign stocks and unusually high

san jose mercury news ca feb 16 californians tuning into the democratic presidential debates over the past nine months have watched the shrinking field of candidates clash again and again over issues like health care the economy and who is best prepared to take on president donald trump but even as the state s delegate rich march 3 primary looms two weeks away and millions of voters here already have their ballots there has been far less focus on the issues that will most directly shape california s future from tackling our skyrocketing housing prices and fighting deadly wildfires to dealing with silicon valley s tech giants and reforming our legal immigration system here s a primer on what the presidential hopefuls have proposed on those crucial topics housing affordability and homelessness housing has long been ignored on the national political stage but a number of candidates have rolled out sweeping plans to deal with the escalating housing prices and staggering homelessness that have struck cities across the country experts say building more affordable housing is a key to lowering housing costs in places like california and several candidates would invest huge federal sums to do so sen bernie sanders would go the furthest proposing an investment of 2 5 trillion over 10 years to build and rehabilitate nearly 10 million affordable homes over the next decade that s a staggering amount considering the u s is building about 1 3 million housing units a year period sen elizabeth warren would invest 500 billion in what the accounting firm moody s found would create more than 3 million new affordable housing units and reduce rents by 10 percent former hedge fund chief tom steyer would spend 470 billion the solutions and numbers may feel very big and even overwhelming but this is the scale of the problem said david zisser the associate director of the affordable housing advocacy group housing california i suspect that 2 5 trillion that sanders is proposing is probably about right not surprisingly the party s most progressive candidates would fund their fix by taxing the rich warren would expand the estate tax while sanders would use a wealth tax on the richest 0 1 percent of americans his plan also calls for a 25 percent house flipping tax on non owner occupied property sold within five years of purchase and a 2 percent tax on the value of vacant homes experts warn throwing money at affordable housing won t go that far without also changing local zoning rules that limit where apartment buildings can be built warren steyer and former new york city mayor michael bloomberg would give grants to cities that reform those zoning practices while south bend mayor pete buttigieg and sanders would use a stick instead of a carrot making federal housing or transportation funds to cities contingent on zoning reform other candidates take a different tack by focusing on renters with proposals from sen amy klobuchar bloomberg buttigieg sanders and others to greatly increase the availability of housing vouchers federal funding helping low income people pay their rent and bloomberg buttigieg and klobuchar would expand tax credits that encourage developers to build affordable housing in one of the most drastic proposals sanders has called for a national rent control law capping annual rent increases at 3 percent or 1 5 times the rate of inflation more stringent than a similar california law passed last year even though some experts warn that would stifle new housing construction none of the other candidates support that idea but they do offer a variety of unique proposals buttigieg and sanders have endorsed a program in which the federal government would give grants to cities to purchase abandoned or foreclosed homes and give them to low income people who live in historically redlined or racially segregated areas after 10 years of living in the home as their primary residence the homesteader would fully own the property former vice president joe biden s campaign says he would focus on policies that get homeless people into homes as quickly as possible instead of making shelter a condition of staying sober or participating in other programs and warren would deny federal grants to police departments that arrest homeless people for living on the streets all of the candidates would go further than trump who has talked tough about cracking down on homelessness in california without laying out many specifics cut funding for public housing repairs in his proposed budgets and pushed state and local governments to cut regulations that get in the way of building affordable housing fighting wildfires all of the candidates have outlined policies to slash u s carbon emissions and fight climate change but some also have focused on what the federal government can do to support california and other wildfire prone western states facing increasingly deadly and costly wildfires many of which were sparked by damaged power lines from pg e and other utilities the president can play a big role in fighting wildfires in the state because 57 percent of california forests are owned and managed by the feds ken pimlott a former cal fire chief said the federal government should be investing more on fire prevention efforts instead of just supporting the state after huge fires break out historically it has been state and local governments working in these areas but with the size of the problem we re facing this is clearly a federal issue too pimlott said steyer the only californian still in the race has called for spending a total of 130 billion on forest health and fire safety as well as other agricultural policies the fires that have devastated communities around california serve as a reminder of how uncertain our future will be if we don t address the climate crisis immediately steyer said bloomberg has come out with the most specific plan calling for doubling federal funding to 10 billion to manage forests and to help communities protect themselves against fires with half of that going to forest restoration and mitigation work he would also increase fema funding for fireproofing homes sanders is the only candidate who s called for a public takeover of the california utility giant pacific gas and electric co criticizing the company for prioritizing corporate payouts over fire safety in an online video ad released last week warren bloomberg and klobuchar have called for federal investments in microgrid technology energy systems disconnected from the main electricity grid which experts say can help reduce fire risk and avoid the blackouts that plagued northern california during last year s fire season several of the candidates would start new programs to put more people to work defending against fires bloomberg calls for a wildfire corps a team of thousands of workers who would be trained in leading fire resilience work steyer has a similar proposal for a civilian climate corps trump has urged california to improve its forest management memorably calling for the state to rake its forests and approved disaster relief funds for communities devastated by fires but he s done little to change the federal government s approach to wildfires regulating big tech companies the democratic candidates agree that tech giants like facebook google amazon and apple have too much power but they re divided on what to do about it two contenders warren and sanders have endorsed breaking up those companies in a seismic shift for silicon valley warren has championed the idea laying out a plan to break up companies with revenue of more than 25 billion that offer online marketplaces while participating on those platforms like amazon selling its own products that compete with other vendors using its site that would bring balance to an industry where a few companies have bulldozed competition used our private information for profit and tilted the playing field against everyone else warren argues in her plan the other candidates have called for a variety of new regulations on the tech industry and said they d be open to breaking up companies in some cases but none would go as far as warren or sanders biden said he would let the justice department not politics decide which antitrust cases to bring bloomberg has said warren and sanders don t know what they re talking about on the issue although he d be open to some more limited breakups and klobuchar said in an interview she favored a broader revamp of u s antitrust laws that went beyond a bumper sticker solution several candidates have also called for amending or ending laws related to online misinformation warren has proposed tough civil and criminal penalties for people who knowingly share false information about when and how to vote in u s elections currently under section 230 of the communications decency act social media companies aren t legally responsible for content their users post biden has called for repealing that law which would lead to a massive shift in tech policy while bloomberg has suggested he wants to amend it and many of the candidates have called for new regulations on data privacy although there are few specifics buttigieg wants to pass a federal privacy law that requires companies to limit and protect the user data they collect while klobuchar has suggested taxing companies that exploit user data what about trump he has sounded off about bias among the big tech companies and his department of justice has launched a major investigation into whether the firms have pushed anticompetitive policies legal immigration and h 1b visas all of the candidates have opposed trump s crackdown on undocumented immigrants and called for an end to practices like separating migrant families at the border but there s been far less conversation about reforming the legal immigration system even though the large majority of immigrants in california and around the country enter the country legally only a few of the candidates have weighed in on the issue of h 1b visas the program that lets highly skilled foreigners work in the u s and has helped silicon valley companies recruit hundreds of thousands of employees the program has faced uncertainty under trump and critics say it allows outsourcing companies to replace american workers with lower paid foreigners bloomberg and steyer support raising the annual 85 000 cap on h 1b visas a limit that s reached within days of applications opening each year klobuchar has also introduced legislation in the senate to more than double the number of visas available they would all pair those increases with reforms to the system such as mandating higher wages to ensure u s workers aren t displaced bloomberg is also proposing a startup visa for international entrepreneurs similar to a program in canada whether they are starting businesses in silicon valley or on main street job creating immigrants should be welcomed to the u s and not sent away to our competitors the former mayor says in his plan sanders campaign said he would require employers to pay substantially higher wages for h 1b visa holders and make them portable between jobs so workers are not trapped at a sponsoring employer he would also put in place tougher enforcement standards to ensure h 1b visa holders aren t replacing american workers in another reform buttigieg sanders and steyer said they d allow the spouses of h 1b visa holders to work a direct contrast with the trump administration which is moving to revoke spouses work authorization beyond h 1b visas biden and bloomberg would both get rid of caps that limit how many employment based green cards are given out each year to citizens of any one country which have led to huge backlogs for immigrants from china and india they d also set up procedures to adjust the number of employment visas available based on unemployment and other economic conditions in the u s that s a smart idea for modernizing our immigration policy said sarah pierce an analyst with the nonpartisan migration policy institute in washington we need a system that s dynamic and responds to the market instead of this ridiculous system that s been set in statute for decades she said the process should be a lot more thoughtful ___ c 2020 the san jose mercury news

it s time to check your 401 k plan the investments might have more risk than you think with the stock market flirting with record highs and 30 000 in view for the dow jones industrial average this is a good opportunity to check under the hood of your investment portfolio to see what you actually own if you have a 401 k plan and haven t evaluated it in a while now s the time to do that because you might be less diversified than you think many investors want broad diversification as it helps to spread risk among hundreds if not thousands of stocks bonds and other assets many have bought funds such as those pegged to the standard poor s 500 index that hold slices of 500 stocks that s normally good diversification which helps to explain the popularity of s p 500 index funds and their emergence in workplace 401 k type programs advertisement advertisement but there are times when diversification runs in reverse especially as big powerful stocks rise in value to take up bloated shares of these funds and drive an outsize amount of their investment performance such trends can be great while they last but they invariably cool off the coronavirus outbreak is a health emergency but is it disastrous for your 401 k the 2020 tax filing season here s what you need to know a possible danger with funds pegged to the s p 500 and some other indexes is that the stocks they own aren t equally weighted rather they re weighted by the stock market value of each one that means bigger more valuable corporations exert more impact on overall investment performance right now a handful of giants are tipping the scales advertisement advertisement the five biggest stocks weigh in at around 17 of the entire s p 500 meaning the other 495 stocks account for the remaining 83 two giants in particular apple and microsoft combine for 9 of the total all this is fine if the giants continue to surge but if things reverse they could drag down the funds dependent on them taking down your portfolio with them story continues the current concentration of top five stocks is the highest since before the dot com bubble burst in 2000 wrote john petrides a portfolio manager at tocqueville asset management in a new report investors might remember that things didn t work out so well back then for a lot of stocks and the indexes and funds that held them darlings of the s p 500 over the past three years six companies in particular have driven the market higher petrides said in an interview these are the faang stocks facebook amazon apple netflix and google along with microsoft he said the two biggest holdings apple and microsoft are more valuable than four entire sectors or industry groups energy companies utilities real estate stocks and those in basic materials such as metals wood products and chemicals advertisement advertisement indexes like the s p 500 are passive meaning there s no portfolio manager pruning branches when certain stocks shoot up toward the sky this isn t necessarily bad as active fund managers who make bad judgment calls could wind up selling way too early but it does create risks that many investors may not have considered petrides added tax help get free personal service from these irs sanctioned programs industry concentration happening too driven by these big stocks a few industry groups or sectors are exerting outsize influence too stocks in technology communication services combine for about 34 of the entire s p 500 if you include amazon which is categorized as a consumer stock the concentration is closer to 36 petrides said advertisement advertisement a high concentration in certain industry groups isn t uncommon but we have seen this story play out before petrides wrote in his report in 1999 for example technology and telecom stocks weighed in at nearly 40 of the s p 500 s total value but then came the dot com bust financial stocks had a run later reaching 22 in 2007 before the collapse of bear stearns and other sector weakness brought them down energy companies rose to 16 the next year but the development of shale oil and other factors deflated their momentum since the second quarter of 2012 the combined market values of the five biggest technology companies excluding netflix have swelled by 374 to 5 5 trillion reported refinitiv an information and technology company so far in 2020 through feb 11 the big five were up 12 a good annual gain in most years long term trend petrides argument isn t new other investment advisers have sounded the same alarm for months yet giant stocks have continued to charge along it thus can seem easy to dismiss the warnings especially with a favorable economic backdrop helping to propel the market but that doesn t mean the warnings are wrong possibly just premature advertisement advertisement the long upward ride of these giant stocks has boosted their valuations and that of many indexes petrides added stocks in the s p 500 currently have an average price earnings ratio around 18 meaning their shares are trading at 18 times what wall street analysts think the companies will earn per share over the next year or so this compares to more normal valuations around 15 or 16 implying that the stocks and indexes are a bit pricey much of that is justified petrides said based on low interest rates meager yields on bonds a competitor to stocks a healthy economy rising dividend payouts and other factors still there s less room for error when stocks are pricey switch to other investments so what to do one possibility is to sell off some of your large stock dominated index funds selling isn t easy to stomach when prices are on a roll or if selling would lock in taxable gains but it s something to consider advertisement advertisement another option is to divert new investment dollars to other areas one possibility in petrides view are foreign stocks and markets where valuations are more modest yet long term growth prospects still reasonably bright though many stocks in the s p 500 are multinational these are still american companies the only international exposure an investor in the s p 500 gets is through each individual company s geographical diversification he wrote coca cola for example derives more than half of its revenue from foreign nations it s easy to gain broad instant exposure to actual foreign companies by investing in any of hundreds of international and global mutual funds and exchange traded funds you also could invest in areas of the u s market that aren t dominated by giant companies any of hundreds of small company funds could do the job advertisement advertisement we re certainly not expecting giant stocks to collapse any time soon said royce investment partners a manager of small stock funds in a recent commentary but we do think a performance pause at their current high valuations could occur allowing small and micro cap stocks to catch up focus on diversification the key point is to remain broadly diversified and resist falling in love with today s stock market darlings and the funds that hold them petrides an active stock manager who doesn t follow a passive or indexing approach believes now is a time to be cautious many people have embraced index funds such as those holding the s p 500 stocks and for good reason over the long haul this has been a highly successful strategy but given elevated valuations the lack of foreign stocks and unusually high concentrations in a handful of giant companies now might be a time for prudence advertisement advertisement the odds are good that the current five or 10 top holdings in the s p 500 won t be the five or 10 biggest a decade from now the s p 500 index currently is not a clear representation of the overall stock market petrides said reach wiles at russ wiles arizonarepublic com or 602 444 8616 this article originally appeared on the republic azcentral com how safe is your 401 k plan now is a

the senate is now clearly under president donald trump s thumb the justice department last week ceded what little claim it still had as the nation s preeminent law enforcement agency as it succumbed to tweet pressure from trump one of the few remaining checks on presidential power the federal reserve is threatened with trumpian domination in ways that could disrupt global financial stability and subject monetary policy to trump s mercurial whims trump has nominated business administration specialist judy shelton to fill one of two seats on the fed s board of governors the other nominee christopher waller should be a hands down favorite for missouri sens roy blunt and josh hawley to support for confirmation waller is research director at the federal reserve bank of st louis and about as uncontroversial as a nominee can be not so with shelton her writings and public statements suggest she would do to the fed what trump has done to the presidency turn it upside down and inside out and not in a good way members of the senate banking committee who questioned her during confirmation hearings thursday signaled that shelton is no shoo in most worrying among her statements is that she favors reducing the fed s independence she wrote in a september wall street journal op ed it would be in keeping with its historical mandate if the fed were to pursue a more coordinated relationship with both congress and the president in other words give politics a bigger role in fed decision making that position rankled even some ardent trump supporters like sen richard shelby r alabama who told reporters thursday i think the fed should be independent and we should have mainstream people on there i don t think she s a mainstream economist i just want to stress this is a dangerous path to go down said sen patrick toomey r pennsylvania shelton advocates returning the united states to the gold standard a policy that this country abandoned in 1973 it would mean monetary policy would be based on fluctuations in the price of gold if the price goes up federal reserve interest rates would in theory go up commensurately during the 2008 recession the price of gold skyrocketed such a policy would have sent fed interest rates far higher the exact opposite of what the fed correctly did to keep money pumping through the financial system and halt the economic collapse shelton isn t even sure a federal reserve is necessary she prefers rigid policies that can t adapt to economic fluctuations and crises she s into cryptocurrencies she also favors a single currency for the united states canada and mexico along with open borders she wants to get rid of federal deposit insurance for bank deposits we could go on but the point is this nomination wastes the senate s time and doesn t deserve serious consideration
