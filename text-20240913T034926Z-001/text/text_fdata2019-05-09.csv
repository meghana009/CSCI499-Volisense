should you be worried about the federal deficit while campaigning president donald trump followed in the footsteps of his conservative predecessors by fear mongering about the ballooning deficit but when he got to the white house that concern all but seemed to disappear when it came to his tax cuts for the rich and increased government spending in fact there s a pattern to the republicans selective concern about increasing the deficit and it all depends on who holds the power when you look at the behavior of people in politics they don t really care about the national debt as much as they like to talk about it so what does their bad faith use of the deficit tell us about how important that number actually is stephanie kelton is here to break it all down the national deficit the nature of money itself federal spending and why it s time to stop comparing it to a household budget chris hayes let s say we pass a green new deal and we don t raise taxes at all we don t like undo the trump tax cuts nothing nothing changes in the tax rate but we spend a trillion dollars more a year that s enormous right a trillion dollar green new deal a year would be world war ii mobilization level increase your point is as long as there s slack in the real capacity there s productive investment to do with that there will not be negative consequences from that that is your fundamental contention stephanie kelton there will not be negative inflationary consequences chris hayes hello and welcome to why is this happening with me your host chris hayes i m about to uncork a rant that is a real go to rant from me you may have heard it in other various platforms that i occupy it concerns the thing in politics that drives me the craziest it s not the worst thing that happens in politics but it s the thing that just drives me the craziest and it has to do with the way that people talk about deficits i am driven absolutely to madness by this i have watched my entire adult life in politics people talk about the deficit as this terrifying thing the deficit s too high the debt s too high and because of that we cannot do x what that always means isn t really i care about the deficit or the debt it never means that it s a lie it s always a lie in fact it s a lie that s so reliable that it s essentially a kind of linguistic substitution it s just an invocation of an outside authority to say like i don t like what you re proposing whatever republican politician you want to choose paul ryan who was concerned about deficits and debts paul ryan doesn t care about deficits and debts and you only need to know that by looking at his voting record like he voted for the iraq war he voted for all the defense appropriations and he voted for medicare part d which was a drug prescription benefit put through by the bush administration unfunded they just created out of whole cloth a new drug prescription benefit for seniors with no revenue stream and it passed by one vote in the house the deciding vote was paul fricking ryan okay he ll cast that vote then he ll turn around two years later and the democrats we need a big recovery act or stimulus program because the country s in the worst economic free fall in 70 years and all of the economists the macro economists tell us that we need demand to stimulate the economy and paul ryan votes against it because that blows up the deficit literally that means nothing yet people take it seriously people will write about paul ryan like paul ryan he s a deficit hawk he s a deficit hawk he worries about the deficit he doesn t f g care about the deficit and that is absolutely evident in his and that s true with kevin mccarthy it s true with mitch mcconnell it s true of every republican and conservative out there because i have watched during my i was born 1979 and here s what s happened ronald reagan small government bad deficits bad small government deficit explodes military funding explodes and taxes are cut bigger deficits they leave that ultimately through george h w bush who actually does put his money where his mouth is infamously votes for a bill that raises taxes to close the deficit and he is thrown out of the conservative movement and viewed as a traitor evermore then bill clinton comes in now there s a democratic president well now we really care about deficit and debt you start to see a little pattern here we got to deal with the deficit and debt and bill clinton buys it too because the bond markets and interest rates and yada yada and then they close the budget deficit they get a surplus what do you think george w bush does what do you think the republicans do when they re in power well they explode the deficit and the debt more military spending huge amounts on wars huge tax cuts basically the same recipe as reagan leave office with the worst financial crisis in 70 years and an exploding deficit and debt what do republicans do the very next day as soon as republicans are out of power barrack obama s president a democrat s the president and they threaten to default on americans debt obligations for the first time in the history of the country they precipitated a huge crisis they impose austerity that makes people miserable then donald trump is elected president and i guess you could complete the pattern here wait a second a huge tax cut for rich people and big increases to military spending and a bigger deficit yes because that is what the republican party stands for bigger deficits when you look at the behavior of people in politics no one cares about the deficit and debt except for a small group of people there s some folks i think some of the advisors to democrats over the years actually care about it but generally no one cares about it they pretend to care about it and everyone pretends to believe that they care about it and scold each other about it like it s a real thing but no one actually acts as if what they re saying they believe that s just maddening everyone walks around with these face value pronouncements and explanations for their political behavior by citing a thing that they don t actually believe it s just unbelievable bad faith the political conversation revolves around it the way that we talk about politics like takes this very seriously you can drive down the street in new york city and you can see a big debt clock right it s one of these non ideological centrist things because you can scold both democrats and republicans with well how are you gonna pay for it i want single payer well how are you gonna pay for it i know i m aware of how a government works wait a second wait a second wait a second if everyone s behaving as if it doesn t really matter and we ve been running huge deficits and debts in sort of waxing and waning cycles but we always have a deficit maybe it doesn t actually matter like what if the whole premise is wrong what if it just doesn t really matter or maybe it matters way less than we think or maybe it matters only in tremendous extremes that we never get close to today s conversation is about that today s conversation is about a theoretical understanding of what a deficit is what government debt is what role it plays in our economy and what it means for what we can and can t do with public funds it is a radical re conception of that understanding it basically takes the understanding that existed before and flips it on its head as you will hear because of that it s hard to make sense of i actually as i sit here talking in this intro i m not sure i actually understand it and i went through the conversation you will hear in the conversation that i m struggling sometimes to rise to the necessary level of conceptual sophistication or maybe it s just a batty idea and the reason i don t understand it is because it doesn t make sense i don t think that s the case i generally think there s a genuine insight there that is just hard because the terrain that this all takes place on which has to do with the nature of money itself the nature of the state with respect to money the difference between money as a thing that is a transfer and a mode of exchange an actual real productive economic capacity all these distinctions are tough ones and as you will say in this conversation i and my guest are wrestling through them if you find yourself hitting the 15 second back button on this because you re folding the laundry or doing the dishes or you find yourself lost i too found myself lost at different points and yet i think the fundamental question here which is are we thinking about how the government spends money and what it can spend money on all wrong is an extremely important one because here s what is about to happen as soon as democrats get power particularly if there s a democratic president and they propose a green new deal or medicare for all or even far more expensive programs like something around college affordability or expanded child tax credit you will immediately hear the same people who have ignored the deficit and debt suddenly be very concerned about it there s going to be a question about whether they should be listened to right now there s underneath the political debate an intellectual debate about what exactly we mean when we talk about the deficit the person i talked to is a woman named stephanie kelton she s a professor of economics and public policy at stony brook university she s also a senior economic advisor for the bernie sanders campaign in 2020 she s worked for him before on the budget committee we don t talk about the campaign at all this is all sort of in her kind of academic capacity she is very associated with a new theory called modern monetary theory that basically attempts to execute a copernican revolution in the way we think about how the government spends money and where the money comes from copernican revolutions can be one of two things they can be actual copernican revolutions or they could be like total crankish ness there are some people who think that she s a crank and her school of thought is a crank there are more and more people i think who are at least saying no there s some fundamental insight here that we should be wrestling with and operationalizing in how we talk about it i ve had her on my evening show i ve had her on previous shows i ve read her writing she s a very sophisticated and rigorous thinker she comes out of an economic tradition that is both real empirical and serious but also kind of dissonant and heterodox they are sort of self consciously outside the mainstream of economics but she will blow your mind a bit she will make you rethink a lot of the fundamental ways you have been taught to think about how the government takes in money and how the government spends money and fundamentally what the relationship is between the two what she s talking about will be at the center of our politics particularly as we enter the area of climate crisis and adjusting the climate crisis when huge amounts of public investments are going to be necessary and there s going to be a big debate over whether we can afford it what my guest today stephanie kelton says is yes we can and in fact that sentence doesn t even really make sense chris hayes so we re going to talk about a theory that you have become very associated with did you coin this term modern monetary theory stephanie kelton no i think bill mitchell an australian economist did chris hayes so modern monetary theory which sounds technical but is and is sort of technical so this conversation is going to be both kind of teasing out and then maybe kind of arguing about it a little bit not that i am arguing with you but just sort of giving you the critiques of it but it s fairly technical terrain but really important and because it s so central to our politics i think the reason that it s like it s really taken off like people are talking about this all the time in fact just as i m sitting down with you there is a gop introduced senate resolution by georgia senator sonny perdue condemning your school of thought like literally it s a gop resolution that s like whereas we have a duty as a senate to condemn modern monetary theory which is wild stephanie kelton yeah my parents are going to be so proud it s so weird chris hayes you didn t know this when you walked in stephanie kelton i didn t know it chris hayes i showed it to you you thought i was making a joke stephanie kelton i totally thought you were putting up a play on me yeah chris hayes all right so let s start what is modern monetary theory stephanie kelton it s such a hard question i can either give you like the thumbnail elevator speech which i could do but then i feel like in a sense i m betraying a whole group of people who spent now going on like 25 years putting the literature that s behind mmt and so if i don t at least stop and say mmt is this amazing group project that started some 25 years or so ago with maybe half a dozen economists wrestling with new ideas that were brought to us by an outsider by someone who yeah he has an undergraduate degree in economics but he came from the finance world and he wrote this little piece called soft currency economics his name is warren mosler and he was trying to get these ideas in front of economists and get them to engage him you know so let s have the conversation this is how i see things and you guys are saying all this other stuff i think it s wrong and he went to harvard and he went to yale and he went to princeton and he went to mit and he tried to go to all the you know top departments in the country and nobody would talk to him chris hayes let me stop you there because i m a person who goes to public events in which people give me manila folders with their takes and their theories sometimes 15 pages sometimes 40 if you re one of those people i love you thank you for that but a lot of times they re pretty kooky stephanie kelton fair enough chris hayes like i just stephanie kelton fair enough and you know what chris hayes let s just say that like the guy running around with like i have the idea to revolutionize the way that we think about monetary theory and deficits getting a reaction of like okay buddy is not the craziest thing in the world going to say stephanie kelton i completely agree with you and having the word currency in it makes it 99 times more likely that you re going to be approached by a crank chris hayes yes because we should make this clear for the people listening to this podcast who don t know this there is an insane world of people who are drawn to currency questions and the fed and gold bugs who believe in hard currency for whatever reason it attracts the crankiest of cranks and it is an entire universe you can fall into out there about people who have like really cranky views on this stephanie kelton absolutely yeah so this guy comes out of nowhere starts mailing his thing around chris hayes right stephanie kelton and nobody wants to talk to him i mean right and for some reason chris hayes that scans stephanie kelton i think that this is the craziest story i think that it was art laffer who gave warren like a few minutes a time and said you know who you should go talk to you should go talk to the post keynesians i think they would listen to you chris hayes okay now we got to stop here stephanie kelton okay chris hayes because we got the tell people who art laffer is who s important art laffer is a very famous even infamous supply side economist who is author of what s commonly known as the laffer curve which was sketched on the back of a napkin i don t know if that s apocryphal or not stephanie kelton i think it s true i ve seen it told as a thing that really did happen chris hayes that really influenced and reagan and republicans and grover norquist do you want to explain the laffer curve stephanie kelton well i mean the idea behind the laffer curve is that you can cut marginal tax rates you can lower people s taxes and end up with more money because you will so incentivize the job creators and everyone will want to be excited about joining the labor market and participating and producing and hiring and so you ll get this burst of economic activity and the tax revenues will just come raining down on you chris hayes yeah it s an extremely attractive theory if you want to cut taxes and it very much relates to people s critiques of mmt so i think it s important we re just pinning art laffer right stephanie kelton yeah chris hayes because art laffer says hey you republicans all you people i know you want to cut taxes it s all you think about day and night you dream about cutting taxes but the binding constraint is that when you cut taxes you create bigger deficits but in comes art laffer to be like no no no no you don t have to stephanie kelton have i got a curve for you chris hayes i ve got this curve and if you re the right part of the curve and let me just defend him for a moment right like if you had a 99 percent marginal tax rate it is probably true right that cutting taxes would increase total revenue because there would be a lot more economic activity but at a certain point you just reduce the amount of revenue which is what happened with the reagan tax cuts stephanie kelton yeah and it happened in the state of kansas where i moved to new york from just a couple of years ago and it was at the urging of art laffer who rolled into the state of kansas and cashed his check for the consulting fees that he gave to the kansas legislature and to the brownback administration said you know if you really want to see job growth and more economic activity here all you got to do is just cut taxes same advice he s been giving for 40 years or whatever chris hayes so this guy is running around i didn t actually know this part so art laffer who is known as basically a right wing crank although incredibly influential right i mean stephanie kelton still clearly yeah they bring him in they wanted his advice they want to be able to point to it and say this economist told us chris hayes exactly stephanie kelton that if we follow this advice yeah chris hayes the philosophical and the theoretical architect of decades of tax cuts or at least their justification like don t worry and i we saw it again with this latest round of tax cuts people with a straight face mitch mcconnell all these people being like no deficits are not going to go up and everyone was like that s bulls t we know they will and they re no no no no and then like of course deficits go up so that s art laffer so what you re telling me is art laffer who plays this really important role in what is modern tax cut gop orthodoxy and the ideological and theoretical justifications thereof is the one who gives some time to this guy what s his name mosler stephanie kelton warren mosler chris hayes warren mosler who s like i got a new theory about deficits and monetary policy stephanie kelton yeah i don t know that art actually read warren s work but maybe he read enough of it to kind of say if you want somebody who will listen go try out the post keynesian chris hayes so he comes to post keynesian and what is the basic gist stephanie kelton so warren shows up he gets on these you know these email lists where everybody kind of engages in real time in a back and forth so warren joins this listserv back in the day when those were you know really popular and he starts floating these ideas and he starts saying things like well you know the reason the currency has value is because the government demands that you receive it uh that you work to get it in order to sell your tax obligations it s not the government that needs the dollars it s the rest of you that need the dollars and everybody s like what chris hayes yeah i didn t stephanie kelton you know that didn t sound right to a lot of people and he s saying you know chris hayes i didn t understand that actually stephanie kelton you didn t understand that chris hayes yeah stephanie kelton oh okay so chris hayes why i m going to stop the historical story for a second because now we re going to talk about what this things is and it requires a lot of like concept building so the first thing that we need to talk about is what is money is what you re talking about right or why does money have value stephanie kelton so yeah and so warren told this story when i was a graduate student at the new school there was a project that warren funded and it was run by a member of the faculty and there were six or so graduate students who had some support as graduate research assistants and we all went down to warren s place in florida one day to meet him because we were studying his theories and we were working on these ideas and finding out whether we could poke holes in them whether we could find useful things to extend the analysis to stress test them all this sort of stuff and warren wanted to meet the group that he was helping to support so we all went down to florida and we spent a couple of nights at his house and while we were there we met his kids and he told us this story and he said you know i have these two kids and i told them if you ll do some chores around the house like you know make your bed cut the grass unload the dish washer walk the dog do these things and i ll give you some of my business cards i ll give you five business cards if you make your bed and i ll give you 20 if you cut the grass and all this kind of stuff and he said you know a couple of weeks went by and the sink the dishes were piled up in the sink and the bedrooms were a mess and grass was knee high and i said what are you guys doing you know i promised i told you i d give you cards i d pay you if you d pitch in around here and they said dad why would we do any of this work and they said we don t want your business cards and he goes oh well they don t have any value do they well what if i said if you want to sleep in my home and swim in my pool and play you know whatever then i m going to need 20 cards a month that s what it s going to cost you to live here all of a sudden the grass got cut the dishes got done and all this kind of stuff it s obviously you know a little bit of a chris hayes yes stephanie kelton play it s a fun playful story chris hayes not helping my vision of the guy as a crank but continue stephanie kelton but his point was he s trying to get us to understand why this otherwise worthless card this piece of paper suddenly had value why were people willing to work and produce in order to get this thing that a week and a half ago they had no interest in chris hayes right stephanie kelton and now suddenly they do and so that begins the story of you know the origin of value in money why do we take these dollars bills that have no intrinsic worth chris hayes right stephanie kelton and why do we all work so hard to get them and we have this idea that somehow the government is dependent on us in order to operate that it needs our money and that we as taxpayers are supporting this huge enterprise this government operation chris hayes right so we create economic value through our activities right and our productivity we produce the value we exchange the value through the medium of exchange of value which are greenback dollars right and then the government takes a cut of that as a kind of siphoning off of that value essentially stephanie kelton right and what we see happening is we see them taking a cut and we think well there it goes and now it s in their hands and now they have it so that now they can spend it and so chris hayes right so they take it so i work and i pay my taxes and the work is economic useful productive stuff and then i write my check or it s garnished from my wages now the government has that money right so it has my 20 dollars and the government says i want to repair that road i m going to hire a contractor to repair that road and here s the 20 dollars that you gave me stephanie kelton right chris hayes that s the way we think of it right stephanie kelton exactly and warren says you re getting the order of operations wrong you should start nobody can pay their taxes to the government until they first get the dollars right the government cannot tax you and collect dollars from you until they first get dollars in your hand where would you get the money to settle the tax obligation if the government didn t spend it or lend it into existence and so the spending had to come first and that s the same with the business cards with warren s kids they couldn t pay their tax to him at the end of the month until he paid them first right he s hiring them to do these useful things around the house he gives them this intrinsically worthless little thing it s a receipt for the work that they ve done at the end of the month they give the ticket back and it says dad i did everything you asked me to do chris hayes okay so this is hard conceptually when you say prior the order of operations you re not talking chronologically because there s no timeline here you re talking sort of conceptually stephanie kelton well at least in the first instance it had to be the case that the dollars got put in before they could be taken out chris hayes i mean that s true in a historical sense stephanie kelton right chris hayes when you go back to like say civil war greenbacks right i mean the first printing of soft currency right which is a currency that s not backed by any store of gold is during if i m not mistaken right is during the civil war and the greenbacks stephanie kelton right chris hayes and that s just the government basically putting a bunch of money into circulation stephanie kelton right it had to come in from government you know the us dollar comes from the us government and can t come from anywhere else right chris hayes yes stephanie kelton they have in a sense the super patent on the issuance of this thing if you and i get busted trying to create it it s called counterfeiting you know we re in big trouble chris hayes yes they have a monopoly on that i think it s fair to say stephanie kelton they have given unto themselves the exclusive right to create the us dollar it can t come from anywhere else it doesn t come from china you know we can t create it it has to come from them so we get it from them and then they reclaim a portion of what we get chris hayes is that true we get it from them i mean get is stephanie kelton well we re talking about the currency itself chris hayes right the currency itself okay right the value this is okay this is where things get difficult and everything with monetary theory always is hard because it s a little like when you re doing really hard high level logic work or semantic work because there s like the referent there s like the arrow and then that thing the arrow s pointing to right because in this case the currency is distinct from the actual value of the thing like a vase is a valuable thing in the world like or a bucket right like a bucket is a valuable thing has value because you can put water in it and you can give it someone who wants to carry water and that s independent of whether you buy it in rubles or you buy it in euros or you buy it in dollars right like that s thing that has value there s work that has you know you create value like if i go plant a field and then i grow some stuff then i ve got some food that i could like exchange with other people and then there s the currency that s like marking that value and those are distinct things right stephanie kelton yeah for warren it would be the value of those business cards was what did you have to do to get them chris hayes right stephanie kelton how many hours of work did it take you to earn five cards chris hayes right stephanie kelton and that is in a sense the value chris hayes but it s almost like a name right it s all the relationship that a name bears to a person right that like there s the thing there s the washing of the dishes there s the making of an iphone there s the crafting of a bucket there s the hosting of a new show extremely valuable extremely valuable work and then there s the name given to it or the currency exchange with it stephanie kelton right so we have a unit of account which is the name that we give chris hayes right stephanie kelton in our case the us dollar or the japanese yen or the british pound or whatever and then we have sometimes a physical manifestation of that name so the paper currency you have to use dollar bills chris hayes yeah like if i reach for my wallet right stephanie kelton yeah so sometimes in lectures i ll do a thing on money and i ll take out the you know actually here s what i do i tell students so i don t have any on me i need a buck or two does anybody have a dollar bill or five or something and some kid will you know a student will say oh here and give me their money and i say okay let s look at this thing is it intrinsically valuable chris hayes no definitely not stephanie kelton no yeah we talk about what we ve been talking about chris hayes sure stephanie kelton and i say well what happens if i do this and i just rip it in half and they do there s a little gasp in the room cause it was this poor kid s coffee money or something and i just took it in half i said did i destroy money and they say no no you can tape it back together so then i rip it a second time and then they start laughing and it s like oh she ripped your money and then i say now did i chris hayes this is a good bit stephanie kelton now did i destroy money and they say no you can still tape it back together so then i just make it confetti and i just shred it and they just start howling and laughing and everybody at that point everyone in the room has agreed that i have destroyed money and then i say but does it still exist somewhere does the fed know i did that we re not going to tell them right chris hayes right right stephanie kelton i probably shouldn t have done that chris hayes that s illegal stephanie kelton but is it still part of the u s money supply as far as chris hayes right stephanie kelton and forever more it will be there right because only the federal reserve can subtract that from the outstanding money supply chris hayes right the point is that when you stephanie kelton get up and rip a dollar to shreds there is not one dollar less in the american economy right stephanie kelton as far as anybody knows chris hayes as far as anybody knows it literally did nothing to the amount of money in the american economy stephanie kelton right and your point is a good one because it gets us to start to think about is money the physical thing and then we worry about how much of it are we quote printing chris hayes right stephanie kelton and then we get excited or increasingly is money really like a spreadsheet entry should we think of it more like digits coming out of a keyboard and that s how most of the money in the world is created today we don t physically print it up chris hayes yeah right stephanie kelton right we re digitally creating this sum chris hayes yeah the government sets the money supply stephanie kelton right so when the government makes a payment to someone who s receiving social security benefits and they re sitting there in front of their computer hitting the refresh refresh refresh cause they want to go get medicine or whatever they ve been waiting to buy groceries and medicine fill a prescription and they see that their balance is 3 and they just keep hitting the refresh and all of a sudden it s 1303 and they say oh where did i get that 1 300 well the government just made a keystroke entry and put 1 300 in your account and that s what happened chris hayes right stephanie kelton so in other words the government spends by instructing its bank to change the numbers in someone s account upward and when we pay taxes the opposite happens chris hayes okay but stephanie kelton numbers change downward chris hayes right right so the government is the creator of the money and that it s important when in the social security right they re not paying them this is the key sort of insight here they re not paying them in the sense that i ve got a bank account that has this amount of money and i ve now drawn i got a bank account that has 1 000 because i ve collected one dollar in tax revenue from 1 000 of my citizens and now i m going to write you a check for 20 for your social security benefit and now i have 980 in my government bank account and what you re saying is that s not the way it works stephanie kelton no i m saying it chris hayes right stephanie kelton yeah there s a constant churning of pluses and minuses happening all day long chris hayes right stephanie kelton and it s not as if the government is like the rest of us where it has to go out and prearrange its finances chris hayes right stephanie kelton in order to buy a car we ve got to go out and get money we ve got to find someone who will lend we ve got to raise the money we have to have the money to make the down payment the government is chris hayes just not constrained in that way stephanie kelton debiting and crediting all day long well there are some institutional self imposed constraints there are rules about the treasury s account and the fed and the balance that needs to be maintained they don t want to allow it to close in negative territory at the end of the day but through the trading day while the checks are being cleared the fed s job is to make sure that treasury checks don t bounce and the fed is the government s fiscal agent and they will clear any payment that s authorized by congress so the payments are being cleared by the fed and payments are being made and things are all arranged very strategically behind the scenes hand in glove with the fed and the treasury making sure that this whole process works flawlessly chris hayes and the process is the government receiving money and the government sending money out stephanie kelton yeah and borrowing chris hayes right stephanie kelton so that as the government spends more than it collects at any point in time we label that deficit spending and then it triggers a borrowing operation i m a little uncomfortable calling it borrowing because when the government does it it s not like when you and i do it but people often call it borrowing chris hayes okay so let s talk about two things here so i m sort of following you i think so there s all sorts of examples of organic creations of forms of currency in constrained circumstances independent of the government there s a famous example about babysitting script in an econ 101 textbook the one that i think people think about all the time is packs of cigarettes in prison right that s an iconic one the pack of cigarettes has some inherent value but even if you don t smoke it has value because it becomes a token of exchange and it s essentially the currency form in an arena with no currency where you can imagine sardines i think have been used in this there s all sorts of examples and i guess my question is there s a certain story that a certain kind of economist wants to tell about the development of currency that cuts out the government for a reason that you don t want to tell what s going on there in that ideological tension stephanie kelton well so the conventional story and you really still find this in almost any economics textbook you pick up today chris hayes it s the beginning of stephanie kelton yeah when you turn to the chapter where money is first introduced it usually begins with a story about barter exchange chris hayes yeah right stephanie kelton and how it sort of once upon a time man conducted his affairs through the exchange of goods for goods we bartered in a marketplace and then we decided this is awfully inefficient we should find a way around this and we should all agree to take some common thing chris hayes right stephanie kelton so that we don t have to satisfy chris hayes simplify stephanie kelton what s called the double coincidence of wants right and all that so we can chose beads or shells or any of these primitive things and then over time the story evolves money gets more sophisticated silver and gold because these things have nice properties they re durable and portable and divisible and so chris hayes and then credit stephanie kelton right and all that kind of stuff so without government sanctioning any of this right chris hayes right stephanie kelton it s just spontaneous chris hayes right stephanie kelton this is very austrian manger libertarian type of story chris hayes right stephanie kelton with no government interference whatsoever markets solve the problem of barter and invent this thing called money to solve a problem of high transaction costs chris hayes right stephanie kelton then if you actually read people who study the origins of money like anthropologists and historians sociologists numismatists people who actually do the hard work to try to learn what really happened that is not the story that they tell and the story that they tell is that money comes into existence along with private property that states play a very central role in because it s legal you have a chris hayes right stephanie kelton it s a system of contracts and laws chris hayes yeah stephanie kelton and you can t sell what you don t have property in and so money evolves along with chris hayes in tandem with state control stephanie kelton property and the state chris hayes right some power and this is the thing you hear all the time right so we think about household budget is i make 1 000 a month and my expenses are 1 200 a month i m in trouble i m down 200 a month and the way that i can cover that is i can get say a credit right so i keep some credit card debt and i m adding 200 in debt every month and that s bad in a household setting because presumably that s high interest that interest is going to go up that 200 is soon going to be 300 then next week another 200 it s 500 that s going be then 600 then 700 up and up and up i m paying 18 percent a p r i m screwed that is the moral story it s not really a technical story the moral story that people talk about government deficits being bad right stephanie kelton yeah it s an economic and a moral story because as you said it s going to take a bigger and bigger piece of your disposable income to service that debt over time chris hayes right stephanie kelton leaving you less and less money to care for the other needs you know chris hayes that s right stephanie kelton right chris hayes right cause my credit card bill even if i could make that happen on a 90 minimum payment pretty soon that minimum payment s going to be 150 and 200 and the debt s going to balloon and then next thing you know you re bankrupt and this happens to people all the time bankruptcy s a huge problem actually if i understand the central insight here is that that s just a nonsense way to understand the way the government works stephanie kelton absolutely this household analogy is just so pernicious and it s so powerful though because the fight chris hayes everyone uses it stephanie kelton everyone uses it politicians chris hayes barack obama used it stephanie kelton exactly and it works so well with audiences because it s simple and it s self referential the finances that we all understand best are our own so when someone gives you an analogy story tells about the dangers of borrowing and taking on too much debt and not living within your means they use the language of getting your fiscal in order the house it s a household and so we re like you we should behave like you and we think yeah you should and what s wrong with you why don t you we start getting upset at the thought of the government spending more than it takes in living beyond its means borrowing burdening putting burdens on its future by living too high on the hog today chris hayes but there are aspects in which it is accurate and these are they the government does have income it has revenue streams right stephanie kelton it does collect taxes and other payments to itself chris hayes right it collects taxes and payments to itself and it also writes checks to people that have to clear and when there is a gap between the two it borrows by issuing treasuries right stephanie kelton mm hmm chris hayes it sells bonds which are called treasury bills right stephanie kelton mm hmm chris hayes so the three main parts of that household story which is like i ve got some income i ve got some expenses and i ve got some debt to cover the difference and the government s story is i ve got some checks that are coming to me i ve got some checks that go out the door and i ve got borrowing to make up the difference called treasury bills right stephanie kelton right chris hayes so where is it stephanie kelton here s the difference chris hayes yeah what s the next part of this stephanie kelton all right here it comes so let s say the government i m going to put numbers to it chris hayes by the way stephanie s already ripped up all of my money in my wallet while she s been having this conversation i can t say it on the podcast but i stephanie kelton i m going to put numbers to it cause i think it helps chris hayes the floor is littered with money confetti stephanie kelton well it took me a while to get through all the money in your wallet that s it let s say the government spends 100 into the economy but it only taxes 90 of those dollars back out chris hayes yep stephanie kelton so what gets recorded in the government budget is a deficit of 10 chris hayes right stephanie kelton so we go minus 10 government okay but wait there s another part of that story which is we have to go plus 10 not government because if i put 100 in and i only take 90 out then obviously i left 10 somewhere and where i left the 10 was somewhere in the economy so now there s 10 bucks sitting in the economy chris hayes that didn t exist before stephanie kelton that didn t exist before chris hayes created by deficit spending stephanie kelton the government s deficit is mirrored by a surplus in some other part of the economy so there s 10 bucks out there now the government comes along by habit and custom and says oh i did this thing called deficit spending i have to sell these treasuries now so it holds up 10 in treasury and goes does anyone want these well the cash doesn t pay any interest and the treasury s due so sure enough somebody happily swaps their 10 in cash for these treasuries so now you ve got 10 in treasuries instead of 10 in cash maybe i did this to build new infrastructure so now you also have safer cleaner more reliable infrastructure and some bonds that s a pretty good deal so what s different from if we re borrowing in our private capacity if i walk into a bank and i sit down with a loan officer and i say i came to borrow some money i don t slap a wad of bills down in front of the loan officer and then say would you make me a loan i m here for a loan i just there s the money could you now make a loan to me chris hayes right stephanie kelton but when the government borrows it s first provisioning the dollars it s putting them out there and then it s allowing someone in the economy to in a sense trade up to an interest bearing kind of government money chris hayes so it creates the 10 in the economy through the deficit spending stephanie kelton right chris hayes and then that 10 is traded back to the government for a bond an interest bearing t bill stephanie kelton right chris hayes okay i guess it just all sounds like magic to me in an uncomfortable way i agree with you that it s not a household but there s some part of my brain that is rebelling against this cause it feels like there s some three card monty that s being played and i m not following the card stephanie kelton you know why you know why yeah i think it s just because we ve all this is how i reacted the first time i heard warren quite frankly i rebelled and i said okay this isn t right and i insisted for weeks that it wasn t right and then one of my colleagues said if you think it s not right you should write it up because he would want to know and so write a paper and show where it all goes wrong so i dove into the manuals at treasury and at fed i started talking to people who work at treasury and fed chris hayes about how this actually mechanically works stephanie kelton about how this actually mechanically works cause i was chris hayes which no one ever looks at stephanie kelton that s right and i was convinced that in this little pamphlet that warren had circulated all those years earlier that he had taken some shortcuts and i thought it doesn t work like that so i m going to show why it s wrong so i sat down and wrote a paper that was published and it was called do taxes and bonds finance government spending cause he was arguing they didn t and i was absolutely convinced that they did chris hayes right just to be clear that s the standard story stephanie kelton yeah chris hayes that taxes and bonds finance government spending right stephanie kelton yeah chris hayes that we pay our taxes and then everything over what our taxes can pay for is funded by those treasuries stephanie kelton exactly so the order of operations there is that the government is raising the money by collecting taxes or borrowing then it has the money then it spends the money chris hayes right stephanie kelton and so i went through six months or so to write a paper explaining to warren all the things that he had gotten badly wrong and i ended up with a really complicated paper that arrived at exactly the same place that warren arrived at and that actually is how i guess in a sense i came to mmt because i didn t go willingly i had to persuade myself through cranking this stuff out that this logic was sound so if it sounds too easy i think it s because well we ve never heard anybody say anything like this before most of us this is completely turns on its head the way we understand the world of government finance and as you said it sounds too easy in a sense it s too magical so i get a bridge and a bond but if you on some level we have to know that that s right that when the government deficit spends to do infrastructure we end up with infrastructure and bonds so that that it s like it has to be right chris hayes well okay so there s one way in which i think it has to be right which is that the united states has existed for 200 plus years and in the modern era particularly it s been in deficit stephanie kelton almost my entire lifetime chris hayes yeah stephanie kelton with almost no exceptions very few chris hayes right okay so the reason that there is a resolution condemning this theory by republicans is that it would seem to say you know there s the very famous idea behind milton friedman that there s no such thing as a free lunch right and that fundamental very fundamental to modern economic theory particularly the chicago school but i think generally is economics is about constraint dealing with that constraint the natural constraint and that you can t just make something out of nothing essentially stephanie kelton yeah chris hayes and this sounds like you re saying you can are you saying you can stephanie kelton no no no emphatically no it s so funny because i keep going back to a principles of economics textbook chapter one page one students are introduced to this idea that there is a constraint chris hayes right it s literally the first concept stephanie kelton it s literally the first concept and you move on to things like opportunity cost and all that but here s the way that the thing is supposed to work and they usually give you a graph with two axes and they put guns on one and butter on the other and it s just meant to basically say your society can produce defense goods or everything else non defense stuff and you can combine your resources any way you want to you can take all the labor that you have the factories the machines the technology the raw materials put it together in different combinations and you could have all defense and no butter all butter and no defense or some combination of the different things right and they draw a line then they tell you that you re on the curve and you re on the curve because you re using all of your resources fully fully utilizing all the people all the factories and machines all the raw everything is fully employed chris hayes just ar 15s and land o lakes that s all we got in our society stephanie kelton yeah if that s the case if your economy reaches that binding constraint where all of the real resources are being utilized then the only way to get more of one thing is to give up something else right and that s true the problem is that our economy and virtually all economies chronically operate below that curve so we have available resources that are lying idle they re sitting around nobody wants them chris hayes right this is the key conceptual thing here right which is that the constraints are real as opposed to fiscal stephanie kelton exactly and in that chris hayes and what we mean by that is real you can t just the government can t create a bunch of value by just creating a lot of money if nothing gets built with it stephanie kelton right chris hayes you need factories you need roads you need the things that actually create genuine value economic activity but the constraint on all this is how much real capacity there is stephanie kelton exactly chris hayes not the ledger in the fed that s the fundamental idea stephanie kelton exactly mmt is trying to replace perceived revenue constraint tax dollars right financing with an inflation constraint with a real constraint that says if you try to push things too far and you try to go after resources that somebody else is already using you re going to bid up prices you re going to create dislocations and problems in the economy you re going to create an inflation problem essentially but if you have space if you have unused capacity and you can bring that capacity online and the government can do that by offering to employ people by giving contracts by building infrastructure or whatever the case is clear those checks hire those resources and push the economy to its full potential chris hayes okay so let s try to play this out we have an economy in which there s two major cities that are very important and they re across a river from each other and in this economy the government builds a bridge and it issues some bonds so at the end of the day you have a bridge between these two cities and you have a bond so in the mmt story the point is like great i ve got a useful thing i got a bridge between these two cities and i got a bond okay now you ve got a government again there s only two cities in this world and they did this now you ve got a new president in power and he s like that worked out really well the last time people liked it we employed a lot of people i m going to build another bridge seven feet next to that bridge between these two cities that s not good right stephanie kelton i should think not unless traffic goes one direction on one bridge and comes the other direction on chris hayes right right i guess at a certain point the problem the thing that you don t want is essentially the government not doing things that productively increase the productivity frontier of real capacity stephanie kelton definitely yeah because congress has the power of the purse that s an awesome power and it can t satisfy every want and desire that we have we have real resource constraints so the question is how do you get congress to prioritize the dispensing of public money and the use of real resources and how do you do that in a way that best serves the public purpose chris hayes right and we should say that the story you re telling is not at all a mainstream story although it has been moving towards the mainstream janet yellen has criticized it larry summers has criticized it jerome powell who s the current fed chair has criticized it i m not saying they re right i m just saying so that people understand the context of this it s not like this is a mainstream theory at this point it is an insurgent theory that i think is making gains is that a fair characterization stephanie kelton i think so i don t think that much of what we ve talked about so far is much of a departure from a lot of stuff they would agree with chris hayes that s interesting great stephanie kelton because we ve just been talking about a lot of operations i think that what jerome powell did in senate testimony he got a question about mmt chris hayes it s become the scourge stephanie kelton yeah the question came from a republican senator who said there s this idea out there that you can have the government because it creates the currency do a green new deal and the fed will pay for it and we don t have to worry because we print our own money now he said to a fed chair the fed will pay you know what i mean i think that what happened in that question was that they tied a big ribbon around aoc green new deal mmt leaning hard on the fed making the fed do something it doesn t already do and that s not necessary at all you don t have to change any current operating procedures in order to take fuller advantage of the fiscal space that we have chris hayes so what i m hearing from you is let s say we pass a green new deal and we don t raise taxes at all we don t undo the trump tax cuts nothing nothing changes in the tax rate but we spend a trillion dollars more a year huge i mean enormous right so the full budget of the government is what two trillion no it s closer to four and a half chris hayes i mean i m sorry the discretionary part of it stephanie kelton oh yeah chris hayes yeah discretionary the stuff that you can actually appropriate is around two trillion right so we re going to 50 percent increase in that part of the budget which is the part that congress appropriates every year that s enormous right a trillion dollar green new deal a year would be world war ii mobilization level increase although short of world war ii i know i can see the face you re making i know world war ii was bigger i know that so your point is as long as there s slack in the real capacity there s productive investment to do with that there will not be negative consequences from that that is your fundamental contention stephanie kelton there will not be negative inflationary consequences as a result of that yeah in fact you might be surprised i think you re going to be surprised when i tell you this there s some new research this just came out this week from a financial analyst who looked at this question of just how much space is there in the economy today if we wanted to do increased spending without offsets without raising taxes or carving out the money from some other part of the budget how much more could the government safely spend in to the economy today on an annual basis and he did some pretty rigorous analysis his answer was safely conservatively between five and six hundred billion if you were willing to push the potential inflation risk and said look if we got to 5 percent maybe we would get up to 5 percent you could go to close to 1 4 trillion a year now you could say well are we willing to risk inflation that might reach 5 percent annually in order to deal with climate in 11 years that we have left some people might happily make that trade off but his conservative estimate is that you have between five and six hundred billion just sitting there non inflationary space waiting to be used chris hayes right let me sort of end on the takeaway there s a very obvious ideological freight to all this because it has to do first let me be clear that no one in politics actually cares about deficits and they pretend to that s an important point they pretend to for their own purposes it s preposterous to say that this mmt thing which is all about how deficits are bad is being signed onto by people who obviously blew up the deficit through the tax cuts but there s an obvious ideological freight to this right i mean you are an advisor to bernie sanders you re i think it s fair to say on the political left that this theory to bring it back around to art laffer like this is the liberals and leftists art laffer right because art laffer comes in and he says to republicans who already want to cut taxes great news guys i know you want to cut taxes for your own reasons here i am with your theoretical justification for why you can cut taxes and deficits won t go up and it was bs but it was very useful ideologically and i think the critique against you in a broader sort of political sense and against mmt is that this is just the laffer curve of the left which is that liberals and democrats and leftists and all these people want all this public investment for a bunch of reasons they want to fund the green new deal because they genuinely believe in it right as a project and there s this sort of ideological vacuum that you re filling that says like go to it you don t have to worry about raising taxes or anything like that stephanie kelton so i will say i think that mmt is both more responsible and more sophisticated in its approach to the federal budgeting process than anything we have going on today and i really really mean that because what happened with let s use the tax cuts as an example the republicans come in and they want to do at the time one and a half trillion that was the number we thought in tax cuts and you had people saying you can t do that you had people like paul krugman writing a column titling it deficits matter again and warning that if you do stimulus of this magnitude when the economy is this close to full employment all the bets are off right the old rules apply chris hayes that was his argument stephanie kelton the old rules apply interest rates are going to go up chris hayes time to worry about deficits again was the column stephanie kelton exactly deficits matter again and he laid it out he said all these negative things are going to happen well guess what they didn t happen and larry summers and jack lew made the same argument about the tax cuts they said if the republican do this we re going to be living on a shoe string for decades to come we re not going to be able to afford to do anything well guess what we can still afford to do more and mmt is about saying how much space remains in the economy in spite of the fact that we did some fiscal stimulus with the tax cuts and the good news is that because the tax cuts were so badly structured because the windfall went overwhelmingly to people who were never going to turn around and spend that money into the economy all that space is still there so people look at what s happened to the deficit because the number s gotten so big now almost two trillion over 10 years and they say oh we used up all the space and i look at it and say no no no there s still space because of the way that they did the fiscal stimulus right they didn t use up real the real economy chris hayes meaning there s still space out in the real economy for productive investment stephanie kelton yeah absolutely and so what we would like to see what i would like to see is congress evaluate proposed spending not based on whether it adds to the deficit over time but whether it carries heightened inflation risk and whether they ve dealt sufficiently with the offsets before moving forward with a vote so instead of going to the congressional budget office saying we ve got this legislation we want to do two trillion dollars of infrastructure investment tell us can we do it and the congressional budget office is the scoring agency they re there to basically give a permission slip to congress yes you can do this green light or no you can t it adds too much to the deficit and what i would prefer is to use agencies to say evaluate this legislation we want to put two trillion in over four years we ve structured these offsets we re going to offset half of it let s say we got taxes or other spending cuts tell us is that going to be an okay thing to do and then get feedback that s useful not just tell me whether it will add to the deficit that s like the least useful piece of information you could get back chris hayes one of my main takeaways here and again i m not sure where i come down personally although who cares about that i m just a podcast host but thinking about what the money does is a key part of this right like the ledger matters less i think in your view doesn t matter at all actually but what is the money doing is the question to ask stephanie kelton all deficits are good for someone right chris hayes that s a good way of putting it stephanie kelton go back to that example if i put 100 in and i only take 90 out someone gets 10 the question is for whom and for what who got that 10 and what did we do what was the deficit designed to do did it lift people out of poverty did it make people safer did it increase the economic security and well being of our people or did it do something else did it widen inequality chris hayes that s a great way of thinking about it stephanie kelton is a professor of economics and public policy at stony brook university she s also a senior economic advisor for bernie sanders 2020 presidential campaign thank you very much that was great stephanie kelton that was so fun thank you chris hayes once again my great thanks to stephanie kelton who you can follow on twitter she s on twitter there s also a lot of stuff she s published in others if you google modern monetary theory and we ll put some links up on the website you can read a lot more and you can read some of the debates you can read larry summers column attacking modern monetary theory you can read some of the responses it s

in my two recent posts here and here about arthur burns s lamentable tenure as chairman of the federal reserve system from 1970 to 1978 my main criticism of burns has been that apart from his willingness to subordinate monetary policy to the political interests of he who appointed him burns failed to understand that an incomes policy to restrain wages thereby minimizing the tendency of disinflation to reduce employment could not in principle reduce inflation if monetary restraint did not correspondingly reduce the growth of total spending and income inflationary or employment reducing wage increases can t be prevented by an incomes policy if the rate of increase in total spending and hence total income isn t controlled king canute couldn t prevent the tide from coming in and neither arthur burns nor the wage and price council could slow the increase in wages when total spending was increasing at a rate faster than was consistent with the 3 inflation rate that burns was aiming for in this post i m going to discuss how the mess left behind by burns upon his departure from the fed in 1978 had to be cleaned up the mess got even worse under burns s successor g william miller the clean up didn t begin until carter appointed paul volcker in 1979 when it became obvious that the monetary policy of the fed had failed to cope with problems left behind by burns after unleashing powerful inflationary forces under the cover of the wage and price controls he had persuaded nixon to impose in 1971 as a precondition for delivering the monetary stimulus so desperately desired by nixon to ensure his reelection burns continued providing that stimulus even after nixon s reelection when it might still have been possible to taper off the stimulus before inflation flared up and without aborting the expansion then under way in his arrogance or ignorance burns chose not to adjust the policy that had already accomplished its intended result not until the end of 1973 after crude oil prices quadrupled owing to a cutback in opec oil output driving inflation above 10 in 1974 did burns withdraw the monetary stimulus that had been administered in increasing doses since early 1971 shocked out of his complacency by the outcry against 10 inflation burns shifted monetary policy toward restraint bringing down the growth in nominal spending and income from over 11 in q4 1973 to only 8 in q1 1974 after prolonging monetary stimulus unnecessarily for a year burn erred grievously by applying monetary restraint in response to the rise in oil prices the largely exogenous rise in oil prices would most likely have caused a recession even with no change in monetary policy by subjecting the economy to the added shock of reducing aggregate demand burns turned a mild recession into the worst recession since 1937 38 recession at the end of the great depression with unemployment peaking at 8 8 in q2 1975 nor did the reduction in aggregate demand have much anti inflationary effect because the incremental reduction in total spending occasioned by the monetary tightening was reflected mainly in reduced output and employment rather than in reduced inflation but even with unemployment reaching the highest level in almost 40 years inflation did not fall below 5 and then only briefly until a year after the bottom of the recession when president carter took office in 1977 burns hoping to be reappointed to another term provided carter with a monetary expansion to hasten the reduction in unemployment that carter has promised in his presidential campaign however burns s accommodative policy did not sufficiently endear him to carter to secure the coveted reappointment the short and unhappy tenure of carter s first appointee g william miller during which inflation rose from 6 5 to 10 ended abruptly when carter with his administration in crisis sacked his treasury secretary replacing him with miller under pressure from the financial community to address the seemingly intractable inflation that seemed to be accelerating in the wake of a second oil shock following the iranian revolution and hostage taking carter felt constrained to appoint volcker formerly a high official in the treasury under both kennedy and nixon then serving as president of the new york federal reserve bank who was known to be the favored choice of the financial community a year after leaving the fed burns gave the annual per jacobson lecture to the international monetary fund calling his lecture the anguish of central banking burns offered a defense of his tenure by arguing in effect that he should not be blamed for his poor performance because the job of central banking is so very hard central bankers could control inflation but only by inflicting unacceptably high unemployment the political authorities and the public to whom central bankers are ultimately accountable would simply not tolerate the high unemployment that would be necessary for inflation to be controlled viewed in the abstract the federal reserve system had the power to abort the inflation at its incipient stage fifteen years ago or at any later point and it has the power to end it today at any time within that period it could have restricted money supply and created sufficient strains in the financial and industrial markets to terminate inflation with little delay it did not do so because the federal reserve was itself caught up in the philosophic and political currents that were transforming american life and culture burns s framing of the choices facing a central bank was tendentious no policy maker had suggested that after years of inflation had convinced the public to expect inflation to continue indefinitely the fed should terminate inflation with little delay and burns was hardly a disinterested actor as fed chairman having orchestrated a monetary expansion to promote the re election chances of his benefactor richard nixon after securing in return for that service nixon s agreement to implement an incomes policy to limit the growth of wages a policy that burns believed would contain the inflationary consequences of the monetary expansion however as i explained in my post on hawtrey and burns the conceptual rationale for an incomes policy was not to allow monetary expansion to increase total spending output and employment without causing increased inflation but to allow the monetary restraint to be administered without increasing unemployment but under the circumstances in the summer of 1971 when a recovery from the 1970 recession was just starting and unemployment was still high monetary expansion might have hastened a recovery in output and employment the resulting increase in total spending and income might still increase output and employment rather than being absorbed in higher wages and prices but using controls over wages and prices to speed the return to full employment could succeed only while substantial unemployment and unused capacity allowed output and employment to increase the faster the recovery the sooner increased spending would show up in rising prices and wages or in supply shortages rather than in increased output an incomes policy to enable monetary expansion to speed the recovery from recession and restore full employment might theoretically be successful but only if the monetary stimulus were promptly tapered off before driving up inflation thus if burns wanted an incomes policy to be able to hasten the recovery through monetary expansion and maximize the political benefit to nixon in time for the 1972 election he ought to have recognized the need to withdraw the stimulus after the election but for a year after nixon s reelection burns continued the monetary expansion without let up burns s expression of anguish at the dilemma foisted upon him by circumstances beyond his control hardly evokes sympathy sounding more like an attempt to deflect responsibility for his own mistakes or malfeasance in serving as an instrument of the criminal campaign to re elect the president without bothering to alter that politically motivated policy after its dishonorable mission had been accomplished but it was not until burns s successor g william miller was succeeded by paul volcker in august 1979 that the fed was willing to adopt and maintain an anti inflationary policy in his recently published memoir volcker recounts how responding to president carter s request in july 1979 that he accept appointment as fed chairman he told mr carter that to bring down inflation he would adopt a tighter monetary policy than had been followed by his predecessor he also writes that although he did not regard himself as a friedmanite monetarist he had become convinced that to control inflation it was necessary to control the quantity of money though he did not agree with friedman that a rigid rule was required to keep the quantity of money growing at a constant rate to what extent the fed would set its policy in terms of a fixed target rate of growth in the quantity of money became the dominant issue in fed policy during volcker s first term as fed chairman in a review of volcker s memoir widely cited in the econ blogosphere tim barker decried volcker s tenure especially his determination to control inflation even at the cost of spilling blood other people s blood if that was necessary to eradicate the inflationary psychology of the 1970s which become a seemingly permanent feature of the economic environment at the time of volcker s appointment if someone were to make a movie about neoliberalism there would need to be a starring role for the character of paul volcker as chair of the federal reserve from 1979 to 1987 volcker was the most powerful central banker in the world these were the years when the industrial workers movement was defeated in the united states and united kingdom and third world debt crises exploded both of these owe something to volcker on october 6 1979 after an unscheduled meeting of the fed s open market committee volcker announced that he would start limiting the growth of the nation s money supply this would be accomplished by limiting the growth of bank reserves which the fed influenced by buying and selling government securities to member banks as money became more scarce banks would raise interest rates limiting the amount of liquidity available in the overall economy though the interest rates were a result of fed policy the money supply target let volcker avoid the politically explosive appearance of directly raising rates himself the experiment known as the volcker shock lasted until 1982 inducing what remains the worst unemployment since the great depression and finally ending the inflation that had troubled the world economy since the late 1960s to catalog all the results of the volcker shock shuttered factories broken unions dizzying financialization is to describe the whirlwind we are still reaping in 2019 barker is correct that volcker had been persuaded that to tighten monetary policy the quantity of reserves that the fed was providing to the banking system had to be controlled but making the quantity of bank reserves the policy instrument was a technical change monetary policy had been and could still have been conducted using an interest rate instrument and it would have been entirely possible for volcker to tighten monetary policy using the traditional interest rate instrument it is possible that as barker asserts it was politically easier to tighten policy using a quantity instrument than an interest rate instrument but even so the real difficulty was not the instrument used but the economic and political consequences of a tight monetary policy the choice of the instrument to carry out the policy could hardly have made more than a marginal difference on the balance of political forces favoring or opposing that policy the real issue was whether a tight monetary policy aimed at reducing inflation was more effectively conducted using the traditional interest rate instrument or the quantity instrument that volcker adopted more on this point below those who praise volcker like to say he broke the back of inflation nancy teeters the lone dissenter on the fed board of governors had a different metaphor i told them you are pulling the financial fabric of this country so tight that it s going to rip you should understand that once you tear a piece of fabric it s very difficult almost impossible to put it back together again teeters also the first woman on the fed board told journalist william greider that none of these guys has ever sewn anything in his life fabric or backbone both images convey violence in any case a price index doesn t have a spine or a seam the broken bodies and rent garments of the early 1980s belonged to people reagan economic adviser michael mussa was nearer the truth when he said that to establish its credibility the federal reserve had to demonstrate its willingness to spill blood lots of blood other people s blood did volcker consciously see unemployment as the instrument of price stability a rhode island representative asked him is it a necessary result to have a large increase in unemployment volcker responded i don t know what policies you would have to follow to avoid that result in the short run we can t undertake a policy now that will cure that problem in 1981 call this the necessary byproduct view defeating inflation is the number one priority and any action to put people back to work would raise inflationary expectations growth and full employment could be pursued once inflation was licked but there was more to it than that even after prices stabilized full employment would not mean what it once had as late as 1986 unemployment was still 6 6 percent the reagan boom notwithstanding this was the practical embodiment of milton friedman s idea that there was a natural rate of unemployment and attempts to go below it would always cause inflation for this reason the concept is known as nairu or non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment the logic here is plain there needed to be millions of unemployed workers for the economy to work as it should i want to make two points about volcker s policy the first which i made in my book free banking and monetary reform over 30 years ago and which i have reiterated in several posts on this blog and which i discussed in my recent paper rules versus discretion in monetary policy historically contemplated for an ungated version click here is that using a quantity instrument to tighten monetary policy as advocated by milton friedman and acquiesced in by volcker induces expectations about the future actions of the monetary authority that undermine the policy rendering it untenable volcker eventually realized the perverse expectational consequences of trying to implement a monetary policy using a fixed rule for the quantity instrument but his learning experience in following friedman s advice needlessly exacerbated and prolonged the agony of the 1982 downturn for months after inflationary expectations had been broken the problem was well known in the nineteenth century thanks to british experience under the bank charter act that imposed a fixed quantity limit on the total quantity of banknotes issued by the bank of england when the total of banknotes approached the legal maximum a precautionary demand for banknotes was immediately induced by those who feared that they might not later be able to obtain credit if it were needed because the bank of england would be barred from making additional credit available here is how i described volcker s monetarist experiment in my book the danger lurking in any monetarist rule has been perhaps best summarized by f a hayek who wrote as regards professor friedman s proposal of a legal limit on the rate at which a monopolistic issuer of money was to be allowed to increase the quantity in circulation i can only say that i would not like to see what would happen if under such a provision it ever became known that the amount of cash in circulation was approaching the upper limit and therefore a need for increased liquidity could not be met hayek s warnings were subsequently borne out after the federal reserve board shifted its policy from targeting interest rates to targeting the monetary aggregates the apparent shift toward a less inflationary monetary policy reinforced by the election of a conservative antiinflationary president in 1980 induced an international shift from other currencies into the dollar that shift caused the dollar to appreciate by almost 30 percent against other major currencies at the same time the domestic demand for deposits was increasing as deregulation of the banking system reduced the cost of holding deposits but instead of accommodating the increase in the foreign and domestic demands for dollars the fed tightened monetary policy the deflationary impact of that tightening overwhelmed the fiscal stimulus of tax cuts and defense buildup which many had predicted would cause inflation to speed up instead the economy fell into the deepest recession since the 1930s while inflation by 1982 was brought down to the lowest levels since the early 1960s the contraction which began in july 1981 accelerated in the fourth quarter of 1981 and the first quarter of 1982 the rapid disinflation was bringing interest rates down from the record high levels of mid 1981 and the economy seemed to bottom out in the second quarter showing a slight rise in real gnp over the first quarter sticking to its monetarist strategy the fed reduced its targets for monetary growth in 1982 to between 2 5 and 5 5 percent but in january and february the money supply increased at a rapid rate perhaps in anticipation of an incipient expansion whatever its cause the early burst of the money supply pushed m 1 way over its target range for the next several months as m 1 remained above its target financial and commodity markets were preoccupied with what the fed was going to do next the fear that the fed would tighten further to bring m 1 back within its target range reversed the slide in interest rates that began in the fall of 1981 a striking feature of the behavior of interest rates at that time was that credit markets seemed to be heavily influenced by the announcements every week of the change in m 1 during the previous week unexpectedly large increases in the money supply put upward pressure on interest rates the monetarist explanation was that the announcements caused people to raise their expectations of inflation but if the increase in interest rates had been associated with a rising inflation premium the announcements should have been associated with weakness in the dollar on foreign exchange markets and rising commodities prices in fact the dollar was rising and commodities prices were falling consistently throughout this period even immediately after an unexpectedly large jump in m 1 was announced pp 218 19 i pause in my own earlier narrative to add the further comment that the increase in interest rates in early 1982 clearly reflected an increasing liquidity premium caused by the reduced availability of bank reserves making cash more desirable to hold than real assets thereby inducing further declines in asset values however increases in m 1 during july turned out to be far smaller than anticipated relieving some of the pressure on credit and commodities markets and allowing interest rates to begin to fall again the decline in interest rates may have been eased slightly by volcker s statement to congress on july 20 that monetary growth at the upper range of the fed s targets would be acceptable more important he added that he fed was willing to let m 1 remain above its target range for a while if the reason seemed to be a precautionary demand for liquidity by august m 1 had actually fallen back within its target range as fears of further tightening by the fed subsided the stage was set for the decline in interest rates to accelerate the great stock market rally began on august 17 when the dow rose over 38 points but anticipation of an incipient recovery again fed monetary growth from the middle of august through the end of september m 1 grew at an annual rate of over 15 percent fears that rapid monetary growth would induce the fed to tighten monetary policy slowed down the decline in interest rates and led to renewed declines in commodities price and the stock market while pushing up the dollar to new highs on october 5 the wall street journal reported that bond prices had fallen amid fears that the fed might tighten credit conditions to slow the recent strong growth in the money supply but on the very next day it was reported that the fed expected inflation to stay low and would therefore allow m 1 to exceed its targets the report sparked a major decline in interest rates and the dow soared another 37 points pp 219 20 the subsequent recovery which began at the end of 1982 quickly became very powerful but persistent fears that the fed would backslide at the urging of milton friedman and his monetarist followers into its bad old monetarist habits periodically caused interest rate spikes reflecting rising liquidity premiums as the public built up precautionary cash balances luckily volcker was astute enough to shrug off the overwrought warnings of friedman and other monetarists that rapid increases in the monetary aggregates foreshadowed the imminent return of double digit inflation thus the monetarist obsession with controlling the monetary aggregates senselessly prolonged an already deep recession that by q1 1982 had already slain the inflationary dragon inflation having fallen to less than half its 1981 peak while gdp actually contracted in nominal terms but because the money supply was expanding at a faster rate than was acceptable to monetarist ideology the fed continued in its futile but destructive effort to keep the monetary aggregates from overshooting their arbitrary monetarist target range it was not until volcker in the summer of 1982 finally and belatedly decided that enough was enough and announced that the fed would declare victory over inflation and call off its monetarist crusade even if doing so meant incurring friedman s wrath and condemnation for abandoning the true monetarist doctrine which brings me to my second point about volcker s policy while it s clear that volcker s decision to adopt control over the monetary aggregates as the focus of monetary policy was disastrously misguided monetary policy can t be conducted without some target although the fed s interest rate can serve as a policy instrument it is not a plausible policy target the preferred policy target is generally thought to be the rate of inflation the fed after all is mandated to achieve price stability which is usually understood to mean targeting a rate of inflation of about 2 a more sophisticated alternative would be to aim at a suitable price level thereby allowing some upward movement say at a 2 annual rate the difference between an inflation target and a moving price level target being that an inflation target is unaffected by past deviations of actual from targeted inflation while a moving price level target would require some catch up inflation to make up for past below target inflation and reduced inflation to compensate for past above target inflation however the 1981 82 recession shows exactly why an inflation target and even a moving price level target are bad ideas by almost any comprehensive measure inflation was still positive throughout the 1981 82 recession though the producer price index was nearly flat thus inflation targeting during the 1981 82 recession would have been almost as bad a target for monetary policy as the monetary aggregates with most measures of inflation showing that inflation was then between 3 and 5 percent even at the depth of the recession inflation targeting is thus on its face an unreliable basis for conducting monetary policy but the deeper problem with targeting inflation is that seeking to achieve an inflation target during a recession when the very existence of a recession is presumptive evidence of the need for monetary stimulus is actually a recipe for disaster or at the very least for needlessly prolonging a recession in a recession the goal of monetary policy should be to stabilize the rate of increase in nominal spending along a time path consistent with the desired rate of inflation thus as long as output is contracting or increasing very slowly the desired rate of inflation should be higher than the desired rate over the long term the appropriate strategy for achieving an inflation target ought to be to let inflation be reduced by the accelerating expansion of output and employment characteristic of most recoveries relative to a stable expansion of nominal spending the true goal of monetary policy should always be to maintain a time path of total spending consistent with a desired price level path over time but it should not be the objective of the monetary policy to always be as close as possible to the desired path because trying to stay on that path would likely destabilize the real economy market monetarists argue that the goal of monetary policy ought to be to keep nominal gdp expanding at that whatever rate is consistent with maintaining the desired long run price level path that is certainly a reasonable practical rule for monetary policy but the policy criterion i have discussed here would at least in principle be consistent with a more activist approach in which the monetary authority would seek to hasten the restoration of full employment during recessions by temporarily increasing the rate of monetary expansion and in nominal gdp as long as real output and employment remained below the maximum levels consistent with desired price level path over time but such a strategy would require the monetary authority to be able to fine tune its monetary expansion so that it was tapered off just as the economy was reaching its maximum sustainable output and employment path whether such fine tuning would be possible in practice is a question to which i don t think we now know the answer

prijedor arcelormittal prijedor has had to take the difficult decision to reduce iron ore production from 1 5 to 1 million tonnes at its omarska mine in order to protect the maximum possible number of jobs for the longer term arcelormittal prijedor s sole customer arcelormittal zenica is consequently reducing its consumption of iron ore from omarska and will instead import additional iron ore from outside bosnia and herzegovina by lowering production to one million tonnes a year the effective life of the omarska mine will be extended by up to 10 years without taking these measures the mine would have to close in 2025 the new plan is expected to commence from september 1 2019 we deeply regret that these essential measures will unavoidably lead to the loss of 300 jobs at arcelormittal prijedor this is significant proportion of the approximately 800 people currently employed by arcelormittal prijedor but we have been forced to take this difficult decision due to the lack of certainty surrounding the future of mining in prijedor the company will work closely with union representatives and provide all possible assistance to those affected on may 7 2019 the annual general meeting of shareholders of arcelormittal held in luxembourg approved all resolutions by a strong majority 69 77 of the voting rights were represented at the general meeting the results of the votes

arcelormittal chairman and ceo said our first quarter results reflect the challenging operating environment the industry has faced in recent months profitability has been impacted by lower steel pricing due to weaker economic activity and continued global overcapacity as well as rising raw material costs as a result of supply side developments in brazil we continue to face a challenge from high levels of imports particularly in europe where safeguard measures introduced by the european commission have not been fully effective although we are somewhat encouraged by the firmer price environment in china this is not being reflected in europe where in order to adapt to the current market environment we have recently announced annualized production cuts of three million tonnes in our flat steel operations it is important there is a level playing field to address unfair competition and this includes a green border adjustment to ensure that imports into europe face the same carbon costs as producers in europe we remain focussed on our own initiatives to improve performance through delivery of our action2020 plan generating positive free cash flow demonstrating progress

prijedor arcelormittal prijedor has had to take the difficult decision to reduce iron ore production from 1 5 to 1 million tonnes at its omarska mine in order to protect the maximum possible number of jobs for the longer term arcelormittal prijedor s sole customer arcelormittal zenica is consequently reducing its consumption of iron ore from omarska and will instead import additional iron ore from outside bosnia and herzegovina by lowering production to one million tonnes a year the effective life of the omarska mine will be extended by up to 10 years without taking these measures the mine would have to close in 2025 the new plan is expected to commence from september 1 2019 we deeply regret that these essential measures will unavoidably lead to the loss of 300 jobs at arcelormittal prijedor this is significant proportion of the approximately 800 people currently employed by arcelormittal prijedor but we have been forced to take this difficult decision due to the lack of

former us ambassador to sri lanka and currently senior director india and south asia of mclartyassociates based in washington d c robert o blake jr delivered a speech at the pathfinder foundation joint apparel association forum of sri lanka as second in the series of seminars held in bmich on may 7 the following is robert o blake s full presentation i return to sri lanka with mixed emotions it is wonderful to be back in sri lanka and to see the many positive changes that have taken place in the ten years since i departed sri lanka and i appreciate the hospitality and leadership of my old friend milinda and the dynamic role of the pathfinder foundation but i and sri lanka s many friends in the us were also deeply saddened by the horrific easter sunday attacks that took the lives of so many and threatened to open new cleavages in sri lanka milinda asked me to talk about sri lanka s place in the administration s indo pacific vision as we look ahead how china is viewed in the us and the implications of all this for the future of us sl relations if there is any one thing that has changed dramatically in the last 10 years it is the growing predominance of china in asia on many fronts and the hostile and increasingly bipartisan reaction to these developments in washington everyone seems to focus on the trade frictions between the us and china but that is just one facet of a much larger and increasingly hostile competition between the us and china washington s list of concerns includes but is not limited to the following the influence of china s belt and road initiative and the debt labour and other impacts it has had on recipient countries china s militarization of disputed islands in the south china sea china s growing surveillance state powered by artificial intelligence and propagated by companies such as huawei chinese theft of us company intellectual property chinese cyber attacks and cyber theft china s suppression of its uighur population the growing role of the chinese communist party and soes the widening gap between what chinese citizens and companies can do in the west as against what westerners are permitted in china underlying many of these concerns is a growing understanding that the us may have made a misguided strategic bet about china when then president clinton made the case that the us should support china s entry into the wto even though china was not yet a market economy he and most americans myself included believed that as china prospered as its middle class grew as more and more chinese travelled and studied abroad china would over time become more of a market economy and become more democratic today most americans see that this strategic calculation was wrong under xi jinping we have seen a strengthening of the role

asked to make a choice between the united states and china they particularly want to benefit from the massive resources china is extending under its ambitious belt and road initiative china s ambassador to the us published an oped in forbes two weeks ago in which he summarized the vast scope of bri according to the ambassador 126 countries and 29 international organisations having signed bri cooperation documents with china total trade between china and other belt and road countries has exceeded 6 trillion and china s investment in these countries has surpassed 80 billion to put these figures into context china committed 113 b in bri financing in 2017 which substantially exceeded the commitments of the world bank and adb combined but increasingly we find pushback from bri recipients debt diplomacy the case of sri lanka s own port of hanbantota has become a watchword for the rest of the world that countries must make sure they choose projects that have solid internal rates of return that will enable them to service the debt owed to china or they will face chinese pressures to convert that debt to equity labour issues every recipient country also grapples with chinese pressure to use chinese labour on these bri projects when almost every country has surplus labour of their own for whom they want to provide opportunities for work lack of transparency most bri projects also face criticism for the lack of transparency about the financial terms of the loans the extent of chinese labour and other such sensitive issues environmental concerns wri published a recent analysis of bri lending from 2014 17 found that chinese energy and transport projects in bri countries did not align with the low carbon priorities recipient countries outlined in their paris pledges what are recipient countries to do first the countries involved in bri must be more forceful and clearer in negotiating with the chinese this is already happening the wsj recently reported that last year myanmar renegotiated terms for a 7 3 billion chinese funded deep water port and industrial zone shrinking the scope of the project and slashing the country s future debt burden to its economic powerhouse neighbour pakistan malaysia myanmar bangladesh and sierra leone also have backed away from bri projects likewise the maldives has announced its own review of bri contracts undertaken by the previous government to ensure it is servicing only the debt for the true value of the projects undertaken not for the inflated cost of what the new government alleges were large corrupt kickbacks on both sides in indonesia where i served as ambassador from 2013 16 the signature bri programme is jakarta bandung high speed rail many questioned the need for a 6 billion rail line given so many other infrastructure needs indonesian ministers have criticized the high speed rail project for being opaque and non transparent complaining that even cabinet members are having trouble getting data and information the good news is that china is beginning to respond to these concerns in a speech on april 26 to mark the latest bri conference president xi jinping told the conference that everything should be done in a transparent way and we should have zero tolerance for corruption and we also need to ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects so that they will achieve the intended goals as planned in another sign of greater transparency xi said china would welcome the participation of multilateral and international financial institutions in belt and road investment and financing the chinese also pledged to defuse tensions with belt and road recipients expressing willingness in principle to renegotiate debts beijing decided to forgive ethiopia s interest payments owed through the end of 2018 there are other signs china is sensitive to the criticism it has received china itself and unep have formed international coalition for green development on the belt and road to make bri greener and more sustainable the coalition includes all the major environmental groups bri countries and key chinese businesses who are major bri contractors batang toru example part of a coalition with global wildlife conservation wwf and others letter by cong henry waxman and others boc said in march by announcing it would review its loan so china is listening the test will come whether we see concrete changes implemented so how has the us sought to advance its interests in the asia pacific and respond to china s growing influence in some ways the trump administration has responded well to china s increased diplomatic and infrastructure promotion efforts first recognizing that it is not enough to simply criticize bri from the sidelines the administration and congress understood that the us and other partners must provide alternatives so partner countries have choices last october the build act was signed into law it created a new u s international development finance corporation which will incorporate the opic and make available financing totaling 60 billion more than double what opic had provided in the past this in turn will unlock over 30 billion in additional funding to facilitate private sector investments in the region the idfc will offer loans loan guarantees and risk insurance to support new investments they will also make equity investments and fund feasibility studies or potential investments making it even easier to collaborate with partner finance institutions now of course the idfc s 60 billion does not come close to the trillion dollars in bri financing but it does provide countries alternatives and in that way will oblige china to be more transparent and responsive to the needs of recipient countries the us also has signaled its readiness to cooperate with partners such as japan and india in co financing projects further expanding the scope and scale of alternatives investment these resources complement the significant us private sector investment in the asia pacific the value of u s foreign direct investment in the region is nearly 1 trillion far outstripping what china or any other country has invested moreover it is not widely known that our investment in asia has more than doubled over the last decade and made the us the largest source of the region s foreign investment i also want to credit the administration s security commitment to the region one of then secretary of defence mattis first acts was to rename our pacific command to be the new indo pacific command showing our understanding that we must have one vision for the indian and pacific oceans and recognizing india s growing power and influence across the asia pacific and the importance the us attaches to our partnership with india the administration also has sustained our high level military to military engagement in the region in most countries in asia where we have military partnerships the us is the largest military exercise partner and the largest provider of military training and the administration has shown a steadfast commitment to continuing our longstanding commitment to ensuring freedom of navigation throughout the indo pacific but particularly in sensitive areas such as the south china sea this security commitment has underpinned asia s extraordinary economic rise for the last 50 years but in important other ways the current administration has damaged us interests in the asia pacific let me mention two the first is on the trade front fulfilling a misguided campaign promise one of president trump s first acts was to withdraw the united states from the trans pacific partnership which the obama administration had played such a pivotal role in helping to negotiate since sri lanka is not a tpp member i will not be labour this point except to say that almost every american business person working in asia regrets this act of unilateral disarmament particularly since the trump administration has not moved to negotiate bilateral or multilateral agreements to fill the gap second there is a general perception across most of the asia pacific that the us places less of a priority on asia than under president obama unlike obama trump has attended only one of the east asia and apec summits one of the few leaders to do so trump administration the president s absence is magnified by the trump administration s painfully slow progress in filling sub cabinet and ambassadorial positions just to take two examples of relevance to all of you more than two and a half years into trump s four year term we still do not have assistant secretaries of state for either east asia or south and central asia these are the point persons who are responsible for developing and executing our policy in these regions and who supervise the work of our ambassadors and their interagency teams in these regions you all recall i was a s for sca under obama obama took office in january congress approved my nomination in june of the same year us sri lanka relations let me now turn to us sri lankan relations as the us china and other influential countries like india japan and australia all jockey for influence in asia sri lanka is in an excellent position to benefit from and even play off these countries against each other your strategic location on the busiest shipping lanes your democratic character and your economic openness make sri lanka an attractive partner but of course there are also caveats let me first give a brief assessment of us sri lankan relations and then offer some advice about how sri lanka can best capitalize on and benefit from the growing strategic stakes of the world in the indo pacific the current government s embrace of the need for reconciliation and healing after sri lanka s 26 year conflict has enabled steady progress in us sri lankan relations over the last several years the us and sri lanka now have regular constructive high level diplomatic contacts until the us withdrew from the unhrc we worked together to co sponsor unhrc resolutions on sri lanka and other matters turning an area of friction into opportunities for collaboration i am pleased that our military to military relations have progressed substantially from the days when i was ambassador in the last years of the war in 2008 and 2009 human rights concern almost completely circumscribed our military exercises training and assistance with the sri lankan army and air force i had to fight hard to maintain even small areas of navy to navy cooperation in part by arguing that it was in our interest to help sri lanka interdict ltte arms shipments today i am happy those restrictions are behind us our two militaries train together in areas ranging from maritime security to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief the us has announced plans for new security assistance of 39 million to sri lanka to support maritime security freedom of navigation and maritime domain awareness in 2018 the u s transferred a u s coast guard cutter to the sri lankan navy and we have regular joint training and exercises with all the services all these are signs of a healthy and growing military partnership likewise our law enforcement cooperation has strengthened there is no better sign of that than the quick and substantial fbi response to sri lanka s request for assistance in its investigation of the easter sunday bombings our economic relations likewise have seen welcome progress over the past ten years our two way trade has increased by 40 percent to 3 2 billion and the united states remains sri lanka s largest export market u s companies have invested more than 300 million in sri lanka generating high quality jobs for sri lanka s people another welcome sign of progress is that talks are proceeding well on a new millennium challenge corporation compact with sri lanka on april 25 the mcc board approved a new compact agreement for sri lanka that is designed to expand economic opportunities and reduce poverty here this is a strong signal of confidence four days after the easter bombings here these decisions are made only after careful study of underlying governance trends i had the dubious pleasure when i was ambassador of canceling a planned compact in 2008 because of declining governance indicators this new compact is therefore a concrete signal of u s confidence but also one that will depend on sri lanka s adroit handling of the post easter crisis aftermath easter bombings let me now turn to some thoughts about how sri lanka can sustain progress in its relations with the us particularly given the new challenges posed by the terrible easter sunday bombings my old boss deputy secretary of state bill burns who is probably the most respected american diplomat of this generation used to joke that us diplomats are never shy about giving advice often when it is unwelcome the easter attacks were not just personal tragedies for the families of those killed and wounded they opened old wounds still fresh from sri lanka s 26 year civil conflict and they raised new questions in the minds of potential business partners about the wisdom of doing business in sri lanka what steps should sri lanka take to successfully manage these new challenges and sustain its progress of the last ten years job one of course must be to pursue with vigour the investigation into who was responsible what links they had to outside terrorist groups how the bombers were able to mount such a sophisticated and well coordinated series of attacks in multiple cities without detection from your intelligence and security services and what networks may remain so the sri lankan people can be sure the threat has abated one priority during this phase of investigating and hopefully wrapping up any remaining terrorist elements must be for the government and security services to conduct investigations in a professional and impartial manner that respects the rights of all sri lankans and does not inadvertently add to the problem the government should also make every effort to limit scope and duration of emergency regulations sri lanka can learn from mistakes america made after 9 11 most civil liberties experts believe the us over reacted by expanding government surveillance without appropriate constitutional checks by extended detentions at guantánamo bay that circumscribed the legal rights of detainees by extraordinary renditions and interrogations all of which gave rise to questions of what the limits of government power should be in times of crisis our system of checks and balances ultimately righted most of these wrongs and the press had a powerful role to play in exposing excesses and wrong doing sri lanka can also benefit from another us lesson learned after 9 11 one of our mistakes was that there was poor communication and intelligence sharing between the cia fbi and other agencies to improve interagency communication and cooperation the bush white house established a working group of senior technocrats from all the intelligence and law enforcement agencies this group met regularly to evaluate all intelligence from all sources and agree on responsibility for follow up on specific threats the group was headed by dnsa john brennan who reported directly to the president sri lanka could benefit from a similar high level group sri lanka must also be careful not to allow isis or other extreme islamic groups to take root although the precise role of isis in the attacks remains to be investigated one must ask why sri lanka proved a tempting target of opportunity first they may have calculated that since muslim christian relations have historically been good and extreme islamic thought has never gained wide favour on the island they and ntj could organize with undue scrutiny secondly they probably calculated that the security forces have relaxed their efforts since 2009 and to the extent they were still concerned that concern was more likely on preventing a revival of the ltte having suffered the loss of their self proclaimed caliphate and territory in iraq and syria isis must show its followers it is still relevant and strong without a central caliphate isis is metastasizing into smaller units wherever opportunities present themselves one is in the southern philippines where they are seeking a beach head in se asia but they also looking to use bombings such as those in sri lanka to sow discord between muslim christian and other communities that they can then exploit for their evil ends sri lanka cannot allow that to happen which brings me to my third recommendation which is that sri lanka needs to give new focus and priority to reconciliation and good governance easter sunday bombings the easter sunday bombings opened a potential new divide in sri lanka s already complex ethnic amalgam sri lanka continues to debate the pace and scope of reforms aimed at reconciliation between sinhalese and tamils some tensions remain as important priorities such as a truth and reconciliation commission reparations and accountability remain on the drawing board even as sinhalese tamil reconciliation remains a work in progress the easter bombings threaten to open new wounds and cleavages in sri lankan society and raise new questions will the attack on st anthony s church in batticaloa rekindle memories of the tamil muslim violence in the east during the country s civil war will extremist sinhalese buddhist groups seek to exploit popular anger about the attacks to renew their attacks on muslims as we saw most recently in kandy in may of last year will christians themselves the victims of muslim and sinhalese buddhist violence seek their own retribution this complex and combustible mix requires the country to come together for a national dialogue given the political chasm and open antipathy between the president and prime minister careful thought must be given as to who might lead such efforts two good places to start would be sri lanka s religious leaders and its youth groups cardinal ranjith has managed the aftermath of the attacks with considerable aplomb and grace and there is a long history interfaith dialogue that can help bring these disparate communities together and reduce tensions with tensions high and the possibility that social media can be misused to spread false rumours the communities would be wise to set up an early warning system to monitor rumours and then have senior religious figures quickly deny these this system has worked well in eastern indonesia likewise i was impressed that after the war youth groups like sri lanka unites sprang up to counter extremist narratives and engage sri lanka s youth so they became part of the solution but religious leaders and young people can only do so much the government itself has a crucial role to play to heal old and fresh wounds every sri lankan citizen should be able to count on equal justice and no group that breaks the law or violates the rights of other citizens should be above the law renewed thought should be given to increasing tamil and muslim recruits in the country s security services so they more accurately reflect sri lankan society as a whole the same should be done with the civil service islamophobia already on the rise in india and my own country should not be allowed to take root in sri lanka in the end any country s response must depend not on its political leaders who too often succumb to the temptation to defend narrow party and personal interests but rather on the strength of its institutions the recent constitutional crisis underlined the critical role of independent institutions like the constitutional council and the judiciary their continued independence will be an important part of restoring faith in sri lanka s ability to recover and prosper economic reforms let me now turn to the business climate international business looks to invest in countries that offer not only economic opportunity but also stability and predictability sri lanka s strategic location its relatively open market and its relatively well educated work force certainly will bring international business to your door but then they will measure the relative merits and risks of doing business here versus in huge and growing markets such as india or asean and sri lanka will often be found wanting in such comparisons certainly sri lanka has made impressive progress to boost its tourism sector that will face new challenges after the recent bombings apparel exports continue to thrive but efforts to diversify sources of growth beyond these areas have yielded little what to do with your relatively small market you must compensate by having world class openness and ease of doing business sri lanka is ranked 100 among 190 economies according to the latest world bank ease of doing business ratings it is true that sri lanka improved to 100 in 2018 from 111 in 2017 but 100 is still far too low to draw investors away from more attractive opportunities elsewhere india for example is 23 points better and prime minister modi has vowed that india will get to 50 countries such as uzbekistan albania and mongolia are still further up the rankings from sri lankahandicapped by what inevitably will be investor security apprehensions the country should therefore undertake efforts to work not only with the world bank to undertake more systematic reform efforts but benchmark those against those of nearby competitors like vietnam and india in the same vein more fundamental reforms are needed to address corruption transparency international ranks sri lanka 89 on its corruption perception index countries such as china belarus and cuba that any knowledgeable observer might guess would rank below sri lanka in fact rank above that should not be third as ai iot robotics and other new technologies shape the 21st century business future that future will belong to the educated in his influential new book on ai superpowers kai fu lee who headed google s ai efforts in china then started vcs in ai companies first in china then silicon valley predicts that the us and china will dominate ai because both generate huge and growing amounts have data have universities training world class engineers and have vcs to power further investment countries like sri lanka that want to succeed in this increasingly competitive environment will be wise to invest in their own universities who can then partner with us and chinese companies to support the research that can catalyze sri lanka specific ai growth unfettered pure research still matters credit suisse report that although china accounted for nearly one third of the world s 326 startups valued at us 1 billion or more its share of unicorns in sectors requiring more advanced scientific research capability such as ai big data robotics and software was just 14 percent compared to 40 percent in the us let me give another example from my own country erie pennsylvania which most people associate with the rust belt and aging uncompetitive factories most big factories there indeed have closed in recent years but the city is rebuilding itself around its local universities and a big insurance company profits from a big gambling casino in erie county are funneled partly to innovation spaces at four local campuses that are enabling erie to re invent itself sri lanka can do the same companies like accenture already are operating here to help your export oriented companies maintain their competitive edge sri lanka should prioritize developing partnerships with us universities that will enable bright young sri lankans to get degrees in ai iot cyber security and other fields that will increasingly underline growth and competitiveness in this century companies like coursera can offer intermediate solutions through online courses offered by our best universities as well as companies such as google and cyber security specialists palo alto network let me conclude on a note of optimism sri lanka stands to benefit from the us and chinese competition for influence in the asia pacific but it will need strong and unified political leadership to fully investigate the easter bombings an even handed security approach and a new commitment to reconciliation that will insulate sri lanka from efforts by isis or others to exploit religious differences to expand their hate filled influence even as sri lanka grapples with these shorter term challenges it must take active measures to establish the university and business partnerships that can position the country to ride rather than be overtaken by the opportunities presented by ai and other new technologies these are tall challenges but sri lanka has overcome worse
former us ambassador to sri lanka and currently senior director india and south asia of mclartyassociates based in washington d c robert o blake jr delivered a speech at the pathfinder foundation joint apparel association forum of sri lanka as second in the series of seminars held in bmich on may 7 the following is robert o blake s full presentation i return to sri lanka with mixed emotions it is wonderful to be back in sri lanka and to see the many positive changes that have taken place in the ten years since i departed sri lanka and i appreciate the hospitality and leadership of my old friend milinda and the dynamic role of the pathfinder foundation but i and sri lanka s many friends in the us were also deeply saddened by the horrific easter sunday attacks that took the lives of so many and threatened to open new cleavages in sri lanka milinda asked me to talk about sri lanka s place in the administration s indo pacific vision as we look ahead how china is viewed in the us and the implications of all this for the future of us sl relations if there is any one thing that has changed dramatically in the last 10 years it is the growing predominance of china in asia on many fronts and the hostile and increasingly bipartisan reaction to these developments in washington everyone seems to focus on the trade frictions between the us and china but that is just one facet of a much larger and increasingly hostile competition between the us and china washington s list of concerns includes but is not limited to the following the influence of china s belt and road initiative and the debt labour and other impacts it has had on recipient countries china s militarization of disputed islands in the south china sea china s growing surveillance state powered by artificial intelligence and propagated by companies such as huawei chinese theft of us company intellectual property chinese cyber attacks and cyber theft china s suppression of its uighur population the growing role of the chinese communist party and soes the widening gap between what chinese citizens and companies can do in the west as against what westerners are permitted in china underlying many of these concerns is a growing understanding that the us may have made a misguided strategic bet about china when then president clinton made the case that the us should support china s entry into the wto even though china was not yet a market economy he and most americans myself included believed that as china prospered as its middle class grew as more and more chinese travelled and studied abroad china would over time become more of a market economy and become more democratic today most americans see that this strategic calculation was wrong under xi jinping we have seen a strengthening of the role of the communist party a doubling down on the role of the state and soes in china s economy and the strengthening of china s surveillance state not only is china not a more liberal market economy it is often seeking to promote its illiberal governance model overseas belt and road initiative most asian countries acknowledge and even share many of these concerns but they also do not want to be

investigated one must ask why sri lanka proved a tempting target of opportunity first they may have calculated that since muslim christian relations have historically been good and extreme islamic thought has never gained wide favour on the island they and ntj could organize with undue scrutiny secondly they probably calculated that the security forces have relaxed their efforts since 2009 and to the extent they were still concerned that concern was more likely on preventing a revival of the ltte having suffered the loss of their self proclaimed caliphate and territory in iraq and syria isis must show its followers it is still relevant and strong without a central caliphate isis is metastasizing into smaller units wherever opportunities present themselves one is in the southern philippines where they are seeking a beach head in se asia but they also looking to use bombings such as those in sri lanka to sow discord between muslim christian and other communities that they can then exploit for their evil ends sri lanka cannot allow that to happen which brings me to my third recommendation which is that sri lanka needs to give new focus and priority to reconciliation and good governance easter sunday bombings the easter sunday bombings opened a potential new divide in sri lanka s already complex ethnic amalgam sri lanka continues to debate the pace and scope of reforms aimed at reconciliation between sinhalese and tamils some tensions remain as important priorities such as a truth and reconciliation commission reparations and accountability remain on the drawing board even as sinhalese tamil reconciliation remains a work in progress the easter bombings threaten to open new wounds and cleavages in sri lankan society and raise new questions will the attack on st anthony s church in batticaloa rekindle memories of the tamil muslim violence in the east during the country s civil war will extremist sinhalese buddhist groups seek to exploit popular anger about the attacks to renew their attacks on muslims as we saw most recently in kandy in may of last year will christians themselves the victims of muslim and sinhalese buddhist violence seek their own retribution this complex and combustible mix requires the country to come together for a national dialogue given the political chasm and open antipathy between the president and prime minister careful thought must be given as to who might lead such efforts two good places to start would be sri lanka s religious leaders and its youth groups cardinal ranjith has managed the aftermath of the attacks with considerable aplomb and grace and there is a long history interfaith dialogue that can help bring these disparate communities together and reduce tensions with tensions high and the possibility that social media can be misused to spread false rumours the communities would be wise to set up an early warning system to monitor rumours and then have senior religious figures quickly deny these this system has worked well in eastern indonesia likewise i was impressed that after the war youth groups like sri lanka unites sprang up to counter extremist narratives and engage sri lanka s youth so they became part of the solution but religious leaders and young people can only do so much the government itself has a crucial role to play to heal old and fresh wounds every sri lankan citizen should be able to count on equal justice and no group that breaks the law or violates the rights of other citizens should be above the law renewed thought should be given to increasing tamil and muslim recruits in the country s security services so they more accurately reflect sri lankan society as a whole the same should be done with the civil service islamophobia already on the rise in india and my own country should not be allowed to take root in sri lanka in the end any country s response must depend not on its political leaders who too often succumb to the temptation to defend narrow party and personal interests but rather on the strength of its institutions the recent constitutional crisis underlined the critical role of independent institutions like the constitutional council and the judiciary their continued independence will be an important part of restoring faith in sri lanka s ability to recover and prosper economic reforms let me now turn to the business climate international business looks to invest in countries that offer not only economic opportunity but also stability and predictability sri lanka s strategic location its relatively open market and its relatively well educated work force certainly will bring international business to your door but then they will measure the relative merits and risks of doing business here versus in huge and growing markets such as india or asean and sri lanka will often be found wanting in such comparisons certainly sri lanka has made impressive progress to boost its tourism sector that will face new challenges after the recent bombings apparel exports continue to thrive but efforts to diversify sources of growth beyond these areas have yielded little what to do with your relatively small market you must compensate by having world class openness and ease of doing business sri lanka is ranked 100 among 190 economies according to the latest world bank ease of doing business ratings it is true that sri lanka improved to 100 in 2018 from 111 in 2017 but 100 is still far too low to draw investors away from more attractive opportunities elsewhere india for example is 23 points better and prime minister modi has vowed that india will get to 50 countries such as uzbekistan albania and mongolia are still further up the rankings from sri lankahandicapped by what inevitably will be investor security apprehensions the country should therefore undertake efforts to work not only with the world bank to undertake more systematic reform efforts but benchmark those against those of nearby competitors like vietnam and india in the same vein more fundamental reforms are needed to address corruption transparency international ranks sri lanka 89 on its corruption perception index countries such as china belarus and cuba that any knowledgeable observer might guess would rank below sri lanka in fact rank above that should not be third as ai iot robotics and other new technologies shape the 21st century business future that future will belong to the educated in his influential new book on ai superpowers kai fu lee who headed google s ai efforts in china then started vcs in ai companies first in china then silicon valley predicts that the us and china will dominate ai because both generate huge and growing amounts have data have universities training world class engineers and have vcs to power further investment countries like sri lanka that want to succeed in this increasingly competitive environment will be wise to invest in their own universities who can then partner with us and chinese companies to support the research that can catalyze sri lanka specific ai growth unfettered pure research still matters credit suisse report that although china accounted for nearly one third of the world s 326 startups valued at us 1 billion or more its share of unicorns in sectors requiring more advanced scientific research capability such as ai big data robotics and software was just 14 percent compared to 40 percent in the us let me give another example from my own country erie pennsylvania which most people associate with the rust belt and aging uncompetitive factories most big factories there indeed have closed in recent years but the city is rebuilding itself around its local universities and a big insurance company profits from a big gambling casino in erie county are funneled partly to innovation spaces at four local campuses that are enabling erie to re invent itself sri lanka can do the same companies like accenture already are operating here to help your export oriented companies maintain their competitive edge sri lanka should prioritize developing partnerships with us universities that will enable bright young sri lankans to get degrees in ai iot cyber security and other fields that will increasingly underline growth and competitiveness in this century companies like coursera can offer intermediate solutions through online courses offered by our best universities as well as companies such as google and cyber security specialists palo alto network let me conclude on a note of optimism sri lanka stands to benefit from the us and chinese competition for influence in the asia pacific but it will need strong and unified political leadership to fully investigate the easter bombings an even handed security approach and a new commitment to reconciliation that will insulate sri lanka from efforts by isis or others to exploit religious differences to expand their hate filled influence even as sri lanka grapples with these shorter term challenges it must take active measures to establish the university and business partnerships that can position the country to ride rather than be overtaken by the opportunities presented by ai and other new technologies these are tall challenges but sri lanka has overcome worse

financial measures see pages 2 and 15 for further information nutrien s first quarter adjusted ebitda was 22 percent higher than 2018 despite being impacted by the second wettest six month period in the us in 125 years while some regions are still receiving excess moisture planting is underway and we expect strong crop input demand in the second quarter as such we are maintaining our annual guidance for 2019 commented chuck magro nutrien s president and ceo our organization is focused on what it can control and how best to deliver long term value to stakeholders in the first quarter we allocated almost 1 billion towards growing our retail business in core markets and repurchased over 800 million of our stock we also continue to pursue operational enhancements across our world class integrated network and to lead the way in digital transformation of the ag retail industry added mr magro highlights retail ebitda in the first quarter was lower compared to the same period last year due to an extremely wet spring season and flooding in parts of the us continued progress was made on nutrien ag solutions digital platform with customers representing 58 percent of our north american retail sales signed up on the platform within nine months of launch potash ebitda was 41 percent higher in the first quarter compared to the same period last year due to higher net selling prices and strong offshore demand partially offset by lower north american sales nitrogen ebitda in the first quarter was slightly higher than the same period last year due mainly to higher urea and uan prices being offset by lower total sales volumes resulting from the excess wet weather across the us we strengthened our us retail business including the acquisitions of actagro llc van horn inc and security seed and chemical inc and completing the remainder of the agrichem acquisition in brazil with combined annual revenue of approximately 400 million for these businesses we also entered into a binding agreement to acquire ruralco holdings limited the third largest agriculture retailer in australia nutrien achieved 621 million in annual run rate synergies as at march 31 2019 surpassing the target of

all references to per share amounts pertain to diluted net earnings loss per share and all financial data are stated in millions of us dollars unless otherwise noted market outlook agriculture and retail trade disruptions continue to impact north american growers us soybean exports to china are down 55 percent year over year while china has also placed import restrictions on two of canada s largest canola exporters unfavorable weather in the us since the fourth quarter of 2018 has narrowed the application window however the us department of agriculture usda projects corn plantings will reach nearly 93 million acres which would be the highest since 2016 and favorable for nutrient demand seed expenditures and custom application services we expect a two to four percent increase in north american crop protection expenditures in 2019 due to higher corn acreage and increased weed pressure this year given the limited ability for growers to use post harvest applications last fall seed expenditures are also expected to be supported by increased corn acreage in the us crop nutrient markets global potash market fundamentals have remained strong as suppliers are comfortably sold forward in 2019 and canpotex is fully committed until june we maintain our forecast that 2019 deliveries will be between 67 and 69 million tonnes underpinned by good affordability in the us and most key offshore markets particularly in brazil and china while weak palm oil prices are a headwind for demand in southeast asia we believe the downside risks are relatively limited as potash is applied on a wide range of crops in the region we expect strong nitrogen demand to emerge in the second quarter of 2019 from the us europe and latin america in the us we expect overall nitrogen demand will be at historically strong levels in the second and third quarter with some weather related product mix shift towards urea and uan as opposed to ammonia in recent weeks this has led to nola urea prices increasing by almost 50 per tonne from february lows slow global demand and lower input costs pressured phosphate prices over the past quarter although we expect some support from an improvement in demand in latin america india and the us in the second quarter financial outlook and guidance based on the market factors detailed above we are maintaining 2019 adjusted net earnings guidance of 2 80 to 3 20 per share and adjusted ebitda guidance of 4 4 billion to 4 9 billion first half 2019 guidance is provided at 1 75 to 1 95 adjusted net earnings per share as the 2019 guidance has not changed

taxes and depreciation and amortization non ifrs measures are a numerical measure of a company s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with ifrs in evaluating these measures investors should consider that the methodology applied in calculating such measures may differ among companies and analysts management believes the non ifrs measures provide transparent and useful supplemental information to investors in order that they may evaluate nutrien s financial performance using the same measures as management as a valuation measurement ebitda excludes the effects of items that primarily reflect the impact of long term investment and financing decisions rather than the performance of our day to day operations and as a measure of our ability to service debt and to meet other payment obligations this non ifrs financial measure should not be considered

sales are more evenly distributed throughout the year the results of this seasonality have a corresponding effect on trade and rebates receivables inventories prepaid expenses and other current assets and trade payables our short term debt also fluctuates during the year to meet working capital needs the company s cash collections generally occur after the application season is complete while customer prepayments are concentrated in december and january note 12 related party transactions the company sells potash from its canadian mines for use outside canada and the united states

it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration leases are recognized as right of use rou assets and corresponding liabilities at the date at which a leased asset is available for use lease payments are allocated between finance costs calculated using the effective interest method and a reduction of the liability rou assets are depreciated over the shorter of the asset s useful life and the lease term on a straight line basis rou assets are measured at cost less any impairments including the initial measurement of lease liability any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease incentives received any initial direct costs and an estimate of costs if any to be incurred by the company in restoring the underlying asset to the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease liabilities arising from a lease are initially measured as the net present value of the future lease payments including fixed payments including in substance fixed payments less any lease incentives variable lease payments that are based on an index or a rate amounts expected to be payable under residual value guarantees the exercise price of a purchase option if the company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and payments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the company exercising that option in recording rou assets and related liabilities at inception of a lease lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate cannot be determined an incremental borrowing rate is used being a rate that the company would have to pay to borrow the funds required to obtain a similar asset adjusted for term security asset value and the borrower s economic environment the carrying amount of rou assets and lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification of the lease a change in the lease term a change in the in substance fixed lease payments a change in the expected amount under a residual value guarantee or a change in the assessment to exercise a purchase extension or termination option payments for short term leases and leases of low value assets are expensed on a straight line basis short term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less that do not contain a purchase option low value assets generally comprise it equipment and office furniture method of adoption the company adopted ifrs 16 using the modified retrospective method which in the company s case resulted in prospective application as there was no impact to opening retained earnings on transition under this method of adoption the company measured the rou asset equal to the lease liability and used the company s incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of future lease payments the company has chosen to apply practical expedients including the use of a single discount rate for a portfolio of leases with reasonably similar characteristics reliance on previous assessments as to whether lease contracts are onerous exclusion of initial direct costs in measuring rou assets at the date of initial application the election not to separate non lease components and instead to account for lease and non lease components as a single arrangement recognition exemptions for short term and low value leases use of hindsight in assessing lease terms and grandfathering of the lease definition on transition adoption of ifrs 16 did not result in any material impact to net earnings for the three months ended march 31 2019 until january 1 2019 substantially all of the company s leases were classified as operating leases under ias 17 leases with payments expensed on a straight line basis over the lease term the company s leasing activities major categories of assets leased by the company are railcars and marine vessels used to transport product to customers real estate used as office space storage and distribution and mobile equipment primarily used to deliver and apply product and to meet with customers railcars are utilized in north america and include general service and high pressure tank cars and general purpose hopper cars railcars are sourced from multiple suppliers and terms vary by lease agreement for railcars required in its operations the company has a history of renegotiating new leases at termination of existing leases marine vessels include ocean going vessels used to transport ammonia from the company s nitrogen facilities in trinidad the company leases real estate across its operations consisting of office space and product storage and distribution sites real estate leases have varying terms by location and use of the property and are normally renewable at market rates most storage and distribution leases do not convey a right to use a specific identified space and accordingly these are not classified as leases under ifrs 16 and are expensed according to the lease terms the company s retail segment leases a fleet of motor vehicles and product application equipment and other transportation equipment motor vehicle leases primarily have a 50 month initial term and are renewable annually thereafter the company expects to renew all its retail motor vehicle leases for substantially all of the useful life of the equipment the company seeks to maximize operational flexibility in managing its leasing activities by including extension options when negotiating new leases extension options are exercisable at the option of the company and not by the lessors in determining if a renewal period should be included in the lease term the company considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise a renewal including the location of the asset the availability of suitable alternatives the significance of the asset to operations and its business strategy lease agreements do not contain significant covenants however leased assets may be used as security for lease liabilities and other borrowings accounting estimates and judgments applied in leasing activities judgment is required to determine whether a contract or arrangement includes a lease and if it is reasonably certain that an extension option will be exercised estimation is used to determine the lease term and the appropriate rate to discount the lease payments supporting information the following table summarizes the impact of adopting ifrs 16 on the condensed consolidated financial statements condensed consolidated balance sheet

press release hansard questions to ministers question no 1 education 1 jan tinetti labour to the minister of education is he confident that recent incentives for teacher recruitment and training will address projected teacher shortages in coming years if so why hon chris hipkins minister of education yes the ministry of education s forecasted estimates of the number of additional teachers needed to meet demand are based on nothing additional being done to address teacher supply in the meantime they show that for primary the gap was forecast to be closed by 2023 but for secondary we would need 2 210 additional teachers by 2025 what the government has put in place since it came into office will provide funding to attract an additional 4 000 primary and secondary teachers over the next four years and that does not include the 1 500 teachers who have been supported to undertake refresher training jan tinetti what other claims has he heard in regards to the number of teachers needed to meet demand hon chris hipkins it has been claimed that up to 8 000 additional teachers are needed by 2025 using that same forecast data it appears that calculation has been done by adding together each year on top of the other which is wrong these annual figures are not compounding if a single role is not filled for two years in a row we don t need to recruit two additional teachers to fill the one role as i ve said with the ministry forecast estimates of the number of teachers needed based on nothing being done to address supply for primary that gap would be closed by 2023 in any event and for secondary the gap is around 2 210 question no 2 prime minister 2 hon paula bennett deputy leader national to the prime minister does she stand by all her government s statements policies and actions rt hon winston peters deputy prime minister on behalf of the prime minister on behalf of the prime minister yes in their context hon paula bennett does the government have a policy to build 100 000 affordable houses over 10 years rt hon winston peters yes on behalf of the prime minister it most definitely does hon paula bennett then why in recent days has the prime minister been reluctant to actually verify that it will be 100 000 houses over 10 years rt hon winston peters the reality is in many businesses getting the start up is not so easy at the beginning obviously for example in the second world war before the battle of speaker order rt hon winston peters thank you mr speaker before the battle of el alamein we hadn t won one battle and thereafter we didn t lose one and we will get going on this project of course we are reconsidering it and when we have made the decisions we ll announce them and the target of 100 000 over 10 years is easily achievable hon paula bennett why if she is confirming today that they are keeping the 100 000 target within 10 years has her minister been backing away from that target rapidly in the last few days and she herself in previous days has been reluctant to confirm it rt hon winston peters on behalf of the prime minister i think if you re looking at the housing situation in this country you ve got to look at the problem holistically whether it s tenements or housing the greatest construction charge on right now is happening under this administration the highest in a record 44 year performance in that setting kiwibuild has got to be reconstructed as well hon paula bennett is the prime minister aware that 1 000 state houses were completed in the 2017 18 financial year practically double that of any previous year for which records are available and that all of these houses were initiated under a previous national government rt hon winston peters on behalf of the prime minister i most definitely can t confirm the premise behind that question but i can say this under that administration that she spoke for 6 500 state houses were sold hon paula bennett what does she say in reply to the deputy prime minister who in january stated the reality is there are many in this government who are seriously committed to ensure we do meet our targets i am going back to former governments where practical men who had never been to university and women decided they would get on with the job and get it done and get it done we are rt hon winston peters on behalf of the prime minister most definitely i agree with the deputy prime minister s statement which was not just aspirational but the intention is to make this country great again question no 3 housing and urban development 3 hon judith collins national papakura to the minister of housing and urban development does the government continue to pledge to build 100 000 affordable homes over the next 10 years through its kiwibuild programme as stated in the speech from the throne hon phil twyford minister of housing and urban development there has been no change to the pledge since the speech from the throne as i said yesterday cabinet will consider the kiwibuild reset in june and it s inappropriate for me to speculate on what cabinet may or may not decide what has changed is that the housing market and the programme need to respond when we came to office we stopped the sale of existing homes to foreign buyers and we closed tax loopholes and we know that this has had an impact because first home buyers now make up 24 percent of the market and wages are now growing faster than house prices hon judith collins then why did he tell the media yesterday that the target was like american nuclear ships it is a neither confirm nor deny situation hon phil twyford simply because we said that we would review the kiwibuild programme and in fact the entire housing programme cabinet has yet to make decisions and it s inappropriate for me to speculate on what cabinet may or may not decide but meanwhile we are getting on with building affordable houses state houses and housing the homeless hon judith collins what responsibility does he take for the design of kiwibuild that he took to cabinet in december 2017 which he has now told us has to be reset hon phil twyford of course as the minister i take responsibility but this is not an easy thing to do if it was easy perhaps the former government might ve had a crack at it it s a difficult thing no government in 40 years has tried to do what we are doing and that is work with the private sector to build affordable houses hon judith collins is it acceptable for him to sign contracts worth around 700 million for housing and then when these contracts start falling over to essentially explain that he s going to have to reset and is just learning on the job hon phil twyford well first i don t sign the contracts second those contracts are not falling over they are delivering affordable houses hon judith collins can any policy that doesn t include a target to build 100 000 houses really be called kiwibuild when the first words of his first press release that he put out on kiwibuild were the government s kiwibuild initiative will deliver 100 000 affordable houses over the next 10 years hon phil twyford we are not deterred by the teething problems that kiwibuild has faced we are committed to building affordable houses we will do everything in our power as a government to turn the market around to give young kiwi families the opportunity they ve been denied for the last decade and we re not ashamed about working with private industry to deliver those outcomes hon chris hipkins what reports has he seen on recent positive changes in the housing market that affect potential first home buyers hon phil twyford when we came to office we stopped the sale of existing homes to foreign buyers and we closed the tax loopholes that turbocharged property speculation we know this has had an impact because first home buyers now make up 24 percent of the market the highest share of the market since 2007 and overseas buyers have dropped by 81 percent i ve seen reports recently that wages are now growing faster than house prices this compares to 2016 when house prices rose 16 percent and wages rose just 1 8 percent this government s sound economic management means that mortgage rates are as low as they ve been in a very long time rt hon winston peters how could the overseas buyership have dropped by 81 percent when the previous government claimed their influence to be only 3 percent hon phil twyford well the previous government denied that overseas buyers were having any kind of speaker order order i ve sort of worked out there s no responsibility for that and the maths is a bit questionable too frankly hon judith collins so how many of the first home buyers over the last 18 months that he s referred to have accessed the homestart programme established by national rather than the kiwibuild programme established by himself hon phil twyford well i think it s pretty obvious to most people that the homestart programme has been going for a while and we support it the kiwibuild programme is just getting off the ground and believe me kiwibuild homestart and all the other things that this government is committed to doing will make a massive difference because we are standing up for young first home buyers in a way that that government never ever did for nine years hon judith collins does the minister stand by his statement to media last year when questioned on the design of the kiwibuild programme that he offered to stake his job on its success and if he does then has he offered his resignation to the prime minister yet hon phil twyford i have not because i m utterly focused on getting the reset of kiwibuild right and i take a lot of pride as do all my colleagues in the government in what we are achieving across the whole housing programme we ve got more than 2 000 new public houses built since we ve been in government that is a huge achievement we have increased the amount of emergency and transitional housing we stopped the sell off of state housing that that government was doing that government reduced the number of state houses by 6 500 in the middle of a housing crisis we re committed to increasing the stock of state housing by 6 500 in our first four years question no 4 workplace relations and safety 4 kieran mcanulty labour to the minister for workplace relations and safety what changes to employment law came into effect this week hon iain lees galloway minister for workplace relations and safety the most substantial parts of the employment relations amendment act came into force on monday these changes rebalance our employment relations system by reinstating workers rights to tea breaks restoring the balance in collective bargaining restoring protection for vulnerable workers and limiting 90 day trials to businesses with fewer than 20 employees this government is delivering for working people and putting a human face on capitalism kieran mcanulty why make the changes hon iain lees galloway this is a government that believes that everyone deserves a fair day s pay for a fair day s work and these changes will help achieve that they achieve the right balance providing strong safeguards and rights to workers while maintaining certainty and flexibility for employers kieran mcanulty what further changes are planned hon iain lees galloway next week the education and workforce committee is due to report back the historic equal pay amendment bill we are well under way on increasing the minimum wage to 20 per hour officials are doing excellent work to progress fair pay agreements and film industry changes alongside this the government is supporting businesses through r d tax credits and the provincial growth fund this government is building a productive sustainable and inclusive economy that delivers good jobs decent work conditions and fair wages question no 5 finance 5 david seymour leader act to the minister of finance does he agree with baker tilly staples rodway that tax freedom day 2019 is five days later than when his government took office because taxes have grown faster than the economy and what plans if any does he have to reduce the tax burden faced by new zealanders hon dr david clark associate minister of finance on behalf of the minister of finance no the government is acting already to reduce the pressure on new zealand families and businesses through the 5 5 billion families package through putting an end to unnecessary secondary tax through the introduction of the r d tax credit through making the tax system fairer by targeting multinationals and through cutting acc levies to save businesses and their customers 100 million over the next two years while at the same time increasing investment in our roads and rail rebuilding our rundown hospitals and schools investing in our regions and investing in more police more nurses and more teachers to fix the deficits and the mess left after nine long years of neglect david seymour is the minister denying the most basic mathematical fact that the percentage of gdp taken by government is now higher than it was two years ago hon dr david clark one reason the tax take is growing is because more people are employed under the coalition government than under the previous government that has boosted paye returns another reason is that companies are generating higher profits under this government one reason for a rising nominal tax take is because of more economic activity david seymour does the minister believe that it helps new zealand s competitiveness to have government taking a larger share of the economy than key trading partners such as australia and the united states hon dr david clark if the member is now advocating for a tax system like australia s that is indeed interesting to me it means obviously that he s now in favour of a top personal tax rate of 47 percent and he s probably also advocating for a capital gains tax question no 6 transport 6 hon paul goldsmith national to the minister of transport what major transport projects if any have been delayed significantly modified or cancelled since his government took office hon phil twyford minister of transport as the member knows the prioritisation of projects is a matter for the new zealand transport agency based on the priorities in the government policy statement however i m able to advise the member that no major transport projects that were under construction have been cancelled the new zealand transport agency re evaluated 12 projects including the east west link which would have cost an eye watering 327 million per kilometre instead motorists will see upgrades like median barriers and intersection upgrades and shoulder widening being rolled out across 670 kilometres of our state highway network to save lives hon paul goldsmith i raise a point of order mr speaker speaker yes i m not surprised hon paul goldsmith i asked what major projects he told me there were 12 but that s not very helpful speaker well i think the minister i don t really want him to expand because the answer was longer than necessary but if he got directly to the answer for the areas for which he is responsible he would be more helpful to the house hon phil twyford the list of projects that have been re evaluated include whangarei to te hana cambridge to piarere pokeno to mangatarata piarere to tauriko waihi to omokoroa te puna to omokoroa katikati urban tauriko west ōtaki to north of levin pētone to grenada and the melling interchange hon paul goldsmith so what new major transport projects that have been designed to reduce congestion on our roads have been started since his government took office hon phil twyford we have filled the 5 9 billion hole that the last government left in auckland s transport plan which includes projects like mill road rapid bus services from pāuanui to the airport and the eastern busway and penlink which are all funded and due to go ahead we funded and futureproofed the city rail link in auckland after the last government didn t even adjust its costings for inflation or leave a contingency the transport agency is now actually fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities to keep the public safe on the roads our government is getting on with fixing the long term issues in transport to save lives and get our cities moving again hon paul goldsmith i raise a point of order mr speaker again i asked a simple question what new major projects have been started he didn t list any he listed existing ones that hadn t been started speaker i think he listed one road project and i m not going to get into trying to establish from the chair whether a project is a new project or not the minister is responsible for his answer rt hon winston peters can i ask the minister on becoming the minister responsible in his first month with respect to the much vaunted four lane highway between whangarei and te hana how many dollars had been allocated to that plan hon phil twyford well that s very interesting the answer to that question is that the national party had promised a four lane expressway from wellsford to whangarei that would have cost 5 billion more than the entire transport spend in one year and not a single dollar was budgeted for hon paul goldsmith does he have any sympathy for kiwis stuck in traffic who have seen 12 major projects delayed or downgraded but not one new project actually started hon phil twyford well here is the number of roads that are being built the manawatū gorge replacement route mt messenger bypass the state highway 1 loop road in northland the matakana link road the awakino tunnel bypass the gills road upgrade and the horsham downs link road the difference between our two polices is that we re investing billions of dollars across the entire transport system instead of pumping 40 percent of the transport budget into five handpicked gold plated expressway projects which is what that government did when it was in office highway projects that carried only 4 percent of vehicle journeys hon paul goldsmith speaking of gold plated speaker order hon paul goldsmith sorry mr speaker have the light rail projects from city to māngere and city to north west for which he announced 1 8 billion seed funding in may 2018 been delayed reset or recalibrated hon phil twyford the light rail projects in auckland which are part of our government s commitment to building modern transport systems in our major cities relieving congestion and giving people genuine choices to move around our urban areas those projects in auckland are to be considered by cabinet and they will be considered but they are part of a commitment that we have to fix the urban transport systems and the deficit in infrastructure that we inherited from that party hon chris hipkins could all of the roads promised by the previous government have been funded within the context of the land transport fund over the next three years or within the current term of parliament without any increase in fuel tax as has been claimed by some hon phil twyford the promises of state highways that were made by that party in the lead up to the last election speaker order areas for which the minister s responsible please hon phil twyford it would not have been possible to fund the projects that the member refers to without a very significant increase in fuel taxes and road user charges the ministry of transport advised the former government that it would have taken a hefty increase in petrol taxes and road user charges and the former minister simon bridges received that advice on the eve of the last election hon paul goldsmith is the reason that the release of the business case for the light rail down dominion road has been delayed because they can t find anybody to come up with a strong business case that stacks up hon phil twyford no hon paul goldsmith does he agree with auckland councillor mike lees assessment mr twyford s version of light rail is kiwibuild on wobbly wheels hon phil twyford well it won t surprise the member to know that i don t agree with mike lee but i m sure that the member understands there are literally dozens of cities around the world right now who are building rapid transit systems including light rail six current light rail rapid transport systems are under way in australia alone because all of these cities are building modern transport systems that give their citizens genuine options congestion free options and provide mobility and access to the things that they need and these are issues that the opposition doesn t even want to hear about hon julie anne genter can the minister confirm that the most effective way to improve travel speeds on the road network is to improve the travel speeds of public transport and that has been demonstrated in cities all around the world the only way to help people get around on the roads is to improve rapid transit hon phil twyford i can speaker no before that occurs i d like the members who interjected during that question to stand up right ok hon phil twyford i can assure the member that it is in fact an established principle of transport planning that the speed of public transport has a direct correlation to the speed of traffic because the better public transport services are and rapid transit the more likely people are to leave their car at home take the train or the bus allowing the motorways and the roads to move more freely that is a fundamental tenet of our transport policy and it s why we re committed to building rapid transit infrastructure and modernising public transport in our cities question no 7 commerce and consumer affairs 7 willow jean prime labour to the minister of commerce and consumer affairs what recent measures has the government announced to protect consumers hon kris faafoi minister of commerce and consumer affairs the government has fast tracked measures to protect consumers in their dealings with both banks and insurers we ve released two options papers seeking feedback on proposed measures to address issues with conduct and culture of financial institutions and with insurance contract law proposed options include a ban on target based remuneration and incentives imposing new legal duties on financial institutions and ensuring products sold to consumers are fit for purpose and sold to the right people this will be supported by new and improved enforcement tools willow jean prime what are these measures in response to hon kris faafoi the measures come in response to the recent reports by the financial markets authority and the reserve bank of new zealand that showed there were major issues in the life insurance sector and poor conduct and culture in the banking sector that needed to be addressed in addition when we came into office we found our insurance contract law is outdated and reform is long overdue for both consumers and for the sector itself the government is committed to making sure that the financial services sector is delivering good outcomes for consumers willow jean prime how soon will these changes be made hon kris faafoi the government wants to provide adequate time for consultation and analysis with stakeholders while at the same time moving the reviews quickly so we can reduce harm to consumers if changes are warranted the aim is for legislation on financial conduct to be introduced by the end of the year and separate legislation on insurance contract law is to be introduced hon gerry brownlee best minister in the government hon kris faafoi next year you might need some insurance for your income soon gerry so you might want to listen this work sits alongside our other legislative changes to the financial services sector such as the financial services legislation amendment bill and it reforms the consumer credit contract laws the government is committed to putting consumers at the heart of decision making so that they can get the best financial outcomes hon gerry brownlee outstanding top minister hon kris faafoi including those who might need some income insurance very soon question no 8 police 8 chris bishop national hutt south to the minister of police did he make the statement to tvnz in december in regard to the matthew dow petition seeking the urgent introduction of random roadside drug testing there s a discussion document that s been approved by cabinet that s going out to the public early next year and if so on what date did cabinet approve the discussion document rt hon winston peters deputy prime minister on behalf of the minister of police in response to media questions on the road toll and drug driving including the one with tvnz on new year s eve i confirm that cabinet decided to undertake public consultation this cabinet decision was made in september cabinet has approved the consultation document and its release is due shortly chris bishop is it correct to say that a consultation document like the minister has just said is the same as the discussion document he mentioned on new year s eve rt hon winston peters on behalf of the minister words do matter but sometimes you can be too picky with words chris bishop why has the discussion document or consultation document to use the minister s words not been released yet when he said it would be released early next year rt hon winston peters on behalf of the minister did he mean early this year or early next year because next year hasn t arrived yet speaker order both sides chris bishop why has the discussion document on roadside drug testing that he told tvnz on new year s eve 2018 would be released early next year i e this year not been released yet rt hon winston peters on behalf of the minister what happened was that getting ready for the release a tragic terrorist event happened on 15 march in christchurch and it so happens that the head of road safety for police mike clement is also the head of police operations in christchurch with respect to that terrorist event that s why it was delayed for a very obvious and understandable reason it will be released shortly chris bishop how on earth can the events of christchurch involving a deputy commissioner that have nothing to do with roadside drug testing have delayed the release of a document that he just told the house was prepared and confirmed in september 2018 rt hon winston peters on behalf of the minister for the most obvious reasons while a document might be prepared its continued refinement may still be central to the government s thinking can i say that why mr mike clement is important is because he heads the police road safety campaign and having said that can i say the previous government since 2009 had done nothing including two cabinet papers that the hon david bennett took on drug driving and they deferred and made no decisions at all chris bishop does he think it is acceptable that when cabinet approves a discussion document on the very important issue of roadside drug testing the government nine months later has not released it to the public despite telling the family of a particular individual killed last year on new year s eve that it would be released early next year rt hon winston peters on behalf of the minister the statement made to the family was always intended to be performed on it will be performed on it will happen but the fact is we had a tragedy the terrorist act on 15 march this year that is understandable but what is not understandable is the appalling misuse of someone s misery for narrow venal political points alastair scott i seek leave of the house for the land transport random oral fluid testing amendment bill in my name to be set down as the first members order of the day on the next members day speaker is there any objection to that yes there is it will not be set down question no 9 regional economic development 9 hon paul goldsmith national to the minister for regional economic development does he stand by all his statements and actions hon david parker minister for economic development on behalf of the minister for regional economic development yes hon paul goldsmith does he stand by his statement in the december 2017 cabinet paper outlining the objectives of the provincial growth fund pgf that the first objective is increased jobs with a focus on high quality jobs and sustainable economic development over the long term hon david parker yes and i m pleased to again advise the member that the provincial development unit officials who contacted pgf funding recipients in february to gather data about job creation tallied 560 new jobs as the most accurate and up to date figure as at that date hon paul goldsmith is he satisfied that the only answer his officials have provided so far to me and the public showing the number of sustained new jobs created by the fund relates to a third of the projects and lists only six jobs hon david parker i am aware of the member s press release to that effect yesterday which said the one straight answer we ve had from the provincial development unit shows that with a third of the projects counted just six permanent sustained jobs have been created it is such an absurd accusation i m surprised that the member was willing to put that out under his name to give but one example the ruapehu alpine lifts have 37 jobs during construction and the wider economic effects of that one project alone will be far more than the miserable six jobs that he thinks the new zealand public is stupid enough to believe is the total hon paul goldsmith i seek to table an email from jarred griffiths to ash battell with a table which shows exactly that six sustained new jobs speaker it s not publicly available hon paul goldsmith no it s dated 11 february 2019 speaker right is there any objection to that email being tabled there appears to be none document by leave laid on the table of the house hon paul goldsmith why are his officials refusing to release the latest figures on the number of sustained new jobs created so far hon david parker the member tries to suggest that jobs that are contractors who are building new infrastructure or new buildings are not jobs they are sustainable jobs in that industry those contractors employ people who are working on these projects that would not have occurred but for the pgf involvement hon paul goldsmith so he thinks halfway through a term relating to a 3 billion fund that even if we went with his upper estimate of 500 jobs including contractors part timers and people who have done speaker order question hon paul goldsmith perhaps one hour it is a good return on that investment hon david parker no that s not what i think what i think is that the member favours tax cuts for the rich and hard right austerity for the regions that s why the provinces withered and social problems grew under his watch we ve got a lot of work to do to fix that laissez faire neglect but we ve started and it s going well question no 10 infrastructure 10 clayton mitchell nz first to the minister for infrastructure what recent announcements has he made regarding the new zealand infrastructure commission te waihanga hon david parker attorney general on behalf of the minister for infrastructure the interim infrastructure commission within treasury has published a pipeline of major infrastructure projects that are coming to market in the next three years the information on those first 174 projects included in that pipeline are worth over 6 billion and this will provide confidence to the private sector to invest and gear up for the efficient delivery of these projects the coalition government has listened to what the infrastructure sector has been advocating for for many years and the new commission will be fully operational by the end of the year clayton mitchell wow that s fantastic what information is included on the infrastructure pipeline hon david parker initially the pipeline includes 174 projects from five capital intensive agencies education health the new zealand transport agency the defence force and corrections these include replacement of the dunedin hospital for over 1 billion the manawatū gorge replacement route project and a 275 million replacement of critical infrastructure at auckland city hospital starship and greenlane clinical centre it contains information as to the cost range of the project as well as estimated time frames for procurement and construction over time the pipeline will be expanded to include projects from all central government agencies as well as local government and large private sector projects the commission will be providing long term visibility of our county s infrastructure needs clayton mitchell fabulous news how will this help deliver better infrastructure and improve the well being of new zealanders hon david parker the pipeline information will give the infrastructure market greater confidence about the timing sequencing and scale of infrastructure projects so it can gear up capacity and capability to deliver we inherited a serious infrastructure deficit and we re focusing on ensuring that our investments are in the right projects at the right time new zealanders rely upon this high quality infrastructure to ensure they can run their businesses efficiently and to underpin their quality of life so the establishment of the new zealand infrastructure commission and the publication of this prototype pipeline will help infrastructure be delivered in a timely and cost effective manner question no 11 land information 11 hon david bennett national hamilton east to the minister for land information why did she decline the application for oceanagold in cases 20171062 and 201810122 to purchase 178 hectares at waihi when the associate minister of finance concluded the project would create substantial and identifiable benefit hon eugenie sage minister for land information thank you mr speaker i declined because it was my judgment that using productive rural farmland to establish a long term tailings reservoir containing hazardous mining waste did not create a substantial and identifiable benefit for new zealand hon david bennett when she concluded that the acquisition of the land would enable more mining and therefore more emissions which could encumber new zealand s transition to a net zero emissions economy will this new test be applied to other applications to the overseas investment office oio hon eugenie sage the test is one of substantial and identifiable benefit to new zealand i considered that in the context of what is a sustainable economic benefit so yes potentially whether it contributes to carbon emissions and our net zero target could be considered hon david bennett when she said it is difficult for an economic benefit to be truly substantial if it is not sustainable the nature of the proposed investment in non renewable resource extraction is inherently unsustainable then has this test been applied to the over 5 2 billion worth of applications to the oio since she has been minister hon eugenie sage i ve been the decision maker in 35 applications under the overseas investment act i ve approved 31 of the applications and declined four i have applied the criteria in the overseas investment act to the best of my ability hon david bennett how can the minister determine that the application only had a moderate economic benefit when the associate minister of finance found that the export value of the gold from the land would be 1 610 years worth of the dairy export value from that farm hon eugenie sage the overseas investment act provides for two ministers to make separate decisions what is a substantial and identifiable benefit to one person may not be to another where the two ministers make different decisions the act requires that the application is declined hon david bennett is the fact that the company spent 373 million in new zealand in 2016 a substantial and identifiable benefit to that minister hon eugenie sage it is certainly a benefit but in the context of sustainable economic development the risk of major tailings impoundments which change productive food producing land into a permanent site for the storage of hazardous waste is not a substantial and identifiable benefit it creates significant risks both economic and environmental hon david bennett why did she use the hauraki district average wage of 23 000 as part of her justification for claiming that further mineral extraction would not generate a substantial and identifiable benefit when the associate minister of finance said that the 120 000 average mining employee s wage was evidence it would hon eugenie sage the decision was about whether the purchase of the land would create a substantial and identifiable benefit in this case it s turning productive land into a site for the long term storage of hazardous waste that is not a benefit question no 12 health 12 dr shane reti national whangarei to the associate minister of health does she stand by all her statements and actions hon julie anne genter associate minister of health yes in the context they were given dr shane reti what actions did she take in defence of proposals for disabled people having shower times reduced to 30 minutes to reduce costs hon julie anne genter i was very clear with the ministry that there were to be no cuts to services and so the proposal they discussed with providers was not carried out dr shane reti what does medically fragile mean when one proposal to reduce costs was no referrals for under fives unless medically fragile hon julie anne genter i can t speak to the detail that would be a document that was written by the ministry of health what i can say is that the plan that was discussed by the ministry of health with providers was not considered acceptable by myself or the minister of health and we put an end to that plan dr shane reti how would disabled people eat when one proposal to reduce costs was removing meal preparation from all disabled packages hon julie anne genter that s why the cuts are not going ahead because we didn t think it was acceptable and i made it very clear to the ministry that my priority is to ensure disabled new zealanders receive the best support possible and that this support is allocated in a fair and consistent manner frankly the difficulties that the health system is struggling with in terms of not having enough funding to meet demand are because of nine years of neglect under that last government where there were not sufficient increases to the health budget that s a matter of public record dr shane reti can she confirm then that the extra funding for disability support services in last year s budget was largely swallowed up by regulatory and compliance costs including pay settlements as stated by the service s chief executive hon julie anne genter what i can say about last year s increase is that it was the largest increase percentage wise since 2007 a 31 percent increase on previous years increases there s more money going into the health system than there would have been under that national government the previous national government s cuts to health funding in real terms compared to the growth in population and the growth in demand are the reason why we are having this sort of conversation right

parliament questions and answers may 9 questions to ministers question no 1 education 1 jan tinetti labour to the minister of education is he confident that recent incentives for teacher recruitment and training will address projected teacher shortages in coming years if so why hon chris hipkins minister of education yes the ministry of education s forecasted estimates of the number of additional teachers needed to meet demand are based on nothing additional being done to address teacher supply in the meantime they show that for primary the gap was forecast to be closed by 2023 but for secondary we would need 2 210 additional teachers by 2025 what the government has put in place since it came into office will provide funding to attract an additional 4 000 primary and secondary teachers over the next four years and that does not include the 1 500 teachers who have been supported to undertake refresher training jan tinetti what other claims has he heard in regards to the number of teachers needed to meet demand hon chris hipkins it has been claimed that up to 8 000 additional teachers are needed by 2025 using that same forecast data it appears that calculation has been done by adding together each year on top of the other which is wrong these annual figures are not compounding if a single role is not filled for two years in a row we don t need to recruit two additional teachers to fill the one role as i ve said with the ministry forecast estimates of the number of teachers needed based on nothing being done to address supply for primary that gap would be closed by 2023 in any event and for secondary the gap is around 2 210 advertisement scroll to continue reading question no 2 prime minister 2 hon paula bennett deputy leader national to the prime minister does she stand by all her government s statements policies and actions rt hon winston peters deputy prime minister on behalf of the prime minister on behalf of the prime minister yes in their context hon paula bennett does the government have a policy to build 100 000 affordable houses over 10 years rt hon winston peters yes on behalf of the prime minister it most definitely does hon paula bennett then why in recent days has the prime minister been reluctant to actually verify that it will be 100 000 houses over 10 years rt hon winston peters the reality is in many businesses getting the start up is not so easy at the beginning obviously for example in the second world war before the battle of speaker order rt hon winston peters thank you mr speaker before the battle of el alamein we hadn t won one battle and thereafter we didn t lose one and we will get going on this project of course we are reconsidering it and when we have made the decisions we ll announce them and the target of 100 000 over 10 years is easily achievable hon paula bennett why if she is confirming today that they are keeping the 100 000 target within 10 years has her minister been backing away from that target rapidly in the last few days and she herself in previous days has been reluctant to confirm it rt hon winston peters on behalf of the prime minister i think if you re looking at the housing situation in this country you ve got to look at the problem holistically whether it s tenements or housing the greatest construction charge on right now is happening under this administration the highest in a record 44 year performance in that setting kiwibuild has got to be reconstructed as well hon paula bennett is the prime minister aware that 1 000 state houses were completed in the 2017 18 financial year practically double that of any previous year for which records are available and that all of these houses were initiated under a previous national government rt hon winston peters on behalf of the prime minister i most definitely can t confirm the premise behind that question but i can say this under that administration that she spoke for 6 500 state houses were sold hon paula bennett what does she say in reply to the deputy prime minister who in january stated the reality is there are many in this government who are seriously committed to ensure we do meet our targets i am going back to former governments where practical men who had never been to university and women decided they would get on with the job and get it done and get it done we are rt hon winston peters on behalf of the prime minister most definitely i agree with the deputy prime minister s statement which was not just aspirational but the intention is to make this country great again question no 3 housing and urban development 3 hon judith collins national papakura to the minister of housing and urban development does the government continue to pledge to build 100 000 affordable homes over the next 10 years through its kiwibuild programme as stated in the speech from the throne hon phil twyford minister of housing and urban development there has been no change to the pledge since the speech from the throne as i said yesterday cabinet will consider the kiwibuild reset in june and it s inappropriate for me to speculate on what cabinet may or may not decide what has changed is that the housing market and the programme need to respond when we came to office we stopped the sale of existing homes to foreign buyers and we closed tax loopholes and we know that this has had an impact because first home buyers now make up 24 percent of the market and wages are now growing faster than house prices hon judith collins then why did he tell the media yesterday that the target was like american nuclear ships it is a neither confirm nor deny situation hon phil twyford simply because we said that we would review the kiwibuild programme and in fact the entire housing programme cabinet has yet to make decisions and it s inappropriate for me to speculate on what cabinet may or may not decide but meanwhile we are getting on with building affordable houses state houses and housing the homeless hon judith collins what responsibility does he take for the design of kiwibuild that he took to cabinet in december 2017 which he has now told us has to be reset hon phil twyford of course as the minister i take responsibility but this is not an easy thing to do if it was easy perhaps the former government might ve had a crack at it it s a difficult thing no government in 40 years has tried to do what we are doing and that is work with the private sector to build affordable houses hon judith collins is it acceptable for him to sign contracts worth around 700 million for housing and then when these contracts start falling over to essentially explain that he s going to have to reset and is just learning on the job hon phil twyford well first i don t sign the contracts second those contracts are not falling over they are delivering affordable houses hon judith collins can any policy that doesn t include a target to build 100 000 houses really be called kiwibuild when the first words of his first press release that he put out on kiwibuild were the government s kiwibuild initiative will deliver 100 000 affordable houses over the next 10 years hon phil twyford we are not deterred by the teething problems that kiwibuild has faced we are committed to building affordable houses we will do everything in our power as a government to turn the market around to give young kiwi families the opportunity they ve been denied for the last decade and we re not ashamed about working with private industry to deliver those outcomes hon chris hipkins what reports has he seen on recent positive changes in the housing market that affect potential first home buyers hon phil twyford when we came to office we stopped the sale of existing homes to foreign buyers and we closed the tax loopholes that turbocharged property speculation we know this has had an impact because first home buyers now make up 24 percent of the market the highest share of the market since 2007 and overseas buyers have dropped by 81 percent i ve seen reports recently that wages are now growing faster than house prices this compares to 2016 when house prices rose 16 percent and wages rose just 1 8 percent this government s sound economic management means that mortgage rates are as low as they ve been in a very long time rt hon winston peters how could the overseas buyership have dropped by 81 percent when the previous government claimed their influence to be only 3 percent hon phil twyford well the previous government denied that overseas buyers were having any kind of speaker order order i ve sort of worked out there s no responsibility for that and the maths is a bit questionable too frankly hon judith collins so how many of the first home buyers over the last 18 months that he s referred to have accessed the homestart programme established by national rather than the kiwibuild programme established by himself hon phil twyford well i think it s pretty obvious to most people that the homestart programme has been going for a while and we support it the kiwibuild programme is just getting off the ground and believe me kiwibuild homestart and all the other things that this government is committed to doing will make a massive difference because we are standing up for young first home buyers in a way that that government never ever did for nine years hon judith collins does the minister stand by his statement to media last year when questioned on the design of the kiwibuild programme that he offered to stake his job on its success and if he does then has he offered his resignation to the prime minister yet hon phil twyford i have not because i m utterly focused on getting the reset of kiwibuild right and i take a lot of pride as do all my colleagues in the government in what we are achieving across the whole housing programme we ve got more than 2 000 new public houses built since we ve been in government that is a huge achievement we have increased the amount of emergency and transitional housing we stopped the sell off of state housing that that government was doing that government reduced the number of state houses by 6 500 in the middle of a housing crisis we re committed to increasing the stock of state housing by 6 500 in our first four years question no 4 workplace relations and safety 4 kieran mcanulty labour to the minister for workplace relations and safety what changes to employment law came into effect this week hon iain lees galloway minister for workplace relations and safety the most substantial parts of the employment relations amendment act came into force on monday these changes rebalance our employment relations system by reinstating workers rights to tea breaks restoring the balance in collective bargaining restoring protection for vulnerable workers and limiting 90 day trials to businesses with fewer than 20 employees this government is delivering for working people and putting a human face on capitalism kieran mcanulty why make the changes hon iain lees galloway this is a government that believes that everyone deserves a fair day s pay for a fair day s work and these changes will help achieve that they achieve the right balance providing strong safeguards and rights to workers while maintaining certainty and flexibility for employers kieran mcanulty what further changes are planned hon iain lees galloway next week the education and workforce committee is due to report back the historic equal pay amendment bill we are well under way on increasing the minimum wage to 20 per hour officials are doing excellent work to progress fair pay agreements and film industry changes alongside this the government is supporting businesses through r d tax credits and the provincial growth fund this government is building a productive sustainable and inclusive economy that delivers good jobs decent work conditions and fair wages question no 5 finance 5 david seymour leader act to the minister of finance does he agree with baker tilly staples rodway that tax freedom day 2019 is five days later than when his government took office because taxes have grown faster than the economy and what plans if any does he have to reduce the tax burden faced by new zealanders hon dr david clark associate minister of finance on behalf of the minister of finance no the government is acting already to reduce the pressure on new zealand families and businesses through the 5 5 billion families package through putting an end to unnecessary secondary tax through the introduction of the r d tax credit through making the tax system fairer by targeting multinationals and through cutting acc levies to save businesses and their customers 100 million over the next two years while at the same time increasing investment in our roads and rail rebuilding our rundown hospitals and schools investing in our regions and investing in more police more nurses and more teachers to fix the deficits and the mess left after nine long years of neglect david seymour is the minister denying the most basic mathematical fact that the percentage of gdp taken by government is now higher than it was two years ago hon dr david clark one reason the tax take is growing is because more people are employed under the coalition government than under the previous government that has boosted paye returns another reason is that companies are generating higher profits under this government one reason for a rising nominal tax take is because of more economic activity david seymour does the minister believe that it helps new zealand s competitiveness to have government taking a larger share of the economy than key trading partners such as australia and the united states hon dr david clark if the member is now advocating for a tax system like australia s that is indeed interesting to me it means obviously that he s now in favour of a top personal tax rate of 47 percent and he s probably also advocating for a capital gains tax question no 6 transport 6 hon paul goldsmith national to the minister of transport what major transport projects if any have been delayed significantly modified or cancelled since his government took office hon phil twyford minister of transport as the member knows the prioritisation of projects is a matter for the new zealand transport agency based on the priorities in the government policy statement however i m able to advise the member that no major transport projects that were under construction have been cancelled the new zealand transport agency re evaluated 12 projects including the east west link which would have cost an eye watering 327 million per kilometre instead motorists will see upgrades like median barriers and intersection upgrades and shoulder widening being rolled out across 670 kilometres of our state highway network to save lives hon paul goldsmith i raise a point of order mr speaker speaker yes i m not surprised hon paul goldsmith i asked what major projects he told me there were 12 but that s not very helpful speaker well i think the minister i don t really want him to expand because the answer was longer than necessary but if he got directly to the answer for the areas for which he is responsible he would be more helpful to the house hon phil twyford the list of projects that have been re evaluated include whangarei to te hana cambridge to piarere pokeno to mangatarata piarere to tauriko waihi to omokoroa te puna to omokoroa katikati urban tauriko west ōtaki to north of levin pētone to grenada and the melling interchange hon paul goldsmith so what new major transport projects that have been designed to reduce congestion on our roads have been started since his government took office hon phil twyford we have filled the 5 9 billion hole that the last government left in auckland s transport plan which includes projects like mill road rapid bus services from pāuanui to the airport and the eastern busway and penlink which are all funded and due to go ahead we funded and futureproofed the city rail link in auckland after the last government didn t even adjust its costings for inflation or leave a contingency the transport agency is now actually fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities to keep the public safe on the roads our government is getting on with fixing the long term issues in transport to save lives and get our cities moving again hon paul goldsmith i raise a point of order mr speaker again i asked a simple question what new major projects have been started he didn t list any he listed existing ones that hadn t been started speaker i think he listed one road project and i m not going to get into trying to establish from the chair whether a project is a new project or not the minister is responsible for his answer rt hon winston peters can i ask the minister on becoming the minister responsible in his first month with respect to the much vaunted four lane highway between whangarei and te hana how many dollars had been allocated to that plan hon phil twyford well that s very interesting the answer to that question is that the national party had promised a four lane expressway from wellsford to whangarei that would have cost 5 billion more than the entire transport spend in one year and not a single dollar was budgeted for hon paul goldsmith does he have any sympathy for kiwis stuck in traffic who have seen 12 major projects delayed or downgraded but not one new project actually started hon phil twyford well here is the number of roads that are being built the manawatū gorge replacement route mt messenger bypass the state highway 1 loop road in northland the matakana link road the awakino tunnel bypass the gills road upgrade and the horsham downs link road the difference between our two polices is that we re investing billions of dollars across the entire transport system instead of pumping 40 percent of the transport budget into five handpicked gold plated expressway projects which is what that government did when it was in office highway projects that carried only 4 percent of vehicle journeys hon paul goldsmith speaking of gold plated speaker order hon paul goldsmith sorry mr speaker have the light rail projects from city to māngere and city to north west for which he announced 1 8 billion seed funding in may 2018 been delayed reset or recalibrated hon phil twyford the light rail projects in auckland which are part of our government s commitment to building modern transport systems in our major cities relieving congestion and giving people genuine choices to move around our urban areas those projects in auckland are to be considered by cabinet and they will be considered but they are part of a commitment that we have to fix the urban transport systems and the deficit in infrastructure that we inherited from that party hon chris hipkins could all of the roads promised by the previous government have been funded within the context of the land transport fund over the next three years or within the current term of parliament without any increase in fuel tax as has been claimed by some hon phil twyford the promises of state highways that were made by that party in the lead up to the last election speaker order areas for which the minister s responsible please hon phil twyford it would not have been possible to fund the projects that the member refers to without a very significant increase in fuel taxes and road user charges the ministry of transport advised the former government that it would have taken a hefty increase in petrol taxes and road user charges and the former minister simon bridges received that advice on the eve of the last election hon paul goldsmith is the reason that the release of the business case for the light rail down dominion road has been delayed because they can t find anybody to come up with a strong business case that stacks up hon phil twyford no hon paul goldsmith does he agree with auckland councillor mike lees assessment mr twyford s version of light rail is kiwibuild on wobbly wheels hon phil twyford well it won t surprise the member to know that i don t agree with mike lee but i m sure that the member understands there are literally dozens of cities around the world right now who are building rapid transit systems including light rail six current light rail rapid transport systems are under way in australia alone because all of these cities are building modern transport systems that give their citizens genuine options congestion free options and provide mobility and access to the things that they need and these are issues that the opposition doesn t even want to hear about hon julie anne genter can the minister confirm that the most effective way to improve travel speeds on the road network is to improve the travel speeds of public transport and that has been demonstrated in cities all around the world the only way to help people get around on the roads is to improve rapid transit hon phil twyford i can speaker no before that occurs i d like the members who interjected during that question to stand up right ok hon phil twyford i can assure the member that it is in fact an established principle of transport planning that the speed of public transport has a direct correlation to the speed of traffic because the better public transport services are and rapid transit the more likely people are to leave their car at home take the train or the bus allowing the motorways and the roads to move more freely that is a fundamental tenet of our transport policy and it s why we re committed to building rapid transit infrastructure and modernising public transport in our cities question no 7 commerce and consumer affairs 7 willow jean prime labour to the minister of commerce and consumer affairs what recent measures has the government announced to protect consumers hon kris faafoi minister of commerce and consumer affairs the government has fast tracked measures to protect consumers in their dealings with both banks and insurers we ve released two options papers seeking feedback on proposed measures to address issues with conduct and culture of financial institutions and with insurance contract law proposed options include a ban on target based remuneration and incentives imposing new legal duties on financial institutions and ensuring products sold to consumers are fit for purpose and sold to the right people this will be supported by new and improved enforcement tools willow jean prime what are these measures in response to hon kris faafoi the measures come in response to the recent reports by the financial markets authority and the reserve bank of new zealand that showed there were major issues in the life insurance sector and poor conduct and culture in the banking sector that needed to be addressed in addition when we came into office we found our insurance contract law is outdated and reform is long overdue for both consumers and for the sector itself the government is committed to making sure that the financial services sector is delivering good outcomes for consumers willow jean prime how soon will these changes be made hon kris faafoi the government wants to provide adequate time for consultation and analysis with stakeholders while at the same time moving the reviews quickly so we can reduce harm to consumers if changes are warranted the aim is for legislation on financial conduct to be introduced by the end of the year and separate legislation on insurance contract law is to be introduced hon gerry brownlee best minister in the government hon kris faafoi next year you might need some insurance for your income soon gerry so you might want to listen this work sits alongside our other legislative changes to the financial services sector such as the financial services legislation amendment bill and it reforms the consumer credit contract laws the government is committed to putting consumers at the heart of decision making so that they can get the best financial outcomes hon gerry brownlee outstanding top minister hon kris faafoi including those who might need some income insurance very soon question no 8 police 8 chris bishop national hutt south to the minister of police did he make the statement to tvnz in december in regard to the matthew dow petition seeking the urgent introduction of random roadside drug testing there s a discussion document that s been approved by cabinet that s going out to the public early next year and if so on what date did cabinet approve the discussion document rt hon winston peters deputy prime minister on behalf of the minister of police in response to media questions on the road toll and drug driving including the one with tvnz on new year s eve i confirm that cabinet decided to undertake public consultation this cabinet decision was made in september cabinet has approved the consultation document and its release is due shortly chris bishop is it correct to say that a consultation document like the minister has just said is the same as the discussion document he mentioned on new year s eve rt hon winston peters on behalf of the minister words do matter but sometimes you can be too picky with words chris bishop why has the discussion document or consultation document to use the minister s words not been released yet when he said it would be released early next year rt hon winston peters on behalf of the minister did he mean early this year or early next year because next year hasn t arrived yet speaker order both sides chris bishop why has the discussion document on roadside drug testing that he told tvnz on new year s eve 2018 would be released early next year i e this year not been released yet rt hon winston peters on behalf of the minister what happened was that getting ready for the release a tragic terrorist event happened on 15 march in christchurch and it so happens that the head of road safety for police mike clement is also the head of police operations in christchurch with respect to that terrorist event that s why it was delayed for a very obvious and understandable reason it will be released shortly chris bishop how on earth can the events of christchurch involving a deputy commissioner that have nothing to do with roadside drug testing have delayed the release of a document that he just told the house was prepared and confirmed in september 2018 rt hon winston peters on behalf of the minister for the most obvious reasons while a document might be prepared its continued refinement may still be central to the government s thinking can i say that why mr mike clement is important is because he heads the police road safety campaign and having said that can i say the previous government since 2009 had done nothing including two cabinet papers that the hon david bennett took on drug driving and they deferred and made no decisions at all chris bishop does he think it is acceptable that when cabinet approves a discussion document on the very important issue of roadside drug testing the government nine months later has not released it to the public despite telling the family of a particular individual killed last year on new year s eve that it would be released early next year rt hon winston peters on behalf of the minister the statement made to the family was always intended to be performed on it will be performed on it will happen but the fact is we had a tragedy the terrorist act on 15 march this year that is understandable but what is not understandable is the appalling misuse of someone s misery for narrow venal political points alastair scott i seek leave of the house for the land transport random oral fluid testing amendment bill in my name to be set down as the first members order of the day on the next members day speaker is there any objection to that yes there is it will not be set down question no 9 regional economic development 9 hon paul goldsmith national to the minister for regional economic development does he stand by all his statements and actions hon david parker minister for economic development on behalf of the minister for regional economic development yes hon paul goldsmith does he stand by his statement in the december 2017 cabinet paper outlining the objectives of the provincial growth fund pgf that the first objective is increased jobs with a focus on high quality jobs and sustainable economic development over the long term hon david parker yes and i m pleased to again advise the member that the provincial development unit officials who contacted pgf funding recipients in february to gather data about job creation tallied 560 new jobs as the most accurate and up to date figure as at that date hon paul goldsmith is he satisfied that the only answer his officials have provided so far to me and the public showing the number of sustained new jobs created by the fund relates to a third of the projects and lists only six jobs hon david parker i am aware of the member s press release to that effect yesterday which said the one straight answer we ve had from the provincial development unit shows that with a third of the projects counted just six permanent sustained jobs have been created it is such an absurd accusation i m surprised that the member was willing to put that out under his name to give but one example the ruapehu alpine lifts have 37 jobs during construction and the wider economic effects of that one project alone will be far more than the miserable six jobs that he thinks the new zealand public is stupid enough to believe is the total hon paul goldsmith i seek to table an email from jarred griffiths to ash battell with a table which shows exactly that six sustained new jobs speaker it s not publicly available hon paul goldsmith no it s dated 11 february 2019 speaker right is there any objection to that email being tabled there appears to be none document by leave laid on the table of the house hon paul goldsmith why are his officials refusing to release the latest figures on the number of sustained new jobs created so far hon david parker the member tries to suggest that jobs that are contractors who are building new infrastructure or new buildings are not jobs they are sustainable jobs in that industry those contractors employ people who are working on these projects that would not have occurred but for the pgf involvement hon paul goldsmith so he thinks halfway through a term relating to a 3 billion fund that even if we went with his upper estimate of 500 jobs including contractors part timers and people who have done speaker order question hon paul goldsmith perhaps one hour it is a good return on that investment hon david parker no that s not what i think what i think is that the member favours tax cuts for the rich and hard right austerity for the regions that s why the provinces withered and social problems grew under his watch we ve got a lot of work to do to fix that laissez faire neglect but we ve started and it s going well question no 10 infrastructure 10 clayton mitchell nz first to the minister for infrastructure what recent announcements has he made regarding the new zealand infrastructure commission te waihanga hon david parker attorney general on behalf of the minister for infrastructure the interim infrastructure commission within treasury has published a pipeline of major infrastructure projects that are coming to market in the next three years the information on those first 174 projects included in that pipeline are worth over 6 billion and this will provide confidence to the private sector to invest and gear up for the efficient delivery of these projects the coalition government has listened to what the infrastructure sector has been advocating for for many years and the new commission will be fully operational by the end of the year clayton mitchell wow that s fantastic what information is included on the infrastructure pipeline hon david parker initially the pipeline includes 174 projects from five capital intensive agencies education health the new zealand transport agency the defence force and corrections these include replacement of the dunedin hospital for over 1 billion the manawatū gorge replacement route project and a 275 million replacement of critical infrastructure at auckland city hospital starship and greenlane clinical centre it contains information as to the cost range of the project as well as estimated time frames for procurement and construction over time the pipeline will be expanded to include projects from all central government agencies as well as local government and large private sector projects the commission will be providing long term visibility of our county s infrastructure needs clayton mitchell fabulous news how will this help deliver better infrastructure and improve the well being of new zealanders hon david parker the pipeline information will give the infrastructure market greater confidence about the timing sequencing and scale of infrastructure projects so it can gear up capacity and capability to deliver we inherited a serious infrastructure deficit and we re focusing on ensuring that our investments are in the right projects at the right time new zealanders rely upon this high quality infrastructure to ensure they can run their businesses efficiently and to underpin their quality of life so the establishment of the new zealand infrastructure commission and the publication of this prototype pipeline will help infrastructure be delivered in a timely and cost effective manner question no 11 land information 11 hon david bennett national hamilton east to the minister for land information why did she decline the application for oceanagold in cases 20171062 and 201810122 to purchase 178 hectares at waihi when the associate minister of finance concluded the project would create substantial and identifiable benefit hon eugenie sage minister for land information thank you mr speaker i declined because it was my judgment that using productive rural farmland to establish a long term tailings reservoir containing hazardous mining waste did not create a substantial and identifiable benefit for new zealand hon david bennett when she concluded that the acquisition of the land would enable more mining and therefore more emissions which could encumber new zealand s transition to a net zero emissions economy will this new test be applied to other applications to the overseas investment office oio hon eugenie sage the test is one of substantial and identifiable benefit to new zealand i considered that in the context of what is a sustainable economic benefit so yes potentially whether it contributes to carbon emissions and our net zero target could be considered hon david bennett when she said it is difficult for an economic benefit to be truly substantial if it is not sustainable the nature of the proposed investment in non renewable resource extraction is inherently unsustainable then has this test been applied to the over 5 2 billion worth of applications to the oio since she has been minister hon eugenie sage i ve been the decision maker in 35 applications under the overseas investment act i ve approved 31 of the applications and declined four i have applied the criteria in the overseas investment act to the best of my ability hon david bennett how can the minister determine that the application only had a moderate economic benefit when the associate minister of finance found that the export value of the gold from the land would be 1 610 years worth of the dairy export value from that farm hon eugenie sage the overseas investment act provides for two ministers to make separate decisions what is a substantial and identifiable benefit to one person may not be to another where the two ministers make different decisions the act requires that the application is declined hon david bennett is the fact that the company spent 373 million in new zealand in 2016 a substantial and identifiable benefit to that minister hon eugenie sage it is certainly a benefit but in the context of sustainable economic development the risk of major tailings impoundments which change productive food producing land into a permanent site for the storage of hazardous waste is not a substantial and identifiable benefit it creates significant risks both economic and environmental hon david bennett why did she use the hauraki district average wage of 23 000 as part of her justification for claiming that further mineral extraction would not generate a substantial and identifiable benefit when the associate minister of finance said that the 120 000 average mining employee s wage was evidence it would hon eugenie sage the decision was about whether the purchase of the land would create a substantial and identifiable benefit in this case it s turning productive land into a site for the long term storage of hazardous waste that is not a benefit question no 12 health 12 dr shane reti national whangarei to the associate minister of health does she stand by all her statements and actions hon julie anne genter associate minister of health yes in the context they were given dr shane reti what actions did she take in defence of proposals for disabled people having shower times reduced to 30 minutes to reduce costs hon julie anne genter i was very clear with the ministry that there were to be no cuts to services and so the proposal they discussed with providers was not carried out dr shane reti what does medically fragile mean when one proposal to reduce costs was no referrals for under fives unless medically fragile hon julie anne genter i can t speak to the detail that would be a document that was written by the ministry of health what i can say is that the plan that was discussed by the ministry of health with providers was not considered acceptable by myself or the minister of health and we put an end to that plan dr shane reti how would disabled people eat when one proposal to reduce costs was removing meal preparation from all disabled packages hon julie anne genter that s why the cuts are not going ahead because we didn t think it was acceptable and i made it very clear to the ministry that my priority is to ensure disabled new zealanders receive the best support possible and that this support is allocated in a fair and consistent manner frankly the difficulties that the health system is struggling with in terms of not having enough funding to meet demand are because of nine years of neglect under that last government where there were not sufficient increases to the health budget that s a matter of public record dr shane reti can she confirm then that the extra funding for disability support services in last year s budget was largely swallowed up by regulatory and compliance costs including pay settlements as stated by the service s chief executive hon julie anne genter what i can say about last year s increase is that it was the largest increase percentage wise since 2007 a 31 percent increase on previous years increases there s more money going into the health system than there would have been under that national government the previous national government s cuts to health funding in real terms compared to the growth in population and the growth in demand are the reason why we are having this sort of conversation right now you have to take some responsibility scoop media
vox populi vox suckers from 2006 vox populi the voice of the people the louder it gets the faster you should run in the opposite direction thirty five years ago today richard nixon went before the tv cameras and announced that he was unilaterally ending the convertibility of the u s dollar into gold at the fixed price of 35 oz that was a punch in the solar plexus of central banks around the world but it was a sucker punch against the american public call it a two fer that announcement was the latest in a series of moves against the economic freedom of americans the government s war on the dollar then escalated in earnest today using official statistics provided by the u s bureau of labor statistics the american price level is five times higher than in 1971 use the inflation calculator here www bls gov the 1971 gold price had prevailed ever since 1934 the year after franklin roosevelt had unilaterally confiscated gold coins and gold bullion owned by american citizens and u s residents paying them 20 per ounce executive order 6102 as soon as the government had its hands on as much of the gold as it was likely to get from compliant law abiding citizens it hiked the price to 35 immediately making the government s stash worth 75 more the u s supreme court upheld roosevelt s move by a 5 to 4 vote it did so by ignoring the history of constitutional monetary law a fact explained in 1 660 pages by austrian economist and harvard law school graduate edwin viera in pieces of eight a book that ought to be put back in print in digital format on a cd rom for say 29 95 this official price hike produced a windfall profit for three major groups 1 the thieving u s government 2 investors in gold mining shares and 3 all those americans who disobeyed the law and kept their coins how many americans did not cooperate we don t know and obviously cannot know an era before coordinated paper trails and digital trails but we do know this you can still buy a circulated u s 20 gold piece liberty head today for a premium of about 10 over the spot gold price or a st gaudens for a 20 premium this indicates that the vast bulk of america s coins were sent out of the country to switzerland where coin dealers can still buy them burt blumert of camino coin company is the grand old man of retail gold coin dealers he makes an interesting observation prohibition ended in 1933 the criminal syndicates that had been violating the constitution had brought in the booze from canada and sold it here there is little doubt that they were getting paid in gold coins for most of the period 1920 1933 they surely were not getting paid by check so when britain de monetized the pound in 1931 refusing to exchange gold for pounds sterling any gangster who understood politics and to survive the syndicates had to could have seen what was coming the u s would de monetize gold the wise ones among them figured out the second step a hike in the official price it was not just the mafia that did well joseph kennedy had ships filled with canadian liquor anchored off the shores of america just before the repeal of the 18th amendment went into effect he was not your average joe so the fact that you and i can buy american gold eagles from the pre 1934 era is the mafia s gift to us the syndicates cleaned up in 1934 at the expense of the average joe who obeyed the law and turned in his coins at 20 oz such is the recurring history of democratic civil government vox populi vox suckers monetary amnesia sometime around 1965 my father in law r j rushdoony persuaded a group of his followers to invite blumert to san marino california to sell some pre 1933 gold coins blumert came with bags of coins which were legal as collector coins this was the biggest sale of gold coins in his career at that time he had been in the coin business for about six years it was not just big for blumert it was big for the entire industry in one shot blumert became the biggest retail dealer in american gold coins in the u s how could this be because nobody else in 1965 knew about these coins the market for gold coins deemed numismatic pre 1934 was either for rare coins in superb condition or for people buying one coin to commemorate a birthday or a wedding date the market for post 1933 foreign gold coins was illegal until 1975 we forget that e c harwood of the american institute for economic research in great barrington massachusetts was prosecuted by the sec in this period for daring to sell to americans paper certificates for gold bullion stored in zurich san marino was where the wealthiest residents of the san gabriel valley lived rushdoony had a few of the almost wealthy on his mailing list who attended his sunday evening bible studies but mostly they were middle class people though older folks as i incorrectly and naïvely thought at the time i was by then part of rushdoony s group so i thought nothing of blumert s event it was not until yesterday when i talked over the history of the american gold coin market with blumert that he told me this story his overnight elevation to 1 in the gold coin retail market there was no other dealer in the u s who could sell this many coins in one day he says that there was universal amnesia in 1965 regarding gold coins as currency the era of gold coins in circulation was no longer understood vox populi vox amnesiacs there was also no perception that the coins could be a source of profits to speculators if the price of gold rose over the next few years members of the john birch society in california also began buying coins from blumert jbs headquarters in southern california were in san marino two years later in november 1967 the british government devalued the pound the chancellor of the exchequer had of course sworn that this was not being contemplated a few weeks before this event i attended the first international gold conference in history it was sponsored by harry schultz the hard money newsletter publisher it was held in los angeles rushdoony paid my admission i wrote it up in a report dated november 17 1967 the coming credit crunch immediately after the devaluation of the pound gold began to rise in 1968 the u s and european central banks imposed a two tier gold market central banks could buy gold from the u s at 35 but agreed not to sell gold to the public at this price gold s free market price began to move up by a few dollars above 35 still the outflow of gold from the treasury continued so on august 15 1971 nixon closed the gold window the secretary of the treasury john connally had sworn to the media for weeks that no such move was being contemplated i shall never forget his press conference on august 16 he admitted openly that he had lied if i had told the truth there would immediately have been a rush by foreign central banks to buy our gold the press nodded dutifully and nobody in the mainstream media complained price controls nixon also froze all domestic prices that day no discussion no democracy just one man rule within days the u s chamber of commerce backed this move against freedom so did the national association of manufacturers normally a gallon of gasoline sold for over 35 cents in southern california but there was a gasoline price war that week you could buy gasoline for about 22 cents a loss leader those stations got locked in a lot of them went bankrupt over the next two years that was when the shift to convenience store gas stations began profits on the sale of candy packaged foods and sodas it marked the end of the service station era i had predicted this move in a 1970 article in the whole earth catalog i had told readers to buy u s silver coins in 1970 i bought british gold sovereigns for 10 each 40 an ounce nixon ran back to back federal deficits of 23 billion each 1970 and 1971 which were considered staggeringly high in that era ever since the end of world war ii the largest one year deficit had been 28 billion in 1968 in no other year did it reach double digits the deficits receded for two years after 1972 then jumped to 53 billion in 1975 and 66 billion in 1976 under ford then under reagan they jumped to the 200 billion range in 1983 in 1977 i had publicly predicted a 200 billion deficit for 1984 it arrived a year early this was an era of monetary inflation and price inflation the republicans got most of the blame and deserved most of it the federal reserve system under arthur burns and the forgettable g william miller destroyed the foundation of monetary stability only under paul volcker beginning in late 1979 did the brakes get slammed on this led to the two worst recessions 1981 and 1982 in postwar america the dollar has continued to slide the rate of depreciation has slowed but it has not approached zero percent per annum the federal reserve always comes to the rescue in a recession and in doing so creates the misallocation of capital that produces the next recession what lies ahead we are in an economy comparable to the one facing johnson and nixon we are at war in two countries the u s government is running huge deficits unlike that era americans are corporately running balance of payments deficits in the range of 750 billion a year the dollar is not tied to gold as it was for central bank dealings until 1971 there is nothing except the fear of rising bond rates to put the fear of free markets into the administration yet long rates are dropping mortgage rates are dropping why because of a perception of a looming economic slowdown investors are looking for ports in the looming storm and 30 year bonds and mortgages seem to provide a safer haven than other markets the recession of 1970 scared nixon into running back to back deficits after a small surplus in 1969 counting the debt based social security surplus as true revenue which was lyndon johnson s statistical gift to the voters which the republicans in congress accepted vox populi vox suckers the next recession will produce the same sort of response but next time there will be no restraint provided by even the dim remnant of a gold standard as there was in 1968 71 next time there will be no trade surplus as there was in that era next time there will be no semi balanced federal budget to use as a launching pad for fiscal red ink as there was in 1970 next time there will be no mainstream media monolith to cover up the truth next time there will be a more shallow reservoir of trust to tap into next time a significant percentage of the populi is less likely to be suckered we are in a unique period the deficit numbers are shouting yellow alert yet the markets have not blinked the dow jones industrial average stock market is still flirting with 11 000 the s p 500 is still playing peek a boo with 1 300 but both averages are stuck meanwhile the lake of aging post depression baby boomers is rising behind the earthen dam of medicare and social security that pressure is statistically inevitable and politically unstoppable we can all hear the creaking of that dam but the vast majority of voters believe that there is some painless solution that the government will figure out which as yet is not visible vox populi vox suckers conclusion we have seen the steady erosion of the dollar s purchasing power since lyndon johnson s great society it became visible in 1968 accelerated in 1971 and went over the top in 1979 80 since then the erosion has slowed but only by comparison to what took place in the aftermath of the two tier gold market of 1968 the history of the demise of the dollar is the history of the replacement of a gold coin standard with the federal reserve system the decline began in 1914 but it has come in waves of depreciation we are on the cusp of the dollar s next great decline now as always pay no attention to vox populi except to run the other way _____________________________ published on august 15 2006

investors worst fears for argentina were confirmed in late april when a poll from well known consulting firm isonomia showed president mauricio macri the great hope of investors when he was elected in 2015 losing narrowly in a runoff election to populist former president cristina fernández de kirchner the price of argentine bonds plunged and the country s chance of default in the next five years rose to 60 percent from 49 percent a week earlier kirchner and macri are bitter rivals she refused to attend his swearing in ceremony after he defeated her party s candidate in the 2015 presidential election he says she ruined the country s economy and fostered a culture of corruption much of macri s time in office has been spent trying to rebuild investor confidence after kirchner refused to negotiate defaulted debt with holdouts even so last year he was forced to go to the international monetary fund for a record 56 billion bailout after a combination of high inflation and rising u s interest rates soured investors on the argentine peso sending the currency into free fall
in may 2000 asia took an extraordinary step to protect its financial cooperation from future crises by creating a multilateral currency swap system it was a response to asia s 1997 meltdown and a wise one a decade later japan china south korea and 10 southeast asian nations were putting real money behind the enterprise pooling us 120 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves by 2012 the pot expanded to 240 billion these dollars could be tapped by any member nation facing a capital flight yet it took a trade war to bring the whole thing together pooling resources in fiji last week at the asia development bank s annual meeting asia s finance ministers agreed to build stronger buffers into the swap arrangement and perhaps increase the pool of reserves even more significantly they took the first step to add the chinese yuan and japanese yen into the mix and reduce asia s reliance on the dollar the trade war that us president donald trump launched 12 months ago is hitting asia hard not 1997 hard but trump s tariffs and the federal reserve s rate hikes are causing the worst turbulence asia has seen since the 2013 taper tantrum things could soon get a whole lot worse trump is threatening to raise levies on 200 billion of chinese goods to 25 from 10 as soon as friday after that he might slap tariffs on another 325 billion of mainland goods and a 25 tax on imports of cars and auto parts no one can say where trump s trade war 2 0 is heading this bull market in uncertainty has asia coming together in ways for which the protectionist us leader hadn t bargained giving currency swap members a choice of withdrawing emergency funds in yuan yen or potentially other asian units reduces washington s footprint it s leverage in asia too among chinese president xi jinping s biggest ambitions is increasing the yuan s role in trade and finance in 2016 the yuan was added to the international monetary fund s top five currency basket joining the yen what happened in fiji could provide a fresh tailwind for president xi s vision come together the same goes for asian cooperation it s best not to be naïve here the region s trade reliant nations have long competed more than they ve worked together asia s numerous summits each year tend to be inane talkfests that achieve little all photo ops and vague communiqués with few concrete efforts to link arms yet trump s erratic policies are driving asia together the original 2000 swap arrangement was called the chiang mai initiative named after the thai city in which it was forged the deal happened on the sidelines of the asian development bank s annual meeting last week s discussions also took place around the adb s gathering progress was made to remove limits imposed back 2000 including how long swap lines can remain open the nature of financial contracts between members and the pool of currencies are being revamped new steps are being taken to increase market surveillance among peers and methods for sharing data and insights all this might sound incremental but among northeast asian nations events in fiji could pave the way to a broader détente japan china and south korea are to varying degrees barely on speaking terms the increased safety net the region is building is more than a step the right direction it s an opportunity to do something constructive despite decades old gripes can northeast asia start talking xi japan s shinzo abe and south korea s moon jae in should compartmentalize the geopolitics trilaterally they could be lowering trade barriers linking bond and stock markets and devising a collective use for their combined 4 8 trillion of currency reserves in a joint statement in fiji governments agreed to further enhance communication and coordination between china japan and korea to contribute to strong sustainable balanced and inclusive growth if there s a silver lining in trump s trade war it is that as it roils regional supply chains it is upping this urgency significantly xi in june is planning to visit osaka where this year s summit of group of 20 economies is being held it will be the first visit by a chinese president in more than a decade china s role in bringing asia together is complicated its mercantilist policies and the leverage beijing is amassing via the belt and road scheme are live concerns but its stabilizing role is unmistakable as xi s aggressive stimulus gains traction while the trump administration amps up its trade rhetoric china unlike its more sickly condition last year is suddenly more important to global economic health than the us says market analyst dion rabouin of washington based axios sure all that debt could prove problematic in 2020 but the bigger worry is how trump s white house is looking to juice its economy at asia s expense it s high time the region circled the wagons recent events in fiji suggest america first is catalyzing an asia first rejoinder
former us envoy in lanka robert blake lists some of america s wrong decisions courtesy newsin asia colombo may 8 newsin asia in a frank talk at the pathfinder foundation here on tuesday robert blake who was us ambassador to sri lanka and assistant secretary of state for south and central asia listed some key mistakes made by the present and past us administrations which landed the world s pre eminent power in trouble blake was speaking in his current capacity as senior director india and south asia mclarty associates a firm of strategic consultants according to blake the first mistake the us made was president clinton s decision to back china s entry into the world trade organization wto based on incorrect assumptions the second was the obama administration s decision to stop all us sri lanka military training programs after eelam war iv on the grounds that the sri lankan armed forces had allegedly committed human rights violations in the last phase of the war against the liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte the third was president trump s withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership tpp china s admission to wto blake recalled that president clinton supported china s entry into the wto even though china was not yet a market economy clinton like most americans believed that as china prospered as its middle class grew as more and more chinese traveled and studied abroad china would become more of a market economy and become more democratic but today most americans see that this strategic calculation was wrong under xi jinping we have seen a strengthening of the role of the communist party a doubling down on the role of the state and state owned enterprises soes in china s economy and the strengthening of china s surveillance state not only is china not a more liberal market economy it is often seeking to promote its illiberal governance model overseas blake charged the veteran american diplomat acknowledged that most asian countries acknowledge and even share many of these concerns but they also do not want to be asked to make a choice between the united states and china they want to benefit from the massive resources china is extending under its ambitious belt and road initiative bri blake noted china s ambassador to the us published an oped in forbes two weeks ago in which he summarized the vast scope of bri according to the ambassador 126 countries and29 international organizationshaving signed bri cooperation documents with china total trade between china and other belt and road countries has exceededus 6 trillion and china s investment in these countries hassurpassed us 80 billion to put these figures into context china committed us 113 billion in bri financing in 2017 which substantially exceeded the commitments of the world bank and adb combined blake pointed out however the bri has created some undesirable trends and blake listed the following among debt diplomacy the case of sri lanka s own port of hanbantota has become a watchword for the rest of the world that countries must make sure they choose projects that have solid internal rates of return that will enable them to service the debt owed to china or they will face chinese pressures to convert that debt to equity blake recommended labour issues every recipient country also grapples with chinese pressure to use chinese labour on these bri projects when almost every country has surplus labour of their own for whom they want to provide opportunities for work the former envoy pointed out lack of transparency most bri projects also face criticism for the lack of transparency about the financial terms of the loans the extent of chinese labor and other such sensitive issues environmental concerns blake referred to a recent world research institute wri analysis of bri lending from 2014 to 2017 and said that chinese energy and transport projects in bri countries did not align with the low carbon priorities recipient countries outlined in their paris pledges blake then asked what are recipient countries to do and his answer was as follows first the countries involved in bri must be more forceful and clearer in negotiating with the chinese this is already happening the wall street journal recently reported that last year myanmar renegotiated terms for a us 7 3 billion chinese funded deep water port and industrial zone shrinking the scope of the projectand slashing the country s future debt burden to its economic powerhouse neighbour pakistan malaysia myanmar bangladeshand sierra leone also have backed away from bri projects likewise the maldives has announced its own review of bri contracts undertaken by the previous government to ensure it is servicing only the debt for the true value of the projects undertaken not for the inflated cost of what the new government alleges were large corrupt kickbacks on both sides in indonesia where i served as ambassador from 2013 16 the signature bri program is jakarta bandung high speed rail many questioned the need for a us 6 billion rail line given so many other infrastructure needs indonesian ministers have criticized the high speed rail project for being opaque and non transparent complaining that even cabinet members are having trouble getting data and information china is rethinking blake pointed out that these criticisms have made china re think and respond to them in a speech on april 26 to mark the latest bri conference president xi jinping told the conference that everything should be done in a transparent way china should have zero tolerance for corruption and ensure the commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects so that they will achieve the intended goals as planned in another sign of greater transparancy xi said china would welcome the participation of multilateral and international financial institutions in belt and road investment and financing the chinese also pledged to defuse tensions with belt and road recipients expressing willingness in principle to renegotiate debts beijing decided to forgive ethiopia s interest payments owed through the end of 2018 blake said there are other signs china is sensitive to the criticism it has received the former envoy said china itself and un environment program have formed international coalition for green development on the belt and road to make bri greener and more sustainable the coalition includes all the major environmental groups bri countries and key chinese businesses who are major bri contractors so china is listening the test will come whether we see concrete changes implemented blake added trump s response to china s challenge blake said that the trump administration has responded well to china s increased diplomatic and infrastructure promotion efforts first recognizing that it is not enough to simply criticize bri from the sidelines the administration and congress understood that the us and other partners must provide alternatives so partner countries have choices last october the build act was signed into law it created a new u s international development finance corporation which will incorporate the opic and make available financing totalling us 60 billion more than double what opic had provided in the past this in turn will unlock over us 30 billion in additional funding to facilitate private sector investments in the region the idfc will offer loans loan guarantees and risk insurance to support new investments they will also make equity investments and fund feasibility studies or potential investments making it even easier to collaborate with partner finance institutions washington dc january 23 afp out u s president donald trump shows the executive order withdrawing the us from the trans pacific partnership tpp after signing it in 2017 now of course the idfc s us 60 billion does not come close to the trillion dollars in bri financing but it does provide countries alternatives and in that way will oblige china to be more transparent and responsive to the needs of recipient countries the us also has signaled its readiness to cooperate with partners such as japan and india in co financing projects further expanding the scope and scale of alternatives blake said these resources complement the significant us private sector investment in the asia pacific the value of u s foreign direct investment in the region is nearly us 1 trillion far outstripping what china or any other country has invested moreover it is not widely known that our investment in asia has more than doubled over the last decade and made the us the largest source of the region s foreign investment meeting china s security challenge blake noted that the trump administration has maintained us security commitment to the region one of secretary of defense jams mattis first acts was to rename the us pacific command to be the new indo pacific command showing us understanding that we must have one vision for the indian and pacific oceans and recognize india s growing power and influence across the asia pacific and the importance the us attaches to our partnership with india the administration also has sustained america s high level military to military engagement in the region in most countries in asia where we have military partnerships the us is the largest military exercise partner and the largest provider of military training and the administration has shown a steadfast commitment to continuing the longstanding commitment of the us to ensuring freedom of navigation throughout the indo pacific but particularly in sensitive areas such as the south china sea this security commitment has underpinned asia s extraordinary economic rise for the last 50 years blake said mistake to have quit trans pacific partnership blake pointed out that trump had made a mistake by quitting the trans pacific partnership tpp the current administration has damaged us interests in the asia pacific the first is on the trade front fulfilling a misguided campaign promise one of president trump s first acts was to withdraw the united states from the trans pacific partnership which the obama administration had played such a pivotal role in helping to negotiate since sri lanka is not a tpp member i will not belabor this point except to say that almost every american business person working in asia regrets this act of unilateral disarmament particularly since the trump administration has not moved to negotiate bilateral or multilateral agreements to fill the gap second there is a general perception across most of the asia pacific that the us places less of a priority on asia than under president obama unlike obama trump has attended only one of the east asia and apec summits one of the few leaders to do so the president s absence is magnified by the trump administration s painfully slow progress in filling sub cabinet and ambassadorial positions just to take two examples of relevance to all of you more than two and a half years into trump s four year term we still do not have assistant secretaries of state for either east asia or south and central asia these are the point persons who are responsible for developing and executing our policy in these regions and who supervise the work of our ambassadors and their interagency teams in these regions you all recall i was assistant secretary of south and central asia under obama obama took office in january congress approved my nomination in june of the same year blake recalled wrong to have withdrawn military training ambassador blake regretted that after the sri lanka ltte war ended in may 2009 the us had stopped its military aid and training programs in the island on the plea that there had been human rights violations by the lankan military in the last years of the war in 2008 and 2009 human rights concern almost completely circumscribed our military exercises training and assistance with the sri lankan army and air force i had to fight hard to maintain even small areas of navy to navy cooperation in part by arguing that it was in our interest to help sri lanka interdict ltte arms shipments today i am happy those restrictions are behind us he said blake referred to the stoppage of military training to the pakistani army and said that this resulted in the us losing contact with a whole generation of pakistani military officers the result was that this generation grew up on a diet of anti american sentiment hampering inter operability which is key to military military cooperation the former envoy said us lanka cooperation restored blake noted that the us and lankan militaries are now training together in areas ranging from maritime security to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief the us has announced plans for new security assistance of 39 million to sri lanka to support maritime security freedom of navigation and maritime domain awareness in 2018 the u s transferred a u s coast guard cutter to the sri lankan navy and we have regular joint training and exercises with all the services all these are signs of a healthy and growing military partnership likewise our law enforcement cooperation has strengthened there is no better sign of that than the quick and substantial fbi response to sri lanka s request for assistance in its investigation of the easter sunday bombings lessons from easter bombings tuning to the april 21 easter sunday bombings in sri lanka blake said the easter attacks were not just personal tragedies for the families of those killed and wounded they opened old wounds still fresh from sri lanka s 26 year civil conflict and they raised new questions in the minds of potential business partners about the wisdom of doing business in sri lanka what steps should sri lanka take to successfully manage these new challenges and sustain its progress of the last ten years job one of course must be to pursue with vigor the investigation into who was responsible what links they had to outside terrorist groups how the bombers were able to mount such a sophisticated and well coordinated series of attacks in multiple cities without detection from your intelligence and security services and what networks may remain so the sri lankan people can be sure the threat has abated one priority during this phase of investigating and hopefully wrapping up any remaining terrorist elements must be for the government and security services to conduct investigations in a professional and impartial manner that respects the rights of all sri lankans and does not inadvertently add to the problem the government should also make every effort to limit scope and duration of emergency rregulations what us experience can teach blake said that sri lanka can learn from mistakes america made after 9 11 most civil liberties experts believe the us over reacted by expanding government surveillance without appropriate constitutional checks by extended detentions at guantánamo bay that circumscribed the legal rights of detainees by extraordinary renditions and interrogations all of which gave rise to questions of what the limits of government power should be in times of crisis our system of checks and balances ultimately righted most of these wrongs and the press had a powerful role to play in exposing excesses and wrong doing sri lanka can also benefit from another us lesson learned after 9 11 one of our mistakes was that there was poor communication and intelligence sharing between the cia fbi and other agencies to improve inter agency communication and cooperation the bush white house established a working group of senior technocrats from all the intelligence and law enforcement agencies this group met regularly to evaluate all intelligence from all sources and agree on responsibility for follow up on specific threats the group was headed by deputy national security advisor john brennan who reported directly to the president sri lanka could benefit from a similar high level group gotabaya rajapaksa praised in this context blake recalled how when gotabaya rajapaksa was lankan defense secretary during the last eelam war he set up a committee of experts to advice him an called for a strong and unified national leadership to take decisions and implement them continued threat from islamic state sri lanka must also be careful not to allow isis or other extreme islamic groups to take root blake warned although the precise role of isis in the attacks remains to be investigated one must ask why sri lanka proved a tempting target of opportunity first they may have calculated that since muslim christian relations have historically been good and extreme islamic thought has never gained wide favor on the island they and ntj could organize with undue scrutiny secondly they probably calculated that the security forces have relaxed their efforts since 2009 and to the extent they were still concerned that concern was more likely on preventing a revival of the ltte having suffered the loss of their self proclaimed caliphate and territory in iraq and syria isis must show its followers it is still relevant and strong without a central caliphate isis is metastasizing into smaller units wherever opportunities present themselves one is in the southern philippines where they are seeking a beach head in se asia but they also looking to use bombings such as those in sri lanka to sow discord between muslim christian and other communities that they can then exploit for their evil ends sri lanka cannot allow that to happen which brings me to my third recommendation which is that sri lanka needs to give new focus and priority to reconciliation and good governance the easter sunday bombings opened a potential new divide in sri lanka s already complex ethnic amalgam sri lanka continues to debate the pace and scope of reforms aimed at reconciliation between sinhalese and tamils some tensions remain as important priorities such as a truth and reconciliation commission reparations and accountability remain on the drawing board even as sinhalese tamil reconciliation remains a work in progress the easter bombings threaten to open new wounds and cleavages in sri lankan society and raise new questions us trained sri lankan airborne special forces new questions according to blake the new questions are will the attack on st anthony s church in batticaloa rekindle memories of the tamil muslim violence in the east during the country s civil war will extremist sinhalese buddhist groups seek to exploit popular anger about the attacks to renew their attacks on muslims as we saw most recently in kandy in may of last year will christians themselves the victims of muslim and sinhalese buddhist violence seek their own retribution this complex and combustible mix requires the country to come together for a national dialogue given the political chasm and open antipathy between the president and prime minister careful thought must be given as to who might lead such efforts two good places to start would be sri lanka s religious leaders and its youth groups cardinal ranjith has managed the aftermath of the attacks with considerable aplomb and grace and there is a long history interfaith dialogue that can help bring these disparate communities together and reduce tensions need for early warning system blake said that with tensions high and the possibility that social media can be misused to spread false rumors the communities would be wise to set up an early warning system to monitor rumors and then have senior religious figures quickly deny these this system has worked well in eastern indonesia he added the lankan government itself has a crucial role to play to heal old and fresh wounds blake said and added every sri lankan citizen should be able to count on equal justice and no group that breaks the law or violates the rights of other citizens should be above the law renewed thought should be given to increasing tamil and muslim recruits in the country s security services so they more accurately reflect sri lankan society as a whole the same should be done with the civil service islamophobia already on the rise in india and my own country should not be allowed to take root in sri lanka need for non partisan united leadership calling for a truly national and united leadership blake said in the end any country s response must depend not on its political leaders who too often succumb to the temptation to defend narrow party and personal interests but rather on the strength of its institutions the recent constitutional crisis underlined the critical role of independent institutions like the constitutional council and the judiciary their continued independence will be an important part of restoring faith in sri lanka s ability to recover and prosper

islamabad pakistan and the imf have worked out financing gap of 10 to 11 billion for the next financial year 2019 20 as the current account deficit is projected to curtail at 8 billion the imf usually pitched gdp growth and current account deficit cad on lower side during the negotiation process initially the imf was pitching the cad at the range of 4 to 6 billion but now both sides have moved towards evolving consensus at 8 billion cad for next fiscal year under the imf programme the financing gap for next fiscal year has been projected at 10 11 billion top official sources confirmed to the news here on wednesday the most critical part of the finalising staff level agreement included imf demand for upfront hike in policy rate by 100 to 200 basis points envisaging quarterly nir net

making regulator national electric power regulatory authority nepra fully independent and gradual doing away with tax exemptions of rs700 billion in two years in first fiscal year the tax exemption of rs350 billion will be abolished pakistan and the imf team will have to conclude staff level agreement till friday tomorrow as the fund team is scheduled to depart to its headquarters washington dc on friday topline securities pakistan in its research report on wednesday stated that given the ongoing discussions with the international monetary fund imf team and recent changes in key government positions they are of the view that pakistan will likely enter into imf programme by june it argued that pakistan s case is not as acute as egypt as real effective exchange rate reer index is around 100 egypt was 130 before programme and there is no subsidy on fuel in egypt fuel subsidy still continues tax revenue and budget deficit target will likely be the sticking points in the ongoing imf negotiations as 10 month tax revenues show shortfall of around rs345 billion 0 9 percent of gdp while budget deficit is expected to exceed 7 percent in fy19 after a gap of 5 years once again imf will demand pak rupee pkr to be free floated and they expect the pkr to settle in the range of rs160 165 by dec 2019 given expectations of reer below 100 given increased taxation measures to shore up revenues reduction in subsidies and devaluation they expect inflation to average in low double digits in fy20 we expect central bank s policy rates to peak at 12 percent during 2019 the imf programme is expected to include key technical benchmarks including net domestic assets nda and net international reserves nir targets which will serve to reduce borrowing from central bank and increase fx reserves respectively the government will have to increase focus towards privatisation and restructuring of loss making state owned enterprises further energy sector reform and resolution of outstanding circular debt will also likely be part of the imf programme pakistan has a long history of signing imf programmes to note benchmark kse 100 index rallied on average by 37 percent in 12 months post imf deal based on last 3 imf programmes we attribute the improvement in market sentiment during imf programme to improved external account situation on receipt of foreign flows and stabilisation on macroeconomic front now based on the assumption that pakistan will get a new imf loan soon they are maintaining index target range of 40 000 45 000 providing total return of 12 26 percent from here as expected the newly appointed finance adviser is making his own team over the last few days the government has appointed a new central bank governor reza baqir who has worked with the imf for the last 18 years and was last heading the imf mission in egypt reza baqir has overseen the implementation of the current imf programme in egypt which was approved in november 2016 and will end later in 2019 the egyptian programme had two key contours that is free float of currency and reduction in energy subsidy the government has appointed shabbar zaidi a seasoned tax consultant and former partner of a f ferguson co as head of other key institution federal board of revenue fbr these two changes we believe are a desperate move to get imf package and implement tough economic reforms we expect imf programme will likely be approved this month or next month we expect imf bailout package to be an extended fund facility eff for a period of 3 years though the previous finance minister was expecting a 6 8 billion package we think the size of the programme should be bigger 10bn considering upcoming debt repayments with imf s support other lending agencies will also feel comfortable to provide funding to pakistan there are news reports of world bank wb and asian development bank adb to extend their support to pakistan to the tune of 6 8 billion once pakistan enters imf programme we may see major steps towards fiscal monetary and structural reforms in next few weeks either with or before the budget that is expected to be announced in next few weeks these may include pkr devaluation free float further hike in interest rates increase in energy prices elimination of subsidies new and more taxes aggressive privatisation policy among others it concluded

china inflation picked up in april but this was mostly due to supply side factors and not stronger domestic demand consumer price inflation rose to a six month high of 2 5 y y in april up from 2 3 y y

tariff geddon taxes global markets the fallout from the trump s threatened friday tariff geddon gathered pace overnight wall street retreated sharply as expectations increased of a u s china trade talk stalemate in a somewhat delayed reaction to sunday s social media bombshell unsurprisingly u s treasury yields moved lower and the u s dollar and japanese yen jpy ratcheted higher as investors rotated into safer harbours at the expense of emerging markets on wall street it was a sea of red with the s p 500 falling 1 65 per cent the nasdaq falling 1 96 per cent and the dow jones falling 1 79 per cent it has and continues to be the author s thesis that global bond markets have been signalling a global slowdown is coming for some time there are slowdowns and there are slowdowns the u s china trade deal is the critical determinant of how deep or shallow the downturn will be with global interest rates mostly at or near record lows except for the united states the world s central banks are ill placed to cut rates to stimulate growth as they reap the harvest of their excessively easy monetary policies of the last ten years in this context the importance of the trade deal can be clearly noted if stocks were falling like birds from the sky overnight it is another flightless bird from down under the kiwi that will have asia s attention initially this morning at 10 am singapore time the reserve bank of new zealand rbnz will in all likelihood cut rates to record lows of 1 50 a rate cut has been baked into the new zealand dollar s nzd price for some time now the real interest will in the statement and press conference one hour later there we will see if the cut is one and done or there are further cuts in the pipeline the rbnz s conundrum is a familiar one to many central banks an economy cruising along nicely but elusive inflation still ten years after the global financial crisis china s trade balance is also released at 1100 singapore time but will in all likelihood be ignored asia prefers to look nervously at wall street s overnight losses and that dirty two word phrase trade talks currencies the jpy rallied strongly against the dollar with japan s return from the extended golden week break putting it in a club of one usd jpy has fallen 0 50 per cent overnight to 110 20 with the jpy s haven credentials being well and truly put on the table yen typically rallies in times of stress and its strength this week is a clear warning shot of potential volatility ahead elsewhere it was business as usual as greenback bulldozed all before it as high yield haven currency of choice for 2019 the fall in u s treasury yields overnight is clearly signalling the u s bond market as the harbour of choice for investors to let the storms past and that will continue to support the greenback with the australian and new zealand dollars hovering above key supports emerging asia currencies will likely feel the chill winds as well in today s session as part of a global em retreat equities both hong kong and china managed small bounces yesterday after monday s heavy losses that is unlikely to be the case today given wall street s heavy sell off overnight in all likelihood asia s stock markets will be a sea of red today as investors focus on global growth threats and head for the doors regional stock markets are particularly vulnerable to trade talk jitters given their high beta to trade with china with the trade talks restarting tomorrow in washington d c we will need to see concrete progress and quickly to lift trump s tariff geddon on friday until then it is hard to see the monsoon clouds hanging over asia s regional markets clearing oil oil followed the trade talk playbook to the letter with both brent crude and wti crumpling on global growth fears brent fell 2 45 per cent to 69 50 a barrel closing below 70 00 support wti fell 1 75 per cent to 61 15 a barrel with the 60 00 a barrel region next in its sights following the fx and equity playbook it is hard to see asia being anything but downcast on oil s prospects and positioning itself accordingly black gold will remain gloomy until we get more clarity from washington d c this week gold gold managed an asthmatic 0 35 per cent rally to 1284 50 overnight in yet another underwhelming performance that will have bulls very concerned gold should be benefiting from the turmoil in global markets but stubbornly refuses to gain a shred of upside momentum 1300 00 may as well be a million miles away and if friday s tariff geddon is avoided or postponed one cannot help but feel concerned for gold s prospects

london with wall street hitting all time highs and the us economy certain to set a new record next month it seems a lifetime since the despondency in financial markets at the end of last year fears of recession have been completely refuted and investors who shared the view expressed here in early january that markets were just going through a bout of irrational panic have enjoyed the strongest start to a year since 1998 the market s rollercoaster behaviour is easy to explain at least in hindsight investors were understandably worried by four risks last year overly aggressive us monetary tightening escalation of the us china trade conflict soaring oil prices possibly returning to 100 per barrel or higher and another euro crisis precipitated by the unprecedented left right populist coalition that emerged from italy s election by the end of the year however all of these risks had subsided the us federal reserve executed a dovish u turn the us china trade war moved towards a ceasefire oil prices fell and italy resolved its fiscal clash with the european commission in a fairly innocuous truce with all of these problems receding the surge in equity prices from january onward was understandable and even predictable the question now is whether this rebound will lead to a resumption of the bull market or turn out to be only a temporary bounce in my view the bull market will continue despite the fact that it has already broken records for longevity the us economic expansion will also break historic records when it enters its eleventh year in june the fundamental reason is that the combination of very low inflation and decently strong economic activity that has characterised the world economy since the 2008 financial crisis shows no sign of ending this benign outlook may seem at odds with two concepts that have dominated economic commentary since the financial crisis secular stagnation and the deflationary new normal both have proved misleading and confusing secular stagnation at least as a description of global economic activity is simply wrong global growth has averaged 3 7 per cent since the end of the recession in mid 2009 which is actually slightly faster than the 3 6 per cent average in the 30 years to 2008 and there has not been a single year this decade in which global growth fell below 3 per cent how could this have happened given that growth in europe the united states and china has slowed since the crisis the explanation is simple arithmetic china and other emerging economies now make up a much larger share of the global economy than in previous decades their increasing dominance creates a base effect that outweighs the slowdown in their national growth rates for example china s gdp growth of 6 5 per cent last year from a base of 14 trillion contributed twice as much to the increase in global output as in 2007 when its economy grew by 14 per cent from a base of 3 5 trillion this calculation is not just a statistical oddity robust and steady gdp growth has been reflected in growing global demand for commodities energy and real goods and services which in turn has translated into robust and steadily growing corporate profits on the other hand the concept of a deflationary new normal is perfectly valid if we focus on inflation instead of economic growth in oecd economies average inflation plunged from an average of 6 2 per cent in the 30 years to 2007 to just 1 9 per cent since 2008 on wall street the combination of moderate economic growth and very low inflation is commonly called the goldilocks economy after the fairy tale about a girl who wants her porridge not too hot and not too cold but a crucial feature of the goldilocks economy is widely misunderstood by investors economists and even central bankers the apparent contradiction between high stock prices which seem to anticipate strong economic activity and falling bond yields which seem to predict global recession or secular stagnation most economists seem to believe that stock markets are over optimistic and wrong while bond markets know something troublesome about the future and are right others argue the opposite but what both sides miss is that in a world of persistently moderate growth and persistently low inflation seemingly optimistic stock markets and seemingly pessimistic bond markets is no contradiction sky high equity prices and rock bottom bond yields are simply sending messages about totally different subjects equity prices are driven by prospects for real economic activity and the expected corporate profits that will result from it but bond prices are driven by the prospects for inflation and the expected interest rates that will result from it in the pre crisis world strong economic growth almost invariably meant higher inflation and therefore higher interest rates but during the past decade the links between economic activity inflation and monetary policy that were taken for granted in the 1980s and 1990s have completely broken down the pre crisis dogma that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon has turned out to be nonsense at least for advanced economies where central banks have printed money like wallpaper without any inflationary response the breakdown of old links between growth and inflation could be due to globalisation technology demographics the weakening of organised labour or other reasons but whatever the causes the consequences for financial markets should now be clear until the combination of steady growth and low inflation is seriously disrupted asset prices will remain much higher and bond yields much lower than pre crisis analysis considered normal sooner or later some political shock will doubtless disrupt the happy balance of robust global growth and low inflation as us president donald trump s trade wars and oil sanctions almost did last year but until such a shock actually happens investors

china inflation picked up in april but this was mostly due to supply side factors and not stronger domestic demand consumer price inflation rose to a six month high of 2 5 y y in april up from 2 3 y y

swine flu was mostly to blame pork price inflation jumped to 14 4 producer price inflation also picked up from 0 4 y y to a four month high of 0 9 this increase was partly due a growth in factory gate

president and chief executive officer thank you chuck good morning and we appreciate you joining us today for our third quarter fiscal year 2019 conference call i will begin with a brief discussion of our operations then our cfo chuck barrantes will provide a financial overview and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year following his remarks we will open the call up for questions we continue to be extremely pleased with our solid operational and financial performance as all of our companies continue to perform at a high level the strong momentum we experienced in the first half of the year continued into the third quarter making the ninth consecutive quarter where we delivered year over year growth in adjusted ebitda our north american leasing operations continue to see strong demand across virtually all of its end markets with a total revenue in the third quarter increasing by 10 year over year and leasing revenues increased by 12 driven by an increase in unit growth higher average lease rates and higher fleet utilization across most of our product lines during the quarter we are very proud of these outstanding results our core portable storage business again continues to perform at the high end of our expectation driven by solid execution and broad based demand across the majority of the end markets ground level offices and storage containers continue to show very high demand as these two product lines generated a combination year over year rental revenue increase of 29 over which was organic growth taking into account all of pac van product lines organic rental revenue growth was 15 for the quarter and 17 year to date our team continues to do a great job executing on a number of initiatives particularly our national account program and our recently introduced pv3 safety containers which together accounted for approximately 15 of the year over year growth in rental revenue pac van continues to be highly regarded by its customers and once again posted a world class net promoter score of 83 in the last 12 months in addition to organic growth we remain focused on building the pac van brand throughout north america by geographically expanding our portable storage container business during the quarter we completed one acquisition in fort worth texas increasing our presence in that dynamic state we also opened a greenfield location in panama city florida adding our eighth branch in the southeast region this week we completed an acquisition of a portable storage business in kentucky adding three locations to the three already in kentucky we continue to serve just over half of the top 100 msas in the us including 39 of the top 50 and our acquisition pipeline remains healthy our liquid containment business in north america delivered slightly improved year over year results as we have seen some moderation in leasing activity in texas while oil and gas production in both basins remain healthy we were impacted in the quarter by certain customers consolidating their field personnel due to recent acquisition activity as well as the normal seasonal slowdown combined with some pipeline availability challenges with some of our customers in the permian all indicators point to continued healthy production activity in both basins in the foreseeable future our overall business remains strong but it s not operating at peak level we were experiencing last fall our north american manufacturing operations posted a slightly positive adjusted ebitda during the quarter as sales to external customers declined from reduced sales of specialty tanks and chassis but we expect activity to increase in fourth quarter as the backlog is very strong now turning to our asia pacific region our asia pacific region continued its positive momentum by delivering third quarter growth in leasing revenues of 11 on a local currency basis up from 9 growth last quarter and marking its 10th year over year increase out of the last 11 quarters sales revenues were down year over year in local currency mostly due to one large sale that occurred last year in third quarter that wasn t repeated this year total reported revenues during the quarter in us dollar were adversely impacted by an approximate 9 decline in average australian dollar exchange rate between periods the increase in royal wolf s leasing revenues was spread across almost all of the end markets with noticeable increases in transportation construction consumer and industrial sectors the growth has mainly been driven by increases in average units on lease combined with average lease rates our team remains focused on building upon its leading market position across the region through a combination of organic growth greenfield openings and to the extent they become available accretive acquisitions to conclude we continue to see both organic growth and expansion opportunities in north america as well as ability to strengthen our market leadership in the asia pacific region as always we ll remain disciplined in our capital allocation our performance year to date positions us well to finish the year strong while also providing us with a solid foundation for continued growth in the fiscal year 2020 i ll now turn over the call to chuck barrantes for his financial review and our outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks jody we intend on filing our annual report on form 10 q shortly at which time this document will be available on both the sec s edgar filing system and our website and i encourage investors and other interested parties to read it as it contains a substantial amount of information about our company some of which we will discuss today turning to our fiscal third quarter financial results total revenues were 86 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 compared to 84 4 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 an increase of 2 leasing revenues were 59 6 million an increase of approximately 9 over the prior year s quarter and comprised 70 of total non manufacturing revenues for the quarter versus 67 in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 non manufacturing sales revenues were 25 2 million in the quarter down from 27 3 million in the third quarter of the prior year in our north american leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totaled 57 2 million compared with 51 8 million for the year ago period an increase of 10 the increases occurred across most sectors but primarily in the construction commercial and oil and gas sectors revenues at our north american manufacturing operations for the third quarter were 27 point 2 7 million excuse me including intercompany sales of 1 3 million for our north american leasing operations this compares to 3 2 million of total sales for the year ago period including intercompany sales of 922 000 ph as jody mentioned our manufacturing operations experienced reduced demand for specialty tanks and other steel related products particularly chassis in our asia pacific leasing operations revenues for the third quarter totaled 27 6 million compared to 30 3 million for the year ago period a decrease of 9 the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a decrease in utility sector as one large sale totaling 1 8 million which occurred in the third quarter of fiscal year 2018 was not repeated this year and as jody mentioned an approximate 9 decline in the australian dollar between the periods leasing revenues increased by approximately 1 on a year over year basis and 11 on a local currency basis driven mainly by increases in the transportation construction industrial and consumer sectors consolidated adjusted ebitda was 24 1 million in the quarter compared to 21 9 million in the prior year s quarter an increase of 10 and adjusted ebitda margin as a percentage of total revenues was 28 up from 26 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 as jody stated this was the ninth consecutive quarter of year over year adjusted ebitda growth in north america adjusted ebitda for our leasing operations was 17 3 million in the third quarter compared to 15 2 million for the year ago quarter an increase of 14 adjusted ebitda at pac van was 12 2 million up 20 year over year and lone star s adjusted ebitda was 5 1 million up 2 from the prior year for our manufacturing operations on a stand alone basis adjusted ebitda was 17 000 for the quarter compared to 111 000 in last year s third quarter asia pacific s adjusted ebitda for the third quarter was 8 1 million compared to 7 6 million in the year ago period an increase of approximately 7 on a local currency basis adjusted ebitda increased by approximately 17 interest expense for the third quarter was up 10 2 million an increase of 800 000 from the year ago period the increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense in the asia pacific area due to a 1 2 million fee on the prepayment of the bison capital term notes which resulted in a higher weighted average interest rate of 13 7 versus 10 4 in the year ago period and was partially offset by a lower average borrowings and a weaker australian dollar between the periods during the quarter we completed we completely repaid the over 60 million bison capital senior note in the asia pacific area replacing this higher cost debt with lower cost borrowings on an amended and expanded syndicated credit facility led by deutsche bank ag this move is expected to generate interest savings of over 3 million per year net loss attributable to common stockholders in the third quarter was 1 3 million or 0 04 per diluted share compared to a net loss of 1 5 million or 0 06 per share in the year ago quarter included in these results were non cash charges of 1 1 million and 500 000 ph in fiscal year 2019 and 2018 respectively for the change in valuation of the stand alone bifurcated derivatives in our asia pacific convertible note both periods include 922 000 for the dividends paid on our preferred stock for the first nine months of fiscal year 2019 we generated free cash flow before fleet activity of 35 7 million compared to 32 2 million in the prior year period an increase of 11 now turning to our balance sheet at march 31st the company had a net leverage ratio of 4 times for the trailing 12 months an improvement from 4 6 times at june 30 2018 the reduction in leverage is due to a combination of factors including the forced conversion of the convertible note at royal wolf and our strong financial performance turning to our companywide outlook for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 based on our year to date results we remain confident that consolidated revenues for the fiscal year 2019 will be in the range of 370 million to 390 million and that consolidated adjusted ebitda will increase by 20 to 25 in fiscal year 2019 from fiscal year 2018 this outlook does not take into account the impact of any additional acquisitions that may occur in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 this now concludes our prepared comments and i would like to turn the call back to the operator for the question and answer session questions and answers operator thank you at this time ladies and gentlemen the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question comes from the line of brent thielman of d a davidson brent thielman d a davidson analyst hey thanks good morning jody e miller president and chief executive officer hey good morning brent charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning brent thielman d a davidson analyst i mean the outlook to get to the upper end of that ebitda guidance range you need to see a pretty sizable increase in ebitda from 3q to 4q can you get there even with the containment business sort of sideways here jody e miller president and chief executive officer i think a lot of it will depend on the energy side we had a little bit more of a hit we knew some of the challenges coming but through the consolidation and the pipeline issues and everything else it appears it s picking up i don t know if it will pick up quite enough to make up the gap our core business in the us as we stated on the call is doing exceptionally well with our containerized fleet growing at 29 for the year but it s probably not quite enough to make up the top of the range for the energy side and then australian dollars really hurting us at 9 year over year as well so it ll be a little bit tough to get up to the top of the range charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer brent as jody mentioned earlier on the call i mean it s we re still doing very well on the permian it s just not shooting at all levels it was early part of the year but we do still expect to have year over year growth in q4 so like anything else it s always at a point in time so we re still very very optimistic and on the future in that sector in our business in north america brent thielman d a davidson analyst sure and yes i mean jody it sounds like things are picking up i ll assume that means slowly but you ve seen some changes since the end of the quarter in that business out there jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay and then chuck were there additional costs that showed up in the interest line this quarter relative to the paydown at bison capital charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah i mean that s very taking brent s side maybe didn t seem clearly but in the quarter we had about 1 2 million 1 3 million of the prepayment fee on the full repayment of the bison term note so that was the reason for the primary increase brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay got it got it okay and then maybe just last question jody the business in australia i mean obviously doing really well it s evident in the numbers i guess i m just kind of curious what the boots on the ground are telling you just with all the noise around china obviously that has an impact on the economy there i guess what are you seeing from a demand perspective jody e miller president and chief executive officer yeah not much of a change to be honest the construction sector s still doing really well as we said before everything in australia has moved with containers right all the freight so our freight business is still very good they still got to get product in and out all the major cities the bnc ph and stackable solutions are getting more accepted and growing and that s still our fastest growing segment so all indications show that it s still going to be strong we get double digit growth in leasing which i think is exceptional we had a couple large sales that didn t repeat this year we also as you guys would probably remember we have a large majority of camps setting that are getting deployed currently there s a big chunk of them going to a project that will help as well so i think there s good optimism in this coming quarter brent thielman d a davidson analyst okay great thank you jody e miller president and chief executive officer thank you brent charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks brent operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of scott schneeberger of oppenheimer scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst thanks hey good morning guys jody e miller president and chief executive officer good morning scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst let s go back just following on a bunch of things that were just discussed in texas how would you classify your visibility there given the slightly changing dynamic with regard to volume and with regard to pricing jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes so i don t think we ll see the pricing increases that we ve seen the first half of the year i think it s kind of flattened out the price of oil is still fine i think with the consolidation happening right now and some of that obviously they re not buying companies to taper that off long term but there s a little bit of a stall where they catch their breath the drill rigs are down slightly so completions and some of the other things are kind of catching their breath but i look for those to kind of stay stable and gradually pick back up so there s a little bit more happening then there was in the past we don t have the crystal ball to say this is what it s going to be we had scheduled out three to six months on some of our customers and some of those are changing a little bit long term we think it ll work its way out and everything will be fine but i think there s just the last three months and maybe now it seems to be kind of picking back up and being a little more positive than it has been in the last three to four months scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst thanks appreciate that it s helpful i want to go back to swing factors i was asking in the context of what how you could finish the fiscal year but just in that light but also in the quarter itself how much of an impact to the australian dollar have relative to what you were expecting at the start of the quarter i m just curious what kind of a swing factor that was in the quarter itself charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no we the australia dollar for the quarter pretty much performed what we had expected we were looking at around 0 71 ph and that s what it was going to q4 australian dollars dipped down a little bit i think it was below 0 70 so we re getting obviously some negative impact on the translation of the dollar not on the economics locally but for the quarter it was what we expected but 9 reduction compared to the prior year third quarter scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst i appreciate that color and then the last thing on pac van looking really good and hearing from some of your competitors recently the same trends are what we re hearing there too so jody just how do you feel about visibility there and kind of the same question i was asking about texas lone star the pricing the volume and the sustainability there jody e miller president and chief executive officer yeah i think the core portable storage side is extremely strong i think still year to date it s a 17 organic which i think it s just awesome they re doing a great job there i think some of the new innovation national accounts and things that we have implemented i think will continue there and we see nothing but a positive forecast in our core business the tank or liquid storage side in texas and also on the pac van side pricing is doing very very well as well we re getting nice increases and we continue to be very consistent on the lone star side as i said earlier i think pricing is kind of flattened out where we were raising prices the first half maybe not quite as much visibility into the short term future with some of the things that are happening with consolidation they re starting to get their pipeline challenges worked out so we still feel very optimistic about it but in the short term maybe not quite as clear as we ve seen the last year but still very optimistic in the long haul scott schneeberger oppenheimer analyst okay thanks i appreciate it guys operator our next question comes from the line of luis hernandez an investor luis hernandez private investor yes hello good morning thanks for taking the question jody e miller president and chief executive officer good morning luis charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer good morning luis luis hernandez private investor hello all right the first one on the refi of the bison loan that one was around 11 or 12 and charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah 12 luis hernandez private investor sorry go ahead charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer no no 11 9 12 was the luis hernandez private investor and the refinancing is what was at what rate roughly charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer it s with the deutsche bank rate so it s somewhere not quite senior facility rates but around 6 level luis hernandez private investor okay all right i guess that s a pretty good news there then on the pac van which segments are you most more optimistic on over the next 12 18 months jody e miller president and chief executive officer yeah luis i think it s honestly across the board if we look at our growth we break it out by segment all segments are doing very well i think construction looks very positive i think our national accounts is probably the most optimistic opportunity for us some of our new product innovation is helping with all segments but it s really across the board i think we re outgrowing obviously the industry but i think everything looks very optimistic on the core business luis hernandez private investor okay all right great then the other next question would be on do you expect a higher level of free cash flow in q4 i mean this first nine months chuck you said 30 36 million roughly 35 7 million do you expect sort of a bump on q4 just maybe some coming from working capital or something charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i think luis just by the fact that on the refinance of bison capital we should get a nice pick up from there just some free cash flow and yes i do expect free cash flow to pick up luis hernandez private investor okay all right and finally on pac van just to basic to dig little details have you grown the fleet at all jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes yes we re running about 80 utilization so obviously there s branches that are running short we continue to that s a big part of our organic number right so we re 17 organic so when you re running close to that 80 more we definitely have added to the fleet luis hernandez private investor yeah because you were roughly around 4 000 tanks just wanted to know if you had grown those kinds at all jody e miller president and chief executive officer no it s all been core storage and glo our glo is still leads our growth percentage and then storage containers are next those are two higher growth products we ve not really we ve not added anything on the tank side and very little in any other categories charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer in north america last year at march 31 2018 we had about a total lease fleet including 4 000 something frac tanks about 43 000 and at the end of march this current third quarter we re at 51 500 ph luis hernandez private investor okay yeah i when i asked the fleet i meant the tank fleet not something jody e miller president and chief executive officer tanks have not grown significant at all last march we had total tanks in north america 4 146 and we have 4 260 now luis hernandez private investor okay so it s pretty much roughly the same slightly above right that s good and then on the rates on the tanks versus 2014 we always check that number how is that the pickup or the relationship of that jody e miller president and chief executive officer the rates on of which product are you luis hernandez private investor on the tanks on the oil tanks charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and so last year third quarter average rate was about for the quarter it was 805 versus little over 900 this quarter this third quarter luis hernandez private investor okay so 900 and then versus 2014 rates charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer we re still well behind not even close to the peak of those rates i d have to look and see but i would state still 30 40 under what we were at that time luis hernandez private investor right so maybe 70 of the rates okay jody e miller president and chief executive officer yes or a little less luis hernandez private investor yeah all right sounds good thanks good quarter and talk to you guys in next three months jody e miller president and chief executive officer thank you charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you luis operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of brian gagnon of gagnon securities brian gagnon gagnon securities analyst hey jody and chuck you have inaudible this year i m looking at the repayment of the bison note and you got hit with 1 2 ph million in q3 and it looks to me like your savings going forward is something on the order of 700 000 or 800 000 a quarter so can i think about the fourth quarter having an automatic 2 million increase versus where you were in q3 on interest hit charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer i would think that s fair deal ph brian gagnon gagnon securities analyst good gentlemen thank you very much charles e barrantes executive vice president and chief financial officer you re welcome jody e miller president and chief executive officer thank you operator and there are no other questions at this time i would now

this article is more than 4 years old pixabay four latin american property markets are heavily discounted for u s dollar buyers right now the currency savings are the biggest in decades 1 brazil currency brazilian real currency controls yes exchange rate us 1 equals 3 97 reais increase in buying power in past 12 months 15 increase in buying power in past 6 years 83 brazil could be described as one step beyond latin america as its culture and language are more unfamiliar and more exotic than those of other countries in the region one cumbersome aspect of buying property in brazil is that the country imposes currency controls this should not be a reason not to invest it simply means taking the time to understand the extra steps to follow when transferring money historically another disadvantage has been that americans and canadians needed a visa to enter brazil as a tourist however the country now offers an e visa that you can obtain online for only 40 plus a service fee of a few dollars in addition brazil now offers a new program whereby a real estate purchase can qualify you for permanent residency the country is known for its beaches and the coast of fortaleza in northeastern brazil has some of the best this white sand region is an emerging international tourist destination that is significantly undervalued one concern has been access historically to get from the united states to this part of brazil you had to fly hours south and catch a connecting flight back north brazil is a big country now many new direct flights make the fortaleza airport more easily and less painfully reached from both north america and europe thanks in part to this improved access the area is receiving growing numbers of foreign tourists still though in country tourists make up much of this market meaning two populations to tap into for renters and potential buyers when you re ready to exit 2 colombia currency colombian peso currency controls yes exchange rate us 1 equals 3

market will be the worst in our lifetime you might also like dear jim rogers it s time to put your money back on india investment guruis still not invested in india as the market was trending upwards till recently he believes it is about time india opens up all its markets including currency and agriculture in a phone conversation from singapore with etmarkets com last week rogers who is known for his no nonsense style said he did not trust any economic data of any country especially around elections rogers 76 reiterated his fear that a big bear market was in the offing he warned that the world was missing the small signs similar to earlier times and these troubles could snowball into a crisis edited excerpts i invested in india before mr modi was elected and i owned the indian shares but then after a few weeks seeing that he did not do much i sold indian shares and i have had no position in india since mainly because it is actually going up and i like to buy stocks when they are going down not when they are going up well mainly i am cautious about the stocks all over the world now except for a couple of places where they are down a lot if and when stocks all over the world go down or if and when india goes down a lot then i would certainly re examine india i guess the stock market would prefer mr modi at the moment i am mainly looking at russia in fact i am buying shares in russia right now russia is very cheap compared to markets all over the world the main problem is stocks in much of the world are up and i prefer not to buy when things are going up and i know that there are going to be some problems in the markets in the next year or two my hope is that when problems come to the world markets i am smart enough to buy lots of stocks next time we have a bear market it is going to be the worst in my lifetime i do not know when it is going to come but i do know we are going to have it it has been 10 years since the american stock market had a major problem and that is the longest in american history when the next problem comes it is going to be the worst in my lifetime in 2008 we had a problem of too much debt since 2008 debt has sky rocketed everywhere when we have the next bear market it is only going to be horrible i do not know when it is going to be i like russia and agriculture mainly i would like to invest in venezuela but then i am not allowed to because i am american i have learned over the decades that when you have a country totally collapsing if you invest there you become happy after four or five years i am not allowed to invest in venezuela at the moment and north korea i would love to invest in but the same applies i am not allowed to because i am an american i am not rushing around looking for investments right now because i am worried about what is going to happen in the world i am buying russian stocks today i own russian government bonds in roubles as well the interest rates are very high there so yes i am interested in both crude in my view is in the process of making a complicated bottom in a few years and then it will be going up for a long time and that is because known reserves of oil all over the world are in decline and have been in decline for some years oil prices are bottoming out they have been bottoming out since 2014 it is a complicated bottom if you look on the soft price chart you will see the bottom is going sideways for several years they are going sideways sideways sideways sideways up and down up and down up and down up and down for years so it is the best bottoms when they turn around they go up a lot and we are in the process of making a bottom like that i am not investing in us stock market because i expect problems to come in the next year or two i am not buying shares in the us market some of the stocks like apple and google go up every day they never go down which is a dangerous sign in any stock markets when you have a few stocks always going up and the movement has been concentrated and that seems to be what is happening in the us stock market top investment i guess i would say probably chinese shares right now or maybe russia i would have to go and look i am buying more russia as we speak if you mean by what are the top assets i am buying it would be russian shares at the moment if it is where i own the most stocks it would probably be russia or china chinese shares have come down significantly from their all time highs there are some companies which have problems which is good but other companies other industries in china will continue to do well no matter what happens chinese agriculture is a great place to be and the pollution clean up is a great place to be you are going to see some bankruptcies in china in the next year or two there are some good things in china and some are bad yes it will because both sides need it and they both have expectations so yes there is going to be some good news coming out fairly soon and we will all be happy for a while but it will not last very long because the next time the american stock market or the economy starts having problems mr trump is going to blame that on asia and come out with more trade war not just against china but against japan korea and everybody because mr trump in his heart thinks trade war is good he is surrounded by people who think trade war is good he thinks he can win a trade war he does not know history thinks he is smarter than history or both i know he is thinking he is smarter than history and i doubt if he knows history so we will have more trade wars next year the year after and that is why another reason the next time we have a bear market it is going to be the worst in my lifetime no i will just say it will be the worst in my lifetime it has been over ten years since we had a serious bear market in the united states i would suspect by the end of this year or next year it will start these things always start small where people are not looking and then they work to the major markets and then you see them on the major news in 2007 iceland went bankrupt but nobody noticed or cared then ireland went bankrupt then a few weeks later bear sterns went bankrupt and a few weeks later northern rock the english bank went bankrupt then eventually lehman brothers went bankrupt and by then everybody knew there was a problem but it had been there for over a year and it has always worked that way it starts when we are not watching it has already started latvia collapsed argentina venezuela turkey some banks in india are having problems indonesia has started having problems it has not made to evening news yet all these markets are small but until they make it to the big markets people do not notice well i was thinking agriculture because it is down so much agriculture has been a disaster for decades i am waiting for gold to go down i have already said gold will go down a lot if the collapse comes again it usually does and that would present a great buying opportunity i own a lot of us dollars at the moment in anticipation of the turmoil people look for a safe haven when there is turmoil they think the us dollar is a safe haven it is not but people think it is so it will go up in the eventuality of a bubble it will get overpriced my is to sell my dollars and i might put them in gold gold often go down when you have market turmoil i would sell my dollars and buy gold or maybe if agriculture gets scaled again then i would probably swap some of the dollar to agriculture too at the moment for me agriculture is the safest but the safest and there is no such word as safe when you are talking about investment is the us dollar it is still somewhat depressed people are realising that it has strength it has been going up for about four years now it is still well down from it s all time high i would suspect dollar will be what people think is the safest haven in the next couple of years modi has done some nice things my main point is that he has done a few small things he has not done any good big thing as far as i can think india needs to open its markets after all these decades this is 2019 this is not 1990 and india should have opened currency markets opened investment markets opened markets of all kind he is buying votes in anticipation of what is going on now he is fine about those as you know he is giving special incentives to farmers he is trying to get their votes for this election but i am not a big fan of mr modi he gets great great great publicity all over the world and he is very well liked all over the world but as far as the real policy is concerned i have not seen a dramatic change yet i do not pay much attention to economic data especially around the elections you probably know that all governments fudge their numbers always but especially during election period i do not trust any government numbers most of the time and certainly not during election time so i have no idea if these numbers are real or not i do not trust anybody s numbers including the us especially the us any other thoughts that you would want to share with us any particular thought on india indian markets world markets anything that i may have missed out and you would want to share with us jim rogers i wish mr modi will open the market i wish he would open the currency market the investment markets and agriculture markets india should be one of the great agriculture nations in the world you have been at some time in your history you have the weather you have the people you have the soil i just wish you would open up all the markets especially agriculture agro investments and currencies i would love india much more if you did that i do not vote in india so you do not have to listen to me but that is what i would urge whoever it is mr modi or anybody i do not care who it is i just wish they will open up india finally it is not 1990 it is 2019
london with wall street hitting all time highs and the us economy certain to set a new record next month it seems a lifetime since the despondency in financial markets at the end of last year fears of recession have been completely refuted and investors who shared the view expressed here in early january that markets were just going through a bout of irrational panic have enjoyed the strongest start to a year since 1998 the market s rollercoaster behaviour is easy to explain at least in hindsight investors were understandably worried by four risks last year overly aggressive us monetary tightening escalation of the us china trade conflict soaring oil prices possibly returning to 100 per barrel or higher and another euro crisis precipitated by the unprecedented left right populist coalition that emerged from italy s election by the end of the year however all of these risks had subsided the us federal reserve executed a dovish u turn the us china trade war moved towards a ceasefire oil prices fell and italy resolved its fiscal clash with the european commission in a fairly innocuous truce with all of these problems receding the surge in equity prices from january onward was understandable and even predictable the question now is whether this rebound will lead to a resumption of the bull market or turn out to be only a temporary bounce in my view the bull market will continue despite the fact that it has already broken records for longevity the us economic expansion will also break historic records when it enters its eleventh year in june the fundamental reason is that the combination of very low inflation and decently strong economic activity that has characterised the world economy since the 2008 financial crisis shows no sign of ending this benign outlook may seem at odds with two concepts that have dominated economic commentary since the financial crisis secular stagnation and the deflationary new normal both have proved misleading and confusing secular stagnation at least as a description of global economic activity is simply wrong global growth has averaged 3 7 per cent since the end of the recession in mid 2009 which is actually slightly faster than the 3 6 per cent average in the 30 years to 2008 and there has not been a single year this decade in which global growth fell below 3 per cent how could this have happened given that growth in europe the united states and china has slowed since the crisis the explanation is simple arithmetic china and other emerging economies now make up a much larger share of the global economy than in previous decades their increasing dominance creates a base effect that outweighs the slowdown in their national growth rates for example china s gdp growth of 6 5 per cent last year from a base of 14 trillion contributed twice as much to the increase in global output as in 2007 when its economy grew by 14 per cent from a base of 3 5 trillion this calculation is not just a statistical oddity robust and steady gdp growth has been reflected in growing global demand for commodities energy and real goods and services which in turn has translated into robust and steadily growing corporate profits on the other hand the concept of a deflationary new normal is perfectly valid if we focus on inflation instead of economic growth in oecd economies average inflation plunged from an average of 6 2 per cent in the 30 years to 2007 to just 1 9 per cent since 2008 on wall street the combination of moderate economic growth and very low inflation is commonly called the goldilocks economy after the fairy tale about a girl who wants her porridge not too hot and not too cold but a crucial feature of the goldilocks economy is widely misunderstood by investors economists and even central bankers the apparent contradiction between high stock prices which seem to anticipate strong economic activity and falling bond yields which seem to predict global recession or secular stagnation most economists seem to believe that stock markets are over optimistic and wrong while bond markets know something troublesome about the future and are right others argue the opposite but what both sides miss is that in a world of persistently moderate growth and persistently low inflation seemingly optimistic stock markets and seemingly pessimistic bond markets is no contradiction sky high equity prices and rock bottom bond yields are simply sending messages about totally different subjects equity prices are driven by prospects for real economic activity and the expected corporate profits that will result from it but bond prices are driven by the prospects for inflation and the expected interest rates that will result from it in the pre crisis world strong economic growth almost invariably meant higher inflation and therefore higher interest rates but during the past decade the links between economic activity inflation and monetary policy that were taken for granted in the 1980s and 1990s have completely broken down the pre crisis dogma that inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon has turned out to be nonsense at least for advanced economies where central banks have printed money like wallpaper without any inflationary response the breakdown of old links between growth and inflation could be due to globalisation technology demographics the weakening of organised labour or other reasons but whatever the causes the consequences for financial markets should now be clear until the combination of steady growth and low inflation is seriously disrupted asset prices will remain much higher and bond yields much lower than pre crisis analysis considered normal sooner or later some political shock will doubtless disrupt the happy balance of robust global growth and low inflation as us president donald trump s trade wars and oil sanctions almost did last year but until such a shock actually happens investors can sit back and enjoy their porridge just the way they like it anatole kaletsky is chief economist and co chairman of gavekal dragonomics and the author of capitalism 4 0 the birth of a new economy

many blog readers have asked for my opinions of modern monetary theory i haven t written yet because i try to read about things in some detail ideally from original sources before reviewing them which i have not done life is short from the summaries i have read some of the central propositions of mmt draw a false conclusion from two sensible premises 1 countries that print their own currencies do not have to default on excessive debts they can always print money to pay off debts true 2 inflation in the end can and must be controlled by raising taxes or cutting spending sufficiently to soak up such printed non interest bearing money true the latter proposition is the heart of the fiscal theory of the price level so i would have an especially tough time objecting it does not follow that the us need not worry about deficits and may happily borrow tens of trillions to finance all sorts of spending borrow 50 trillion or so when bondholders revolt print money to pay off the bonds when this results in inflation raise taxes to soak up the money ok but this latter step is exactly raising taxes to pay off the bonds moreover if bondholders see that the plan is to pay off bonds with printed money they refuse to buy or roll over bonds in the first place and the inflation can happen right away this may reflect a common confusion between today s money with the new money that pays off debt it would only take 1 5 trillion in extra taxes or lower spending to retire current currency non interest bearing government debt outstanding but that s not the task after the great bond bailout then we have to raise taxes or cut spending by in my example the 50 trillion printed to pay off the bonds large debts are either paid or defaulted and inflation is the same thing economically as default period currency boards run in to some of the same problem backing today s currency is not enough to avoid devaluation if one does not back all the debt which promises to pay currency i must admit some amusement that keynesian commentators having urged fiscal stimulus and decried evil austerians for years are apoplectic to be passed on the left but that does not make the ideas of those passing on the left any more right there is also a different and interesting strain of thought exemplified by recent writings by larry summers and olivier blanchard that the current low interest rate environment might allow for somewhat but not unlimited extra borrowing those ideas are completely different analytically i hope to cover them in a later blog post noah smith and guru based theory but as i said i have not studied mmt so perhaps i m missing something enter noah smith who has delved in to figure out just what mmt is and whether or how it hangs together noah interestingly characterizes mmt as guru based theory noah says formal models vs guru based theories these days most economic theories are collections of mathematical models if you want to know what the theory says you can parse out the models and see for yourself you don t have to go ask mike woodford what new keynesian theory says you don t have to go ask ed prescott what rbc theory says you can go read a new keynesian model or a real business cycle model and figure it out on your own mmt is different there are many wordy explainers and videos that will explain some of the concepts behind mmt or tell you some of mmt s policy recommendations but that s different than having a formal model of the economy formal models have important advantages for one thing a good formal model can be compared with quantitative data to see whether it works or whether it fails formal models can make testable predictions a second advantage of formal models is that you can figure them out for yourself without having to ask any gurus if you have to run to the gurus to ask them what the theory says any time you think you ve found a flaw it becomes almost impossible to skeptics or outsiders to evaluate the theory objectively this is a good insight and well supported by the rest of noah s post after an exhaustive tour of noah s struggles with one paper that does seem to offer a framework he offers i m not confident in my ability to answer these and other important questions by reading l randall wray blog posts or long online explainers or wordy mmt papers i want to be able to read a concrete formal well specified model like the tcherneva model above and answer these questions myself and the rest of the non mmt econ deserves this as well the paper is monopoly money the state as a price setter by pavlina r tcherneva published in oeconomicus which as far as i can tell is a newsletter of the university of missouri kansas city there are plenty of guru based theories around much of literature and philosophy is concerned with what did x really mean from shakespeare to marx the impersonality of theory is the main distinction of science if you want to know what newton really meant you do not learn latin to read the original you pick up the most recent undergraduate textbook the sociology of science i view it somewhat differently however in fact formal models don t totally speak for themselves especially on the research frontier new keynesian models are a good example since there is an active debate on just what the equations say and how to interpret them i ve devoted a lot of energy to this debate it is conducted in the pages of peer reviewed journals there is or was an active debate on what the equations of quantum mechanics and general relativity say too and while the occasional testable prediction makes for spectacular rhetoric economics like other non experimental sciences is pretty thin on testable predictions otherwise we would still not be debating what really caused the great depression whether minimum wages help or hurt disadvantaged people whether the government borrowing money and spending it even on totally useless projects stimulates the economy or not i read noah s story instead as a good documentation of how mmters and especially mmt advocates in the policy world ignore the scientific sociology of contemporary economics there are no mmt articles in major peer reviewed academic journals there are essentially none at major professional conferences such as the american economic association meetings there are no academic mmt articles in the major working paper series there are no mmt books from university presses while noah points to the content the lack of formal modeling i found noah s characterization of the messenger just as interesting it is almost entirely a creature of tweets blog posts youtube videos and so on now the sociology of science is no guarantee of correct results nine out of ten or more published articles are wrong or just plain silly from a free market economists point of view whole academic fields journals and professional societies seem to have gone off the deep end especially in the humanities fads have come and gone in the pages of the american economic review too but as many bad ideas survive in the society of science the number of genuinely successful ideas ideas eventually seen to be logically and scientifically correct and most of all ideas that are ready to be reliable guides to policy that ignore this scientific sociology is vanishingly small yes there are new ideas that begin new fields economics itself started with a book by adam smith but monetary economics is a well established field and this range of ideas the nature of money the tax backing of money the interaction of monetary and fiscal policy government budget constraints and so on is well within the range that current intellectual institutions debate knowledgeably the fraction of good solid ready for policy ideas of that sort outside the scientific mainstream is vanishingly small and the fraction of crackpot junk science there is pretty large i do not blame the mmters they have some ideas and they have found an audience ready to listen via this nontraditional method the curious thing is that those who frame the national discussion of economic policy in politics and media take so seriously ideas that have not made it in to the scientific mainstream that larger society of economic discussion and policy bears some of the blame while disparaging mmters their commitment to science based policy in general is not deep most macroeconomic policy analysis takes place within late 1970s era keynesian islm framework that has not been seen in major peer reviewed journals since that time perhaps as even luminaries such as larry summers and paul krugman have written everything since then has been a misguided waste of time such things do happen in economics but then we can t complain too much and get on our scientific high horses about mmters relying on guru based views of the world that avoid the trappings of economic science traditional keynesianism is at this point pretty much a guru based enterprise and a verbal tradition not based on formal models which were eviscerated in the 1980s published in academic journals likewise much of what the fed tries to digest and control anything with the words systemic risk liquidity contagion for example goes to put it politely far beyond anything of which we have solid scientific understanding the rest of economic policy is even further removed there isn t much scientific basis for the sec s micro management of asset markets the ftc s ideas about competition the labor department s intensely specific rules and so on what study there is tends to be academics jumping in after the fact to find new questions to which policies might be the answer in sum the policy and political world would have a lot more room to complain if they demanded more science both in the method of analysis and the form of its communication before acting mmt i did a little background research beyond reading noah s blog post to find the academic articles on mmt and to document the above views in more detail if i am missing important things especially crucial peer reviewed publications feel free to let me know via comments i started with the the social science research network ssrn which has pretty much every academic article on economics written since its founding it has a lot of other stuff too and it s open to everyone unlike say the nber working papers needless to say the same search in nber working papers came up empty i searched for modern monetary theory and found a grand total of 11 results several of those were spurious modern monetary theory can mean well modern monetary theory not modern monetary theory i e new keynesian models micro foundations of money and so on all i found were three blog posts modern monetary theory a primer on the operational realities of the monetary system by scott t fullwiler modern money theory a response to critics by scott t fullwiler stephanie bell and l randall wray the conscience of a neo liberal by scott t fullwiler only one that looks like a paper is very high public debt a problem pedro leã o and a critique does government spending increase your saving hak choi this paper works out the rights and wrongs of government spending but disproves the extreme part of the modern monetary theory another way to do this is to find writings by specific authors scott fullwiler and stephanie kelton i found their author pages on ssrn but that s not comprehensive i searched for their cvs normally academics post their cvs or their departments web administrators do so you can get a full list of their publications that way strangely i couldn t find cvs for either even on kelton s snazzy website pavlina r tcherneva has a publication list but it does not include any peer reviewed articles if you know where these are hiding let me know this search did turn up some academic articles setting interest rates in the modern money era by st fullwiler journal of post keynesian economics 2006 timeliness and the fed s daily tactics by st fullwiler journal of economic issues 2003 macroeconomic stabilization through an employer of last resort by st fullwiler journal of economic issues 2007 paying interest on reserve balances it s more significant than you think by st fullwiler journal of economic issues 2005 in one ranking the journal of post keynesian economics is 453 and economic issues 972 last thought now i really don t want to be snooty here as there is a place for blog posts in trowing out ideas and discussing them i m obviously a big believer in discussing economic ideas via blogs there is an important place in science for niche journals many important new ideas have had to start their own journals create a community of peers that will review papers and advance a research agenda that way before breaking into the mainstream but these ideas have clearly not yet made it into that mainstream the real question is when is an idea ready for widespread implementation in public policy how much of the sociology of science should we wait for before spending trillions of dollars though some good ideas have indeed been disparaged by the mainstream and took a long time to be accepted there are so many bad ideas out there that i think the answer is a bit longer certainly the advocates of mmt seem not too interested in say writings on climate change expressed entirely on critical blog posts youtube videos and nice climate skeptic journals their embrace of mmt has made a mockery of their embrace of science on climate questions but there is plenty of hypocrisy going around on those subjects note to readers yes the blog is back i had to take a few weeks off to get through some screaming items on the inbox update sebastian edwards has read and thought about mmt more than i have and has written an interesting review of how mmt policies worked out in latin america according to modern monetary theory mmt it is possible to use expansive monetary policy money creation by the central bank i e the federal reserve to finance large fiscal deficits that will ensure full employment and good jobs for everyone through a jobs guarantee program in this paper i analyze some of latin america s historical episodes with mmt type policies chile peru argentina and venezuela the four experiments ended up badly with runaway inflation huge currency devaluations and precipitous real wage declines these experiences offer a cautionary tale for mmt enthusiasts editor s note the summary bullets for this article were chosen by seeking alpha editors
by yawen chen and kevin yao beijing reuters chinese banks throttled back new lending in april after a record first quarter that sparked fears of more bad loans but analysts say the central bank will likely have to step up support for the economy as trade tensions with the united states escalate global investors are closely watching to see how much more support beijing will inject to shore up growth but those policy expectations are swinging wildly as a sudden blowup in diplomatic ties threatens china s nascent recovery u s president donald trump stunned financial markets this week by announcing he will hike tariffs on chinese goods on friday unless beijing agrees to a trade deal sharply escalating their dispute after months of negotiations beijing has vowed to retaliate the resurgence in external risks comes as china s economy was beginning to show tentative signs of stabilizing after a raft of growth boosting measures more modest bank lending last month suggested the central bank was fine tuning policy in light of recent encouraging data and concerns about a rapid rise in debt economists at nomura said in a note but they added we expect a rebound of money and credit in may the sudden escalation of u s china trade tensions and the recent sharp drop of stock prices could convince beijing to take further easing measures to bolster confidence and stabilize growth chinese banks extended 1 02 trillion yuan 150 16 billion in net new yuan loans in april the central bank said on thursday well below analysts expectations of 1 2 trillion yuan in a reuters poll and march s surprisingly strong 1 69 trillion yuan growth of outstanding total social financing tsf a broad measure of credit and liquidity in the economy slowed to 10 4 percent from a year earlier from 10 7 percent in march tsf growth is a rough gauge of credit conditions the slowdown in credit growth underlines the need for further monetary policy easing in order to keep credit expanding fast enough to provide a floor to economic growth julian evans pritchard at capital economics said in a note the credit data was released unexpectedly early hours ahead of the resumption of last ditch u s china trade talks and a day ahead of the threatened u s tariff hike the data is typically released between the 10th and 15th of every month while april lending levels have tended to moderate from march in past years investors had been looking to details of the data for clues on how much more policy easing to expect the people s bank of china pboc said on monday it will cut reserve requirement ratios rrr for some small and medium sized banks in the latest in a series of moves specially tailored to help small firms struggling amid the economic slowdown price pressures other data on thursday showed price pressures in china were rising with april consumer inflation quickening to a six month high of 2 5 percent but analysts noted much of the pick up was due to higher pork prices and the trend did not stand in the way of policymakers if further easing is needed to offset mounting trade pressures the cpi reading remained below the government s annual target of around 3 percent indeed factory gate inflation also quickened in april to a four month high of 0 9 percent suggesting underlying demand may be starting to improve renewed uncertainty in china u s trade relations will likely add to policymakers determination to stay the course on policy easing said julia wang china economist at hsbc there is still a lot of slack in the economy this means the pboc has room to look past temporary shocks in pork or oil prices and focus instead on core inflation which has been relatively steady less room for policy easing some analysts believe the pboc has less room to ease monetary policy this year after it cut rrrs and interest rates aggressively in past economic downturns beijing has been leaning more on fiscal stimulus this time counting on higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts to stoke growth the oecd has estimated that china s fiscal stimulus was equivalent to 4 25 percent of gross domestic product gdp in 2019 up from 2 94 percent last year ing estimates china has announced support measures worth about 8 trillion yuan in 2018 and 2019 twice as much as its last major stimulus program during the global financial crisis though a smaller proportion of gdp than a decade ago top officials have repeatedly vowed not to open the credit floodgates in an economy already saddled with piles of debt a legacy of massive stimulus during the financial crisis and subsequent downturns analysts believe the central bank will continue to cut reserve requirements for lenders on top of five reductions since early 2018 though they expect it will refrain from more aggressive measures such as cutting benchmark interest rates which could add to debt levels and pressure the yuan currency however some china watchers believe a benchmark rate cut cannot be ruled out

well servicing and snubbing operations are provided through its production services segment these operations are primarily conducted in the wcsb and united states through high arctic s fleet of well

through rig 102 the net book value of rig 102 is not material and no workover services were provided in png during 2019 or 2018 and as such no revenue was generated or costs have been incurred associated with this rig during the periods presented first quarter decreased quarter over quarter activity for high arctic s concord well servicing rigs was partially offset by higher activity from the corporation s snubbing operations in the quarter resulting in a 6 decrease in revenue for the production services segment to 22 0 million in the quarter versus 23 3 million in the first quarter of 2018 operating hours for the concord rigs decreased 13 to 27 913 hours in the quarter from 32 184 hours in the first quarter of 2018 consistent with prior quarters the concord rigs achieved above industry utilization of 52 versus the 48 utilization generated by the industry s registered well servicing rigs in the quarter source caodc pricing remains competitive but with an increased exposure to higher rate operating areas this allowed the average revenue per hour for the concord rigs to remain flat at 635 per hour in the quarter from 634 per hour in the comparative quarter in 2018 the positive contribution from the powerstroke acquisition resulted in an increase in the production services snubbing operations which saw revenue increase to 4 8 million in the quarter versus the 2 9 million generated in the first quarter of 2018 operating hours for the snubbing rigs in the quarter were 4 006 versus 1 875 hours in the first quarter of 2018 activity for the corporation s snubbing operations continues to be hampered over recent quarters due to prolonged low natural gas prices which is curtailing snubbing activity on natural gas completions for the corporation s customers snubbing revenue declined quarter over quarter due to low natural gas prices and the type of work undertaken which consisted of lower pressure well completions operating margin decreased 8 compared to the same quarter in 2018 the decrease in margin is primarily due to extra costs related to expansion into the us and other associated operating costs on lower overall revenue ancillary services three

lower activity levels operating margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 51 in the quarter versus 63 in the first quarter of 2018 this decrease was due to the decreased contribution from both

operating lease expense by the same amount share based compensation the decrease in share based compensation to 0 3 million in 2019 from 0 6 million in 2018 is a result of a higher number of awards granted in the first quarter of 2018 foreign exchange transactions the corporation has exposure to the u s dollar and other currencies such as the png kina through its international operations as a result the corporation is exposed to foreign exchange gains and losses through the settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions as well as the conversion of the corporation s u s dollar based subsidiaries into canadian dollars for financial reporting purposes gains and losses recorded by the canadian parent on its u s denominated cash accounts receivables payables and intercompany balances are recognised as a foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of earnings high arctic is further exposed to foreign currency fluctuations through its net investment in foreign subsidiaries the value of these net investments will increase or decrease based on fluctuations in the u s dollar relative to the canadian dollar these gains and losses are unrealized until such time that high arctic divests its investment in a foreign subsidiary and are recorded in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation gains or losses for foreign operations the u s dollar

international suppliers and customers high arctic has received approval from the bank of png to maintain its u s dollar account within the conditions of the bank of png currency regulations the corporation has taken steps to increase its use of png kina for local transactions when practical included in the bank of png s conditions is for future png drilling contracts to be settled in png kina unless otherwise approved by the bank of png for the contracts to be settled in u s dollars the corporation has received such approval for its existing contracts with its key customers in png the corporation will continue to seek bank of png approval for future customer contracts to be settled in u s dollars on a contract by contract basis however there is no assurance the bank of png will continue to grant these approvals if such approvals are not received in future the corporation s png drilling contracts will be settled in png kina which would expose the corporation to exchange rate fluctuations related to the png kina in addition this may delay the corporation s ability to receive u s dollars which may impact the corporation s ability to settle u s dollar denominated liabilities and repatriate funds from png on a timely basis the corporation also requires the approval from the png internal revenue commission irc to repatriate funds from png and make payments to non resident png suppliers and service providers while delays can be experienced for the irc approvals such approvals have been received in the past operating activities the decrease in net earnings increase in foreign exchange gains deferred tax expense and gain on sale of assets offset by the increase in depreciation and changes in net working capital has resulted in funds provided from operations to

primarily related to maintenance capital and upgrades to the corporation s well servicing rigs financing activities during the quarter the corporation distributed 2 5 million in dividends to its shareholders in addition the corporation purchased and cancelled 770 151 shares for a total of 2 9 million under its ncib resulting in a total of 5 4 million being returned to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks year to date credit facility as at march 31 2019 high arctic s credit facility consisted of a 45 0 million revolving loan facility which matures on august 31 2020 the facility is renewable with the lender s consent and is secured by a general security agreement over the corporation s assets the available amount under the 45 0 million revolving loan facility is limited to 60 of the net book value of the canadian fixed assets plus 75 of acceptable accounts receivable 85 for investment grade receivables plus 90 of insured receivables less priority payables as defined in the loan agreement as at march 31 2019 there was no amount drawn on the facility and total credit available to draw was 45 0 million outlook industry activity in the first quarter was affected by the alberta government imposed apportionment of oil production in the province to alleviate wide price differentials experienced throughout 2018 in addition extreme cold weather in western canada significantly slowed well servicing activity in the quarter the uncertainties within the canadian industry are ongoing and will continue until new pipeline capacity is added and canadian oil and gas companies remain cautious with 2019 capital expenditure programs notwithstanding the slow activity levels experienced in the quarter concord well servicing maintained its market share and achieved equipment utilization rates much better than that experienced by the well service industry concord has already begun to experience much improved equipment utilization leading into the second quarter of 2019 we expect this improved level of activity to be maintained throughout 2019 the acquisition of powerstroke opened a new market for snubbing and well services in the united states the subsequent acquisition of precision drilling s snubbing assets provides high arctic with additional quality equipment and access to experienced personnel and crews resulting in high arctic being the largest snubbing operator in canada with an estimated 55 market share we continue to move under utilized assets from canada into the united states where there is better utilization and day rates in papua new guinea we see strong potential for increasing activity depending on the specific timing of the expansion of lng export capacity the announcement made that the gas sales agreement was signed between the state of papua new guinea and papua lng in april 2019 is very encouraging combined with the parallel project of co habited png lng expansion train the proposed facility is expected to double lng export capacity in png and project partners have indicated target timing for commencement of lng shipments from expansion production in 2024 based on exploration license well commitments and increased optimism ahead of the lng expansion we expect drilling activity to increase in png as early as the fourth quarter 2019 in png rig 103 and 104 remained active through the first quarter rig 103 moved to moran field where operations commenced on april 10th to complete the work program interrupted by the earthquake in february 2018 rig 103 will continue with infield well works for most of 2019 rig 104 continued operations working on muruk 2 and will demobilize back to moro in q2 before deploying for its next drilling assignment rig 116 and rig 115 are cold stacked in port moresby

sec generally permits oil and gas issuers in their filings with the sec to disclose only proved reserves as defined in sec rules but permits the optional disclosure of probable reserves and possible reserves each as defined in sec rules canadian securities laws require oil and gas issuers in their filings with canadian securities regulators to disclose not only proved reserves which are defined differently from the sec rules but also probable reserves and permits optional disclosure of possible reserves each as defined in ni 51 101 accordingly proved reserves probable reserves and possible reserves disclosed in this news release may not be comparable to us standards and in this news release crescent point has disclosed reserves designated as proved plus probable reserves probable reserves are higher risk and are generally believed to be less likely to be accurately estimated or recovered than proved reserves possible reserves are higher risk than probable reserves and are generally believed to be less likely to be accurately estimated or recovered than probable reserves in addition under canadian disclosure requirements and industry practice reserves and production are reported using gross volumes which are volumes prior to deduction of royalties and similar payments the sec rules require reserves and production to be presented using net volumes after deduction of

commenting on the quarter tom simons ces president and chief executive officer said first quarter 2019 results represent improvements in key focus areas for the company and a good start to 2019 revenue and adjusted ebitdac increased year over year as the company s significant us operations and associated infrastructure have expanded in canada we continue to be the market leader in a challenging environment and remain disciplined on cost structure while ensuring the business maintains the scalability to grow into its infrastructure in the quarter we reduced the draw on our senior facility and remained active in our ncib share repurchase program with margins improving from prior quarter significant capex largely completed and reduced levels of working capital ces continues to increase free cash flow generation from all business lines and is well positioned to capitalize on existing and improving industry trends in key markets ces generated 333 0 million in revenue in q1 2019 representing a record first quarter result for the company and achieved adjusted ebitdac of 43 7 million in q1 2019 both of which represent increases over q1 2018 revenue generated in the us was 224 9 million in q1 2019 or 68 of the company s total revenue in the quarter and represented an increase of 25 over the 2018 comparative period the year over year increase in us revenues was driven by ces improving market share completed investments in us infrastructure and operations improvement in the drilling fluids business and increased production chemical related activity particularly in the permian basin revenue generated in canada was 108 1 million in q1 2019 or 32 of the company s total revenue in the quarter and represented a decrease of 11 versus the 2018 comparative period the canadian oil and gas industry continued to face headwinds in q1 2019 with government mandated production curtailments and winter drilling activity that was significantly lower than q1 2018 negatively impacting both production chemical and drilling fluids revenues in the current quarter on january 1 2019 the company adopted ifrs 16 leases using the modified retrospective approach therefore comparative information has not been restated the adoption of ifrs 16 resulted in the addition of 19 9 million in right of use assets and corresponding lease obligations on january 1 2019 for the three months ended march 31 2019 the impact of ifrs 16 on adjusted ebitdac was an increase of 1 4 million whereas the impact on net income was a decrease of 0 2 million as the reduction in cost of sales and general and administrative expenses was offset by higher depreciation expense and finance costs further details are included in the significant accounting policies section in the company s md a for the three months ended march 31 2019 in q1 2019 ces recorded gross margin of 69 2 million or 20 8 of revenue compared to gross margin of 70 6 million or 23 5 of revenue generated in q1 2018 in q1 2019 ces recorded gross margin excluding depreciation of 81 8 million or 24 6 of revenue compared to gross margin excluding depreciation of 80 2 million or 26 7 of revenue generated in q1 2018 throughout 2018 and into q1 2019 cost inflation on significant inputs has outpaced the combination of ces operating leverage gains and ces current ability to pass cost increases through to customers as was evidenced from q4 2018 to q1 2019 ces believes that as it increases sales in areas such as the permian and the deep basin ces will realize improved operating leverage from its expanded infrastructure and its innovative technologies and superior service culture should improve margins going forward net income for q1 2019 was 2 2 million compared to 13 3 million in q1 2018 q1 2019 adjusted ebitdac was 43 7 million representing 13 1 of revenue versus 42 5 million in q1 2018 or 14 1 of revenue excluding the 1 4 million increase resulting from the adoption of ifrs 16 adjusted ebitdac in q1 2019 would have been 42 3 million representing 12 7 of revenue in q4 2018 ces achieved adjusted ebitdac of 42 1 million which represented 12 1 of quarterly revenue when compared to prior quarter q1 2019 adjusted ebitdac as a percentage of revenue benefited from revenue mix internal cost improvement initiatives and isolated price increases in q1 2019 ces incurred 9 4 million in capital expenditures compared to 15 8 million for the three months ended march 31 2018 excluding amounts reimbursed through insurance proceeds current quarter capital expenditures were primarily comprised of

to optimize existing operations and support growth in key markets ces continues to maintain a prudent balance sheet and is well positioned to capitalize from existing operations and potential growth opportunities in key markets at march 31 2019 ces had a net draw of 132 1 million on its senior facility december 31 2018 161 5 million the decrease was primarily driven by working capital returning to the balance sheet and free cash flow generation offset by opportunistic share repurchases through ces ncib program the maximum available draw on the senior facility at march 31 2019 was 180 0 million on the canadian facility and us 40 0 million on the us facility december 31 2018 180 0 million and us 40 0 million respectively at march 31 2019 ces was in compliance with the terms and covenants of its senior facility as at the date hereof the company had a net draw of approximately 130 0 million on its senior facility in october 2017 ces successfully re financed and reduced its coupon on its 200 0 million senior notes by issuing new 6 375 senior notes which have an extended maturity into october 2024 providing a stable long term tranche of debt to withstand potential industry volatility ces continues to see improvement in its financial performance and the company s board of directors and management believe that the market price of ces common shares do not reflect their underlying value on july 17 2018 the company began a normal course issuer bid ncib to repurchase for cancellation up to 24 587 978 common shares the ncib will terminate on july 16 2019 or such

executive management team of its canadian production chemicals division purechem effective may 9 2019 ken zinger currently president of canadian drilling fluids and chief operating officer will also assume leadership of canadian production chemicals in his new role as president of canadian operations ken will assume the purechem leadership position formerly held by jason waugh who is leaving the company senior management and operations of canadian production chemicals remain otherwise unchanged on behalf of the company we would like to thank jason waugh for his hard work and contributions over the last several years particularly in growing ces purechem division in canada and assembling a high quality team to carry the division forward employees customers and shareholders have benefited from his service to the company and we wish jason all the best in his future endeavors said tom simons ces president and chief executive officer ken zinger has been an integral part of the company s growth since 2006 and we are confident in ken s leadership in this expanded role as purechem continues to grow into its infrastructure and gain market share in canada outlook ces continues to be optimistic about its prospects for 2019 and beyond ces infrastructure buildout in both the us and canada was largely completed in 2018 and this strategy has positioned the company to take advantage of the opportunities ahead ces believes that over time it can continue to grow its share of the oilfield consumable chemical markets in which it competes ces also sees the consumable chemical market increasing its share of the oilfield spend as operators continue to drill longer reach laterals and drill them faster expand and optimize the utilization of pad drilling and cube development techniques increase the intensity and size of their fracs and require increasingly technical and specialized chemical treatments to effectively maintain existing cash flow generating wells and treat growing production from new wells in the us ces infrastructure is largely built out to meet anticipated growing production chemical and drilling fluid needs in the key basins in the permian basin the kermit texas mud plant expansion has been designed to double capacity over 2017 levels and has enabled the company to take on new work and continue to grow market share in addition catalyst s current platform is setup to capitalize on growing production and higher levels of activity in the permian basin which ces believes will be even more pronounced in 2019 as several pipeline projects are on track to add significant offtake capacity further ces continues to recruit top talent in this highly competitive region ces plans to expand its barite grinding capabilities in the us further adding to the company s competitive positioning and operating leverage in canada market conditions continue to face headwinds due to current takeaway capacity constraints and lack of consistent market access which caused wide price differentials and relatively low natural gas prices and government mandated production curtailments as a result canadian oil and gas operators pared back capital programs for 2019 and winter drilling activity was muted price differentials were positively impacted in late 2018 by the mandatory crude oil production curtailments established by the alberta government however customers remain cautious on capital programs in h2 2019 ces believes that its current canadian business is well positioned to weather these persistent market challenges through its scalable canadian drilling fluids business model and through improved financial contribution from its purechem production chemical division as it realizes ongoing structural efficiency gains and grows into its infrastructure ces strategy is to utilize its decentralized management model its vertically integrated manufacturing model its problem solving through science approach its patented and proprietary technologies and its superior people and execution to increase market share the downturn made many middlemen or competitors who are simply resellers of other company s products redundant by being basic in the manufacture of the consumable chemicals it sells ces continues to be price competitive and a technology leader recent competitor consolidations and business failures will provide further opportunities for ces as operators require increasingly technical solutions and deeper customer centric coverage models to meet their needs ces believes that its unique value proposition makes it the premier independent provider of technically advanced consumable chemical solutions to the north american oilfield ces balance sheet is well positioned to capitalize on robust oilfield activity levels in the us and weather the current decline in industry activity in canada in october 2017 ces successfully re financed and reduced its coupon on its 300 0 million senior notes by issuing new 6 375 senior notes which have an extended maturity into october 2024 in 2019 it is expected that ebitdac will materially exceed the sum of cash expenditures on interest taxes and capital expenditures allowing for free cash flow to be returned to shareholders through ces monthly dividend and recently implemented ncib as ces infrastructure buildout in both the us and canada was largely completed in 2018 absent acceptable return expansionary capital projects such as the buildout of the northeast us barite facility ces expects capital expenditures in 2019 to return to levels below 2017 2018 levels

mr j cameron bailey high arctic s ceo stated first quarter results continued to see the effects of rig 116 rolling off its take or pay contract on november 2 2018 with the recent approval of the new lng project in png we see potential for demand in drilling activity to start to pick up as early as q4 2019 the quarter was also adversely impacted by extreme cold weather in canada although the company generally maintained pricing levels and market share we are confident our focus on top tier quality and customers is the right strategy to deliver profitability in what has been a long term challenging market highlights high arctic generated revenue of 46 5 million in the first quarter of 2019 a sequential decrease of 1 3 million over the fourth quarter of 2018 and 7 2 million or 13 lower than the comparable first quarter of 2018 these results were driven by waning customer demand in canada carried over from 2018 q4 2018 take or pay contract expiry and idle rigs in the corporation s international operations as expected and were mitigated by the following positive developments high arctic generated revenue of 46 5 million 2018 53 7 million and adjusted ebitda of 5 5 million 2018 13 7 million approximately 75 of the reduction in well servicing hours during the quarter was due to extreme cold weather although high arctic generally maintained its market share utilization of rigs 103 and 104 was 100 for the quarter ahead of the prior year the company has regained its leadership position in snubbing services critical to customers and snubbing hours in the quarter were more than doubled that of 2018 the strategy to diversify into new markets generated 1 584 hours of rig work in the united states in the first quarter strategic priorities corporation s

non png third party contractor and was returned to its owner in the fourth quarter of 2018 first quarter drilling services revenue decreased 20 in the quarter to 18 8 million from 23 5 million in the

segment also provides heli portable workover services in png through rig 102 the net book value of rig 102 is not material and no workover services were provided in png during 2019 or 2018 and as such no revenue was generated or costs have been incurred associated with this rig during the periods presented first quarter decreased quarter over quarter activity for high arctic s concord well servicing rigs was partially offset by higher activity from the corporation s snubbing operations in the quarter resulting in a 6 decrease in revenue for the production services segment to 22 0 million in the quarter versus 23 3 million in the first quarter of 2018 operating hours for the concord rigs decreased 13 to 27 913 hours in the quarter from 32 184 hours in the first quarter of 2018 consistent with prior quarters the concord rigs achieved above industry utilization of 52 versus the 48 utilization generated by the industry s registered well servicing rigs in the quarter source caodc pricing remains competitive but with an increased exposure to higher rate operating areas this allowed the average revenue per hour for the concord rigs to remain flat at 635 per hour in the quarter from 634 per hour in the comparative quarter in 2018 the positive contribution from the powerstroke acquisition resulted in an increase in the production services snubbing operations which saw revenue increase to 4 8 million in the quarter versus the 2 9 million generated in the first quarter of 2018 operating hours for the snubbing rigs in the quarter were 4 006 versus 1 875 hours in the first quarter of 2018 activity for the corporation s snubbing operations continues to be hampered over recent quarters due to prolonged low natural gas prices which is curtailing snubbing activity on natural gas completions for the corporation s customers snubbing revenue declined quarter over quarter due to low natural gas prices and the type of work undertaken which consisted of lower pressure well completions operating margin decreased 8 compared to the same quarter in 2018 the decrease in margin is primarily due to extra costs related to expansion into the us and other associated

from 0 6 million in 2018 is a result of a higher number of awards granted in the first quarter of 2018 foreign exchange transactions the corporation has exposure to the u s dollar and other currencies such as the png kina through its international operations as a result the corporation is exposed to foreign exchange gains and losses through the settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions as well as the conversion of the corporation s u s dollar based subsidiaries into canadian dollars for financial reporting purposes gains and losses recorded by the canadian parent on its u s denominated cash accounts receivables payables and intercompany balances are recognised as a foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of earnings high arctic is further exposed to foreign currency fluctuations through its net investment in foreign subsidiaries the value of these net investments will increase or decrease based on fluctuations in the u s dollar relative to the canadian

to high arctic s requirement to transact with international suppliers and customers high arctic has received approval from the bank of png to maintain its u s dollar account within the conditions of the bank of png currency regulations the corporation has taken steps to increase its use of png kina for local transactions when practical included in the bank of png s conditions is for future png drilling contracts to be settled in png kina unless otherwise approved by the bank of png for the contracts to be settled in u s dollars the corporation has received such approval for its existing contracts with its key customers in png the corporation will continue to seek bank of png approval for future customer contracts to be settled in u s dollars on a contract by contract basis however there is no assurance the bank of png will continue to grant these approvals if such approvals are not received in future the corporation s png drilling contracts will be settled in png kina which would expose the corporation to exchange rate fluctuations related to the png kina in addition this may delay the corporation s ability to receive u s dollars which may impact the corporation s ability to settle u s dollar denominated liabilities and repatriate funds from png on a timely basis the corporation also requires the approval from the png internal revenue commission irc to repatriate funds from png and make payments to non resident png suppliers and service providers while delays can be experienced for the irc approvals such approvals have been received in the past

invested 2 6 million 2018 2 6 million in capital expenditures primarily related to maintenance capital and upgrades to the corporation s well servicing rigs financing activities during the quarter the corporation distributed 2 5 million in dividends to its shareholders in addition the corporation purchased and cancelled 770 151 shares for a total of 2 9 million under its ncib resulting in a total of 5 4 million being returned to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks year to date credit facilityas at march 31 2019 high arctic s credit facility consisted of a 45 0 million revolving loan facility which matures on august 31 2020 the facility is renewable with the lender s consent and is secured by a general security agreement over the corporation s assets the available amount under the 45 0 million revolving loan facility is limited to 60 of the net book value of the canadian fixed assets plus 75 of acceptable accounts receivable 85 for investment grade receivables plus 90 of insured receivables less priority payables as defined in the loan agreement as at march 31 2019 there was no amount drawn on the facility and total credit available to draw was 45 0 million outlook industry activity in the first quarter was affected by the alberta government imposed apportionment of oil production in the province to alleviate wide price differentials experienced throughout 2018 in addition extreme cold weather in western canada significantly slowed well servicing activity in the quarter the uncertainties within the canadian industry are ongoing and will continue until new pipeline capacity is added and canadian oil and gas companies remain cautious with 2019 capital expenditure programs notwithstanding the slow activity levels experienced in the quarter concord well servicing maintained its market share and achieved equipment utilization rates much better than that experienced by the well service industry concord has already begun to experience much improved equipment utilization leading into the second quarter of 2019 we expect this improved level of activity to be maintained throughout 2019 the acquisition of powerstroke opened a new market for snubbing and well services in the united states the subsequent acquisition of precision drilling s snubbing assets provides high arctic with additional quality equipment and access to experienced personnel and crews resulting in high arctic being the largest snubbing operator in canada with an estimated 55 market share we continue to move under utilized assets from canada into the united states where there is better utilization and day rates in papua new guinea we see strong potential for increasing activity depending on the specific timing of the expansion of lng export capacity the announcement made that the gas sales agreement was signed between the state of papua new guinea and papua lng in april 2019 is very encouraging combined with the parallel project of co habited png lng expansion train the proposed facility is expected to double lng export capacity in png and project partners have indicated target timing for commencement of lng shipments from expansion production in 2024 based on exploration license well commitments and increased optimism ahead of the lng expansion we expect drilling activity to increase in png as early as the fourth quarter 2019 in png rig 103 and 104 remained active through the first quarter rig 103 moved to moran field where operations commenced on april 10th to complete the work program interrupted by the earthquake in february 2018 rig 103 will continue with infield well works for most of 2019 rig 104 continued operations working on muruk 2 and will demobilize back to moro in q2 before deploying for its next drilling assignment rig 116 and

advertisement an official said there s no harm in taking advantage of official development assistance while these are still available it appears there s no stopping the momentum of enhanced economic relations between the philippines and china despite what malacañang has described as irritants in bilateral ties when president rodrigo duterte attended the second belt and road forum in beijing from april 25 27 along with 37 other heads of state he also met with chinese president xi jinping that meeting yielded a one billion renminbi p7 7 billion grant to the philippines and the signing of 19 business agreements valued at 12 16 billion the agreements covered a wide range of investment areas including energy infrastructure tourism related facilities internet connectivity agriculture and training of filipinos in china the business deals are expected to create more than 21 000 jobs for filipinos advertisement earlier in april the country hosted the first boao forum for asia bfa considered the davos of asia the bfa seeks to unite asian countries to achieve common development through the integration of the regional economy with this year s theme of concerted action for common development in the new era the event was attended by 100 business leaders from china 100 business leaders from the philippines and 100 executives from chinese enterprises in the philippines addressing the gathering china embassy charge d affaires ad interim tan qingsheng said bilateral relations have entered a golden age with political and security coordination economic cooperation and people to people exchanges at the same time he denied any hidden agenda in loan agreements with the philippines adding that speculation regarding the so called china debt trap was completely groundless tan cited figures from the bangko sentral ng pilipinas bsp showing that chinese loans account for merely 0 65 percent of the total debt of the philippines even if the planned financing is implemented the figure will only be around 4 5 percent by 2022 if we compare the interest rates in us dollar terms the interest rate of chinese loans is actually very similar or even lower than that of other countries he pointed out the chinese envoy also said that more job opportunities for filipinos will be created through the economic cooperation between the two countries he said about 50 large scale chinese companies based in the philippines have employed more than 16 000 filipinos so far and the number is expected to increase in the coming years the diplomat stressed during the boao forum that bilateral economic ties have brought tangible benefits to both sides with total trade volume in 2018 reaching us 55 7 billion with an 8 5 percent year on year increase china is now the philippines top trading partner the largest source of imports and the fourth largest export market earlier finance undersecretary gil beltran the chief economist of the department of finance debunked fears that we would be drawn inexorably to a china debt trap as overblown and overdiscussed beltran said that with an interest rate of 2 percent per annum for projects financed by china versus an internal rate of return irr of at least 15 percent the philippines would easily gain 13 percent from these projects you only lose money if you mismanage the project and that will take a very stupid manager or a very corrupt manager and these are very good projects which should have been implemented 20 years ago beltran told a recent forum of business journalists beltran said that since the philippines needs to upgrade its infrastructure and the projected irr is very high there s no harm in taking advantage of official development assistance oda while these are still available there s a limit to how much you can get from oda source and what we re getting from china is what they allocated to us he said we are not favoring china it s just they allocated 9 billion for us and japan also said they re going to give 9 billion so we let them choose which projects which they can implement given their resources and capabilities he added the dof believes that our per capita income might breach 4 000 this year which makes us an upper middle income country at present our per capita income of over 3 000 puts us in the low middle income category which qualifies the country for most oda packages consisting of grants and loans at any rate among the participants in the 2nd belt and road forum were top officials of the international monetary fund imf headquartered in washington d c which gathers 189 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation secure financial stability facilitate international trade promote high employment and sustainable economic growth and reduce poverty around the world for changyong rhee the director of the imf s asia and pacific department the bri project is a very important contribution to the global economy as it would help improve the infrastructure requirements in the low income countries and also promote regional cooperation and connectivity in trade investment finance and human mobility the imf official said his organization is in very close collaboration with chinese authorities on sharing the best international practices especially regarding fiscal sustainability and capacity building this is an interesting development that we ll monitor in the

with canadian disclosure standards which are not comparable in all respects of united states or other foreign disclosure standards for example the united states securities and exchange commission the sec generally permits oil and gas issuers in their filings with the sec to disclose only proved reserves as defined in sec rules but permits the optional disclosure of probable reserves and possible reserves each as defined in sec rules canadian securities laws require oil and gas issuers in their filings with canadian securities regulators to disclose not only proved reserves which are defined differently from the sec rules but also probable reserves and permits optional disclosure of possible reserves each as defined in ni 51 101 accordingly proved reserves probable reserves and possible reserves disclosed in this news release may not be comparable to us standards and in this news release crescent point has disclosed reserves designated as proved plus probable reserves probable reserves are higher risk and are generally believed to be less likely to be accurately estimated or recovered than proved reserves possible reserves are higher risk than probable reserves and are generally believed to be less likely to be accurately estimated or recovered than probable reserves in addition under canadian disclosure requirements and industry practice reserves and production are reported using gross volumes which are volumes prior to deduction of royalties and similar payments the sec rules require reserves and production to be presented using net volumes after deduction of applicable royalties and similar payments moreover crescent point has determined and disclosed estimated future net revenue from its reserves using forecast prices and costs whereas the sec rules require that reserves be estimated using a 12 month average price calculated as the arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the 12 month period prior to the end of the reporting period consequently crescent point s reserve estimates and production volumes in this news release may not be comparable to those made by companies using united states reporting and

arctic had rig 405 in its png drilling fleet to complete a short term drilling project due to the duration of this project the rig was leased from a non png third party contractor and was returned to its owner in the fourth quarter of 2018 first quarter drilling services revenue decreased 20 in the quarter to 18 8 million from 23 5 million in the first quarter of 2018 this decrease was due to lower drilling activity in the quarter and the end of the take or pay contract for rig 116 in the fourth quarter of 2018 rig 103 operated continuously on infield work during the quarter while rig 104

through rig 102 the net book value of rig 102 is not material and no workover services were provided in png during 2019 or 2018 and as such no revenue was generated or costs have been incurred associated with this rig during the periods presented first quarter decreased quarter over quarter activity for high arctic s concord well servicing rigs was partially offset by higher activity from the corporation s snubbing operations in the quarter resulting in a 6 decrease in revenue for the production services segment to 22 0 million in the quarter versus 23 3 million in the first quarter of 2018 operating hours for the concord rigs decreased 13 to 27 913 hours in the quarter from 32 184 hours in the first quarter of 2018 consistent with prior quarters the concord rigs achieved above industry utilization of 52 versus the 48 utilization generated by the industry s registered well servicing rigs in the quarter source caodc pricing remains competitive but with an increased exposure to higher rate operating areas this allowed the average revenue per hour for the concord rigs to remain flat at 635 per hour in the quarter from 634 per hour in the comparative quarter in 2018 the positive contribution from the powerstroke acquisition resulted in an increase in the production services snubbing operations which saw revenue increase to 4 8 million in the quarter versus the 2 9 million generated in the first quarter of 2018 operating hours for the snubbing rigs in the quarter were 4 006 versus 1 875 hours in the first quarter of 2018 activity for the corporation s snubbing operations continues to be hampered over recent quarters due to prolonged low natural gas prices which is curtailing snubbing activity on natural gas completions for the corporation s customers snubbing revenue declined quarter over quarter due to low natural gas prices and the type of work undertaken which consisted of lower pressure well completions operating margin decreased 8 compared to the same quarter in 2018 the decrease in margin is primarily due to extra costs related to expansion into the us and other associated operating costs on lower overall revenue ancillary services three

lower activity levels operating margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 51 in the quarter versus 63 in the first quarter of 2018 this decrease was due to the decreased contribution from both

quarter of 2018 the corporation incurred amortization costs of 0 5 million associated with right of use assets in 2019 as a result of the adoption of ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 offset by a reduction in operating lease expense by the same amount share based compensation the decrease in share based compensation to 0 3 million in 2019 from 0 6 million in 2018 is a result of a higher number of awards granted in the first quarter of 2018 foreign exchange transactions the corporation has exposure to the u s dollar and other currencies such as the png kina through its international operations as a result the corporation is exposed to foreign exchange gains and losses through the settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions as well as the conversion of the corporation s u s dollar based subsidiaries into canadian dollars for financial reporting purposes gains and losses recorded by the canadian parent on its u s denominated cash accounts receivables payables and intercompany balances are recognised as a foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of earnings high arctic is further exposed to foreign currency fluctuations through its net investment in foreign subsidiaries the value of these net investments will increase or decrease based on fluctuations in the u s dollar relative to the canadian dollar these gains and losses are unrealized until such time that high arctic divests its investment in a foreign subsidiary and are recorded in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation gains or losses for foreign operations the u s dollar remained strong relative to the canadian dollar with an average exchange rate of 1 3225 during the first quarter of 2019 2018 1 2665 the stronger u s dollar benefits the corporation as the majority of

international suppliers and customers high arctic has received approval from the bank of png to maintain its u s dollar account within the conditions of the bank of png currency regulations the corporation has taken steps to increase its use of png kina for local transactions when practical included in the bank of png s conditions is for future png drilling contracts to be settled in png kina unless otherwise approved by the bank of png for the contracts to be settled in u s dollars the corporation has received such approval for its existing contracts with its key customers in png the corporation will continue to seek bank of png approval for future customer contracts to be settled in u s dollars on a contract by contract basis however there is no assurance the bank of png will continue to grant these approvals if such approvals are not received in future the corporation s png drilling contracts will be settled in png kina which would expose the corporation to exchange rate fluctuations related to the png kina in addition this may delay the corporation s ability to receive u s dollars which may impact the corporation s ability to settle u s dollar denominated liabilities and repatriate funds from png on a timely basis the corporation also requires the approval from the png internal revenue commission irc to repatriate funds from png and make payments to non resident png suppliers and service providers while delays can be experienced for the irc approvals such approvals have been received in the past operating activities the decrease in net earnings increase in

primarily related to maintenance capital and upgrades to the corporation s well servicing rigs financing activities during the quarter the corporation distributed 2 5 million in dividends to its shareholders in addition the corporation purchased and cancelled 770 151 shares for a total of 2 9 million under its ncib resulting in a total of 5 4 million being returned to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks year to date credit facility as at march 31 2019 high arctic s credit facility consisted of a 45 0 million revolving loan facility which matures on august 31 2020 the facility is renewable with the lender s consent and is secured by a general security agreement over the corporation s assets the available amount under the 45 0 million revolving loan facility is limited to 60 of the net book value of the canadian fixed assets plus 75 of acceptable accounts receivable 85 for investment grade receivables plus 90 of insured receivables less priority payables as defined in the loan agreement as at march 31 2019 there was no amount drawn on the facility and total credit available to draw was 45 0 million outlook industry activity in the first quarter was affected by the alberta government imposed apportionment of oil production in the province to alleviate wide price differentials experienced throughout 2018 in addition extreme cold weather in western canada significantly slowed well servicing activity in the quarter the uncertainties within the canadian industry are ongoing and will continue until new pipeline capacity is added and canadian oil and gas companies remain cautious with 2019 capital expenditure programs notwithstanding the slow activity levels experienced in the quarter concord well servicing maintained its market share and achieved equipment utilization rates much better than that experienced by the well service industry concord has already begun to experience much improved equipment utilization leading into the second quarter of 2019 we expect this improved level of activity to be maintained throughout 2019 the acquisition of powerstroke opened a new market for snubbing and well services in the united states the subsequent acquisition of precision drilling s snubbing assets provides high arctic with additional quality equipment and access to experienced personnel and crews resulting in high arctic being the largest snubbing operator in canada with an estimated 55 market share we continue to move under utilized assets from canada into the united states where there is better utilization and day rates in papua new guinea we see strong potential for increasing activity depending on the specific timing of the expansion of lng export capacity the announcement made that the gas sales agreement was signed between the state of papua new guinea and papua lng in april 2019 is very encouraging combined with the parallel project of co habited png lng expansion train the proposed facility is expected to double lng export capacity in png and project partners have indicated target timing for commencement of lng shipments from expansion production in 2024 based on exploration license well commitments and increased optimism ahead of the lng expansion we expect drilling activity to increase in png as early as the fourth quarter 2019 in png rig 103 and 104 remained active through the first quarter rig 103 moved to moran field where operations commenced on april 10th to complete the work program interrupted by the earthquake in february 2018 rig 103 will continue with infield well works for most of 2019 rig 104 continued operations working on muruk 2 and will demobilize back to moro in q2 before deploying for its next drilling assignment rig 116 and rig 115 are cold stacked in port moresby

supply side factors and not stronger domestic demand consumer price inflation rose to a six month high of 2 5 y y in april up from 2 3 y y in march and in line with expectations the increase was driven by an acceleration in food price inflation from 4 1 y y to a three year high of 6 1 note disruptions to pork supply caused by african swine flu was mostly to blame pork price inflation jumped to 14 4 producer price inflation also picked up from 0 4 y y to a four month high of 0 9 this increase was partly due a growth in factory gate prices from 0 1 to 0 3 note higher food inflation is

associated with this rig during the periods presented first quarter decreased quarter over quarter activity for high arctic s concord well servicing rigs was partially offset by higher activity from the corporation s snubbing operations in the quarter resulting in a 6 decrease in revenue for the production services segment to 22 0 million in the quarter versus 23 3 million in the first quarter of

industry utilization of 52 versus the 48 utilization generated by the industry s registered well servicing rigs in the quarter source caodc pricing remains competitive but with an increased exposure to higher rate operating areas this allowed the average revenue per hour for the concord rigs to remain flat at 635 per hour in the quarter from 634 per hour in the comparative quarter in 2018 the positive contribution from the powerstroke acquisition resulted in an increase in the production services snubbing operations which saw revenue increase to 4 8 million in the quarter versus the 2 9 million generated in the first quarter of 2018 operating hours for the snubbing rigs in the quarter were 4 006 versus 1 875 hours in the first quarter of 2018 activity for the corporation s snubbing operations continues to be hampered over recent quarters due to prolonged low natural gas prices which is curtailing snubbing activity on natural gas completions for the corporation s customers snubbing revenue declined quarter over quarter due to low natural gas prices and the type of work undertaken which consisted of lower pressure well completions operating margin decreased 8 compared to the same quarter in 2018 the decrease in margin is primarily due to extra costs related to expansion into the us and other associated operating costs on lower overall revenue ancillary services three

clearcompliance software business operations first quarter all contributing divisions of this segment showed decreases during the quarter relative to the first quarter in 2018 driven primarily by lower activity levels operating margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to 51 in the quarter versus 63 in the first quarter of 2018 this decrease was due to the decreased contribution from both

of revenue 8 8 0 0 general and administrative costs decreased 0 6 million to 3 7 million in the first quarter 2019 compared to 2018 mainly as a result of cost reduction initiatives taken through out

quarter of 2018 the corporation incurred amortization costs of 0 5 million associated with right of use assets in 2019 as a result of the adoption of ifrs 16 leases ifrs 16 offset by a reduction in operating lease expense by the same amount share based compensation the decrease in share based compensation to 0 3 million in 2019 from 0 6 million in 2018 is a result of a higher number of awards granted in the first quarter of 2018 foreign exchange transactions the corporation has exposure to the u s dollar and other currencies such as the png kina through its international operations as a result the corporation is exposed to foreign exchange gains and losses through the settlement of foreign currency denominated transactions as well as the conversion of the corporation s u s dollar based subsidiaries into canadian dollars for financial reporting purposes gains and losses recorded by the canadian parent on its u s denominated cash accounts receivables payables and intercompany balances are recognised as a foreign exchange gain or loss in the statement of earnings high arctic is further exposed to foreign currency fluctuations through its net investment in foreign subsidiaries the value of these net investments will increase or decrease based on fluctuations in the u s dollar relative to the canadian dollar these gains and losses are unrealized until such time that high arctic divests its investment in a foreign subsidiary and are recorded in other comprehensive income as foreign currency translation gains or losses for foreign operations the u s dollar remained strong relative to the canadian dollar with an average exchange rate of 1 3225 during the first quarter of 2019 2018 1 2665 the stronger u s dollar benefits the corporation as the majority of the corporation s png business is conducted in u s dollars as at march 31 2019 the u s dollar exchange rate was 1 3363 versus 1 2894 as at march 31 2018 although year on year the us dollar strengthened against the canadian dollar the u s dollar weakened from the end of 2018 through q1 resulting in a translation loss of 3 0 million recorded in other comprehensive income for the quarter

outstanding on its debt facilities and 23 0 million in cash the bank of png policy continues to encourage the use of the local market currency kina due to high arctic s requirement to transact with international suppliers and customers high arctic has received approval from the bank of png to maintain its u s dollar account within the conditions of the bank of png currency regulations the corporation has taken steps to increase its use of png kina for local transactions when practical included in the bank of png s conditions is for future png drilling contracts to be settled in png kina unless otherwise approved by the bank of png for the contracts to be settled in u s dollars the corporation has received such approval for its existing contracts with its key customers in png the corporation will continue to seek bank of png approval for future customer contracts to be settled in u s dollars on a contract by contract basis however there is no assurance the bank of png will continue to grant these approvals if such approvals are not received in future the corporation s png drilling contracts will be settled in png kina which would expose the corporation to exchange rate fluctuations related to the png kina in addition this may delay the corporation s ability to receive u s dollars which may impact the corporation s ability to settle u s dollar denominated liabilities and repatriate funds from png on a timely basis the corporation also requires the approval from the png internal revenue commission irc to repatriate funds from png and make payments to non resident png suppliers and service providers while delays can be experienced for the irc approvals such approvals have been received in the past operating activities the decrease in net earnings increase in foreign exchange gains deferred tax expense and gain on sale of assets offset by the increase in depreciation and changes in net working capital has resulted in funds provided from operations to decrease to 0 0 million from 4 8 million quarter on quarter 2019 to 2018 investing activities in the first quarter the corporation has invested 2 6 million 2018 2 6 million in capital expenditures primarily related to maintenance capital and upgrades to the corporation s well servicing rigs financing activities during the quarter the corporation distributed 2 5 million in dividends to its shareholders in addition the corporation purchased and cancelled 770 151 shares for a total of 2 9 million under its ncib resulting in a total of 5 4 million being returned to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks year to date credit facility as at march 31 2019 high arctic s credit facility consisted of a 45 0 million revolving loan facility which matures on august 31 2020 the facility is renewable with the lender s consent and is secured by a general security agreement over the corporation s assets the available amount under the 45 0 million revolving loan facility is limited to 60 of the net book value of the canadian fixed assets plus 75 of acceptable accounts receivable 85 for investment grade receivables plus 90 of insured receivables less priority payables as defined in the loan agreement as at march 31 2019 there was no amount drawn on the facility and total credit available to draw was 45 0 million outlook industry activity in the first quarter was affected by the alberta government imposed apportionment of oil production in the province to alleviate wide price differentials experienced throughout 2018 in addition extreme cold weather in western canada significantly slowed well servicing activity in the quarter the uncertainties within the canadian industry are ongoing and will continue until new pipeline capacity is added and canadian oil and gas companies remain cautious with 2019 capital expenditure programs notwithstanding the slow activity levels experienced in the quarter concord well servicing maintained its market share and achieved equipment utilization rates much better than that experienced by the well service industry concord has already begun to experience much improved equipment utilization leading into the second quarter of 2019 we expect this improved level of activity to be maintained throughout 2019 the acquisition of powerstroke opened a new market for snubbing and well services in the united states the subsequent acquisition of precision drilling s snubbing assets provides high arctic with additional quality equipment and access to experienced personnel and crews resulting in high arctic being the largest snubbing operator in canada with an estimated 55 market share we continue to move under utilized assets from canada into the united states where there is better utilization and day rates in papua new guinea we see strong potential for increasing activity depending on the specific timing of the expansion of lng export capacity the announcement made that the gas sales agreement was signed between the state of papua new guinea and papua lng in april 2019 is very encouraging combined with the parallel project of co habited png lng expansion train the proposed facility is expected to double lng export capacity in png and project partners have indicated target timing for commencement of lng shipments from expansion production in 2024 based on exploration license well commitments and increased optimism ahead of the lng expansion we expect drilling activity to increase in png as early as the fourth quarter 2019 in png rig 103 and 104 remained active through the first quarter rig 103 moved to moran field where operations commenced on april 10th to complete the work program interrupted by the earthquake in february 2018 rig 103 will continue with infield well works for most of 2019 rig 104 continued operations working on muruk 2 and will demobilize back to moro in q2 before deploying for its next drilling assignment rig 116 and rig 115 are cold stacked in port moresby

this testimony was given before the house of representatives foreign affairs committee subcommittee on europe eurasia energy and the environment introduction chairman keating ranking member kinzinger distinguished members of this committee thank you for inviting me to testify before you for the second time this hearing takes place in a context of a shift in the attitudes of both the united states and europe towards china s growing economic and geopolitical rise as well as a broader evolution of beijing s own priorities and external strategy for the past seven years i have been focusing on china s geo economic outreach with a focus on foreign direct investments and how these are perceived in eurasia including europe the caucasus and central asia eurasia is a complex concept with diverging definitions and has been a playing field for competition or cooperation between big powers especially russia china the united states and the european union eu although i have also been working on central asia i have decided today to focus my testimony on recent developments between china and the european continent while the u s has taken a tougher stance in dealing with china s persistent lack of reciprocity in economic relations and violations of international norms of intellectual property for some years european countries have recently begun reacting concretely to the economic and security related considerations linked to certain chinese investments on their soil the eu s official acknowledgment of china as a systemic rival in a policy document released this spring marks a departure from previously conciliatory language 1 at the same time chinese investments on both sides of the atlantic have declined considerably after peaking in 2016 beijing is increasingly curbing private outward investment to maintain its stock of foreign reserves and to direct capital to domestic use amid a period of economic slowdown the notable exceptions are foreign direct investments fdi connected with president xi jinping s flagship strategy to achieve technological parity in key industries made in china 2025 and investment towards the belt and road initiative bri xi s other grand plan to connect china to its markets through large scale infrastructure projects the bri now counts new european signatories including italy one of the eu s founding members which also became the first g7 nation to sign a memorandum of understanding with china in march 2019 the latter episode has provided an important test for the u s europe security relationship upon the urging of american diplomats not to take part in the bri italy has loudly reiterated its allegiance to nato and the underlying western alliance yet is has chosen to defy both the u s and eu strategic posture in its decision to adhere to the project the greatest challenge is that chinese investments in strategic sectors can generate economic dependence especially among smaller countries and struggling economies and this relationship can expand into the political realm as it has on a few occasions that i will mention shortly against this backdrop the u s and europe need to consider how they can maintain their security relationship to meet mutual challenges but also how to reconcile diverging strategies for handling the emergence of china in order to avoid an escalation of tensions and to build instead a constructive relationship with beijing over the brief time of this testimony i will address the following questions and concerns what is the state of chinese foreign direct investments in europe following multiple visits and summits in europe and the bri forum in beijing what is china s vision towards europe how is the european union and how are individual countries reacting is china s growing economic presence translating into political influence in europe how is the eu responding to the bri overview of chinese fdi in europe economic relations between europe and china have expanded dramatically over the last decade the eu is now china s largest trading partner and china is the eu s second largest trading partner after the united states china s annual fdi into the eu skyrocketed from 840 million in 2008 to 42 billion in 2017 covering a wide range of geographic areas and industrial sectors the count about doubles when including switzerland a non eu country which has captured the lion s share of chinese fdi with chemchina s acquisition of the agri business giant syngenta for 43 billion the world s single largest acquisition by a chinese company philippe le corre philippe le corre was a nonresident senior fellow in the europe program at the carnegie endowment for international peace more phlecorre however data from the last two years indicates that in aggregate terms chinese fdi into europe is slowing down from its 2016 peak in 2018 chinese fdi in europe declined by 40 compared to 2017 for a total of 22 5 billion 2 part of this downward trend relates to fewer mega deals being pursued or completed whereas multi billion deals were a key feature of total fdi in previous years similarly 2018 saw a shift away from infrastructures utilities and real estate projects in favour of more consumer facing sectors the united kingdom remained the largest european recipient of chinese fdi for 2018 followed by sweden germany luxembourg and france behind the headline of an aggregate fall in fdi 2018 saw sharper increases in a more diverse pool of european countries spain sweden luxembourg denmark as well as hungary croatia poland and slovenia all saw growing investments 3 the overall value of deals was nothing to remark on especially for smaller and eastern european countries but it is significant insofar as it marks a growing chinese presence in a wider range of countries and significantly in several eu member states the british case deserves a close attention as the country prepares to exit the union the 2017 2018 decline in fdi in europe is largely the outcome of the chinese government s recently introduced controls on private capital outflows besides the decline in outbound fdi there has also been a considerable wave of divestments estimated at 5 billion it includes large private companies such as hna or dalian wanda that had invested substantially in european countries but have recently sold some of their assets however europe continues to receive most of its fdi from state owned enterprises soes which made up about 63 of total fdi between 2008 18 4 unlike private firms which have made up a majority of fdi in the u s for instance soes are less restricted in their ability to invest abroad especially on projects backed by beijing and compatible with made in china 2025 and the bri5 on top of this supply side restriction on fdi european countries have followed somewhat in the u s footsteps and began to scrutinize investment especially from soes with the effect of reducing the volume of deals on the other hand china ranks 59th out of the 62 countries evaluated by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in terms of openness to fdi almost half of companies surveyed in 2018 by the european chamber of commerce in china said they missed out on business opportunities due to regulatory barriers or market access restrictions and they expected obstacles to increase during the next five years it is increasingly evident that many european countries are unhappy with the lack of reciprocity and the joint ventures forced upon european firms to do business in china which often entail a form of technology transfer only smaller countries appear to continue to view one way fdi as a sufficiently good trade off new regulations announced at the recent session of the national people s congress in beijing might bring more openings for european companies in the next year but the real changes will come when the eu and china finally settle on a comprehensive agreement on investment cai recent developments in eu china relations the past three months have seen some of the most significant developments and responses to challenges in europe china relations these include both increased cohesion at the eu level especially among the largest eu members and divergence on key foreign policies such as adherence to the bri with regards to the latter italy became the first g7 country to formally endorse the bri in march switzerland followed suit on april 29 they joined 22 other european countries who had already signed mous austria bosnia herzegovina bulgaria croatia cyprus czech republic estonia greece hungary latvia lithuania luxemburg malta montenegro north macedonia poland portugal romania serbia slovakia slovenia and ukraine in the chinese original conception of the bri6 europe is the final destination of this ambitious project and still represents the largest and most attractive consumer market for chinese products having more european countries signing in to the bri is a major success in the chinese domestic political context at the second bri forum organized in beijing in april 2019 no less than 12 european heads of state and heads of governments attended including those of austria hungary italy greece portugal the czech republic and malta7 the balkan countries with the exception of croatia are not eu members for that reason they are eager for chinese investments do not require a visa for chinese visitors and have little barriers for fdi at all china is investing massively in this part of europe five of these balkan states and 11 eu eastern european member states form the 16 1 group which gathered for its 8th summit meeting in croatia on april 10 11 attended by premier li keqiang greece has now joined this group which has been re labelled as 17 1 on the other hand larger eu member states are broadly wary of entertaining purely bilateral relations with beijing and instead favour a coordinated eu approach that can effectively stand up to china as an equal power for instance france s president emmanuel macron summoned german chancellor angela merkel and european commission president jean claude juncker to paris on occasion of xi jinping s state visit in march again germany s economy minister told the press from the belt and road forum that took place in late april that large eu member states had agreed not to sign similar deals on a bilateral basis but as a european bloc thanks to the alignment of its largest members the eu has recently taken three main steps on the foreign policy stage that signify a change of attitude towards china firstly in march the european commission the eu s executive body issued a strategic outlook in which it labels china as a systemic rival and strategic competitor and sets out a number of intended steps to contrast the lack of reciprocity and violation of international rules china is simultaneously in different policy areas a cooperation partner with whom the eu has closely aligned objectives a negotiating partner with whom the eu needs to find a balance of interests an economic competitor in pursuit of technological leadership and a systemic rival promoting alternative models of governance it says such language is unusually bold for the eu and captures the concerns of eu institutions and several member states with an increasingly felt chinese presence on its soil and periphery secondly on april 5th the eu concluded the process to introduce a centralized fdi screening mechanism and instructed the roughly half of its member states that still lack equivalent domestic measures to introduce them too this investment screening mechanism is a relatively loose non binding cooperation and oversight system it encourages sharing information across member states about the potential for given investments to affect national security and interests and empowers the commission to weigh in on deals that affect multiple member states or the eu as a whole the eu screening mechanism sets out the goal of gradual convergence of individual member states regimes and calls for monitoring and reporting by member states today only 11 of 28 members lack screening measures or concrete plans to introduce them the rapid passing of this new eu measure in just 18 months is indicative of heightened concerns over the terms of china s economic expansion this measure is largely perceived as targeting china specifically because it makes provisions for dominant characteristics of its investment strategy a focus on technology and infrastructure sectors state linked and funded entities and state led outward projects another key feature of the eu s new screening mechanism targets a specific aspect of some chinese deals namely that many are executed via third parties in other states to conceal the chinese source of ownership and funding the measure explicitly sets out to prevent the bypassing of national screening by investigating deals within the eu

journalists and politicians to its headquarters and underlining repeatedly its separation from the chinese state and communist party concerns for security nato and u s eu cooperation political

whose coalition government appeared to be committed to a strong relationship with china during president xi jinping s march visit is responding to internal calls largely from deputy prime minister matteo salvini and his northern league to broaden the government s golden powers to block deals that threaten national security and economic autonomy the u s and europe remain largely divided over huawei technologies and the extent of the security risks linked to its inclusion in the development of 5g infrastructure the u k recently approved huawei as a supplier of 5g services but kept it out of critical parts of the network germany has similarly allowed the telecoms giant and italy is debating its position internally but seems to be leaning in favour of following its european peers the u k and germany even set up security evaluation centres to monitor huawei services on their soil but british intelligence services claimed that even this monitoring only had limited capacity to guarantee security in the meantime recent days have seen revelations that software backdoors were found in huawei equipment as early as 2009 by carrier vodafone in italy and that despite recurrences to the contrary they remained in place at least until 2011 although vodafone said the issue was eventually resolved this precedent if further evidence corroborates it should discourage allowing huawei to operate at least the most sensitive components of 5g networks in nato countries while europeans concern with huawei is largely limited to the ability of the chinese government to exploit the company which ownership system remain unclear15 to spy on the countries and conduct cyber attacks the u s is also significantly worried about the effect of sustaining the growth of a critical industry in a rival country that could cost u s and european firms their technological lead a key motive for the u s pressure to ban huawei that is not well received in europe is that western providers should be bolstered to win a 5g race besides the question of huawei europe has to grapple with chinese ownership or control of physical infrastructure and the security risks that arise from it chinese state owned enterprises soe with backing from state funds often under the bri label are expanding their control of key european port assets and increasingly also rail links and utilities therefore the use of european ports for u s and nato naval operations could be compromised as it may happen in the case of the israeli port of haifa which will be operated by shanghai international port group sipg from 2021 nato as an organization is only starting to look at china as a part of its reflexion but the bigger question is whether the alliance is the ideal forum for this new strategic orientation in one respect of military salience the emergence of a russia china nexus directly affects nato s primary mission the sino russian relationship should not be exaggerated but the two countries have been conducting joint naval exercises in the mediterranean black sea and baltic sea 16 their military leaderships have increased their exchanges on the other hand intra european divisions on china may translate into lower effectiveness of nato making it a weak platform for pursuing a cohesive strategy to contain china s ability to project power to conclude europe has started re evaluating its policies with respect to the china challenge the necessary measures for ensuring critical technologies and infrastructures are protected are now largely in place but their implementation and enforcement will make the difference between continued vulnerability and effective security europe also remains divided with a number of countries at its periphery benefiting from chinese economic assistance still the european union is now standing as one of the strongest advocates of liberal and democratic values in the world many of them shared on this side of the atlantic the rise of china in an increasingly multipolar world should be part of the transatlantic discussion bearing in mind european sensitivities the u s congress should use all its possibilities to collaborate with europe to build consensus over the immediate security technological and geo economic sides of china s expansion as the current u s administration continues to send mixed messages to america s european allies

high level negotiations to continue as us raises tariffs on 200bn worth of chinese goods from 10 to 25 percent a week ago it looked like the world s two biggest economies were close to resolving their ongoing trade dispute now the united states is imposing a new round of punishing tariff increases on chinese goods eleventh hour negotiations got under way on thursday between a high level chinese delegation led by vice premier liu he and us negotiators led by trade representative robert lighthizer 181130130736067 the pressure to salvage a trade deal between the two sides ratcheted up on wednesday after the us formally filed paperwork that would make good on president donald trump s twitter threat earlier in the week to raise tariffs on chinese imports from friday tariffs are increasing on 200bn worth of chinese goods from 10 to 25 percent china promises to retaliate but has not offered specifics on possible countermeasures senior trump administration officials have accused beijing of reneging on commitments made during earlier trade talks speaking at a rally in florida on wednesday trump had said china broke the deal but trump changed his tone on thursday with a tweet saying he had received a beautiful letter from chinese president xi jinping with the trade war entering its second year the us and china are wrestling with a long list of hot button issues most analysts agree beijing stands to lose more than washington if the bilateral trade conflict is prolonged china s gross domestic product gdp could fall by some 1 6 percent this year if punitive tariffs continue to squeeze chinese companies out of american markets the international monetary fund imf estimates meanwhile strong us economic growth a healthy job market and a less jittery wall street have ushered in a bold new stance by the trump administration the us economy grew 3 2 percent in the first quarter unemployment is hovering at a 50 year low and a us stock market rally this year has boosted investor confidence albeit amidst a general perception that the us and china were moving towards a deal china seven times as vulnerable the us imported about 540bn in goods from china last year and had exports to china of 120bn robert e scott an economist at the economic policy institute told al jazeera neither figure is a large share of us gdp which reached 21 1 trillion in the first quarter scott added the proportion for china is much greater its 540bn in exports to the us in 2018 represented four percent of economy he said in other words china is roughly seven times as vulnerable to trade disruption as the united states in this particular dispute 181129194947608 given the strength of the us dollar weakness in the chinese yuan and chinese importers absorbing additional costs scott believes the effect should be small and manageable for the us economy however other experts believe the trump administration s position may not be as strong as headline indicators suggest companies have absorbed much of the cost of tariffs so far particularly in the goods that were only targeted at 10 percent andrew coflan a china analyst with eurasia group told al jazeera twenty five percent however is much more difficult to absorb given margins in global supply chains coflan added referring to friday s increase these costs will be passed on to consumers in a way that current tariffs have not been this will lead to both inflation and job loss two challenges that this administration has not had to deal with but even if the us starts to feel the heat china is likely to experience more economic pain because of higher reliance on exports and increasing indebtedness the global economy could also experience the consequences with trade flows and financial markets feeling ripple effects all out trade war talks stalled last week reportedly because the chinese side opted for regulatory rather than legislative implementation which could be internally undone more easily without the legal change us officials will have more difficulty nearly impossible selling the deal said coflan meanwhile us delegates refuse to say what exactly tripped up the discussions with the chinese the 150 page seven chapter draft of the trade deal addresses complex issues such as ending beijing s practice of forced technology transfers implementing better protections for us intellectual property and increasing market access for us firms gary clyde hufbauer a senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics said it s likely that china baulked at some of its earlier commitments regarding provincial subsidies and the opening of agriculture pork and soybeans especially regardless of why the talks appear to have faltered many experts agree that though the us is better prepared to weather the storm repercussions are inevitable if trump s tariff threats mature into an all out trade war us gdp growth will be knocked down possibly by 0 5 percent and the stock market will take an even bigger hit said hufbauer alluding to the market volatility that further trade uncertainty could bring hufbauer added that consumers could experience significant price rises for a variety of products while some us businesses could suffer on the us import side a wide range of consumer goods sold in stores like walmart and target will become more expensive he said on the us export side agricultural sales will stay depressed major business service firms like jpmorgan chase will suffer and us exports of hi tech products like aeroplanes and turbines will fall face saving deal as talks continue following the tariff increase some analysts believe the trump administration will step back from the brink i still think they ll get a deal edward alden a senior fellow at the council on foreign relations told al jazeera 190509055106797 the us stock market just wants to see signs of nearing a deal alden added emphasising that investors may not be concerned with the fine print nevertheless the draft agreement remains on the rocks pending work by sizable teams on both sides the chinese are hurting more but that doesn t mean they couldn t sustain a long trade war alden said
this testimony was given before the house of representatives foreign affairs committee subcommittee on europe eurasia energy and the environment introduction chairman keating ranking member kinzinger distinguished members of this committee thank you for inviting me to testify before you for the second time this hearing takes place in a context of a shift in the attitudes of both the united states and europe towards china s growing economic and geopolitical rise as well as a broader evolution of beijing s own priorities and external strategy for the past seven years i have been focusing on china s geo economic outreach with a focus on foreign direct investments and how these are perceived in eurasia including europe the caucasus and central asia eurasia is a complex concept with diverging definitions and has been a playing field for competition or cooperation between big powers especially russia china the united states and the european union eu although i have also been working on central asia i have decided today to focus my testimony on recent developments between china and the european continent while the u s has taken a tougher stance in dealing with china s persistent lack of reciprocity in economic relations and violations of international norms of intellectual property for some years european countries have recently begun reacting concretely to the economic and security related considerations linked to certain chinese investments on their soil the eu s official acknowledgment of china as a systemic rival in a policy document released this spring marks a departure from previously conciliatory language 1 at the same time chinese investments on both sides of the atlantic have declined considerably after peaking in 2016 beijing is increasingly curbing private outward investment to maintain its stock of foreign reserves and to direct capital to domestic use amid a period of economic slowdown the notable exceptions are foreign direct investments fdi connected with president xi jinping s flagship strategy to achieve technological parity in key industries made in china 2025 and investment towards the belt and road initiative bri xi s other grand plan to connect china to its markets through large scale infrastructure projects the bri now counts new european signatories including italy one of the eu s founding members which also became the first g7 nation to sign a memorandum of understanding with china in march 2019 the latter episode has provided an important test for the u s europe security relationship upon the urging of american diplomats not to take part in the bri italy has loudly reiterated its allegiance to nato and the underlying western alliance yet is has chosen to defy both the u s and eu strategic posture in its decision to adhere to the project the greatest challenge is that chinese investments in strategic sectors can generate economic dependence especially among smaller countries and struggling economies and this relationship can expand into the political realm as it has on a few occasions that i will mention shortly against this backdrop the u s and europe need to consider how they can maintain their security relationship to meet mutual challenges but also how to reconcile diverging strategies for handling the emergence of china in order to avoid an escalation of tensions and to build instead a constructive relationship with beijing over the brief time of this testimony i will address the following questions and concerns what is the state of chinese foreign direct investments in europe following multiple visits and summits in europe and the bri forum in beijing what is china s vision towards europe how is the european union and how are individual countries reacting is china s growing economic presence translating into political influence in europe how is the eu responding to the bri overview of chinese fdi in europe economic relations between europe and china have expanded dramatically over the last decade the eu is now china s largest trading partner and china is the eu s second largest trading partner after the united states china s annual fdi into the eu skyrocketed from 840 million in 2008 to 42 billion in 2017 covering a wide range of geographic areas and industrial sectors the count about doubles when including switzerland a non eu country which has captured the lion s share of chinese fdi with chemchina s acquisition of the agri business giant syngenta for 43 billion the world s single largest acquisition by a chinese company philippe le corre philippe le corre was a nonresident senior fellow in the europe program at the carnegie endowment for international peace more phlecorre however data from the last two years indicates that in aggregate terms chinese fdi into europe is slowing down from its 2016 peak in 2018 chinese fdi in europe declined by 40 compared to 2017 for a total of 22 5 billion 2 part of this downward trend relates to fewer mega deals being pursued or completed whereas multi billion deals were a key feature of total fdi in previous years similarly 2018 saw a shift away from infrastructures utilities and real estate projects in favour of more consumer facing sectors the united kingdom remained the largest european recipient of chinese fdi for 2018 followed by sweden germany luxembourg and france behind the headline of an aggregate fall in fdi 2018 saw sharper increases in a more diverse pool of european countries spain sweden luxembourg denmark as well as hungary croatia poland and slovenia all saw growing investments 3 the overall value of deals was nothing to remark on especially for smaller and eastern european countries but it is significant insofar as it marks a growing chinese presence in a wider range of countries and significantly in several eu member states the british case deserves a close attention as the country prepares to exit the union the 2017 2018 decline in fdi in europe is largely the outcome of the chinese government s recently introduced controls on private capital outflows besides the decline in outbound fdi there has also been a considerable wave of divestments estimated at 5 billion it includes large private companies such as hna or dalian wanda that had invested substantially in european countries but have recently sold some of their assets however europe continues to receive most of its fdi from state owned enterprises soes which made up about 63 of total fdi between 2008 18 4 unlike private firms which have made up a majority of fdi in the u s for instance soes are less restricted in their ability to invest abroad especially on projects backed by beijing and compatible with made in china 2025 and the bri5 on top of this supply side restriction on fdi european countries have followed somewhat in the u s footsteps and began to scrutinize investment especially from soes with the effect of reducing the volume of deals on the other hand china ranks 59th out of the 62 countries evaluated by the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in terms of openness to fdi almost half of companies surveyed in 2018 by the european chamber of commerce in china said they missed out on business opportunities due to regulatory barriers or market access restrictions and they expected obstacles to increase during the next five years it is increasingly evident that many european countries are unhappy with the lack of reciprocity and the joint ventures forced upon european firms to do business in china which often entail a form of technology transfer only smaller countries appear to continue to view one way fdi as a sufficiently good trade off new regulations announced at the recent session of the national people s congress in beijing might bring more openings for european companies in the next year but the real changes will come when the eu and china finally settle on a comprehensive agreement on investment cai recent developments in eu china relations the past three months have seen some of the most significant developments and responses to challenges in europe china relations these include both increased cohesion at the eu level especially among the largest eu members and divergence on key foreign policies such as adherence to the bri with regards to the latter italy became the first g7 country to formally endorse the bri in march switzerland followed suit on april 29 they joined 22 other european countries who had already signed mous austria bosnia herzegovina bulgaria croatia cyprus czech republic estonia greece hungary latvia lithuania luxemburg malta montenegro north macedonia poland portugal romania serbia slovakia slovenia and ukraine in the chinese original conception of the bri6 europe is the final destination of this ambitious project and still represents the largest and most attractive consumer market for chinese products having more european countries signing in to the bri is a major success in the chinese domestic political context at the second bri forum organized in beijing in april 2019 no less than 12 european heads of state and heads of governments attended including those of austria hungary italy greece portugal the czech republic and malta7 the balkan countries with the exception of croatia are not eu members for that reason they are eager for chinese investments do not require a visa for chinese visitors and have little barriers for fdi at all china is investing massively in this part of europe five of these balkan states and 11 eu eastern european member states form the 16 1 group which gathered for its 8th summit meeting in croatia on april 10 11 attended by premier li keqiang greece has now joined this group which has been re labelled as 17 1 on the other hand larger eu member states are broadly wary of entertaining purely bilateral relations with beijing and instead favour a coordinated eu approach that can effectively stand up to china as an equal power for instance france s president emmanuel macron summoned german chancellor angela merkel and european commission president jean claude juncker to paris on occasion of xi jinping s state visit in march again germany s economy minister told the press from the belt and road forum that took place in late april that large eu member states had agreed not to sign

of critical parts of the network germany has similarly allowed the telecoms giant and italy is debating its position internally but seems to be leaning in favour of following its european peers the u k and germany even set up security evaluation centres to monitor huawei services on their soil but british intelligence services claimed that even this monitoring only had limited capacity to guarantee security in the meantime recent days have seen revelations that software backdoors were found in huawei equipment as early as 2009 by carrier vodafone in italy and that despite recurrences to the contrary they remained in place at least until 2011 although vodafone said the issue was eventually resolved this precedent if further evidence corroborates it should discourage allowing huawei to operate at least the most sensitive components of 5g networks in nato countries while europeans concern with huawei is largely limited to the ability of the chinese government to exploit the company which ownership system remain unclear15 to spy on the countries and conduct cyber attacks the u s is also significantly worried about the effect of sustaining the growth of a critical industry in a rival country that could cost u s and european firms their technological lead a key motive for the u s pressure to ban huawei that is not well received in europe is that western providers should be bolstered to win a 5g race besides the question of huawei europe has to grapple with chinese ownership or control of physical infrastructure and the security risks that arise from it chinese state owned enterprises soe with backing from state funds often under the bri label are expanding their control of key european port assets and increasingly also rail links and utilities therefore the use of european ports for u s and nato naval operations could be compromised as it may happen in the case of the israeli port of haifa which will be operated by shanghai international port group sipg from 2021 nato as an organization is only starting to look at china as a part of its reflexion but the bigger question is whether the alliance is the ideal forum for this new strategic orientation in one respect of military salience the emergence of a russia china nexus directly affects nato s primary mission the sino russian relationship should not be exaggerated but the two countries have been conducting joint naval exercises in the mediterranean black sea and baltic sea 16 their military leaderships have increased their exchanges on the other hand intra european divisions on china may translate into lower effectiveness of nato making it a weak platform for pursuing a cohesive strategy to contain china s ability to project power to conclude europe has started re evaluating its policies with respect to the china challenge the necessary measures for ensuring critical technologies and infrastructures are protected are now largely in place but their implementation and enforcement will make the difference between continued vulnerability and effective security europe also remains divided with a number of countries at its periphery benefiting from chinese economic assistance still the european union is now standing as one of the strongest advocates of liberal and democratic values in the world many of them shared on this side of the atlantic the rise of china in an increasingly multipolar world should be part of the transatlantic discussion bearing in mind european sensitivities the u s congress should use all its possibilities to collaborate with europe to build consensus over the immediate security technological and geo economic sides of china s expansion as the current u s administration continues to send mixed messages to america s european allies

canada the outlook for the u s market remains optimistic across all business lines we are seeing increased levels of activity in the bakken marcellus and rockies basins resulting in strad relocating 6 of our canadian surface rental fleet to meet this demand said andy pernal president and ceo of strad in 2019 as we continue with our strategy to increase our matting fleet to 180 000 units by 2021 we deployed 6 6 million of capital to maintain and increase our fleet and have 26 0 million approved out of our expected 30 0 million capital program for 2019 the first quarter continued to highlight the impact of our industrial matting business to deliver high rates of return with a 156 ebitda increase from the segment in the quarter we benefited from the continued large montney region matting project and saw increased activity from the u s in both matting and surface rentals this activity combined with a change in ifrs contributed to a 9 increase in revenue and a 75 increase in ebitda

results strad reported an increase in revenue and ebitda of 9 and 75 respectively during the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 during the three months ended march 31 2019 strad reported net income of 1 6 million compared to net loss of 0 4 million in 2018 for the three months ended march 31 2019 strad s industrial matting segment reported an increase in revenue and ebitda of 70 and 156 as compared to the same period in 2018 earnings before interest and taxes ebit from industrial matting increased from 1 6 million in the first quarter of 2018 to 4 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 the increase in revenue ebitda and ebit was a result of a large matting project that began in the fourth quarter of 2018 and carried through the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 during which strad had no significant matting projects the increase in revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was further impacted by increased average pricing strad s equipment rentals segment reported a decrease in revenue and ebitda of 27 and 24 respectively during the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 the decrease in revenue was a result of lower rig activity and utilization in canada which was partially offset by an increase in pricing and utilization in the u s during the first quarter of 2019 capital expenditures were 6 6 million in industrial matting the majority of the capital additions were related to wood matting additions which were acquired to prepare for and to support industrial matting projects that are planned for 2019 outlook subsequent to the quarter the united conservative party won the provincial election in alberta and will form a majority government the party s platform is pro business and includes many reforms aimed at increasing capital investment in businesses based in alberta these reforms include a proposed reduction in the provincial corporate tax rate to 8 pursuing all possible pipeline projects and alternatives to get alberta oil products to market and creating a job creation tax cut for employers while the provincial government will encourage investment and the construction of pipelines the energy sector still faces several challenges the federal government has introduced legislation under bill c 69 which proposes new criteria for review of major infrastructure projects many believe this legislation could result in stagnated approval processes and effectively end construction of new pipelines should new pipelines begin construction during 2019 the economic impact may still not be felt for several years despite these challenges we believe strongly in the opportunities presented in both canada and the u s for our industrial matting segment formal approval of the lng canada project and associated coastal gaslink project could continue to provide significant opportunity for the industrial matting segment in late 2019 and subsequent years the coastal gaslink project is progressing with construction activities across northern british columbia by preparing workforce accommodation sites and beginning right of way clearing in preparation for construction in mid to late 2019 despite opposition to lng canada and coastal gaslink the organizations responsible for those pipelines have committed to advancing the projects and maintaining the construction schedule our results continue to demonstrate the opportunity and free cash flow provided by our industrial matting segment the large scale matting project which began in the fourth quarter of 2018 and required a substantial number of mats on the north montney mainline continued through the entire first quarter supporting our strong results for the quarter in 2019 we will look to employ our expertise in deploying matting projects in the u s market with increasing environmental responsibility and regulation throughout north america we expect the overall matting market to increase as we also look to increase our market share our internal estimates place the current market size for matting in north america at over 2 0 billion annually the outlook for the u s equipment rentals business remains consistent with 2018 the business environment remains strong with low corporate tax rates and relatively high west texas intermediate wti pricing in canada however we see challenging times ahead first quarter rig counts were down approximately 32 year over year in canada and the forecast for the remainder of the year places 2019 estimates only marginally ahead of historic lows experienced in 2016 beginning in the first quarter and continuing into the second quarter we moved equipment from canada to regions in the u s experiencing higher demand year to date we have moved approximately 2 5 million net book value of equipment to the u s including the permian basin in west texas we will continue to be opportunistic with our equipment rentals fleet deploying equipment in the u s where possible consistent with our strategy to double our matting fleet to 180 000 units by 2021 we deployed 6 6 million of capital to maintain and increase our fleet in the first quarter of 2019 to date the board of directors has approved 26 0 million of capital spending in 2019 of an expected 30 0 million total capital program on november 26 2018 the company obtained approval from the toronto stock exchange to renew the normal course issuer bid until november 27 2019 with the number of common shares the company can buy back limited to a maximum of 4 067 205 common shares

value revenue for the three months ended march 31 2019 of 17 7 million increased 70 compared to 10 5 million during the same period of 2018 increased revenue was primarily due to the timing of

to the same quarter of 2018 which had no large scale matting projects further impacting revenue was an increase in average utilization to 36 from 27 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first

increased to 4 1 million compared to 1 6 million during the same period of 2018 the primary driver for the increase in ebit was the increase in ebitda for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first quarter of 2018 operating expenses for the three months ended march 31 2019 increased 42 to 8 8 million as compared to 6 2 million during the same period of 2018 the increase in operating

of 2019 the change in current liabilities was a result of a 28 decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities to 11 8 million at march 31 2019 compared to 16 4 million at year end the decrease

results strad reported an increase in revenue and ebitda of 9 and 75 respectively during the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 during the three months ended march 31 2019 strad reported net income of 1 6 million compared to net loss of 0 4 million in 2018 for the three months ended march 31 2019 strad s industrial matting segment reported an increase in revenue and ebitda of 70 and 156 as compared to the same period in 2018 earnings before interest and taxes ebit from industrial matting increased from 1 6 million in the first quarter of 2018 to 4 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 the increase in revenue ebitda and ebit was a result of a large matting project that began in the fourth quarter of 2018 and carried through the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 during which strad had no significant matting projects the increase in revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was further impacted by increased average pricing strad s equipment rentals segment reported a decrease in revenue and ebitda of 27 and 24 respectively during the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 the decrease in revenue was a result of lower rig activity and utilization in canada which was partially offset by an increase in pricing and utilization in the u s during the first quarter of 2019 capital expenditures were 6 6 million in industrial matting the majority of the capital additions were related to wood matting additions which were acquired to prepare for and to support industrial matting projects that are planned for 2019 outlook subsequent to the quarter the united conservative party won the provincial election in alberta and will form a majority government the party s platform is pro business and includes many reforms aimed at increasing capital investment in businesses based in alberta these reforms include a proposed reduction in the provincial corporate tax rate to 8 pursuing all possible pipeline projects and alternatives to get alberta oil products to market and creating a job creation tax cut for employers while the provincial government will encourage investment and the construction of pipelines the energy sector still faces several challenges the federal government has introduced legislation under bill c 69 which proposes new criteria for review of major infrastructure projects many believe this legislation could result in stagnated approval processes and effectively end construction of new pipelines should new pipelines begin construction during 2019 the economic impact may still not be felt for several years despite these challenges we believe strongly in the opportunities presented in both canada and the u s for our industrial matting segment formal approval of the lng canada project and associated coastal gaslink project could continue to provide significant opportunity for the industrial matting segment in late 2019 and subsequent years the coastal gaslink project is progressing with construction activities across northern british columbia by preparing workforce accommodation sites and beginning right of way clearing in preparation for construction in mid to late 2019 despite opposition to lng canada and coastal gaslink the organizations responsible for those pipelines have committed to advancing the projects and maintaining the construction schedule our results continue to demonstrate the opportunity and free cash flow provided by our industrial matting segment the large scale matting project which began in the fourth quarter of 2018 and required a substantial number of mats on the north montney mainline continued through the entire first quarter supporting our strong results for the quarter in 2019 we will look to employ our expertise in deploying matting projects in the u s market with increasing environmental responsibility and regulation throughout north america we expect the overall matting market to increase as we also look to increase our market share our internal estimates place the current market size for matting in north america at over 2 0 billion annually the outlook for the u s equipment rentals business remains consistent with 2018 the business environment remains strong with low corporate tax rates and relatively high west texas intermediate wti pricing in canada however we see challenging times ahead first quarter rig counts were down approximately 32 year over year in canada and the forecast for the remainder of the year places 2019 estimates only marginally ahead of historic lows experienced in 2016 beginning in the first quarter and continuing into the second quarter we moved equipment from canada to regions in the u s experiencing higher demand year to date

generally accepted accounting principle non gaap financial measures these measures are widely used in the mining industry as a benchmark for performance but do not have a standardized meaning as prescribed by ifrs as an indicator of performance and may differ from methods used by other companies with similar descriptions these non gaap financial measures include cash costs the company s method of calculating cash costs may differ from the methods used by other entities and accordingly the company s cash costs may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other entities investors are cautioned that cash costs should not be construed as an alternative to production costs depreciation and amortization and royalties determined in accordance with ifrs as an indicator of performance adjusted earnings and basic adjusted earnings per share the company believes that these measures better reflect normalized earnings as they eliminate items that in management s judgment are subject to volatility as a result of factors which are unrelated to operations in the period and or relate to items that will settle in future periods all in sustaining costs per silver or gold ounce sold net of by product credits aisc the company has adopted aisc as a measure of its consolidated operating performance and its ability to generate cash from all operations collectively and the

than the prior year quarter due to the increase in aocf and offset in part by the increase in weighted average shares outstanding the increase in weighted average shares outstanding was a result of the equity financing related to the acquisition of ngl retail east ngl superior had net earnings of 158 7 million in the first quarter 113 7 million or 253 higher than the prior year quarter primarily due to an increase in revenue and gross profit as well as a realized gain on derivative financial instruments compared to a realized loss in the prior year quarter the increase in net earnings was

assets and the wholesale business in the second quarter of 2018 average u s propane sales margins in the first quarter were 39 6 cents per litre compared to 20 3 cents per litre in the prior year quarter primarily due to the higher proportion of residential sales volumes sales and marketing and integration initiatives and the positive impact of the weaker canadian dollar on the translation of

therefore be considered in isolation or used in substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with ifrs other issuers may calculate non gaap financial measures differently investors

flow and adjusted operating cash flow per share aocf is equal to cash flow from operating activities as defined by ifrs adjusted for changes in non cash working capital other expenses non cash

during the quarter 17 3 million tonnes of material were mined a 2 increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 as we commenced mining the next phase of the mackay pit which resulted in shorter haul

royalties of 812 per payable ounce of gold sold in the first quarter of 2019 was 7 higher than the previous quarter primarily due to planned lower grades mined in the second half of 2018 and the first quarter of 2019 total mining costs of 1 73 per tonne in the first quarter of 2019 were 7 less than in the previous quarter due to 2 more tonnes mined and lower maintenance costs processing unit costs were 6 lower in the first quarter due to a 17 reduction in cyanide costs that resulted from the start up of a new leach pad this reduction in costs offset the 3 reduction in ore tonnes stacked general and administrative unit costs were 6 higher in the first quarter of 2019 than in the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily due to lower ore tonnes stacked despite the higher cash costs aisc per payable ounce of gold sold decreased in the first quarter of 2019 to 984 from 995 in the fourth quarter due to decreased capital spending partially offset by higher deferred stripping and capitalized exploration mine sales a total of 55 517 ounces of gold were sold at an average realized gold price of 1 303 per ounce during the first quarter of 2019 an increase of 10 from the 50 550 ounces of gold sold at an average realized gold price of 1 227 per ounce during the fourth quarter of 2018 exploration the primary objective for exploration work in 2019 is to explore the north and south extensions of red dot and the western area of the mackay pit activities in these areas have the potential to discover additional mineral resources due to their proximity to existing mineral resources during the first quarter we completed 70 reverse circulation rc drillholes for 23 447 meters a limited amount of work during the period advanced the mineral resource to mineral reserve conversion at red dot through the completion of geotechnical and qa qc core drilling this work comprised 12 core holes for 4 893 meters during the period results were received from 40 of the 70 rc holes with 29 reporting resource grade intercepts these results will be compiled later in the year with our existing data looking ahead to the second quarter rc drilling on the east basalt and valmy targets will commence

at the seabee gold operation see cautionary note regarding non gaap measures 3 includes capitalized and expensed exploration expenditures mine production seabee gold operation produced a record 31 183 ounces of gold in the first quarter of 2019 largely due to timing of gold pours at year end 2018 and aided by the increased mill throughput rate gold sales totaled 27 999 ounces for the first quarter 29 higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 the mill achieved an average throughput of 1 008 tonnes per day over the first quarter a 7 increase compared to the previous quarter reflecting a higher

costs were 467 in the first quarter of 2019 7 lower than the 502 recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 lower cash costs were due to lower unit operating costs for mining and general and administrative as a higher proportion of underground activities were directed to capitalized development costs per tonne mined were 52 in the first quarter of 2019 9 lower than in the previous quarter due to higher tonnes mined processing costs per tonne were higher than the prior quarter while general and administrative unit costs decreased by 16 in the first quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to adjustments to payroll accruals and lower tonnes milled in the fourth quarter of 2018 lower unit costs more than offset lower grades processed aisc per payable ounce of gold sold were 973 in the first quarter of 2019 31 higher than the 743 in the fourth quarter of 2018 as increased capital expenditures capital development and capitalized exploration were somewhat offset by payable ounce of gold sold this increase is due to the seasonal nature of our operation whereby a majority of annual sustaining capital items are purchased in the first quarter of each year for delivery on the ice road for summer construction in the first quarter sustaining capital included approximately 7 million for our planned investment in underground mining equipment to increase capacity flexibility and reliability at the seabee mine mine sales a total of 27 999 ounces were sold at an average realized gold price of 1 302 per ounce during the first quarter of 2019 29 higher

underground drilling and 23 000 meters of surface drilling with the objective to increase and convert mineral resources into mineral reserves near the santoy mine in the first quarter of 2019 we completed 12 576 meters of underground drilling and 15 561 meters of surface drilling in 24 and 58 drillholes respectively underground activities for the first quarter of 2019 centered on three targets including santoy gap hanging wall gap hw santoy 8a vein zone and santoy 9 a and c vein zones surface drilling in the first quarter focused on three areas including gap hw 8a east batman lake and the fisher project with 7 639 meters being completed in 20 core drillholes several gap hw holes intersected visible gold particularly in the near surface drillholes targeting the up plunge extension of the structure we expect that these results will increase mineral resources for gap hw once compiled with our existing drill data on greenfields targets we received anomalous positive results from two holes at batman lake located 800 meters south of santoy mine on the seabee property and the last hole completed on the north mac showing at the fisher project results from the

expenditures of the chinchillas project mine production the chinchillas mine ramp up was substantially completed during the first quarter of 2019 total material mined from the chinchillas open pit increased significantly compared to the previous quarter as commercial production was achieved on december 1 2018 as noted in our annual guidance waste removal is elevated in 2019 as the chinchillas mine completes the highwall pushback and commences the next pit phase this was demonstrated by the elevated strip ratio in the first quarter and is expected to continue through the third quarter of 2019 with a downward trend to year end 2019 as a result the pirquitas mill will predominantly process stockpiled chinchillas ore into the third quarter of 2019 with ore mined in 2019 principally supplying the pirquitas mill in the fourth quarter of 2019 silver production was 2 4 million ounces for the quarter an increase of 101 relative to the fourth quarter of 2018 mainly due to higher silver mill feed grade and silver recovery as ore was sourced exclusively from the chinchillas mine silver sales totaled 0 9 million ounces as concentrate shipments commenced later in the quarter on an attributable basis silver production and sales for the first quarter totaled 1 8 million ounces and 0 7 million ounces respectively during the first quarter ore was milled at an average of 3 830 tonnes per day a 3 increase compared to ore milled in the previous quarter mainly due to improvements in mill flotation pumping processed ore in the first quarter of 2019 contained an average silver grade of 235 g t a 77 increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 due to solely processing higher grade chinchillas ore metallurgical recoveries of silver lead and zinc are expected to be variable until we achieve steady state production the new tailings pump system at the pirquitas mill was completed during the quarter mine operating costs cash costs and aisc per payable ounce of silver sold are non gaap financial measures please see cautionary note regarding non gaap measures cash costs which include cost of inventory treatment and refining costs provincial royalties export duties and by product credits were 9 94 per payable ounce of silver sold in the first quarter of 2019 a 34 decrease from 15 02 per payable ounce of silver sold in the fourth quarter of 2018 the decrease was primarily due to higher production resulting from higher silver grade of ore processed with chinchillas supplying all the processed ore and recognition of higher by product credits aisc per payable ounce of silver sold in the first quarter of 2019 were 19 76 slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 as significantly lower cash costs were offset by high sustaining capital per payable ounce in the first quarter as discussed above mining activities in the quarter focused on waste removal and drove high capitalized stripping costs this combined with payable silver ounces sold well below production due to the required ramp up in concentrate sales drove higher per payable ounce sustaining capital costs in the quarter mine sales silver sales totaled 0 9 million ounces and attributable sales were 0 7 million in the first quarter of 2019 comparable to the fourth quarter of 2018 sales of silver lead and zinc concentrates increased through the first quarter and are expected to be in line with production over the remainder of 2019 subsequent to the quarter we entered into annual contracts for all expected 2019 concentrate tonnage in line with past practice exploration at puna operations exploration activities were limited to the completion of detailed drone magnetic data at chinchillas and the pirquitas mine areas magnetic inversions have been completed and contribute to target selection at both properties in 2018 we evaluated the potential for an underground mine at the pirquitas deposit to provide supplemental ore to the pirquitas mill the study confirmed a technically feasible and economic project however with a return below our investment thresholds at current metal prices we have budgeted 1 million in 2019 for a 3 000 meter drill program to test for extensions to the mineralization that could have a positive impact on the project economics we plan to commence this drilling in the second quarter of 2019 chinchillas project argentina during the first quarter ore feed to the pirquitas plant has been exclusively from the chinchillas mine the in pit tailings pumping system was commissioned during the quarter and tailings deposition to the pit is ongoing the chinchillas truck shop structure is complete with equipping remaining in process three truck bays are being used for operating maintenance while works are completed road upgrades and

per share to manage and evaluate our operating performance please see cautionary note regarding non gaap measures quarterly financial summary revenue in the first quarter of 2019 increased by 29 relative to the comparative quarter in 2018 due principally to an increase in gold sales both at the marigold mine and the seabee gold operation puna operations revenue also increased on higher sales of lead and zinc partially offset by lower silver sales concentrate sales increased relative to the previous quarter but lagged the increase in production of silver and lead resulting from processing solely chinchillas ore in the first quarter of 2019 income from mine operations in the first quarter of 2019 generated a gross margin of 24 higher than the 18 gross margin in the first quarter of 2018 due to higher income from mine operations generated by the seabee gold operation and puna operations as lower cost and depreciation more than offset lower realized metal prices relative to the prior year quarter the marigold mine generated a lower gross margin due to higher costs and lower realized prices in the first quarter of 2019 we generated net income of 5 7 million compared to a net loss of 2 3 million in the first quarter of 2018 cash used in operating activities in the quarter was 0 3 million compared to 11 0 million generated in the first quarter of 2018 both the seabee gold operation and puna operations had higher sales at lower unit costs while the marigold mine had higher gold sales at higher unit costs cash from operating activities was negatively impacted by a 27 4 million increase in non cash working capital compared to a 11 9 million increase in the first quarter of 2018 due primarily to a combination of supplies inventory restocking at seabee gold operation increased concentrate finished goods inventories at chinchillas as sales lagged production higher leach pad inventory costs at the marigold mine and a reduction in trade payables at the end of the quarter we used 33 8 million in investing activities in the first quarter of 2019 this included expenditures of 13 2 million on property plant and equipment and 6 1 million on the chinchillas project this compared to 1 4 million generated from investing activities in the first quarter of 2018 in the first quarter of 2018 we received 28 1 million from the sales of common shares of pretium resources

cautionary note to u s investors this news release includes mineral reserves and mineral resources classification terms that comply with reporting standards in canada and the mineral reserves and the mineral resources estimates are made in accordance with ni 43 101 ni 43 101 is a rule developed by the canadian securities administrators that establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects these standards differ significantly from the requirements of the sec set out in sec industry guide 7 consequently mineral reserves and mineral resources information included in this news release is not comparable to similar information that would generally be disclosed by domestic u s reporting companies subject to the reporting and disclosure requirements of the sec under sec standards mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made in addition the sec s disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute reserves by u s standards in documents filed with the sec u s investors should understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and

results strad reported an increase in revenue and ebitda of 9 and 75 respectively during the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 during the three months ended march 31 2019 strad reported net income of 1 6 million compared to net loss of 0 4 million in 2018 for the three months ended march 31 2019 strad s industrial matting segment reported an increase in revenue and ebitda of 70 and 156 as compared to the same period in 2018 earnings before interest and taxes ebit from industrial matting increased from 1 6 million in the first quarter of 2018 to 4 2 million in the first quarter of 2019 the increase in revenue ebitda and ebit was a result of a large matting project that began in the fourth quarter of 2018 and carried through the first quarter of 2019 as compared to the first quarter of 2018 during which strad had no significant matting projects the increase in revenue for the first quarter of 2019 was further impacted by increased average pricing strad s equipment rentals segment reported a decrease in revenue and ebitda of 27 and 24 respectively during the three months ended march 31 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 the decrease in revenue was a result of lower rig activity and utilization in canada which was partially offset by an increase in pricing and utilization in the u s during the first quarter of 2019 capital expenditures were 6 6 million in industrial matting the majority of the capital additions were related to wood matting additions which were acquired to prepare for and to support industrial matting projects that are planned for 2019 outlook subsequent to the quarter the united conservative party won the provincial election in alberta and will form a majority government the party s platform is pro business and includes many reforms aimed at increasing capital investment in businesses based in alberta these reforms include a proposed reduction in the provincial corporate tax rate to 8 pursuing all possible pipeline projects and alternatives to get alberta oil products to market and creating a job creation tax cut for employers while the provincial government will encourage investment and the construction of pipelines the energy sector still faces several challenges the federal government has introduced legislation under bill c 69 which proposes new criteria for review of major infrastructure projects many believe this legislation could result in stagnated approval processes and effectively end construction of new pipelines should new pipelines begin construction during 2019 the economic impact may still not be felt for several years despite these challenges we believe strongly in the opportunities presented in both canada and the u s for our industrial matting segment formal approval of the lng canada project and associated coastal gaslink project could continue to provide significant opportunity for the industrial matting segment in late 2019 and subsequent years the coastal gaslink project is progressing with construction activities across northern british columbia by preparing workforce accommodation sites and beginning right of way clearing in preparation for construction in mid to late 2019 despite opposition to lng canada and coastal gaslink the organizations responsible for those pipelines have committed to advancing the projects and maintaining the construction schedule our results continue to demonstrate the opportunity and free cash flow provided by our industrial matting segment the large scale matting project which began in the fourth quarter of 2018 and required a substantial number of mats on the north montney mainline continued through the entire first quarter supporting our strong results for the quarter in 2019 we will look to employ our expertise in deploying matting projects in the u s market with increasing environmental responsibility and regulation throughout north america we expect the overall matting market to increase as we also look to increase our market share our internal estimates place the current market size for matting in north america at over 2 0 billion annually the outlook for the u s equipment rentals business remains consistent with 2018 the business environment remains strong with low corporate tax rates and relatively high west texas intermediate wti pricing in canada however we see challenging times ahead first quarter rig counts were down approximately 32 year over year in canada and the forecast for the remainder of the year places 2019 estimates only marginally ahead of historic lows experienced in 2016 beginning in the first quarter and continuing into the second quarter we moved equipment from canada to regions in the u s experiencing higher demand year to date we have moved approximately 2 5 million net book value of equipment to the u s including the permian basin in west texas we will continue to be opportunistic with our equipment rentals fleet deploying equipment in the u s where possible consistent with our strategy to double our matting fleet to 180 000 units by 2021 we deployed 6 6 million of capital to maintain and increase our fleet in the first quarter of 2019 to date the board of directors has approved 26 0 million of capital spending in 2019 of an expected 30 0 million total capital program on november 26 2018 the company obtained approval

value revenue for the three months ended march 31 2019 of 17 7 million increased 70 compared to 10 5 million during the same period of 2018 increased revenue was primarily due to the timing of

to the same quarter of 2018 which had no large scale matting projects further impacting revenue was an increase in average utilization to 36 from 27 for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the first

increased to 4 1 million compared to 1 6 million during the same period of 2018 the primary driver for the increase in ebit was the increase in ebitda for the first quarter of 2019 compared to the

calculated in accordance with gaap reconciliations of the most directly comparable gaap measures to non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share are provided within the schedules attached to this release we use non gaap measures in our operational and financial decision making believing that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations as a result internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews include adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share additionally we believe that the presentation of non gaap measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates for example our ability to meet capital expenditures and working capital requirements and otherwise meet our obligations as they become due investors are cautioned that non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for gaap disclosures this communication also includes certain forward looking non gaap financial measures we are unable to present without unreasonable efforts a reconciliation of forward looking non gaap financial information to the corresponding gaap financial information because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary information forward looking non gaap financial information is based on numerous assumptions including assumptions with respect to general business economic market regulatory and financial conditions and various other factors all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information non gaap measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to cision many of which present non gaap measures when reporting their results these measures can be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because we believe the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of gaap financial disclosures however non gaap measures have limitations as an analytical tool non gaap measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies they are not presentations made in accordance with gaap are

by excluding depreciation and amortization from ebitda users can compare operating performance without regard to different accounting determinations such as useful life in the case of the other items

useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding the amortization related to acquired intangibles users can compare operating performance without regard to highly variable amortization expenses related to our acquisitions in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess

first quarter 2018 adjusted ebitda decreased 44 year over year operating cash flow of 5 6 million in 1q19 compared to 14 2 million in 1q18 agreed to acquire 100 of viajes falabella with operations in chile colombia peru and argentina and entered into long term strategic alliance with falabella financiero message from ceo commenting on the company s results damian scokin ceo stated we continue to execute on our strategic initiatives making disciplined investment decisions to accelerate growth to that end we recently announced that we reached an agreement to acquire viajes falabella a business with strong focus on packages and operating across our fastest growing markets successful execution of our strategy resulted in a strong first quarter 2019 performance across our key commercial and operational metrics given the challenging macro environment particularly in argentina importantly profitability improved sequentially while posting attractive growth despite tougher comps from last year s record first quarter and on an fx neutral basis we reported year over year increases in gross bookings asps revenues and gross profit we are focused on pursuing organic and inorganic growth and profitability opportunities as competitive dynamics evolve in light of the weakening macro environment unfolding we will not lose focus on our long term growth strategy while in the medium term balancing growth versus profitability we have the right strategy to create long term shareholder value which will become increasingly evident as our business strategy continues gaining traction in the marketplace and macro conditions improve concluded mr scokin operating and financial metrics highlights in millions except as noted 1q19 1q18 chg operating metrics number of transactions 2 7 2 5 5

other five key markets as per management estimates based on gds and oag data during 1q19 transactions increased 5 to 2 7 million from 2 5 million in the year ago quarter while fx neutral gross bookings rose 24 in the period industry gross bookings continued to contract in 1q19 as the company s key markets particularly argentina experienced increasing macro volatility and currency depreciation in this context reported gross bookings declined 6 year on year to 1 157 5 million in 1q19 from 1 231 5 million in 1q18 importantly this performance was better than the high single digit contraction experienced by the travel industry in latin america in the first quarter the company s business is organized into two segments 1 air which consists of the sale of airline tickets and 2 packages hotels and other travel products which consists of travel packages the bundling of two or more products together which can include airline tickets and hotel rooms as well as stand alone sales of accommodations including hotels and vacation rentals car rentals bus tickets cruise tickets travel insurance and destination services the share of higher margin packages hotels and other travel products transactions in 1q19 was 43 of total transactions improving sequentially from the 42 reported in 4q18 but declined from a record high of 46 in 1q18 this metric remains impacted by a contracting market in argentina which still accounts for a significant share of packages hotels and other travel products as mentioned in the company s 4q18 earnings release despegar successfully concluded its summer seasonal proprietary activities tour operations and allotments or cupos in argentina for flights to the south of brazil this initiative ended during the month of march driving over 110 proprietary flights with a load factor of 99 this program provided customers with the option to purchase a full travel experience consisting of a charter flight transportation hotel and activities nps continued to improve increasing 586 basis points yoy in 1q19 driven by ongoing investments in customer service to enhance customer satisfaction a key strategic priority the average selling price asp in 1q19 increased 17 year over year on an fx neutral basis but was down 11 to 436 per transaction as reported this was mainly the result of year on year quarterly average currency devaluation of 54 in argentina one of despegar s key markets which more than offset the successful continued mix shift to higher asp packages in addition the mix shift from domestic to international travel across some key markets supported by a reduction in industry air travel prices in certain markets had a positive impact on asps in the quarter despegar continues to make progress in driving mobile transaction growth with total downloads reaching over 52 million at quarter end during 1q19 the number of transactions via mobile increased 30 year over year with 38 3 of all transactions

transactions reported a year over year increase of 3 in transactions on an fx neutral basis gross bookings rose 20 year over year and asps 16 year over year however as reported gross bookings increased 3 year over year and asps were flat at 446 as continued mix shift from domestic to international travel and mix shift to higher asp packages were offset by the impact from the 16 currency depreciation in the period argentina continued to experience challenging macro conditions with annualized inflation at 55 and the currency in 1q19 posting a 54 year over year depreciation against the u s dollar the company s ability to quickly adjust to changing market dynamics coupled with its leading market position continued to drive market share gains despite reporting an 9 decline in transactions reflecting the overall market contraction on an fx neutral basis gross bookings increased year over year by 34 and asps rose 46 on a reported basis gross bookings and asps in argentina declined year over year by 32 and 26 respectively across the rest of latin america despegar reported increases of 20 in transactions and 12 in gross bookings while asps declined 7 year over year to

company continued to gain market share however as reported revenue decreased 10 to 133 1 million in 1q19 from 148 6 million in the year ago period this was principally due to the 11 year on year decline in asp from the fx translation impact from currency depreciation additionally a reduction in industry prices to adjust for lower purchasing power brought about by the unfavorable macro conditions in argentina was a contributing factor these factors more than offset a positive reversal in mix shift in 1q19 towards international travel versus domestic in some key markets revenue margin declined 57 basis points year on year to 11 5 in 1q19 two key factors contributed to this 1 reductions in customer fees and discounts in package transactions taken place in the second quarter of 2018 to drive further share gains and 2 a reduction in air supplier volume bonuses as a result of lower demand sequentially revenue margin increased 50 basis points due to customer fee increases and lower package discounts during 1q19 in certain markets the improvement is notable as q1 is a seasonally lower the year on year decline in revenue was mainly the result of lower revenues from air and to a lesser extent from packages hotels other travel products segments air segment revenue was 49 7 million in the 1q19 decreasing 18 year over year from 60 9 million in 1q18 transactions increased 11 year on year driving market share gains despite softer overall market growth higher volumes were more than offset by a 27 decline in average revenue per transaction principally driven by the decline in asps resulting from the fx translation impact on domestic transactions lower supplier pricing and the above noted company s strategy of lowering air customer fees in several markets last year to support share gains and drive additional cross selling opportunities this together with a reduction in supplier volume bonuses due to lower demand more than offset a positive mix shift from domestic towards international travel this quarter across some key markets packages hotels other travel products segment revenue declined 5 in 1q19 to 83 4 million from 87 7 million in the year ago quarter transactions declined 1 impacted by the challenging macro environment in argentina while revenue per transaction fell 4 impacted by the fx translation lower air supplier prices and the

revenue was primarily driven by higher installment plan costs mainly reflecting increased interest rates despite a reduction in the availability and duration of installments in argentina to a lesser extent higher fulfillment costs also contributed to higher cost of revenue partially offset by a continued reduction in fraud however fulfillment cost per transaction declined 6 year on year reflecting higher operating leverage these customer oriented initiatives drove a 586 basis point year on year increase in after trip nps on an fx neutral basis gross profit increased 6 to 111 4

year over year to 14 1 financial income expenses in 1q19 the company reported a net financial expense of 5 2 million compared to 2 8 million in 1q18 the increase was primarily due to higher credit card receivable factoring expenses in brazil due to the increase in the discounted amounts and foreign exchange losses given the currency devaluation in argentina and brazil financial expenses were

1q19 compared to cash generation of 14 2 million in 1q18 this usage of cash resulted mainly from a decrease in the company s travel supplier payables resulting from lower year over year sales an increase in other assets and prepaid expense balances and lower net income this was partially offset by a decrease in the credit card receivables balance driven by brazil and argentina reflecting higher factored amounts and lower us gross bookings growth respectively during 1q19 the company s capital expenditures were 7 9 million compared to 6 1 million during the same quarter in the prior

quarter holders of aac insured cofina bonds who did not elect to commute the associated aac policy deposited their bonds into the cofina class 2 trust the trust in exchange for units issued by the trust the trust also received such holders shares of the new cofina bonds and cash amounts paid by cofina aac s obligations under its policy with respect to the aac insured cofina bonds held in the

entities was 15 9 million for the first quarter of 2019 including a gain of 14 9 million on the consolidation of this trust expenses operating expenses for the first quarter of 2019 increased by 3 6 million to 24 9 million from 21 3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 the increase in the first quarter of 2019 was mostly due to higher cyclical compensation costs related to annual equity

bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda rejected an idea gaining traction in some u s circles that governments can spend more aggressively without causing hyper inflation adding that tokyo s economic policies are nowhere close to the concept kuroda said hyper inflation could happen not only under extreme circumstances such as after a war but also due to policy failures as seen in some latin american and asian nations story continues below advertisement remove ad it s wrong to assume there will be no hyper inflation even if you boost fiscal spending recklessly as long as it s financed by the central bank kuroda told japan s parliament on thursday proponents of modern monetary theory mmt say the u s government s monopoly over dollar issuance the printing press gives it power to spend as much as needed to meet the full employment and inflation mandates assigned to the federal reserve taxes may not be needed to support all spending as the government can create more money such as by forcing the central bank to directly underwrite debt they argue some fans of mmt have cited japan as a success case saying tokyo has been able to boost fiscal spending without causing inflation as the central bank keeps the government s borrowing cost ultra low through its massive stimulus programme kuroda said japan was not resorting to mmt as the government commits to getting the country s fiscal house in order japan has deployed economic stimulus policies but the government believes it s important to restore fiscal health and make fiscal policy sustainable kuroda said it s wrong to say japan is resorting to mmt story continues below advertisement remove ad while mmt has yet to gain traction among mainstream japanese politicians some analysts say it could appeal to lawmakers who favour big spending to lure votes prime minister shinzo abe has prioritised measures to boost growth over fiscal austerity slowing progress in reining in japan s public debt which has ballooned to twice the country s gross domestic product critics blame the boj s ultra loose monetary policy for allowing lawmakers to delay painful but much needed spending cuts or tax hikes that would reduce japan s debt pile

revenue growth of 3 4 and earnings per share value earnings per share in line with our guidance range for the second quarter our results through the first half are right where we expected them to be as we ve been discussing with you we planned for revenue growth in the second quarter to be below our full year guidance range this was driven by our expectations for strong underlying core business growth partially offset by a tough flu comparison and timing within the year in pharmaceutical systems there were two additional items that impacted our growth this quarter the market reaction to the fda letter regarding dcbs and timing in the medication delivery solutions business in the us when we factor in these items underlying revenue growth was in line with our expectations year to date in addition we remain pleased with the integration of bard we are on track for our cost and revenue synergy capture targets and we have gained momentum on the investments that we made last year in addition notable progress has been made on it systems integration and in planning for supply chain initiatives we are reaffirming our full fiscal year 2019 currency neutral revenue guidance despite near term pressure to our dcb business our updated eps guidance reflects strong underlying performance partially offset by the headwind to our dcb business as well as additional foreign currency pressure due to broad strengthening of the us dollar looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2019 we have confidence in our planned back half acceleration there are a number of growth drivers across our segments which we will review later in the presentation in addition to easing comparisons i ll now turn things over to chris for a more detailed discussion of our second quarter fiscal performance and our fiscal year 2019 guidance christopher r reidy executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer thanks vince and good morning everyone moving onto slide 7 i ll review our second quarter revenue and eps results as well as the key financial highlights second quarter revenues grew 3 4 on a comparable currency neutral basis as vince mentioned our second quarter performance was broadly in line with our expectations driven by strong underlying core business growth there were two items in the quarter that brought the revenue slightly below our expectations first in our medication delivery solutions business in the us our results reflect the impact of distributor inventory adjustments in our hypodermic business inventory levels are now normalized and we expect strong demand for the remainder of the year second our results this quarter also reflect an impact to our dcb business the fda s mid march update regarding the use of all paclitaxel coated devices has negatively impacted companies that manufacture and sell these products i ll provide more color on revenue growth in the quarter in a moment when i take you through the results by segment and geography adjusted eps of 2 59 grew 7 2 on a currency neutral basis this was in line with our previously communicated expectations for the quarter we also continued to de lever during the second quarter paying down approximately 500 million of debt we remain on track to achieve our commitment to de lever to below 3 times over 3 years moving on to slide 8 i ll review the medical segment revenue growth bd medical s second quarter revenues increased 3 8 revenues in medication delivery solutions or mds grew 1 3 as expected our second quarter results reflect the tough comparison to the prior year in the us the inventory adjustments previously discussed also impacted growth in the quarter however we expect strong demand and growth in this business in the second half of the fiscal year outside the us growth in mds was driven by strength in europe across vascular access management and vascular access devices revenues in medication management solutions or mms grew 7 3 growth in mms was driven by strong performance in infusion and strength in retail dispensing diabetes care revenues grew 4 7 as expected revenue growth rebounded from lower growth in the first quarter with strength in both the us and international businesses aided by timing of orders revenues in pharmaceutical systems grew 3 9 performance in pharm systems reflects the timing of customer ordering patterns which benefited the first quarter and negatively impacted growth in the second quarter as we expected turning to slide 9 and the bd life sciences segment revenues increased 2 7 in the second quarter as expected this growth reflects a headwind of over 200 basis points related to the strength of last year s flu season in comparison to a more typical flu season this year as you are aware the timing and severity of the flu season can impact our year over year comparisons as a result revenues in diagnostic systems declined 1 6 reflecting a headwind of approximately 550 basis points from the tough flu comparison underlying performance was solid and driven by double digit growth in idast and our bd max molecular platform preanalytical systems revenues grew 3 5 growth continues to be aided by recent capacity additions that have improved the supply of push button collection sets as expected partially offsetting this growth was the timing of distributor orders that benefited the strong first quarter biosciences revenues grew 7 9 growth was driven by research reagents our facsymphony and facslyric platforms and strength in emerging markets now turning to slide 10 and the bd interventional segment second quarter revenues increased 3 5 this reflects an unfavorable impact of 170 basis points from the hurricane and dcbs on an underlying basis growth was approximately 5 2 revenues in peripheral intervention or pi grew 3 8 our results this quarter reflect the previously mentioned impact to our dcb business on an underlying basis pi revenues grew approximately 6 driven by strong global growth in end stage renal disease and growth across the entirety of the business in emerging markets i ll provide our updated assumptions for dcb growth over the remainder of the fiscal year later in my remarks second quarter revenue growth in surgery was 1 2 as expected this reflects a tough comparison to the prior year in our hernia business when we released supply for back orders following hurricane maria growth in the surgery unit includes strong performance in biosurgery and infection prevention where we continue to see the benefit from our revenue synergy investments revenues in urology and critical care or ucc grew 6 performance in ucc continues to be driven by products in acute urology as well as continued strength in our home care and targeted temperature management businesses moving on to slide 11 i ll walk you through our geographic revenues for the second quarter us revenues grew 2 2 this is below our normal growth rate and reflects the impact of dcbs and the distributor inventory adjustments within mds in addition this reflects a tough flu comparison as expected moving on to international revenues grew 4 9 this reflects solid performance from all three segments with strength in emerging markets and across the medical segment in europe as previously discussed developed market revenues grew 2 4 driven by solid performance in europe partially offset by lower growth in the us revenues in emerging markets grew 9 2 performance was driven by growth of 11 8 in china which reflects strong performance across all three segments in addition emerging markets benefited from double digit growth in ema turning to slide 12 which recaps the second quarter income statement as discussed revenues grew 3 4 in the quarter on a comparable basis moving down the p l gross profit grew 2 year over year excluding the impact of currency i ll provide additional details on gross profit in just a moment ssg a as a percentage of revenues was 25 9 this reflects additional deferred compensation expense due to stock market performance in the quarter for your reference deferred compensation expense is fully offset in other income expense ssg a was also impacted by unfavorable timing from the harmonization of bard s compensation and benefit plans as expected on an underlying basis expenses are growing slower than sales and reflect our ongoing focus on disciplined spending and the achievement of bard cost synergies r d as a percentage of revenue was 5 8 which reflects our continued commitment to invest in innovation as a result operating margins decreased 150 basis points or 50 basis points on a currency neutral basis which was in line with our expectations our tax rate was 16 in the quarter which was also in line with our expectations at the high end of our full year guidance range as expected we paid preferred dividends of 38 million in the quarter as we have been discussing the preferred shares are not included in the shares outstanding calculation in the quarter adjusted earnings per share were 2 59 which is a decline of 2 2 3 versus the prior year or an increase of 7 2 on a currency neutral basis now turning to slide 13 and our gross profit and operating margins for the second quarter gross profit margin was 55 3 in the quarter on a performance basis gross profit margin was flat year over year in line with our expectations this reflects margin improvement driven by our continuous improvement initiatives and cost synergies offset by unfavorable mix driven by lower flu and dcb revenues as well as headwinds from raw materials and pricing currency had a negative impact of 90 basis points on gross profit margin which was greater than anticipated due to the broad strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies operating margin declined 150 basis points in the quarter or 50 basis points on a currency neutral basis the decrease in operating margin was driven by increased ssg a in the quarter as previously discussed moving on to slide 15 and our full fiscal year 2019 revenue guidance as we discussed our underlying performance is strong through the first half we are right where we expected to be looking to the second half of the fiscal year beyond these in comparisons such as the flu there are a number of drivers across our segments that give us confidence in our planned acceleration within the medical segment these include continued momentum in share gain in mms and revenue synergy capture in mds driven by our leading vascular access portfolio in life sciences we expect continued strong growth in bd max and ds and the timing of instrument sales and reagents to benefit growth in bdb within bd interventional we recently launched several new products as the inaudible wavelinq covera and venovo which are performing as anticipated and are being well received in the market and we anticipate several more product launches across bdi in the second half we also expect continued double digit growth in china in the second half of the year while we now expect revenue growth of 4 5 to 5 5 for the bd interventional segment due to anticipated dcb headwinds we have reaffirmed our total company revenue growth guidance of 5 to 6 our updated guidance reflects a reduction in dcb sales of approximately 50 over the remainder of the year we continue to expect bd medical revenue growth of 5 to 6 and bd life sciences growth of 4 to 5 we also continue to anticipate developed market growth of 4 to 5 and growth of about 10 in emerging markets driven by a diversified base with low double digit growth in china and strength in ema and latin america now moving on to slide 16 and our full fiscal year 2019 eps guidance our eps guidance reflects our expectation for continued strong underlying performance driven by revenue growth and solid operating performance partially offset by near term headwinds on a currency neutral basis we expect adjusted eps growth of about 12 this reflects a headwind of approximately 150 basis points related to dcbs based on current rates we expect currency will result in additional headwind of approximately 200 basis points this is driven by a broad strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies our current forecast reflects a euro to dollar exchange rate of 1 12 versus our original expectation of 1 16 in addition our updated forecast also reflects incremental pressure attributable to profit and inventory all in we expect to deliver adjusted eps of 11 65 to 11 75 now before we move on i d like to take a moment to walk you through the additional information we have provided on slide 16 this quarter in response to the questions we ve received this fiscal year we thought it was prudent to provide investors with a snapshot of our ability to offset headwinds to the business this year the magnitude of the headwinds we are facing a significantly greater than the headwinds we have encountered in recent years the total headwinds this year amount to approximately 400 million we have the ability to offset approximately 150 million this year which is 50 more than we have offset in each of the past few years to summarize this chart demonstrates that our core is strong the integration of the bard deal is very much on track and together we have an even greater ability to offset headwinds by driving robust operating performance turning to slide 17 we have also updated our detailed p l guidance to reflect the headwinds from dcbs and fx we now expect reported revenue growth of 8 to 9 as a result of approximately 50 basis points of incremental fx pressure gross margins are expected to be between 56 and 57 and operating margins between 25 and 26 our margin guidance is approximately 50 basis points lower than our previous guidance as a result of both dcb and fx headwinds we expect operating cash flow to be approximately 4 1 billion the balance of our guidance expectations for the full fiscal year 2019 remain unchanged in addition we continue to expect to achieve approximately 100 million in cost synergies in fiscal year 2019 we are on track to fully realizing 300 million in annualized cost synergies over the 3 year deal period we feel good about the momentum we have across our businesses while we are facing some near term headwinds we are confident that we ll deliver on our commitments in fiscal year 2019 and beyond now i d like to turn the call back over to vince who will provide you with an update on our product portfolio vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer thank you chris turning to slide 19 and our planned product launches by segment as you can see by this slide we continue to have a rich pipeline there are a number of things we continue to be excited about i ll touch on just a few of the recent launches here starting with the bd medical segment we are excited about the consistent cadence of innovation within bd medical and are seeing strong uptake from recent launches notably adoption of our new alaris m2 pump is aiding the strong growth in infusion also the recent additions of our healthsight platform have continued to gain great interest and positive feedback from customers another good example is in our diabetes care business where we are seeing good uptake of our new best in class pen needle nano pro within bd within mds we also launched two new products during the second quarter that strengthen our vascular access product family the powerglide cue and bd provena picc regarding the type 2 insulin patch pump we recently received feedback from the fda in our 510 k submission we are in the process of evaluating and responding to the agency s feedback which was more comprehensive than we expected given the fda s comments we re considering a variety of options and strategies but do expect a launch delay we plan to provide you with an update on our august conference call in the bd life sciences segment we recently launched the bd facsduet a new automated flow cytometry sample preparation instrument with ced ivd certification the bd facsduet system raises the bar on flow cytometry automation offering a fully integrated sample to answer solution with the bd facslyric clinical flow cytometer this is a new fully automated sample preparation instrument enables clinical laboratories to improve their efficiency by reducing errors and limiting the manual user interactions required to run assays on the bd facslyric we also started shipping the new 12 color facslyric further enhancing the capabilities of this platform in the bd interventional segment we received 510 k clearance from the fda for the bd wavelinq 4 french endovascular av fistula system we are excited to add the 4f system to our portfolio of technologies that create restore and or maintain av access for patients on haemodialysis with its slim profile the 4f system increases the fistula location options by enabling risk access points to be created this provides increased procedural flexibility for clinicians while reducing the risk of scarring or arm disfigurement for patients compared to open surgical av fistula creation we also received approval from the fda for the venovo venous stent which is the first venous stent indicated to treat obstructed or narrowed blood flow specific to the iliac and femoral veins located near the groin most importantly it is engineered to address the special challenges of venous lesions that are very different than those posed by arterial narrowing as you can see we have a very rich pipeline of new products across our businesses and we look forward to sharing additional updates with you along the way before i move on i would like to remind you that we have again included a slide in the appendix of today s presentation that provides an update on our sustainability initiatives we hope you find this information useful in understanding bd s commitment to these important initiatives moving to slide 20 i would like to reiterate the key messages from our presentation today solid revenue and eps growth this quarter was driven by strong underlying growth in our core across our businesses and regions through the first half our results are right where we expected them to be the integration of bard is on track and we are confident in our ability to achieve our cost and revenue synergy commitments looking forward to the remainder of fiscal year 2019 there are a number of drivers across our segments that give us confidence in our planned back half acceleration in summary we are confident that our strategy is working our core remains strong and we have a significant opportunity to continue to deliver even more impactful comprehensive solutions for our customers and their patients around the world so thank you we will now open the call to questions questions and answers operator the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question is coming from david lewis with morgan stanley david lewis morgan stanley analyst good morning thanks for taking the questions just two from me one on revenue and one on currency just starting with revenue here for a second our sense is the dcb update probably reflects a 50 reduction in that business in the back half and i just guess the question is is that worst than the existing trend or how risk adjusted is that for the june panel and just given the quarter and dcb within that 5 to 6 range should we be thinking toward the lower half of that range and then i have a quick follow up christopher r reidy executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer yes david this is chris you got that right 50 is what we re projecting for the remainder of the year and that is in fact what we re seeing through the month of april and late march so we re calling it as continuing along those lines obviously we ll see what happens when the fda talks at the end of june but right now we re calling it as we re experiencing it what we are also assuming is that btk while we continue to talk to the fda about btk but we would expect that launch to be in the next fiscal year as well so it s a combination of those two impacts and when you take that impact against our original guidance range of 5 to 6 it does bring us down to the low end of the guidance range operator your next question is from kristen stewart with barclays kristen stewart barclays analyst hi thanks for taking my question vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer hi kristen and happy birthday kristen stewart barclays analyst thanks very much i won t make you guys sing or anything christopher r reidy executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer we ll do that later kristen kristen stewart barclays analyst that sounds good just in terms of chris you had mentioned the ability to kind of offset some of this what are some of the actions that you have generally taken year to year as you think about kind of offsetting some of these headwinds there s obviously concerns out there just with next year with the gore royalties coming off and then some questions i guess on how to think about dcbs going forward with btk maybe being a potential offset i guess mixture to a degree helping the trend if we get approval just how should we just think about this flexibility that you have and the levers that you can pull christopher r reidy executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer sure so i m going to start just to put things in perspective then i ll turn it over to tom as we showed on the waterfall chart we re driving 19 to 20 underlying growth and that clearly 3 of that comes from the year over year tax rate but we re driving 16 to 17 growth as well and we ve been able to do that kind of growth in the past and so that i would point you to the fact that 12 fx and growth despite the 400 million of pressure that i m talking about is evidence of our ability to still drive good strong fx end growth despite that kind of pressure and so tom is going to talk a little bit about the kinds of things we did to get there thomas polen president and chief operating officer sure on so hi kristen and again happy birthday as we think about in fy 19 i d say all the businesses are very tightly managing expenses so if you look at our underlying ssg a growth we re 3 or less year to date in the core businesses that reflects that level of discipline that we re driving across the organization and of course as we planned for 20 and we re deep into planning there of course we re way ahead of where we normally would be given the situation with the gore royalty i d say again very very disciplined expense management across the board both g a and obviously the selling and marketing as well as continued management of our r d lines we continue to drive a number of efficiency programs across all of those organizations where appropriate moving for example sustained engineering to lower cost locations where we can be doing that that s a trend that we ve been accelerating actually within the bard organization substantial progress this year and when it comes to paclitaxel specifically of course and we can comment on this later through simon but of course as we dig further in all we see is becoming more and more confident in our data on paclitaxel that we do not have we re very very confident in the safety of lutonix and again we can comment on that further later on so we re looking forward to the fda discussion in june we re not doing any restructuring of that organization at this point in time we re going to be hiring for the launch of btk and so one thing that we ll be monitoring very closely is how we come out of the fda session and then making a decision after that and as was mentioned before we are still in active discussions with the fda on the btk product it s a very unique new solution in the marketplace there are no valid treatment options other than amputation for patients suffering with below the knee blockages and so right we are still hopeful that while that won t occur in fy 19 that it will occur later on and we ll get a better sense of that we think after the june meeting as well too so more to come we re planning behind the scenes but we think it s prudent to see where that evolves too vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer so kristen you can get a strong sense there we re doing everything we can as chris said to offset those headwinds we re being prudent around the dcb situation and then 2020 is a whole different work stream in line with what we have been communicating all along in terms of how we will offset that we re making good progress in all of these things we ll see how the dcb situation comes out one thing that i would add is that we have done we ve taken our data to a third party and have them take a look and actually do the analysis for us we re feeling very good about those results and the safety results that they show and simon and his team are looking to get that published so we look forward to getting our data out there so thanks for the question operator your next question is from larry biegelsen with wells fargo larry biegelsen wells fargo securities analyst good morning thanks for taking the question one on fx and then one on the p l guidance so starting with fx i think initially it was a 2 top line hit was about a 3 5 eps impact from currency and now i think it s 2 5 at the top line but the 5 5 eps hit so could you just help us understand why it seems like the ratio from the top line hit to the eps hit is greater now and i ll ask my second question on the p l guidance right now chris can you help us bridge kind of from the first half operating margin of about 24 to the implied second half operating margin of about 27 hopefully i m doing the math right at the midpoint there thanks for taking the questions guys christopher r reidy executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer great larry two good questions so let me step back on fx a little bit and as you pointed out we had estimated about a 3 5 eps impact or about 0 40 thereabouts our new guidance is 5 5 and we have certainly seen since november a broad strengthening of the us dollar against the euro but also more directly against all other currencies around the world through the first half we are already experiencing the 0 40 or 3 5 of fx pressure and q2 was slightly worse than we had expected we had thought it would be 0 20 to 0 22 and we saw a 0 25 as far as the remainder of the year goes we had expected fx pressure in q3 but we are now expecting that to be worse than anticipated as the dollar continues to strengthen and as we looked at q4 we had originally thought that that turned around and offset the impact of q3 to essentially be neutral in the second half that doesn t look like it s going to happen now as the dollar continues to strengthen and the q4 is neutral but certainly not an offset to q3 so when you put all that together it drops about 0 20 more in the third quarter and then the fourth quarter would be relatively flat and some of what s making that happen as well as the profit and inventory that as the dollar continues to strengthen that come back from profit and inventory that we expected in the fourth quarter is lessened and so that s what makes the fourth quarter neutral one thing to consider in terms of the drop through is as we ve seen in past years when the pressure comes from currencies other than euro and of the 0 60 pressure that we re seeing this year only 0 15 of that is from the euro so the rest is all other currencies when the pressure comes from other currencies the drop through tends to be greater than it was in prior years so that s the story on fx in terms of your other question in terms of the way to think about margin from where we are the first half margin is as you said about 24 we re guiding 25 to 26 which implies about a 27 second half and a number of things go into that very much consistent with what we said on the call last quarter fx does abate in q4 as we annualize headwinds the cost synergies that we have ramped in the second half particularly on a year over year basis we also have additional ssg a leverage on higher second half sales and we feel very good about the acceleration of revenues in the second half that generate that as we went through in the script so we feel real good about our ability to get to that 25 to 26 operating margin improvement despite the headwinds operator your next question is from the line of bob hopkins with bank of america bob hopkins bank of america analyst hi good morning and thank you for taking the question so just i wanted to start out maybe with a little bit of a longer term question and on the upcoming paclitaxel panel if we just hypothetically say that doesn t go well are you guys still comfortable that that 5 to 6 that you ve talked about is still doable even if paclitaxel panel goes poorly and you have to kind of really draw down your thoughts on what the below the knee opportunity might look like vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer so we think that by the time the panel meets there is not much time for the substantial impact in this year and so if it doesn t go well then we would have to take a look at this business and look at the expense structure and how we would manage that we actually believe that the industry from talking to other companies that all of us have good data as i mentioned we want to get ours out there and published so we re actually looking forward to that june meeting we wish it was coming sooner simon anything else you would add to that simon campion executive vice president and president of the interventional segment no just once more as vince said we have reaffirmed the safety profile of our product with an independent group of physicians involved all the interventions that would use our product and oncologists and we said we do that back in the q1 earnings call we ve done that we ve reaffirmed it and we re going through the publication process the other thing to note while dcb is undoubtedly a headwind for us there are many other many other legs to the peripheral intervention stool and indeed the bdi stool that can help mitigate some of those headwinds so as we break down our business we can see a good growth in the other segments on a global basis the other parts of pi on a global basis so dcb is very important but it s not the only positive story that we have to express as we serve patients globally operator our next question is from the line of robbie marcus with jpmorgan vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer hello robbie robbie marcus jpmorgan analyst thanks for taking the question good morning maybe just a follow up on kristen s question a little bit i think a lot of us are sitting here looking at some of the headwinds some of them going into fiscal 20 some of them not i know it s still pretty early in the year and we won t get full 20 guidance here but maybe if you could just help us think about three times 13 eps growth going into fiscal 20 is that still something that s achievable inaudible puts and takes you could help with that with early in the year here with all the headwinds thanks vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer sure robbie so you re right we re not going to give guidance for 2020 this early in the year but i would say that the deal model is very intact obviously we have to keep our eye on the dcbs and the impact next year but we still have strong performance and momentum across the business and continued synergy capture and so everything we talked about and offsetting the gore royalty clearly is still in place now the gore royalty as is clear is running a little harder than the original deal model and so that s something we re clearly working toward to getting too so as we look at the as we look at these significant headwinds that we have in the short term clearly there is some like you wouldn t expect the kind of pressure we are getting in fx if the fx if the dollar stays right where it is there would be about a push next year so no 5 5 kind of headwinds and so that is great and obviously the divestiture was a one time item and you wouldn t have that again flu kind of normalizes we had a normal flu season this year we would plan for a normal flu season so you don t have that headwind going forward resins we had a spike in resins just before we gave guidance last year that s gotten slightly favorable and it s kind of held right there so we ll have to watch that oil prices are going up but seems like the pricing there has more to do with supply right now than oil prices as it had in the past so we ll certainly watch that but no indication that there is additional pressures there and your guess is as good as mine on tariffs and so we ll see we ll do everything we can to offset tariffs and do what we can to move sources et cetera but that remains to be seen whether that s a headwind going forward or not so it s clearly an indication that the level of headwinds that we had this year tend to abate and so we ll address more of that going forward as we go throughout the year operator your next question is from the line of brian weinstein with william blair brian weinstein william blair analyst hey guys thanks for taking the question just wanted to talk about the dcb reduction here the 57 million it seems like the eps impact is greater than what we would have expected there can you talk about the margins on that business and am i right to think that nearly 100 of that is falling through the bottom line and if so why would that be thanks vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer well first the margins in that business are very high it s a very attractive product line one two we re continuing to manufacture the product and so but of course and significantly lower volume so then we have the variances that go along with that and chris can give you more detail christopher r reidy executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer yeah so it s clearly not 100 but they re really good margins and we don t like for competitive reasons to give the specifics but it s very strong i think what you might be missing in your model is our assumption on below the knee so you re right about the 57 million at strong margins but then you got below the knee coming out of our numbers as well which certainly has an impact of about 20 million to revenue or thereabouts so that would get you in the ballpark vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer thanks for the question brian operator and our next question is from the line of vijay kumar evercore isi vijay kumar evercore isi analyst hey guys vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer good morning vijay vijay kumar evercore isi analyst thanks for taking the question and good morning vince so just a couple of them on guidance rolled into one question when you think about the back half step up it looks like a couple of 100 basis points on the revenues i just want to make sure that step up in the back half there s nothing changed versus three months ago and then we know it looks like it s a first in class product right maybe some color on what it means and then a follow up on margins gross margin is down sequentially is this all fx or maybe just some comments on what happened on gross margins thank you christopher r reidy executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer sure so a couple of comments in there so first of all on the confidence on the second half revenue it is exactly as we called it last quarter as well and the things that go in there are the tough flu comp in the first half so if you look at life sciences year to date is 3 7 clearly we re calling it much higher than that in the second half and so you ve got that benefit sticking in life sciences you ve got the ema tender timing and biosciences that we talked about we continue to see strong performance in bd max so we re very confident on that acceleration on bdi you mentioned venovo we also have the 4 french wavelinq you saw that we got approval for 4 french so we have that and covera and as i mentioned in my prepared remarks a number of other product launches in the second half and then moving to surgery within interventional we have progel back and that s accelerating nicely so and surgery essentially won t have the impact of the hurricane that we were fighting in the first half of this year so that returns to normal and then on the medical side we mentioned that we expect mds to accelerate based on the strong hypo demand that we re seeing and that was a supply issue in the past and so that s writing itself and so we expect strong demand there and then mms as you see the performance at mms we continue to see that performing well in the second half of the year don t forget revenue synergies also build the timing is we haven t seen too much revenue synergy in the first half we ve seen some but we have strong confidence in seeing that build in the second half so we re very very confident on the revenue build in second half and so when you think about it we re about 4 3 year to date which is about where we expect it to be for the first half of the year even though q2 is a little lighter we were actually a little bit better in q1 as you might remember and so the back half of the year implies kind of a 5 5 to 6 growth which we feel very very comfortable with in terms of your comment on margins most of that is the fx impact and so that s what s driving that on an underlying basis fx and the margin was right where we expected to be the bigger driver of that is ssg a as you can see was a little bit harder in the second quarter that s just a timing issue when you normalize for the integration of bard so bard wasn t in the first quarter so you saw a big first quarter last year so in the first quarter you saw a big change in the second quarter that comes back in what you see happening is things like comp and benefit plans you re taking two companies that are on different year end fiscal year ends and normalizing that so you re getting some hits in the second quarter that normalize over the course of the year those benefit plans aren t incremental there they are the same as they were it s just out of quarter the best indication of that is something that tom mentioned is that for the first half of the year on a comparable basis ssg a is running about 2 9 that s about where we expected to be for the year which is showing that we are able to drive down costs through synergies and continuous improvement so we feel good about the gross margin and that will improve through the second half of about 57 on average to get us to the 56 to 57 guidance range we mentioned operator our next question is from larry keusch with raymond james larry keusch raymond james analyst thanks good morning i was just hoping that you guys could talk a little bit about the pump market obviously competition is certainly set to increase over the next 12 months or so so just wanted to get a sense for sort of what you re seeing out there in the market thoughts around your market share gains and what really is the differentiator that you think that you have for the alaris system at this point as the competitors come in vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer so tom is going to kick that off and then we ll go from there thomas polen president and chief operating officer hey larry this is tom and i ll make a couple of comments and then turn it over to alberto for anything further there so we feel really good about our position in infusion pumps of course another great quarter from mms here and certainly very strong year to date performance customers continue we continue to gain share in that 1 to 2 points we re on that exact same trajectory this year as we have been for the last several years and certainly the power of the system is not just in the pump itself obviously the integration of the lvp the syringe the pca the interoperability we re at over 400 interoperable sites which is multiples higher than i think all the rest of the market combined and now the power of healthsight in particular as well where we re leveraging data across not just the infusion platform but across dispensing and our other solutions around compounding and inventory management to help provide outcomes for the customer leveraging that data to do things such as reducing inventory costs or preventing diversion of drugs improving patient safety and those are things that we alone are uniquely positioned to provide because of the breadth of our portfolio and we see a lot of excitement from customers there the majority of our deals north of 50 of our deals when we close them today are not just pump deals they re deals that include multiple elements of our portfolio and again that s quite unique to us and not something that those who are in this space can offer so alberto anything else to add to that alberto mas executive vice president and president of the medical segment no i think you summarized it well so we continue to develop our core platforms nicely and pyxis side adding for example pyxis logistics iv prep so we continue to invest in our core platforms and the interoperability on the alaris is really a significant differentiator for us and then the wraparound for really the integration of our core platforms to provide really unique analytics for our customers is really that where we re seeing the big winners we do obviously have visibility into the future and some of these upcoming contracts and we feel very confident that we ll continue that category share gain consistent to what we ve always said and that tom as highlighted operator our next question is from the line of rick wise with stifel rick wise stifel analyst good morning everybody vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer good morning rick wise stifel analyst two quick questions maybe vince at a high level your emerging market business continues to do well you called out china specifically maybe talk to us about how sustainable it is given the trade issues economic uncertainties the back and forth and just more specifically on the type 2 diabetes pump delay because of complex feedback and you re reflecting on options does this diminish your confidence in the product to make it to the market the next year or so how quickly would you hope to work it through and make a go no go kind of decision thanks so much vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer right so let me start out on emerging markets and thanks for the questions rick so you re right we saw very strong performance in china good performance in asia good performance around ema as well too so we re actually confident that we re going to continue to see that i would tell you my experience with the china team is that the trade situation is being kept very separate from what s happening in our business and it just remains so important to china to continue to develop that healthcare system it s foundational to their strategy and the stability of course that they re always seeking so we are seeing strong performance across all three of our business segments and as we look forward we continue to see that one of the reasons why is that the funding of the chinese healthcare system is actually improving over time and most people don t know and understand that but our team walked us through that about a month ago or so so we re feeling very good on that side on the diabetes pump we did get the feedback from the fda and we re in a situation where we re really assessing the options that we have the technical pathways that we have in responding to them some can be simple some can be longer term and so that s why we said hey listen we ve got to call that out for you we ve got to do that work before we can assess exactly where we end up in terms of launch date with that and so that s where we stand and that s why we think it s going to take us another quarter or so to really understand how those potential solutions play out tom is there anything else you want to add to that thomas polen president and chief operating officer no i think you did very well vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer okay so that s where we stand and we ll talk to you later in the summer about it operator your next question is from the line of dan leonard with deutsche bank dan leonard deutsche bank analyst thank you so first question on slide 16 appreciate all the heavy lifting to offset the headwinds but can you clarify have you taken incremental actions to offset the incremental worsening foreign currency in dcb troubles that s my first question and then my second just a housekeeping did you quantify the distributor inventory adjustments in medical delivery and if not is it possible to quantify those thank you christopher r reidy executive vice president chief financial officer and chief administrative officer so this is chris on the first question what i would say is the incremental fx impact we are already driving 19 to 20 underlying growth and we re not going to offset fx by cutting into muscle at that point and that was the point of saying we re already driving 150 million of offsets as it relates to dcb we re not assuming any offsets at this point as we talked about but if things went negatively which we don t expect in june but if they did we would clearly take actions to offset the impact of that so the actions that we re talking about are things like sales comp incentives or whatever and we re not going to take short term action to hurt the sales force that we need when things come back but if things got materially worse after june we certainly would look at that and manufacturing et cetera thomas polen president and chief operating officer and maybe dan this is tom just to add to chris s comments i would say so as you heard from vince and chris of course our core business is very much on track is on budget for the year across the board with that said we have taken above budget actions to manage expenses so we have done things such as there are hiring freezes on non manufacturing non sales related roles we have launched initiatives to more aggressively manage particularly indirect spend as an example right and so every one of the businesses and parts of the organization are driving expense initiatives to reduce expenses below budget and we are implementing those very actively i would say so again that s driving that base 19 20 number that you heard chris talk about operator your next question is from rich newitter with seb leerink rich newitter seb leerink analyst hi this is jaime on for rich i was just wondering if we could go back to kind of the bard cost synergies any additional progress that you guys made in the second quarter and how we should be thinking about some of the things that you ve highlighted in the past around the surgery sales force expansion as well as geographic expansion in the back half contributing and then just the second part of that question relative to the deal model is it still fair to assume that if upside were to materialize that would primarily be from the revenue synergies thanks for taking my question vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer okay so there is a bunch in there let me start with the cost synergies so we re right on track with the cost synergies as we said the most recent achievements we pointed to are kind of in the it infrastructure space as well as in the supply chain and so some of those things are like moving data centers and collapsing data centers and moving off of older it systems like mfg pro and beginning to move those kinds of items we did close down the murray hill office including the data center and moved it out so those are the kind of synergies that you start achieving this is on top of last year s achievements which included duplicate public company costs and some of the procurement savings as we look out into 2020 we would be looking at more of the operational kind of synergies like plants and distribution centers and that kind of thing so we re right on track where we expected to be from a cost standpoint the same is true on the revenue synergies as we said we invested to get some revenue synergies and i ll pass it over to simon to talk a little bit about the surgery component of that simon campion executive vice president and president of the interventional segment yeah good morning it s simon here so i think we mentioned again last time on the biosurgery and infection prevention sales organization within europe we invested heavily there and that sales force is performing as expected and actually above our plan now we did something similar in the us where we combined the same two sales forces and we re getting good leverage and between the legacy bard biosurgery sales force and the legacy bd infection prevention sales force the other point i think is important to note here is that the investment profile and the investment agenda that bard had set forth has been fully supported by bd example of that is acquisition of tva medical to fill out our end stage renal disease portfolio and that acquisition has gone to plan as chris noted earlier we got fda clearance for the 4 french we ve rolled that out and the progress in that business continues to be very good and then on a global basis across all three businesses we continue to do very well particularly in the emerging markets in china so overall all the investment plans are on track and the investment agenda that we set forth has been fulfilled by bd operator your next question is from matthew mishan with keybanc matthew mishan keybanc capital markets analyst great thank you for taking the questions i m going to ask my first one and then i m going to have a follow up on the surgery side in interventional you guys talked about a tough comp especially in hernia but maybe talk a little bit about the biosurgery piece of that you d have a you probably have a very easy comp around the progel ramp and i m also just curious about the performance of the hemostat arista powder where there is increasing competition simon campion executive vice president and president of the interventional segment hi simon again indeed yeah progel we reintroduced back to the market i think it was in the october november timeframe and we re really pleased with how that has performed we are i would say we re slightly ahead of where we thought we would be with that as you rightly mentioned we have seen increased competition on the hemostat side and the evaluations have certainly eaten in a little bit into our business there but i think from a clinical perspective we feel really comfortable with where we stand with the performance of arista versus some of the competitors that have entered the market so i think while there s some short term pain as their products are evaluated a lot of institutions and the clinicians have come back around to arista and then the final point i d like to make about that business is as you may have seen we have received approval for inaudible chloraprep which further differentiates us in the infection prevention business and we are getting ready to roll that out over the summer months and we ve seen great growth on that in the past two quarters we expect that profile to continue as we roll out a further differentiated product in that category matthew mishan keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then on to this continued strength that you re expecting in mms you re running up against some very serious back half comps i m just trying to understand how much visibility you have there to new placements or maybe there is a lag from the increase in placements to the benefit you re going to get on the consumables part of that business vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer go ahead alberto alberto mas executive vice president and president of the medical segment okay so yes we do obviously have visibility of some of the contracts that are coming up there s two variables used contracts and then installation or placement timing and we have a sense for the placement can sometimes change because it s not depending on us and we had to accommodate the customer as well but we feel fairly more than confident that we re going to see the same similar type of trajectory in the second half than in the first half so we re and the dynamics as tom mentioned and i mentioned before are basically the same because we re not trying to compete like with like but more a comprehensive approach to our portfolio and putting in front place some of the differentiators such as interoperability and some other the healthsight analytics and so on matthew mishan keybanc capital markets analyst great thanks alberto operator and there are no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the floor back over to vince forlenza for closing remarks vincent a forlenza chairman and chief executive officer well thanks to all of you for joining us today on the call let me make a couple of remarks here our performance year to date with some puts and takes is right in line with our expectations we expect a strong back half and have confidence we will deliver it consistent with our proven track record and historical performance even in the phase of significant headwinds we continue to weather the storm our core remains strong the deal model is tracking in line with our plan yes we have to handle dcbs and we will do that and together bd and bard have the ability to deliver robust operating performance so having said all that we look forward to updating you again next time thanks very much operator thank you this does conclude today s teleconference please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day duration 65 minutes call participants monique dolecki senior vice president of investor relations vincent a forlenza

a supplement to our financial statements based on us generally accepted accounting principles gaap non gaap financial information is provided to enhance the reader s understanding of our financial performance but none of these non gaap financial measures are recognized terms under gaap and non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap reconciliations of the most directly comparable gaap measures to non gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share are provided within the schedules attached to this release we use non gaap measures in our operational and financial decision making believing that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations as a result internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews include adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share additionally we believe that the presentation of non gaap measures provides information that is useful to investors as it indicates for example our ability to meet capital expenditures and working capital requirements and otherwise meet our obligations as they become due investors are cautioned that non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for gaap disclosures this communication also includes certain forward looking non gaap financial measures we are unable to present without unreasonable efforts a reconciliation of forward looking non gaap financial information to the corresponding gaap financial information because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary information forward looking non gaap financial information is based on numerous assumptions including assumptions with respect to general business economic market regulatory and financial conditions and various other factors all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control accordingly investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on this information non gaap measures are frequently used by securities analysts investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of companies comparable to cision many of which present non gaap measures when reporting their results these measures can be useful in evaluating our performance against our peer companies because we believe the measures provide users with valuable insight into key components of gaap financial disclosures however non gaap measures have limitations as an analytical tool non gaap measures are not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies they are not presentations made in accordance with gaap are not measures of financial condition or liquidity and should not be considered as an alternative to profit or loss for the period determined in accordance with gaap or operating cash flows determined in accordance with gaap as a result you should not consider such performance measures in isolation from or as a substitute analysis for results of operations as determined in accordance with gaap

losses related to divested businesses or assets sponsor fees and expenses and unrealized translation losses gains all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to adjusted ebitda are either non cash items or are items that we consider to be less useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding depreciation and amortization from ebitda users can compare operating performance without regard to different accounting determinations such as useful life in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 3

businesses or assets stock based compensation deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting amortization related to acquired intangibles non recurring interest and losses on extinguishment of debt sponsor fees and expenses and unrealized translation losses gains which together sum to adjusted net income loss before income taxes adjusted net income loss before income taxes is then taxed at an assumed long term corporate tax rate of 26 all of the items included in the reconciliation from net income to adjusted net income are either non cash items or are items that we consider to be less useful in assessing our operating performance in the case of the non cash items we believe that investors can better assess our operating performance if the measures are presented without such items because unlike cash expenses these adjustments do not affect our ability to generate free cash flow or invest in our business for example by excluding the amortization related to acquired intangibles users can compare operating performance without regard to highly variable amortization expenses related to our acquisitions in the case of the other items we believe that investors can better assess operating performance if the measures are presented without these items because their financial impact does not reflect ongoing operating performance 4 cision defines adjusted net income per diluted share as adjusted net income as defined above divided by the fully diluted pro forma weighted average shares outstanding for the period for purposes of calculating the number of fully diluted shares outstanding we have excluded the potential impact of dilution from outstanding warrants to purchase shares of our common stock prior to the dates of their conversion and stock options and restricted

arcelormittal chairman and ceo said our first quarter results reflect the challenging operating environment the industry has faced in recent months profitability has been impacted by lower steel pricing due to weaker economic activity and continued global overcapacity as well as rising raw material costs as a result of supply side developments in brazil we continue to face a challenge from high levels of imports particularly in europe where safeguard measures introduced by the european commission have not been fully effective although we are somewhat encouraged by the firmer price environment in china this is not being reflected in europe where in order to adapt to the current market environment we have recently announced annualized production cuts of three million tonnes in our flat steel operations it is important there is a level playing field to address unfair competition and this includes a green border adjustment to ensure that imports into europe face the same carbon costs as producers in europe we remain focussed on our own initiatives to improve performance through delivery of our action2020 plan generating positive free cash flow demonstrating progress

prijedor arcelormittal prijedor has had to take the difficult decision to reduce iron ore production from 1 5 to 1 million tonnes at its omarska mine in order to protect the maximum possible number of jobs for the longer term arcelormittal prijedor s sole customer arcelormittal zenica is consequently reducing its consumption of iron ore from omarska and will instead import additional iron ore from outside bosnia and herzegovina by lowering production to one million tonnes a year the effective life of the omarska mine will be extended by up to 10 years without taking these measures the mine would have to close in 2025 the new plan is expected to commence from september 1 2019 we deeply regret that these essential measures will unavoidably lead to the loss of 300 jobs at arcelormittal prijedor this is significant proportion of the approximately 800 people currently employed by arcelormittal prijedor but we have been forced to take this difficult decision due to the lack of

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by leika kihara tokyo reuters bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda rejected an idea gaining traction in some u s circles that governments can spend more aggressively without causing hyper inflation adding that tokyo s economic policies are nowhere close to the concept kuroda said hyper inflation could happen not only under extreme circumstances such as after a war but also due to policy failures as seen in some latin american and asian nations related stories it s wrong to assume there will be no hyper inflation even if you boost fiscal spending recklessly as long as it s financed by the central bank kuroda told japan s parliament on thursday proponents of modern monetary theory mmt say the u s government s monopoly over dollar issuance the printing press gives it power to spend as much as needed to meet the full employment and inflation mandates assigned to the federal reserve taxes may not be needed to support all spending as the government can create more money such as by forcing the central bank to directly underwrite debt they argue some fans of mmt have cited japan as a success case saying tokyo has been able to boost fiscal spending without causing inflation as the central bank keeps the government s borrowing cost ultra low through its massive stimulus program kuroda said japan was not resorting to mmt as the government commits to getting the country s fiscal house in order japan has deployed economic stimulus policies but the government believes it s important to restore fiscal health and make fiscal policy sustainable kuroda said it s wrong to say japan is resorting to mmt while mmt has yet to gain traction among mainstream japanese politicians some analysts say it could appeal to lawmakers who favor big spending to lure votes prime minister shinzo abe has prioritized measures to boost growth over fiscal austerity slowing progress in reining in japan s public debt which has ballooned to twice the country s gross domestic product critics blame the boj s ultra loose monetary policy for allowing lawmakers to delay painful but much needed spending cuts or tax hikes that would reduce japan s debt pile reporting by leika kihara editing by richard borsuk

trustworthiness and keeps its promises and this has never changed gao added we hope the u s can meet china halfway take care of each others concerns and resolve existing problems through cooperation and consultations but he also said that china s attitude has been consistent and china will not succumb to any pressure gao warned china has made preparations to respond to all kinds of possible outcomes at a rally in florida late yesterday trump accused that china broke the deal as the trade negotiations entered the final stage and he pledged no to back down on tariffs unless china stops cheating our workers he said i just announced that we ll increase tariffs on china and we won t back down until china stops cheating our workers and stealing our jobs and that s what s going to happen otherwise we don t have to do business with them and they broke the deal he added they can t do that so they ll be paying if we don t make the deal nothing wrong with taking in more than 100 billion a year corbyn tells may to move red lines and give big offer on brexit uk opposition labour jeremy corbyn said there is no big offers from prime minister theresa may on brexit yet an he urged may to move her red lines corbyn said so far in those talks there s been no big offer and the red lines are still in place its actually quite difficult negotiating with a disintegrating government with cabinet ministers jockeying for succession rather than working for an agreement quite honestly the government has to move its red lines we cannot go on having mv1 mv2 mv3 and then coming on for possibly mv4 or a bill we have yet to actually see he added may s spokesperson said there are significant work to do to reach a unified way forward to break a parliamentary impasse over brexit and the government is working hard to introduce the brexit withdrawal agreement bill as soon as possible kuroda boj won t do anything on exchange rate it s mof s job boj governor haruhiko kuroda told parliament today that the biggest factor on markets trust in yen is boj s commitment to price stability he said currency rates move on various factors so it s hard to judge market trust in the yen by looking at exchange rate fluctuations alone instead confidence in the central bank s policy is a big factor behind market trust in the country s currency kuroda also said boj is watching exchange rate moves carefully however currency policy falls under the jurisdiction of the ministry of finance thus boj would not do something for exchange rate stability rbnz orr get ahead of the curve with this week s rate cut rbnz governor adrian orr toned down the chance of another rate cut after yesterday s as he addressed a parliamentary committee today he noted that at the moment we see in the outlook for interest rates as balanced regarding yesterday s cut orr pointed out that the reason for the cut is global economic growth has slowed growth has come off rapidly in europe in china though that s stabilized more recently and australia so key trading partners separately orr also told the morning report that the cut was sensible as our forward projection a lower rate and the question for the committee was do we wait or do we move now orr said moving now is the best choice for us as far as we consider because it means we get ahead of the curve we aren t chasing the economy in cycles we re actually getting ahead and removing the cycles usd jpy mid day outlook daily pivots s1 109 90 p 110 10 r1 110 32 more usd py dips further to 109 60 so far today and intraday bias stays on the downside sustained break of 109 71 key support will confirm completion of rebound from 104 69 at 112 40 on bearish divergence condition in daily macd deeper decline should then be seen back to retest 104 69 low on the upside though rebound from current level and break of 110 28 minor resistance will mix up near term outlook intraday bias will be turned neutral in this case first in the bigger picture usd jpy is staying inside falling channel from 118 65 thus there is no confirmation of trend reversal yet sustained break of 109 71 will argue that rebound from 104 69 is completed and the down trend from 118 65 is still in progress but at this stage in case of break of 104 69 we d expect strong support above 98 9 2016 low to contain downside an bring rebound economic indicators update

gaap measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share are provided within the schedules attached to this release we use non gaap measures in our operational and financial decision making believing that it is useful to exclude certain items in order to focus on what we deem to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance and our ability to generate cash flow from operations as a result internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews include adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income per share additionally we believe that the presentation of

obligations as they become due investors are cautioned that non gaap financial measures are not a substitute for gaap disclosures this communication also includes certain forward looking non gaap financial measures we are unable to present without unreasonable efforts a reconciliation of forward looking non gaap financial information to the corresponding gaap financial information because management cannot reliably predict all of the necessary information forward looking non gaap financial information is based on numerous assumptions including assumptions with respect to general

everything to know about the april 8 eclipse in atlantic canada saltwire eclipse saltwire by leika kihara tokyo reuters bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda rejected an idea gaining traction in some u s circles that governments can spend more aggressively without causing hyper inflation adding that tokyo s economic policies are nowhere close to the concept kuroda said hyper inflation could happen not only under extreme circumstances such as after a war but also due to policy failures as seen in some latin american and asian nations related stories it s wrong to assume there will be no hyper inflation even if you boost fiscal spending recklessly as long as it s financed by the central bank kuroda told japan s parliament on thursday proponents of modern monetary theory mmt say the u s government s monopoly over dollar issuance the printing press gives it power to spend as much as needed to meet the full employment and inflation mandates assigned to the federal reserve taxes may not be needed to support all spending as the government can create more money such as by forcing the central bank to directly underwrite debt they argue some fans of mmt have cited japan as a success case saying tokyo has been able to boost fiscal spending without causing inflation as the central bank keeps the government s borrowing cost ultra low through its massive stimulus program kuroda said japan was not resorting to mmt as the government commits to getting the country s fiscal house in order japan has deployed economic stimulus policies but the government believes it s important to restore fiscal health and make fiscal policy sustainable kuroda said it s wrong to say japan is resorting to mmt while mmt has yet to gain traction among mainstream japanese politicians some analysts say it could appeal to lawmakers who favor big spending to lure votes prime minister shinzo abe has prioritized measures to boost growth over fiscal austerity slowing progress in reining in japan s public debt which has ballooned to twice the country s gross domestic product critics blame the boj s ultra loose monetary policy for allowing lawmakers to delay painful but much needed spending cuts or tax hikes that would reduce japan s debt pile reporting by leika kihara editing by richard borsuk

pleased that our first quarter results were solid and reflects improving profitability in our usa business pockets of strength in our international businesses and one month of contribution from the nexeo acquisition we also continue to work to navigate some headwinds and choppy demand in the marketplace and carl will discuss our first quarter results in debt ph shortly just 10 weeks ago on february 28 we closed the acquisition of nexeo solutions ahead of our initial timeline on march the 1st launch as a new company univar solutions we executed a seamless day one transition with zero disruption to our customers and suppliers launched a new brand for our company and began the process of shaping the univar solutions culture as a values based purpose driven enterprise focused on superior returns we also began immediately executing on our integration plan which i ll discuss in detail later just six weeks ago in keeping with our vision to be the most valued chemical and ingredient distributor on the planet we completed the divestiture of next year s plastics distribution business to allow us to concentrate our full energy on our core chemical and ingredient distribution business we realized attractive gross proceeds from the sale of 650 million which we used to pay down debt over these past 10 weeks our confidence in the strategic rationale and value creation opportunity has only grown as we ve seen tangible evidence of our enhanced value proposition and have improved visibility into achieving the synergies that result from combining these two businesses i m excited by the opportunity we have to streamline to innovate and to grow we have the opportunity to streamline business processes for our customers suppliers and ourselves removing redundancies eliminating bottlenecks and structurally reducing our cost base this creates a sustainable competitive advantage and a win win for our customer and supplier partners that will serve as another driver of accelerating long term growth nlyy two months into the process but our team made up from people from both legacy organizations is already working in a highly collaborative fashion to optimize our processes and increased asset utilization when we have completed our integration we will be an even more flexible and agile organization with a clear path to earning increasing returns on invested capital we have the tools resources and thought leadership to be an innovator in our industry not only with the products we supply such as our expanding range of natural ingredients but with our enhanced digital tools these are changing how we interact with our customer and supplier partners utilizing the suite of digital products coming out of our continued investments in this area will allow us to provide our customers and supplier partners with market intelligence and analytics help predict trends on uncovered insights into the supply chain raising opportunities to streamline innovate and grow as univar solutions we have an even stronger product portfolio from some of the best brands in the world with this new strength and scale we re standing up two new markets as dedicated focused industries home care and industrial cleaning and lubricants and metal working to add to our already wholly dedicated presence in personal care food ingredients pharmaceuticals and coatings we have formulation expertise in our 17 solution centers across the globe that help customers innovate while promoting our suppliers brands and our sellers are energized and excited about the opportunity in front of them to grow their careers and their book of business and crucially have the products support and bandwidth they need to drive growth while we are excited about our growth potential it s important to remind you about the degree of stability inherent in our business while we d love to have perpetual tailwinds across all businesses and across all geographies this obviously does not reflect reality but we do have many value creation opportunities that don t require a robust demand environment and our model is able to generate strong free cash flow through the cycle now let me turn the call over to carl who will walk you through our first quarter results in detail and then i will close with some comments on the progress of the integration carl lukach chief financial officer executive vice president thanks david and good morning everyone i m pleased to say that with the launch of our new company it s a new dawn and a new day for univar solutions we want to clearly communicate to you the metrics and milestones that you can track so that you can be as excited as we are about the growth and value capture that lies ahead the key metrics are gross profit adjusted ebitda cash flow and return on capital we will also report on our leverage and synergy capture from the next year acquisition i d like to start by saying that overall we are pleased with our performance in the quarter as david said we successfully achieved a number of milestones related to the transaction and are excited about our progress to date when it comes to our financial performance there are a number of puts and takes this quarter and in last year s first quarter that make it difficult to understand our underlying business performance i will take you through that but first let me give you an overview with a challenging quarter in all of our global markets with choppy demand from industrial end markets however we grew our gross profit dollars by 5 currency neutral expanded our gross margin and improved our conversion ratio our us business improved and we continued with solid performance in emea growth in our usa and emea segments however was offset by a significant decline in ebitda in canada and challenging conditions in our latam segment our cash flow was strong in the quarter due to a much lower build of net working capital and our return on capital employed was steady at 23 our leverage ratio was 3 9 times and we are just getting started on synergy value capture for the next year acquisition against that business performance we had a number of one time costs in the quarter that i need to take you through with that let s get started in the first quarter we reported a gaap net loss of 0 43 per share this loss included a charge of 0 44 per share for acquisition integration and severance related costs it also included a one time charge of 0 31 per share for the previously disclosed settlement of a longtime dispute we had with the us government related to the import of saccharine between 2007 and 2012 adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were 0 33 compared to 0 42 in the prior year our adjusted earnings per share in the quarter were negatively impacted 0 03 by fx and 0 03 by a higher tax rate prior year first quarter benefited 0 04 per share from a previously disclosed product cost adjustment in our usa segment adjusted ebitda of 160 million in the quarter was unfavorably impacted by 5 million of fx and included one month of results the legacy nexeo chemicals business this compared to 166 million in the prior year first quarter which included a one time 8 million product cost adjustment benefit gross profit dollars increased 5 currency neutral to 496 million and gross margin expanded 50 basis points to 23 growth was the result of improving execution in our sales force more favorable product and end market mix and one month of contribution from legacy nexeo chemicals adjusted ebitda margin increased sequentially 10 basis points to 7 4 and net ph synergy contribution in the quarter was minimal turning to our usa segment adjusted ebitda increased 6 5 as a result of contributions from the nexeo acquisition higher margins driven by favorable changes in product mix and improving sales force execution excluding the impact of the onetime product comp adjustment last year adjusted ebitda grew 17 organic volumes declined 4 6 reflecting lower sales of bulk commodity products compared to last year s first quarter with some obvious outliers like the coatings market which remain somewhat sluggish overall the demand environment in the usa segment while choppy was healthy gross margin increased 30 basis points compared to last year and a 100 basis points excluding the impact of the product cost adjustment which lowered our cost of sales in the year ago outbound freight and handling costs as a percentage of sales decreased sequentially 30 basis points as our execution is improving but was still 20 basis points higher than last year we managed our operating costs well in the quarter keeping them flat to the prior year and our conversion ratio increased 100 basis points to 31 6 normalized for the product cost credit last year our commercial and supply chain teams are actively integrating the operations and product flows of legacy nexeo and legacy univar to capture synergies the prior customer and product supply chains as well as financial data flows are being combined as a result we are looking at our usa business holistically as one univar solutions and are rapidly losing the legacy identity of the pre merger former businesses for example customers who bought from both companies previously no longer have deliveries coming from two separate warehouse locations in two separate trucks supply chain and facilities optimization is an exciting part of our overall value capture effort and is well under way turning now to our canada segment adjusted ebitda fell 26 or 23 currency neutral despite near double digit growth in our core industrial chemicals business the significant drop in demand for chemicals from the canadian energy market was the largest factor reflecting a government directed cut in oil sands production in alberta as well as softness in certain bulk commodity chemical markets in canada in addition demand from the agriculture market during the first quarter was soft as growers continued to absorb excess stocks from the prior two year drought conditions we are not satisfied with the decline in our short term results with focused management action and prudent cost management we expect to see an improvement over the coming months and we have already started to see this happen in april our emea segment grew adjusted ebitda 2 excluding the impact of currency in a challenging and weakening macroeconomic environment this is the 22nd consecutive quarter of currency neutral ebitda growth for our emea segment and is a testament to the restructuring actions and change in strategy that we took several years ago our more modern erp system in emea equivalent to what legacy nexeo was using allows us to be more nimble and agile in a fluctuating demand environment gross profit dollars increased 2 excluding the impact of currency and gross margin expanded 100 basis points driven by a more favorable product and end market mix along with solid sales force execution we had strong growth in our local chemical distribution business and certain focused industries most notably the food ingredients during the quarter we estimate that brexit boosted our first quarter adjusted ebitda by about 2 million from customers in the uk ordering and holding higher than normal levels of inventory we expect this timing benefit will reverse in the second quarter we are being disciplined with our spending as we navigate through this period of high uncertainty affecting industrial production across emea in our latam segment strong performance in our brazilian ag business and march contributions from the nexeo acquisition were offset by lower demand from brazilian industrial chemical markets higher prices from change in mix improved sales force execution and certain product shortages were largely offset by lower volumes as a result of soft economic conditions and the product shortages our brazilian customers seem to have adopted a wait and see approach to business as the country heads into a vote on governmental public finance reforms in mexico economic conditions deteriorated through the quarter as uncertainty and sluggish industrial conditions dampened demand with that said however we expect the first quarter to be the low quarter of the year as a result of cost actions we ve taken and new winds in our brazil ag business moving now to cash flow change in net working capital was a cash outflow in the quarter of 92 million which due to our lower sales compared to last year was about 140 million less than last year this provided operating cash that helped fund our transaction closing costs and the legal site settlement that we called out in our earnings news release cash interest expense in the quarter was 40 million we now expect cash interest for the year to be around 140 million down from our prior guidance of 150 million cash taxes in the quarter were 10 million we are reducing our full year forecast of cash taxes from 70 million to now 59 million while our cash tax forecast is reduced due to the one time costs related to the nexeo acquisition our effective tax rate for adjusted eps in the quarter of 31 8 was higher than the prior year first quarter of 25 and was a 0 03 per share headwind to adjusted earnings per share the higher rate was due to the timing of the one time costs in the first quarter we expect the rate will taper down during the rest of the year and settle out at about 30 for the year as we said last quarter underlying capital expenditures to maintain our facilities and grow our business we are 17 million in the quarter unchanged from the prior year we are reducing our full year forecast of capex from previously 115 million to now 100 million and this excludes the one time spending that will likely occur when we combine and optimize the legacy univar and legacy nexeo facilities footprints in the us during the quarter we paid an expense transaction fees of 50 million related to the acquisition of nexeo and 38 million of and severance costs we also paid 18 million of debt refinancing fees which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the financing we continue to earn an attractive return on our capital which underscores the quality of our business our return on assets deployed of 23 6 was roughly unchanged from the first quarter last year our roic defined as adjusted net income divided by net assets deployed was just under 10 down from 10 6 at this time last year reflecting the addition of bchemicals assets deployed to our balance sheet we expect our roic will increase as we successfully execute our integration and synergy capture plans at quarter end our leverage ratio was 3 9 times and our near term priority use of cash is the continue delevering to below three times during the quarter we refinanced our 1 4 billion abl facility due in 2020 with the new 1 7 billion facility due in 2024 increased our liquidity and extend the maturity of the debt in february we raised 1 3 billion of new debt at favorable terms to complete the acquisition and one month later paid down 650 million of debt using the gross proceeds from the plastics sale we continued to expect our leverage ratio to be approximately 3 5 times by december this year turning now to guidance for the full year 2019 we continue to expect to earn 740 million to 760 million in adjusted ebitda compared to 640 million earned in the prior year this guidance includes 10 months of earnings from the nexeo chemicals business and approximately 10 million in estimated net realized synergies we still expect to generate 300 million to 350 million in free cash flow inclusive of the 63 million saccharine settlement and before one time integration and transaction fees the negative impact of the settlement is expected to be partly offset by lower cash taxes lower cash interest and lower capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2019 we expected adjusted ebitda to be between 195 million and 200 million up from 173 million earned in the second quarter of 2018 as we expect this synergies to be realized a bit faster than the cost saves with that david i ll turn it back to you david lim vp of corporate development ir thanks carl since closing the nexeo acquisition we ve moved immediately from planning to execution as said before we are keenly aware of the magnitude of effort this integration will take and have an excellent team and a detailed thorough and comprehensive plan they re working swiftly but methodically to execute on we moved to capture synergies quickly while also providing internal reassurance to employees and continued service to our suppliers and customers diligent planning and executing at pace are the key to success and we are operating at pace after successful and seamless day one our priority has been to ensure stability and have the right leaders with a clear accountability in place to drive results we announced the key leadership team immediately after close and have already formalized the organizational structure down to director and general manager level we will have the whole organization structure finalized by the end of this month our commercial teams have been successful in working with customers to allay any concerns they may have and minimizing any customer and supply disruption meanwhile our sellers are highly motivated and excited by the opportunity in front of them to grow their career and their book of business with a fast moving industry leader with the vision of redefining chemical distribution standards as we stated before the acquisition resulted in some supplier and customer dis synergies which are included in our net synergy guidance of 100 million inaudible that for you and to give you some milestones we contract together over the coming quarters that number was made up of approximately 130 million in cost savings and 30 million of customer and supplier dissynergies this is anticipated in our planning and as expected we are seeing those dissynergies upfront as we manage our way through the portfolio of product choices we have and are successfully working to mitigate and offset those impacts we re pleased to say we ve not seen any surprises to date i m delighted that we ve had the opportunity to expand our relationship with some of our existing partners and industry leaders such as dow exon mobil olin and shell as yet we have not included or enumerated the commercial upsides from such things as cross selling and approved sales efficiency in any of the guidance we provided having said that seller attrition remains at the low levels we observed post deal announcements and territory redesign for our sales force is under way we have given this a very high priority and expect to complete it in the coming weeks liberating and expanding sales force to drive for profitable growth we ll then be able to develop commercial growth plans with our supplier partners and i m confident we have many opportunities to drive value and growth for them and our customers as we mentioned in the past we re moving the legacy univar business on to the legacy nexeo it platform to leverage the benefits of a modern erp system this will create additional process efficiencies provide the backbone we need to fully realize our digital strategy we have completed a fit ph gap analysis are on track to complete mapping legacy univar s master data on to the legacy nexeo platform we have a comprehensive plan that s been fully pressure tested by external experts and expect to start moving sites onto the platform later this year we will manage the it migration program in five ways starting in the fourth quarter and extending through 2020 our network optimization plans are also on track we will be moving business from sites that will be closed to other sites in close geographic proximity we have detailed plans in place to manage the transition to provide our customers with a high level of service they expect from us as we stated before much of our site consolidation program will follow the it migration program however there will be some facilities that will be able to close later this year finally we are realizing indirect procurement synergies leveraging our combined spend pre close we worked inside clean room to develop combined spend data since close we ve been able to go to market very quickly on our combined transportation spend and are expecting to realize savings we re getting lost ground for the 2018 transportation market tightness we remain confident in our ability to capture 100 million in net synergies including 113 million in hard cost savings and have a disciplined process with clear milestones detailed scorecard and action plans by function to track against all our synergy targets while we re focused on integrating nexeo we are also advancing key initiatives to grow our business we re taking an omnichannel approach to grow select product lines in markets and shaping customer coverage appropriately and we re leveraging our digital capabilities to reach and service a wide range of account sizes meanwhile we continue to expand our product portfolio and have signed inaudible distribution agreements with inaudible among others with many more in the pipeline as we zoom in on integration and growing our core chemical and ingredient distribution business and as we mentioned on our last call we ll actively evaluate our portfolio of businesses in order to ensure we maintain our focus and to make sure with the right owner to allow our businesses to fulfill that potential as a result i am pleased to announce that david lim will be transitioning from his dual ir and m a role to focus solely on portfolio management i d like to thank david for his many contributions and i look forward to working with him in this new role i m delighted to announce his replacement is heather kos some of you may already know as an experienced investor relations officer and a recent recipient of the chicago crain s notable women in manufacturing award i hope you will all have an opportunity to get to know her in the coming days and i m excited that we continue to attract such high quality talent to univar solutions while we have much work ahead of us it s an exciting time to be at univar solutions our teams are genuinely excited highly motivated and driving hard to capture the tremendous opportunity we have in front of us our supplier partners too are excited and right behind us they recognize the power that the platform we are developing to grow their business combine the best product portfolio in the industry with the largest targeted industry focus technically skilled and supporting sales force in north america as i said at the opening of my comments this has been a busy period for all of us at univar solutions we bought the company sold another and created a new one in the process we launched a new brand a new culture and manage this down through face to face meetings with over 1 200 sales and commercial leaders globally we restructured the leadership team down to four levels below me a team with clear goals and accountability we began executing on our integration plan and realized our first synergies we paid down debt and refinanced our borrowing we signed a new supplier authorizations while expanding others and we delivered earnings in line with expectations despite choppy demand and adverse fx this is a proven team of experienced professionals with a clear plan and the ability to execute now univar solutions we will continue to streamline innovate and grow redefining chemical distribution to achieve our vision of being the most valued chemical and ingredient distributor on the plants thank you for your attention and with that we ll open up to questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions david begleiter from deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open david begleiter deutsche bank analyst this is inaudible here for david i guess first can you discuss more opening improvement in sales force execution you have seen so far and can you also roughly quantify the benefits of that in q1 david c jukes president ceo director sure we can we can do that thanks for the question our sales force as you know we turned over quite a bit of that in the legacy univar organization in 2017 and sales force is maturing and developing well the attrition from both companies the seller attrition from both companies has reduced since the deal announcement and the legacy nexeo s sellers are really bringing a fresh perspective into the organization collaboration levels between the two teams are extremely high and the teams are now highly motivated energy levels are very high following a sales meeting joint sales meeting that we have with them about three four weeks ago and so the teams have a very very clear vision of what they need to do we continue to invest in training and developing our people growing our people to grow our business is a core value at univar solutions so we continue to see that paying off and now really the priority is to finalize the sales territory realignments and so we can liberate an expanded sales organization onto the marketplace to drive more growth carl lukach chief financial officer executive vice president as far as quantifying the impact of that in the first quarter it s hard to put an exact precise number on that but it s certainly contributed to the margin increase that we saw and the gross profit dollar growth david c jukes president ceo director if you look at how we target the sellers and the sellers have been very clearly targeted to sell and drive the products that we were focused on particularly in our focused industries we saw good growth in our food ingredient business not personal care business there i point to the improvements in our gross profit and the improvement in our gross profit margin as examples of really good execution from an improving sales organization david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you and then second on your comment portfolio options where are some key areas of focus is for you if you when you think about the portfolio optimization or strategic alternatives david c jukes president ceo director inaudible we have a wide portfolio of really good businesses within univar solutions we are very focused on being that most valued chemical and ingredient distributor on the planet and so just like we did with the nexeo plastics business which is good business we ll take a look at these businesses all our businesses and see whether we are the best home to allow them to fulfill their potential so very very very very early in the process but i think that we owe it to the businesses we owe it to all our businesses to make sure that we can provide the right support capital and direction to allow them to fulfill their potential but we ve got a portfolio of really good businesses there is nothing on no fire sales going here and we know we are very happy with the portfolio we have it s a question of how do resource them appropriately to allow them to fulfill that potential and inaudible the best home to do that david begleiter deutsche bank analyst okay thanks operator robert koort from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open robert koort goldman sachs analyst thank you this is inaudible on for bob as you reiterated your full year ebitda guidance i was wondering if you could maybe comment on the upside risks to it and if there are any specific events or trends that could potentially lead to you racing this david c jukes president ceo director i am glad tonight s the night for a raise ph look i think we re very focused on delivering our commitments one of our values at univar solutions is we do what we say so we are very committed to focusing on our commitments one of those commitments is to deliver 130 million in hard cost synergies and we are very focused on that we re very focused on the erp integration and transition process that we will go through to 2021 sorry through 19 and 20 which will drive growth we re very focused on the realignment of sales territories which we need to do to liberate the sales organization to drive growth we haven t ennumerated the cross selling opportunities that we may have from the new organization or the efficiency gains that we will have from the new organization so we re very focused on delivering and what we said we re going to do that s where our focus is and that s what we re going to do robert koort goldman sachs analyst thank you and then in europe your ebitda declined and you noted some softening macro environment i also noted that one of your peers missed on europe this morning so could you maybe comment on the dynamics you see here and what you see going forward david c jukes president ceo director yes and i think in europe our ebitda on a currency neutral basis was was off a little bit the macroeconomic trends in europe are very confusing but we have a very robust business in europe it s a very well oiled machine it knows what playbook to play depending on how the market is operating it s very geographically diverse and it pivoted some years ago to more consumer demand focused products like pharmaceuticals like food ingredients like personal care and it s done exceptionally well in those but we have a very well oiled machine there which can run equally well in second gear as inaudible and knows what playbook to play so whatever the market conditions i have great confidence in that team s ability to navigate their way through them carl lukach chief financial officer executive vice president yes i ll just add to that david the additional factor to our performance we had very good cost control by the management team there in europe going through these choppy uncertain demand signals from the economy so the combination of all that led to a good currency neutral result in a very challenging market robert koort goldman sachs analyst thank you operator laurent favre from exane please go ahead your line is open laurent favre exane analyst yes good morning all the first question is around the 10 million of net synergies that you mentioned i think you are hinting that number starts being negative i guess in the first quarter in the second quarter and then we see the net positive toward the end of the year can you give us a bit more details around the negative or the dis synergies i mean are you expecting to see the full minus 30 in the first 12 months of integration and therefore the cost cuts being very close to 40 million run rate toward the end of the year so 40 minus 30 being the 10 net that s the first question carl lukach chief financial officer executive vice president yes sure laurent thanks for that yes think of it is to cut two gears moving at the same time the first one is the gross cost synergies and as david said we re very much on track there and confident in being able to capture those savings the dis synergies around supplier supplier to synergies primarily are as we expected happening sooner and so you got this two interacting quarter by quarter it s hard to be precise quarter by quarter but yes we expect in the second quarter the dis synergies will outweigh the cost savings in the second quarter but as you progressed to the third quarter and then the fourth quarter those two would turn net positive and give us a net positive result of 10 for the year david c jukes president ceo director if i just add to that just add some color to that if i may we are very confident of the 130 million in hard cost savings and that s why we wanted to pull that out so you can track that very very clearly but this is this synergies are front end loaded we always said to be front end loaded but there is nothing in there that surprises us there is nothing happening that we didn t expect to happen or make happen so it s just a case of the transition between supplier x or supplier y or the transition between customer x and customer y that s doing that so there s nothing in there that s a surprise to us there is nothing that s unplanned it s just merely a case of managing the moving parts but our synergy execution is working well our team are working well yes as carl said in q2 it will be a headwind but that will be reversed as the year goes on but there s nothing happening that we didn t anticipate laurent favre exane analyst thank you and the second question is around david lim s new job and new focus i mean given the assets to migrate the legacy business to launch the new it platform does it make sense to migrate all the businesses toward the new it platform and then think about portfolio or should we assume that you don t need to wait for the food integration to be done to sell some non core businesses david c jukes president ceo director well look we will make those decisions as we go along our primary focus is to move the legacy univar business onto the legacy nexeo platform and our focus is on the core chemical ingredients distribution business and as we said we ll do that in a series of waves and starting in q4 of this year there are businesses which we have which are on that platform already we have businesses outside that platform we have a wide portfolio of businesses we also have experience like we have with the plastics business of carving out of business pretty quickly and pretty readily to be able to stand it up as a stand alone entity so davidwill be looking at all factors as we review our portfolio for any possible divestitures or further acquisitions as we continue to develop our laurent favre exane analyst thank you david c jukes president ceo director thanks operator steve byrne from bank of america please go ahead your line is open steve byrne bank of america analyst hi this is luke washer ph on for steve i wanted to touch on the again kind of elaborating a little bit more on the looking at evaluating your portfolio just want some expansion on this does this seem more and i know you are in the early stages but is this more of a kind of a us centric initiative following the nexeo merger and are you looking at certain key metrics when evaluating these businesses david c jukes president ceo director well i mean i appreciate your interest to try and really drill down on to this heather joined us on monday david is still here shuffling bits of paper and hasn t even started on these thoughts yet we have a wide portfolio of businesses and some of those businesses none of those businesses are bad we don t have bad businesses we have bad years but we don t have bad businesses so we have some good businesses and we re going to evaluate whether when we think about our capital allocation the right thing to do is to invest in those businesses and their growth or whether they be better supported and sustained by someone else the plastics business is a clear example of a really good business that actually was probably better in someone else s hands than in our hands and we sold that we got good proceeds from that and were able to pay debt down so david will at some time in the very near future stop shuffling these papers start shuffling fresh set of papers think about what the options are for our businesses but none of them are distressed none of them are bad and there s no fire sale going on here so if you see nothing happened for the next six nine months don t necessarily be alarmed about that we re making really good value judgments about whether we are the right home and the sponsor to allow the growth of the multiple franchises that we have david lim vp of corporate development ir if i could add on to that just in terms of metrics i mean certainly what are the overall goal would be to maximize economic income for the portfolio and return on capital so that will always be in our mindset as we make these evaluations each one of these businesses has an investment for growth profile and as all good portfolio management would do we will look at the at maximizing returns on these investment options steve byrne bank of america analyst makes sense thank you and just touching on the macro it seemed entering this year that you were one of the few companies not calling for second half rebound now four months into the year how have your thoughts changed on the macro side and the outlook for the second half of the year david c jukes president ceo director i don t think they have i think this is there is as much uncertainty around as there was at the turn of the year so is the chinese trade war going to end this week i mean i don t know when is brexit going to happen i don t know when is france going to stop being in flames i don t know there is so much uncertainty around that i don t see any reason to hope for a second half rebound we certainly don t plan for a second half rebound hope is not a strategy our strategy is to manage through what we see at the moment so what we see in front of us at the moment is pretty choppy demand and we have growth projections and plans which are fit for that market if the market changes we will adjust our strategy appropriately steve byrne bank of america analyst makes sense thank you operator jim sheehan from suntrust please go ahead your line is open pete australand suntrust analyst good morning this is pete australand on for jim what is driving the favorable mix shift in the us this quarter is that related to the addition of nexeo or was there something else specific in the quarter and do you believe that this is sustainable heading into the second quarter david c jukes president ceo director well it isn t it isn t to deal with nexeo although we believe the nexeo will be highly accretive for us as we go forward nexeo had a split between a commodity business and a good specialty portfolio good differentiative portfolio and that portfolio added to the legacy univar portfolio is allowing us to build up strength in key markets like food ingredients and personal care and farm ingredients i mean the two markets which have really being impacted for us i think everybody for coatings i mean the coatings market where we sell a lot of bulk solvents has been negatively impacted and we are seeing projects being delayed projects being put back it s not i don t believe we ve lost business or we have lost share there but we are seeing some projects delayed and put back and then the energy business the upstream business where we don t play as much anymore and certainly we re looking for profitable growth and some of those markets don t offer the profitable growth that we would want so i think there will always be a balance between the differentiated and non differentiated products that we have clearly we re very focused on on more putting more business toward consumer markets like food ingredients farm ingredients personal care which tend to be more robust through the economic cycle and i d point to emea business is an example of what that looks like through the cycle pete australand suntrust analyst thank you and then on the agriculture end markets in the us and canada could you see a tailwind on a year over year basis in the second quarter if some of those weather impacted volumes from the first quarter are delayed david c jukes president ceo director well we don t have a business in the us it is in canada and yes there will be a tailwind if we get the right weather and yes we ll be a headwind if we don t so not being a weather forecaster i m not actually prepared to commit anything at the moment other than we have a view and we ve taken a kind of modest view and with supply chain is so well stacked and what we are doing is improving the quality of our business in there to more robust kind of products products which are less weather dependent and the deal we announced with the inaudible will be a substantial deal that will deliver in 2020 and a much more robust area of the ag market pete australand suntrust analyst thank you operator laurence alexander from jefferies please go ahead your line is open laurence alexander jefferies good morning it s inaudible on for laurence how are you david c jukes president ceo director good thank you how are you laurence alexander jefferies good i know david is just getting started but have you got any inquiries from potential suitors in the past prior to nexeo for inaudible to think that it is attractive is this something that s been ongoing for a couple of years david c jukes president ceo director look i think people regularly offer us things for sale or offer to buy things from us so there is no particular accelerations there is no change in the external environment which is causing goes to think about how we manage our portfolio managing portfolio is something that any healthy enterprise does and particularly as you want to zoom in and focus on winning we know very clearly where we want to win and where we want to grow and so it s a question of focus for us now and then a question about cash allocation whether we can support the growth demands and the growth aspirations of a wide portfolio of businesses that we hold laurence alexander jefferies okay and then in terms of your canadian ag business is there a particular type of product that you guys focus on pre emergent herbicides or insecticides or are you kind of spread out carl lukach chief financial officer executive vice president there we are spread out we ve got a full portfolio of products there from herbicides and insecticides and fungicides and even a little fertilizer in there too even little seeds so it s pretty widespread laurence alexander jefferies okay thank you very much operator operator instructions duffy fischer from barclays please go ahead your line is open duffy fischer barclays analyst yeah good morning first question is just trying to understand how much of the upper tier of management from nexeo is going to be feathured into the new univar so maybe david if you could kind of talk about your top tier one and two is that s 30 people in the new univar what would be the split how many are historic universe versus how many are nexeo david c jukes president ceo director well no one is being feathered in we ve made very deliberate choices about the people that we want to lead this company people who reflect the values that we have for our new company univar solutions so if we think about the operating committee the top leaders who manage this business brian herington as chief commercial officer pat jerding is chief information officer there are two legacy nexeo employees who are very impactful to our business many of c suites ph from legacy nexeo of course went on to do other things so that wasn t as much to choose from that if i go down to the next layer of the us management team we have what two three we have joey going there running our focused industries which is the large growth part of our business we have inaudible solvents business so we have tracy diel with our marketing business so we have a number of legacy nexeo employees but i mean that all of us used to work somewhere and now all of us have worked for univar solutions for about 10 weeks and that s really what we re focusing on and that s who we are duffy fischer barclays analyst okay and then just the second one around the accretion from nexeo so carl in the 160 1 adjusted ebitda for the first quarter how much of that would have come from the nexeo accretion and then how should we think about the run rate ebitda generation of nexeo kind of right at the deal closed i mean what was the run rate for this year going to be if it was stand alone carl lukach chief financial officer executive vice president duffy okay let me try to rought that out for you but i have to say upfront that the eggs are scrambled we are very very actively integrating these two companies former supply chain because there are immediate cost synergies available to us and so we re not wasting time to grab those but to try to help out with that in this first quarter you k now that we expected legacy univar to earn 140 to 145 and for legacy nexeo to be roughly flat with last year and the way it came out in the 160 is that legacy nexeo came in about as expected to the best we coudl identify that and legacy univar came in a little bit better than expected with that really coming in the us if you look at compared to last year 166 million that legacy univar did you adjust for the one time product adjustment credit that we had of eight the fx headwinds that we faced of five and thentake take into account the lower canadian earnings of five currency neutral and that should take you to about 148 roughly for legacy univar in the quarter and so as i said it came out as we expected when we went into it but duffy have to say this is the last quarter that we ll be able to rough that out for you we re really are losing visibility on the historical performance of those companies as we merge these supply chains david c jukes president ceo director i mean deffy just a minute add on to that i mean just two things i think we said in the script we started moving on integration immediately and as i said earlier on we are now one company it s univar solutions to reinforce carl s point the eggs are scrambled can t put back in the shell for you and we re not even trying because it is pointless we re focused on the commitments that we ve made for synergy capture for gross profit growth for ebitda growth free cash flow that are the things that we re focused on delivering as univar solutions duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you guys david c jukes president ceo director thanks duffy operator thank you we have now reached the end of our q a session i will now turn the call back over to univar solutions team for closing comments david lim vp of corporate development ir thank you ladies and

in his pamphlet the class struggles in france 1848 to 1850 his first assessment of the 1848 revolution karl marx presented a depiction of the financial oligarchy which despite the passing of 170 years has only increased in relevance for an understanding of the present situation the capitalist world economy and financial system which has developed by leaps and bounds since marx s day especially over the past three decades is now characterised by the relentless drive of the financial elites to boost the stock market by all means available to ever new heights nothing they insist must be allowed to stand in the way of their wealth accumulation which has brought social inequality to historically unprecedented heights in his depiction of the physiognomy of the ancestors of the present day oligarchs and its relationship to the political and economic structures of bourgeois society marx wrote since the finance aristocracy made the laws was at the head of the administration of the state had command of all the organized public authorities dominated public opinion through the actual state of affairs and through the press the same prostitution the same shameless cheating the same mania to get rich was repeated in every sphere to get rich not by production but by pocketing the already available wealth of others clashing at every moment with the bourgeois laws themselves an unbridled assertion of unhealthy and dissolute appetites manifested itself particularly at the top of bourgeois society lusts wherein wealth derived from gambling naturally seeks its satisfaction where pleasure becomes debauched where money filth and blood commingle the finance aristocracy in its mode of acquisition as well as in its pleasures is nothing but the rebirth of the lumpenproletariat on the heights of bourgeois society the social economic and political process depicted by marx today finds its consummate personification in the form of donald trump who emerged from the bowels of the underworld of speculation in new york real estate and the debased environs of so called reality television to become the president of the most powerful capitalist country in the world some members of the financial elite especially those who have recently expressed concerns about the direction in which the whole system is heading warning of the dangers of deepening social polarisation and even possible revolution no doubt try to disassociate themselves from the more vulgar features of trump s personality but that should not be allowed to obscure the fact that in their objective mode of existence and their actions they exemplify the same essential tendencies the only difference they have with trump is that he gives voice openly and crudely to the underlying driving forces of the financial system over which they preside it needs to be recalled that the us senate investigation into the crash of 2008 found that the financial system not merely individuals was a snake pit rife with greed conflicts of interest and wrongdoing such was the extent of the wrongdoing and criminality and so endemic was it to the operations of finance capital that president obama s attorney general eric holder concluded that none of those responsible for the financial meltdown could be prosecuted lest such action jeopardize the us and global financial system too big to fail also meant too big to jail in recent months trump has been waging a campaign to have the us federal reserve which has already pumped trillions of dollars into the financial system and lifted the stock market by 400 percent from its nadir in march 2009 to do even more under conditions where the fed s base interest rate is at 2 25 to 2 5 percent very low by historical standards he has called for a cut of at least 1 percentage point and the resumption of the program of financial asset purchases by the central banks the policy of quantitative easing insisting that this would boost the dow by a further 10 000 points an increase of 40 percent from its already stratospheric level there has been a certain amount of tut tutting about trump s attack on the supposed independence of the fed a fiction that has been assiduously cultivated in order to cover over the fact that the institutions of the capitalist state function as instruments of the financial oligarchy trump s two intended appointees to the fed s board of governors herman cain and stephen moore have both withdrawn under pressure from sections of the financial elite that are opposed to the us central bank becoming an instrument in trump s re election campaign and concerned that the elevation of such unabashed lackeys would too clearly reveal the fed s essential role in providing them with cash to finance their parasitism but as always actions speak louder than words and here marx s remarks about the way in which financial capital clashes with bourgeois laws themselves are highly relevant in understanding the present situation in 2018 in response to an upturn in the growth rate of the us and global economy the fed on four occasions lifted its base interest rate by 0 25 percentage points the aim of this very limited operation was to create a kind of buffer to meet the next and inevitable downturn or recession the fed s goal was to have some ammunition in the form of a potential interest rate cut to prevent a repeat of what took place in 2008 2009 when the us economy went into its deepest decline in the post world war ii period unless interest rates were raised in conditions where the economy was growing the fed would have very little room to manoeuvre when the situation changed it also signalled it would continue to wind down its holdings of financial assets which had risen from around 800 billion before the financial crisis to some 4 5 trillion in order to pursue a more normal monetary policy in accordance with what were regarded as the prevailing laws and procedures of bourgeois economics the financial markets stamped their feet and issued loud denunciations such a return to normal policy was not to be tolerated nothing not even a policy based on conventional bourgeois economic wisdom could be allowed to impede the mania for accumulation by parasitism and speculation consequently as trump verbally railed against the fed wall street underwent a sell off that resulted in the worst december since the great depression year of 1931 the december 2018 plunge has been described in some circles as a kind of dress rehearsal for another financial meltdown when the house of cards collapses with even more devastating consequences than the crisis of 2008 but no matter the financial oligarchs operate according to the maxim après moi le deluge which as marx noted is the watchword of every capitalist and of every capitalist nation accordingly fed chairman jerome powell responded immediately to the financial markets demands at the first available opportunity during a speech in early january he signalled to the markets message received he made it clear that interest rate rises pencilled in for 2019 were off the table that position was endorsed at the meeting of the federal open market committee fomc the central bank s policy making body in march the fomc went even further not only did it rule out interest rate rises for the rest of the year it decided to cease the wind down of the fed s financial assets and leave some 3 5 trillion on its balance sheet but in their maniacal lust the financial markets and their mouthpieces have called for more demanding an interest rate cut for the most part they are not as direct as trump his white house economic adviser larry kudlow and vice president mike pence all of whom have called for an interest rate cut and even for a resumption of quantitative easing they have tried a more subtle approach to achieve the same end through criticism of powell s remarks following an fomc meeting last week in which he kept to the line going back to his predecessor janet yellen that persistently low inflation was due to transitory drags one of the planks of official policy is that the fed should frame its monetary policy to ensure inflation at around 2 percent the latest data show that inflation in march was 1 6 percent according to the fed s most favoured measure with no signs of a significant upward movement however jobs data showed the lowest level of unemployment 3 6 percent in 50 years and the fed is acutely aware that this could lead to a significant push by workers for wage increases already seen in the ongoing struggles of teachers one of the key economic models used by the fed in determining its policies is the so called phillips curve which purports to show that as the jobless rate falls wages will tend to rise leading to higher inflation which must then be countered with an interest rate rise and so in accordance with this conventional wisdom powell left that option open however the trump white house in the words of kudlow maintains that the persistence of low inflation even under conditions of historically low jobless rates means that phillips curve models are buried and interest rates should be cut powell however claimed that the fed s policy stand was appropriate and he saw no strong case for a movement in either direction this provoked a series of criticisms to the effect that in the words of one economist powell had blindsided us and upset the entire market view of inflation in other words low inflation was not due to transient factors and so an interest rate cut to try and boost it was necessary the real aim being not to increase prices but to fuel the stock market critics have found plenty of ammunition for their campaign in the positions advanced by powell himself who as recently as march called low inflation one of the major challenges of our times nothing can really be understood about the dynamics of the present economic situation if one confines an analysis to the musings of the bourgeois economists their various laws seek at best only to correlate certain features of the market without penetrating beyond that and consequently they are all at sea when it comes to analysing changes in the very structure and foundations of the capitalist economy the crisis of 2008 was one such change not a cyclical fluctuation but a veritable breakdown in the operations of the profit system the twists and turns of powell low inflation is a major challenge of our times one day to a transitory phenomenon the next are only an indication of the bewilderment of the bourgeoisie and its state agencies in the face of forces they have unleashed in this case the pumping of trillions of dollars into the financial system following the financial meltdown as marx put it they are like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world which he has called up by his spells in this case quantitative easing in which money was simply created through pressing on a computer key how then has the present situation fraught with contradictions and beyond the comprehension of bourgeois economics and its conventional wisdoms arisen in his analysis in capital marx explained that the essential circuit of the capitalist mode of production was money the purchase of commodities production resulting in new commodities with a higher value than those that entered the production process to be turned back into an increased mass of money at the end having expanded itself the increased mass of money had to be thrown back into the circuit once again in order to undergo further expansion otherwise it ceased to be capital and simply became a sterile money hoard the source of the additional amount of money and the basis for its continual expansion as capital was the surplus value extracted from the exploitation of the working class in the process of capitalist production it arose from the difference in the value of the labour power purchased by capital and paid for in wages and value created by the use of that labour in the course of the working day the value created by the labour of the worker exceeded the value of the commodity labour power sold to the capitalist and this formed the basis for the expansion and accumulation of capital in analysing this process marx drew out how it could lead to the development of what is now termed financialisation where money simply begets more money it is precisely because the money form of value is its independent and palpable form of appearance that the circulation form m m which starts and finishes with actual money expresses money making the driving motive of capitalist production most palpably the production process appears simply as an unavoidable middle term a necessary evil for the purpose of money making frederick engels marx s lifelong collaborator who edited the second volume of capital in which these lines appear made in an important insertion into marx s text this explains he wrote why all nations characterized by the capitalist mode of production are periodically seized by fits of giddiness in which they try to accomplish the money making without the mediation of the production process what engels described as a temporary phenomenon a kind of passing fit the accumulation of money without producing anything has now assumed a dominant position in the us economy and around the world it is estimated that some 40 percent of all us corporate profits comes from the finance sector largely the result of speculative activities from the end of world war ii to around the beginning of the 1980s financial profits as a percentage of the total remained steady but with the ending of the post war boom a result of the downturn in the rate of profit in manufacturing and other key areas the share of finance began to rise as capital searched for new ways to accumulate via financial operations there was a downturn in the process after the crash of 2008 but this was quickly turned around by the government bank bailout followed by the fed s reduction of interest rates to historic lows and its program of quantitative easing cheap money not only drives up share values it enables the financing of corporate takeovers and mergers funds share buybacks and provides the foundation for the development of arcane financial instruments such as derivatives as means for profit making but the precondition for the development of these mechanisms is the continual provision of cheap money whatever amount is provided it is never enough because still more is needed to finance new rounds of profit accumulation via speculation however there is another side to this process which has decisive implications for the mass of the working population whose labour is the source of all wealth in a capitalist economy profits derived from financial speculation are not the result of the production of new wealth in the final analysis they are the means by which the owners of finance capital appropriate a portion of the surplus value extracted by other sections of capital from the working class therefore finance capital must always seek to ensure that this flow of surplus value on which it ultimately depends is increased by intensifying the exploitation of the working class and ensuring that wages are suppressed at the same time it must ensure that social services such as health education welfare payments pensions the funding of cultural activities are slashed because they represent a deduction from the available mass of surplus value which it can appropriate this is the source of the contradiction that confronts millions of workers around the world and in the us the american economy is supposedly roaring ahead with unemployment at a half century low yet the vast majority of the working population faces a situation of stagnant or falling wages new forms of exploitation such as those developed by amazon and others and insecure part time and casual employment in the so called gig economy students emerging from universities and colleges start their working lives burdened with a mountain of debt at the same time workers and youth face ever more difficult conditions of life because of the slashing of basic physical and social infrastructure this impoverishment of the working class is not some unfortunate or accidental occurrence it is an inherent and necessary component of the processes that now form the fundamental driving forces of the capitalist economy this means that the expansion of financial wealth to ever greater heights and the consequent widening of social inequality cannot be overcome in the manner proposed by the supposed left democrats i e some marginal increase in corporate tax here or some tweak to the economic system there this process is rooted the very foundations of the present day structure of the profit system and is not some kind of epiphenomenon and just as the so called normal methods of profit accumulation have passed into history so too are the past methods of rule based on the precepts of bourgeois democracy heading for oblivion they belong to an era that no longer exists the ruling classes are acutely aware of the fact that the working class is moving to the left that anti capitalist sentiment is growing and producing an orientation towards socialism as the way forward an explosion of the class struggle is in the making some sections of the ruling elite are making a desperate effort to contain it by channelling social opposition behind the democratic party and its left wing which holds out the illusion that some form of progressive capitalism is possible other sections know that a confrontation is inevitable and rapidly approaching and are making their preparations accordingly at the same time they look to the lefts to blind the working masses while they organise their offensive herein lie the objective roots of the drive toward authoritarian forms of rule and the promotion of outright fascist ideology and organisations just as trump s calls for still more money to be placed at the disposal of the financial elite are only the most egregious expression of processes rooted in the very heart of the profit system so his diatribes against socialism and his fascistic rants are the articulation of strengthening tendencies in the political superstructure in the us and around the world the ruling classes cannot rule in the old way the working class however cannot live under the new economic and political order it is time to draw the necessary conclusions the attempt to channel the growth of anti capitalist sentiment back under the wing of one of the oldest capitalist parties in the world has to be exposed for the dangerous political fraud that it is and through that exposure hostility to capitalism and its depredations must be transformed into a conscious political movement for international socialism based not on paltry and essentially unobtainable reforms but on the struggle to end the profit system and build the revolutionary party to lead this struggle

to 1 2 billion excluding the impact of foreign exchange gtv increased 3 gtv from live on site auctions was flat partly due to the q1 2018 grande prairie auction of 37 million that did not repeat in q1 2019 offset by growth in live on site auctions in the us and europe online marketplaces gtv posted consecutive quarter growth delivering a 9 increase in the first quarter total revenue increased 17 to 303 4 million primarily due to a 56 increase in inventory sales revenue partially offset by a 2 decrease in service revenue inventory sales revenue increased 56 primarily due to an increase in volume of inventory sales contracts in the us and europe the decline in service revenue resulted from a 9 decrease in commissions revenue offset by a 7 increase in fees lower commissions were attributable to lower price realization on guarantee contracts as well as a decrease in the volume of straight commission contracts the lower rates earned from guarantee contracts were partially due to softer price performance on specific assets in greater supply at the 2019 orlando auction fee revenue increased 7 due to moderately higher gtv volume with an increased proportion of low value lots online inspection fees and fees earned from rbfs foreign exchange had an unfavourable impact on total revenue in q1 2019 due to fluctuations in the euro and canadian exchange rate relative to the u s dollar costs of services decreased 2 to 36 1 million compared to 36 7 million in q1 2018 which was in line with the change in gtv cost of inventory sold increased 59 to 120 5 million in line with higher activity in inventory sales revenue a contributing factor to the higher cost of inventory sold in the quarter resulted from discrete lower price performance on certain categories of equipment which was in greater supply at the february 2019 orlando auction selling general and administrative sg a expenses decreased 2 to 95 2 million compared to 97 5 million in q1 2018 the decrease was primarily due to higher share unit expenses in q1 2018 related to mark to market costs driven by growth in the share price and incremental compensation cost resulting from the modification of certain performance factors the decrease was partially offset by on going incremental costs related to the govplanet non rolling stock program and growth of rbfs foreign exchange rates had a favourable impact on sg a expenses in the quarter primarily due to fluctuations of the euro and canadian dollar exchange rate relative to the u s dollar net income attributable to stockholders increased 1 0 million or 6 from 17 1 million in q1 2018 due to higher operating income coupled with lower net interest expenses this increase was partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate primarily for the

measures this news release references a non gaap measure non gaap measures do not have a standardized meaning and are therefore unlikely to be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies the presentation of this financial information which is not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles is not intended to be considered in isolation of or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles the non gaap measure diluted adjusted eps attributable to stockholders eliminates the financial impact of adjusting items which are after tax effects of significant non recurring items that we do not consider to be part of our normal operating results such as acquisition related costs management reorganization costs and certain other items which we refer to as adjusting items there were no adjusting items in q1 2019 or in the comparative prior period and accordingly diluted adjusted eps attributable to stockholders was equal to diluted eps attributable to stockholders the most comparable gaap measure in our consolidated income statements for q1 2019 adjusted ebitda and adjusted net debt adjusted ebitda reconciliation the company believe that comparing adjusted net debt adjusted ebitda on a trailing 12 month basis for different financial periods provides useful information about the performance of our operations as an indicator of the amount of time it would take the company to settle both the short and long term debt the company does not consider this to be a measure of liquidity which is the ability to settle only short term obligations but rather a measure of how well we fund liquidity the following table reconciles adjusted ebitda and adjusted net debt adjusted ebitda to debt cash and cash equivalents net income and debt as a multiple of net income which are the most directly comparable gaap measures in or calculated from our

centerpoint energy s quarterly report on form 10 q for the quarter ended march 31 2019 and other reports centerpoint energy or its subsidiaries may file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission use of non gaap financial measures by centerpoint energy in providing guidance in addition to presenting its financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap including presentation of income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share centerpoint energy also provides guidance based on adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share which are non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s historical or future financial performance that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable gaap financial measure centerpoint energy s adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share calculation excludes from income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share respectively the impact of zens and related securities and mark to market gains or losses resulting from the company s energy services business centerpoint energy s guidance for 2019 also does not reflect certain impacts associated with the vectren merger which are integration and transaction related fees and expenses including severance and other costs to achieve anticipated cost savings as a result of the merger and merger financing impacts in january prior to the completion of the merger due to the issuance of debt and equity securities to fund the merger that resulted in higher net interest expense and higher common stock share count centerpoint energy is unable to present a quantitative reconciliation of forward looking adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share because changes in the value of zens and related securities and mark to market gains or losses resulting from the company s energy services business are not estimable as they are highly variable and difficult to predict due to various factors outside of management s control these excluded items along with the excluded impacts associated with the merger could have a material impact on gaap reported results for the applicable guidance period management evaluates the company s financial performance in part based on adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share management believes that presenting these non gaap financial measures enhances an investor s understanding of centerpoint energy s overall financial performance by providing them with an additional meaningful and relevant comparison of current and anticipated future results across periods the adjustments made in these non gaap financial measures exclude items that management believes does not most accurately reflect the company s fundamental business performance these excluded items are reflected in the reconciliation tables of this news release where applicable centerpoint energy s adjusted income and adjusted diluted earnings per share non gaap financial measures should be considered as a supplement to and not as a substitute for or superior to income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per share which respectively are the most directly comparable gaap financial

hurtsellers investment management and rob grubka employee benefits with that let s turn to slide 3 as i would like to turn the call over to rod rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer good morning let s begin on slide 4 with some key themes during the first quarter we made further progress in support of our long term plan to drive organic growth cost savings and optimal capital deployment our normalized adjusted operating eps for the first quarter was 1 22 up 43 compared with the first quarter of 2018 we are on track to deliver 10 plus eps growth for the full year 2019 as i mentioned on our earnings call in february this growth will be achieved from our full year 2018 normalized adjusted operating eps baseline of 4 88 our performance throughout the first quarter demonstrated continued momentum across our businesses and is in line with the targets that we shared on investor day for retirement we grew full service recurring deposits 11 year over year and have now achieved 22 consecutive quarters of positive full service net flows for corporate markets in investment management the first quarter marked our 13th consecutive quarter of positive institutional net flows and in employee benefits total in force premiums increased 14 compared with the first quarter of 2018 surpassing 2 billion we remain on track to achieve the 230 million to 250 million in annual run rate cost savings by the end of 2020 we also continue to maintain a strong capital position with approximately 705 million of excess capital we repurchased 250 million of shares in the first quarter and in the beginning of the second quarter we entered into an additional 236 million share repurchase program which fully utilized our existing authorization as we announced yesterday our board provided authorization for an additional 500 million in share repurchases which expires on june 30 2020 in addition to using excess capital to repurchase shares we expect to increase our common stock dividend to its annual yield of at least 1 in the third quarter as we noted on investor day and as demonstrated by the almost 5 5 billion in buybacks that we ve executed repurchasing our shares remains an attractive use of excess capital since our ipo in 2013 we have repurchased approximately half of our outstanding shares equating to 127 million shares an amount that s equal to our market cap at our ipo at the same time increasing the dividend will help broaden our investor base and we believe will increase the attractiveness of our shares turning to slide 5 we remain committed to and confident in our goal of annual eps growth of at least 10 in each of the next three years on a normalized basis as we have previously shared our eps growth will be achieved through a combination of organic growth cost savings and capital deployment in 2019 we expect eps growth to be largely driven by cost savings and capital deployment organic growth will play a larger role in 2020 and 2021 as evidenced by our top line results in the first quarter our businesses both individually and collectively provide a compelling value proposition to our customers looking at the new clients that we re bringing on board as well as the strength of our pipeline we are confident in the organic growth component of our plan our track record and commitment to execution as a company and the management team speaks to our ability to achieve our eps growth target over each of the next three years turning to slide 6 building the character of our brand continues to help drive our success and support our financial performance our brand and culture continue to be recognized externally we are proud to have again been named one of the world s most ethical companies by the ethisphere institute for six consecutive years each year since 2007 there was about a 20 to 25 turnover on that list this year voya was one of only a 128 companies worldwide to earn this honor and one of only five companies recognized in the financial services category according to ethisphere the world s most ethical companies have outperformed the large cap index over five years by more than 14 this validates the belief that financial performance and ethics go hand in hand it also tracks with barron analysis of its 100 most sustainable companies which outperformed the s p 500 by 24 and the russell 1000 by 30 in 2018 this was voya s second year to earn recognition forbearance as a more sustainable company ranking number six overall and number one in financial services additionally during the quarter we were named to the 2019 corporate equality index for the 14th consecutive year we were also recognized as one of america s best large employers by forbes and we earned a spot on the mogul s list of the 2019 best places to work in the u s for our commitment to diversity and inclusion we are increasingly hearing from our clients that our culture and the way we do business distinguishes us from other companies and that s having an impact on our business performance and our pipelines with that let me ask mike to provide more details on our financial performance michael smith chief financial officer and interim chief risk officer thank you rod let s begin on slide 8 in the first quarter we delivered normalized after tax adjusted operating earnings of 1 22 per share this excludes 0 16 of alternative income below our long term expectations and 0 01 of favorable dac unlocking alternative income was affected by mark to market adjustments on private equity investments related to fourth quarter equity market performance as a reminder investment performance on most of these assets is reported on a three month lag on a reported basis after tax adjusted operating earnings were 1 07 per share for the quarter our first quarter gaap net income results included a 79 million purchase price true up in relation to the 2018 sale of our annuity businesses this is reported within the discontinued operations we do not expect additional material adjustments to the purchase price and continue to view the transaction favorably our first quarter normalized after tax adjusted operating earnings grew 23 year over year from 0 99 we remain on track to grow eps by at least 10 in full year 2019 as highlighted at our investor day moving to slide 9 retirement delivered 125 million of adjusted operating earnings in the first quarter excluding unlocking this was lower than the first quarter of 2018 fourth quarter equity markets affected alternative income which was below long term expectations by 16 million average asset balances were also unfavorably affected which in turn reduced fee income in addition administrative expenses were higher reflecting higher pension costs and a legal accrual expenses also reflected investments in our distribution and costs associated with onboarding new plants both of which will improve earnings in future quarters net flows remain strong as retirement generated 584 million of positive full service flows in the quarter this quarter marks 22 consecutive quarters of inflows in full service corporate markets over five years of consecutive net inflows trailing 12 month full service recurring deposits grew 11 to nearly 10 billion in the first quarter we have a strong pipeline of new sales across both service and are on track to achieve our full year target of 10 to 12 recurring deposit growth in 2019 total client assets finished higher in the first quarter helped by the recovery in equity markets this should help second quarter fee income assets were lower compared with a year ago due to a record keeping plan termination of approximately 40 billion of planned assets which we discussed last quarter following a record earnings year for retirement in 2018 we expect normalized earnings in 2019 to be roughly in line with 2018 that said we remain confident in the retirement businesses ability to deliver a normalized pre tax earnings cagr of 4 to 7 over the three year period ending with 2021 on slide 10 investment management delivered 34 million of adjusted operating earnings in the first quarter this was lower compared with first quarter of 2018 investment capital results in the quarter were roughly 7 million below long term expectations fees associated with the closing of a large private equity fund as well as performance fees did not repeat in the first quarter of 2019 in addition retail outflows in the fourth quarter that extended into the first quarter resulted in lower asset balances and in turn lower fees partially offsetting this were lower administrative expenses despite growth in our institutional business reflecting lower variable compensation and a legal recovery our first quarter operating margin was 27 7 on a trailing 12 month basis including investment capital we remain confident and returning our operating margin to 30 to 32 by 2021 and expect to do so through organic growth and by proactively managing expenses investment management generated over 1 billion of institutional net inflows in the first quarter to mark 13 consecutive quarters of positive institutional net flows over the last 12 months we have garnered over 4 5 billion of institutional net inflows this track record has been driven by continued strong investment performance the growing success of our specialty capabilities which includes distribution to third party insurance companies and the strength of our core fixed income capabilities during the quarter we saw a continuation of retail outflows driven by the loss of a few sizable mandates encouragingly retail sales grew 15 year over year which includes the success of our strategic income opportunity fund this fund surpassed 1 billion of assets last quarter and is the top asset gatherer in its morningstar category looking ahead we see a healthy sales pipeline for the remainder of 2019 giving us confidence we can achieve net flows as a percentage of beginning assets under management of 2 to 4 in 2019 we expect investment management to deliver a normalized pre tax earnings cagr of 5 to 8 over the three year period ending with 2021 turning to slide 11 employee benefits delivered 38 million of adjusted operating earnings in the first quarter excluding unlocking return on capital remains high at 28 on a trailing 12 month basis first quarter 2019 showed strong growth with adjusted operating earnings 15 higher from first quarter 2018 this was supported by 14 growth in total in force premiums which drove premiums above 2 billion for the first time voluntary in force premiums grew almost 30 year over year reflecting the consistent success we have had in growing this business over the last few years we expect it to remain a significant growth driver as we continue to leverage our expertise and strong distribution relationships within stop loss we saw a return to growth more in line with historical rates while we maintain strong pricing discipline group life in force premiums grew 9 year over year driven by the strength of our relationships with national firms total aggregate loss ratios were within our target range of 71 74 we are very pleased with employee benefits continued success and feel confident in our ability to deliver a normalized pre tax earnings cagr of 7 to 10 over the three year period ending with 2021 on slide 12 individual life adjusted operating earnings were 51 million in the first quarter excluding unlocking higher than 46 million in the first quarter of 2018 return on capital was 9 3 on a trailing 12 month basis first quarter mortality results were slightly favorable to our expectations due to lower frequency partially offsetting this was alternative income below long term expectations in connection with our decision to cease new business at the end of 2018 we announced our plan to reduce annual run rate cost by 20 million we have now achieved this run rate as a result we expect administrative expenses to be approximately 50 million in the second quarter we also anticipated sales to be reported in 2019 as we processed applications received through year end 2018 this resulted in first quarter sales of 34 million some applications carried over into the second quarter but are now complete this will result in approximately 10 million of additional sales to be reported in the second quarter looking ahead we continue to expect at least 1 billion of free cash flow to come from this block over the next five years to six years including a significant one time release of capital related to a redundant reserve financing in late 2019 or early 2020 on slide 13 we provide additional items to consider for the second quarter share repurchases will have a positive impact on eps in addition we expect the following unfavorable items not to recur in the second quarter seasonally higher administrative expenses and legal reserves accrued in retirement in the first quarter not expected to recur at the same levels partially offsetting these items we expect individual life mortality to normalize and an investment management legal recovery to not recur in addition we expect lower second quarter corporate losses due to progress on reducing stranded costs also our semiannual preferred stock dividend is not paid in the second and fourth quarters as a reminder our quarterly earnings per diluted share will likely include increased shares from the warrants given our current share price levels in the appendix we include a sensitivity table to help you calculate the impact of the warrants while we have provided some items to consider there will of course be other factors that affect second quarter eps results on slide 14 we provide greater transparency into the composition and performance of our alternatives portfolio as you can see our alternatives portfolio has delivered strong investment performance over time and is generally consistent with our long term expectations of 9 currently over two thirds of our 1 6 billion alternatives portfolio is invested in private equity first quarter results were largely impacted by the mark to market of private equity investments related to fourth quarter equity market performance most of our private equity holdings are reported on a quarter lag we expect the year to date rebound in equity markets to improve second quarter alternative income turning to slide 15 our capital position remains strong our estimated rbc ratio of 475 at the end of march significantly exceeded our target of 400 our excess capital was 705 million at the end of the first quarter both our rbc ratio and excess capital are adjusted for the annuities purchase price true up i mentioned earlier our debt to capital ratio was 28 on march 31st comfortably below our 30 target included in our debt to capital ratio was an increase related to a one time reclassification of certain deferred tax liabilities on our balance sheet related to unrealized capital gains this reclassification aligns us more closely with many of our peers but importantly it does not impact the value of our deferred tax assets during the quarter we completed 250 million of accelerated share repurchases and are executing on arrangements to repurchase an additional 236 million of shares the board also provided authorization for an additional 500 million of share repurchases which expires at the end of the second quarter 2020 we will provide further guidance on how much of the 500 million will be utilized in the second half of 2019 once the current asr is complete in addition as rod shared earlier we plan to increase our common stock dividend to an annual yield of at least 1 in third quarter of 2019 which we believe will further expand our shareholder base turning to slide 16 over the last few years we have taken deliberate actions to simplify our business and reduce risk these actions have enabled us to significantly increase our free cash flow generation our free cash flow conversion is now 85 to 95 supporting our projected free cash flow yield of nearly 10 this yield compares very favorably to pre annuities transaction level and to our peers in summary we remain confident in our ability to grow eps at least 10 in 2019 largely due to cost savings and capital management we are encouraged by our underlying sales activity and believe this will help generate greater organic growth in 2020 and beyond our business mix is focused on high cash conversion with minimal tail risk and has no long term care and minimal va exposure and our capital position and balance sheet remains strong with that i will turn the call back to the operator so that we can take your questions questions and answers operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of john barnidge with sandler o neill please proceed with your question john barnidge sandler o neill analyst thanks my question is on the employee benefits stop loss ratio it s meaningfully improved for the last several quarters can you talk about maybe some of the pricing dynamics you re seeing in the competitive environment there robert l grubka president employee benefits yes thanks john this is rob grubka on that one with stop losses we ve talked about it seems like for all the quarters i ve been running this business where we going from a pricing perspective and getting the loss ratio in range we saw that turn at the back end of last year and that was driven by pricing action that we took around the book in 1 1 of 18 we took a step back and sort of rebalanced the mix of what we were wanting to sell versus the size of the book of business and the renewal action that we wanted to see we feel like we repeated a very good 1 1 cycle for 2019 and continue to feel very confident that we re going to be in the range and stay in range despite growing that was our intention we said that as well but we thought we d get back to growing the business from a new sales perspective john barnidge sandler o neill analyst okay and then my follow up questions for investment management i know the markets were cooperative in the first quarter but there is a lot of volatility last year so can you kind of like talk about how your conversations have changed with maybe some clients and if they re pushing on fees and maybe how consumer behaviors change this year after the volatility we saw in the fourth quarter thanks for the answers rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer sure john and then christine will take that christine hurtsellers chief executive officer investment management yeah thanks john yeah certainly as you say some of the sentiment that we saw in the fourth quarter as far as the volatility in the risk off sentiment did trickle into the first quarter and impact our flows but really as it was normal that s more of the business mix shift with clients and so we got a little bit slower start to the year i would say in terms of asset allocation and where people were going because of that but really we haven t seen it specifically impact their demand of fee or fee compression and so when you look kind of taking a step back and you look at what s going on with investment management and our yields and fees on the assets which we re managing what we like to do is we like to look at it on a 12 month trailing basis and so based on that we did have the fees on our inflows were four basis points lower than the fees on our outflows but again this is really more a business mix issue for us now we did see some retail outflows again as you say due to risk off out of our bank loan funds some active equity but on the retail side we are seeing very strong momentum mike and his comments mentioned the strategic income opportunities fund and that fund is now 1 7 billion today it hit the 1 billion mark last quarter so really strong growth on that front then again going back to how to think about basis points and the business mix issue it really is driven by more fixed income mandates and what we re seeing is that we have more than one as an example large fixed income mandate funding that s over 1 billion and so typically when you have that size we tend to be more aggressive in the fees because quite frankly our if they are so scalable we have a very deep fixed income team strong infrastructure so the variable costs associated with that type of business are minimal and so its highly margin accretive so again and thinking about it don t think about it as demanding clients driving fee compression it s a business mix and as far as our overall revenue yield and how to think about it in looking at our unfunded wins and pipeline i would expect more of the same in terms of fixed income mandates settling in but in the later part of the year we had some higher margin fee products coming to market a real estate debt funds we just landed or added to our team an infrastructure debt team for our private credit clients and so we re going to most likely be launching a fund with that capability early next year as well as being back in the market in 2020 with private equity so again i would say that strong pipeline strong organic growth and we re going to be able to achieve our earnings targets and our margin given the strong growth that we see operator our next question comes from the line of suneet kamath with citi please proceed with your question suneet kamath citi analyst thanks good morning mike can you help us with sizing the release of the redundant reserves from the life business that you mentioned in your prepared remarks michael smith chief financial officer and interim chief risk officer sure suneet i think the way to think about it is we ve given guidance on the conversion of income into cash and that s rough numbers think of that is 150 million per year over the next five to six years and so when you add that up there is left the delta between that total and the 1 billion that we ve guided to 1 billion plus i think our expectation is that the redundant reserve release will close much of that gap i want to be a little careful not to get too far ahead we re still in discussions with third parties i don t want to create a ceiling for the opportunity for us but that s the way to think about it suneet kamath citi analyst okay got it and then just second on the buyback authorization the 250 million i guess through the end of the second quarter it seems like your quarterly pace of buybacks has been around 200 million maybe 250 million so just wondering if there s a change here in terms of the pace of buybacks that we should be expecting or are you prepared to roll out a new authorization if you exhaust this one before the second quarter of next year thanks rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer thanks again for the question so to be clear we have an asr in place for 236 million in the second quarter that represents the authorization that remained at the time that we entered into the asr so we use that up we discussed with our board some of our expectations for the future and authorized an additional 500 million our plan is to use the same judgment that we ve used in the past as a careful and prudent managers of shareholder capital with maintaining an eye toward delivering value to shareholders in the best way we can so we will execute on share repurchases as consistent with that and if and when we exhaust the 500 million authorization then we ll seek another authorization so i think you should not and we re definitively not trying to signal timing through these authorizations and so and that s part of the reason we ve gotten away from having an annual ask that i think people are interpreting as well that s what we re going to do in a year we re going to do what we think is prudent at the time and will proceed on that basis i think our track record speaks for itself suneet kamath citi analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of humphrey lee with dowling partners please proceed with your question humphrey lee dowling partners analyst good morning and thank you for taking my questions a question for christine so obviously inflows were very strong in investment management and especially in the institutional business my understanding is there was some clo issuance in the quarter and i was just wondering can you size the impact of the issuance and also in terms of potential pipeline in the coming quarters christine hurtsellers chief executive officer investment management certainly as far as clo flows in the first quarter we priced or settled just a little under 800 million but when we think about clos they re an important part of our business mix they were 10 of our gross sales last year so an important part of our business mix but not the only one in terms of what s really driving our organic growth because we re just seeing real interest in a range of products oftentimes you have heard me reference consultant by ratings and as an example we have 22 strategies are represented currently in consultant driven searches semifinals and finals but going back to your point about clos i d say the market clo overall kind of got a soft start to the year however we were still able to price the deal and what we re doing our outlook is for the market to continue to improve and one key thing that we re doing in clos is we priced our second euro clo last week it was eur400 million so think about 430 in dollars and so that s very encouraging as well as when you think about the european bank loan market it s grown 50 year over year and we are seeing increasing interest out of both european and asian investors to invest there and so we are also launching in june a euro fee cap ph so again i see good building interest in pipeline across our bank loan and clo products humphrey lee dowling partners analyst got it i appreciate the color and then just a clarification with mike i think you mentioned that you expect the normalized realized earnings in 2019 would be in line with 2018 whether it would be on a reported basis of 2018 or normalized basis for 2018 and if so like what are some of the drivers that keep the earnings a little bit flattish michael smith chief financial officer and interim chief risk officer i ll start with the clarification and then maybe give charlie a chance to share some of the dynamics that are driving the retirement business but the short answer is it s versus normalized from last year and that s normalized for dac unlocking and also in prepays expectations charlie you want to talk about some of the more dynamics in the business charles p nelson chief executive officer retirement and employee benefits sure i will give you a little bit more color on what we re seeing in 2019 as mike indicated in his comments beyond the legal reserve increase and the pension expense we ve had some increases in our retirement business largely due to the overall growth that we were seeing in our business and it s coming in a handful of categories if you look at it quarter one versus quarter one last year we certainly had growth and we did the acquisition last year of the pen cal record keeping capability so that wasn t in our first quarter of last year but certainly it s in this year and given us some expanded capabilities and then we ve also seen and are investing a lot in the growth just in our overall business and both in what we see and committed sales sales that are in process as well as the pipeline of rfp activity and let me give you a little more color on that just if you look at on a trailing 12 month basis through the first quarter we brought on about three times as many plans as we ve lost our first quarter sales were up 25 in full service corporate and 40 in our tax exempt quarter to quarter so we look at that and we look at the trend in particular in our distribution expansion where we ve talked in the past about how we ve been trying to drive distribution expansion and we saw some really good results for that and a good leading indicator for us for the future was that 27 of our first quarter sales in the corporate market came from new distributors new advisors and we think that s a really good sign so our pipeline of plans that are in the process of being implemented for example in our full service corporate business right now is 15 higher than it was last year in the first quarter we have been equally strong and robust an implementation process going on on a number of large record keeping wins and then we look at our kind of looking forward and we re looking at the activity in the market and we see about a 25 increase in rfps in the full service corporate market and a 40 increase in activity in the large record keeping so there s both just momentum in the business i think are largely hit net for us in the expense side and we re investing to help prepare to bring on even more business as we go forward so we re confident in achieving our investor day target of the 4 to 7 as mike said on a compound annual growth rate as we continue to drive more sales and growth in our planned sales i should say our retention which continues to be strong as well as our higher recurring deposits which had 11 this quarter we re really quite strong within the range we gave in the guidance michael smith chief financial officer and interim chief risk officer humphrey part of what charlie said what you heard from christine which you heard from rob is the reason that we are comfortable with and confident in the reaffirmation of the 10 plus eps growth rate as i mentioned on the early part of the call the early stages as we planned and expected were going to be driven by both share buyback and capital deployment but the pipeline activity in the committed sales that you heard charlie talk about rob and christine are what will be additive to that and enable us we believe to accomplish those objectives over this period humphrey lee dowling partners analyst got it it sounds like just a little bit more of transitional year kind of building up future growth opportunities that makes sense rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer indeed humphrey lee dowling partners analyst thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of andrew kligerman with credit suisse please proceed with your question andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst hi thank you very much mike i appreciate your comment just need about the timing of any considerations around block sales in the run off business but maybe you could give a little color on the interest level is there a lot of interest in reinsuring these blocks maybe i ll just leave it at that michael smith chief financial officer and interim chief risk officer andrew to be clear that the transaction that i m talking about is a financing of redundant reserves running business it s not a reinsurance transaction in the way that you re thinking about it it s we will be working with a third party we ve had a robust discussion with a number of potential third parties and we re working our way through the process of narrowing that down and ultimately entering into what we think will be an attractive agreement for both sides so that s working its way through again we expect that to be done toward the end of the year in terms of broader interest in looking for additional reinsurance opportunities we continue to be open to that i don t have any more color beyond that s going to be an opportunity for us i think over both the near and long term as the market unfolds but right now we re very focused on just managing the business as efficiently and as quickly and getting the capital out as quickly as we can andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst i see and freeing up the redundant reserves would free up an estimated how much in capital michael smith chief financial officer and interim chief risk officer if you do the math it s in the 200ish range but that s a really broad range and as i said earlier i think there a need i don t want to create a feeling to say that s what we re going to do because we are still in negotiations on the structure of the deal andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst okay and that s separate and apart from the 1 billion that you hope to event with the next inaudible michael smith chief financial officer and interim chief risk officer andrew that s a sol to get us to the 1 billion rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer that s a piece of it andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst got it ok and then just shifting over to the retirement fee levels we did a calculation q over q fourth quarter it was about 57 bps first quarter it came out to about 55 bps and just want to get a sense of were there any dynamics there that were non recurring in the quarter where do you see fee levels going in retirement rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer charlie charles p nelson chief executive officer retirement and employee benefits yes thanks you re going to see some noise in the fees from time to time in particular i think we ve managed through fee pressure within the industry and i think as you look at the and peel away the layers of what drives the changes from quarter to quarter we look at some examples of some things that may drive lower fees but also come with associated expense savings and let me give you just a couple of quick examples we see advisors switching from commissions to more a fee based approach and this will show a reduction in the revenue but it also comes with a reduction in the commission expenses as well a second example would be as plans move more and more to auto enrollment or e delivery those types of things that may come with lower revenue and associated lower expense levels so that creates some of the variance from quarter to quarter but i would come back to say that we do manage our business on a total revenue basis not by individual revenue source and are really focused on the profitability that each plan brings to us so as i step back in our retirement business i think our scale and our breadth of that market of markets that we talk about has really served us well because it gives us the scale and efficiency relative to some of the fee variances we bring a revenue a diversified mix of revenue both investment spread and the fee revenues as well so it gives us in complement i think it s complemented by the recurrent strong recurring deposit growth that we ve had an increase in average assets so i think if we look at this and any changes you see we ve got this embedded in our expectations as we go forward and remain confident in achieving the targets that we ve established at investor day andrew kligerman credit suisse analyst thank you rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer just to add to what charlie said to reinforce the point we will have surely 10 plus billion of recurring deposits this year and the stickiness of those assets in these diversity of markets we think is a real advantage as we push forward charles p nelson chief executive officer retirement and employee benefits rod that s a good point and thank you for calling that out because in our full service business when you look at our recurring deposits in the stickiness of those assets assets that left us in 2018 as an example in our full service business were with us for over 15 years and that s very very different than what you typically see in asset management in the industry operator our next question comes from the line of tom gallagher with evercore isi please proceed with your question tom gallagher evercore isi analyst good morning just a question on retirement as well the level of expenses were elevated in the quarter and i think they were higher pension expenses as well as higher expenses related to on boarding of new plans can you specify how elevated those different expense levels were whether they are expected to recur just that s my first question michael smith chief financial officer and interim chief risk officer yeah tom i ll take part this is mike i ll take part of that and then i ll turn it over to charlie for the rest at an enterprise level going forward pension costs which is the part i ll cover will be up over prior year by about 7 million a quarter pre tax and that s driven by largely the asset levels as well as some modification and our expectations for future returns so that s going to be mostly and the majority of that will hit retirement we do allocate out pension cost to the various business segments retirement will have the majority followed by investment management and then employee benefits and then charlie if you want to add more color on the rest of it rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer and tom you ve seen that with other announcements also in terms of the pension piece charlie charles p nelson chief executive officer retirement and employee benefits and thanks for pointing out tom as i mentioned in my previous question that came up a lot a large part of our growth and administrative expenses is really due to the overall growth in our business both in and just truly net adds to the business but also the plans that are in process and what we re seeing in the pipeline so we expect our quarterly run rate of the admin expenses for the remainder of the year to kind of be in that 190 million to 200 million for the remainder of 2019 and i think if you look at our business and we re certainly have brought on an off a lot but we ve got a very strong and proven track record of building scale and driving expense efficiencies as i think about what we ve accomplished with the platform consolidation the investments we ve made in digital and data and analytics that are helping us drive lower expenses and we also believe as i ve said that we have some additional upside in our next phase with more robotics and automation in the future so i kind of look at it as expense management remained strong and disciplined but we re also focused on growth and making sure that we re ready for the growth that we re bringing on and what we anticipate in the future rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer tom let me add one other piece before we get to the second question we ve made as mike talked about in our prepared remarks we have made excellent progress in our approaching the stranded cost the 230 million to 250 million over 2019 and 2020 as we discussed at investor day and again mike is giving you an update on that the fact that our pipelines are growing and growing at a faster rate than they have historically we think is a quality improvement in expense that will lead again to recurring revenue tom gallagher evercore isi analyst that makes sense rod thanks and mike just one quick follow up on that the 7 million a year of elevated quarterly pension expenses would if we finished the year at current levels would you expect that to go down in 2020 or remain the same michael smith chief financial officer and interim chief risk officer tom it s a good question keep in mind that there are two aspects of that calculation and there is asset levels and that s clearly been favorable since 12 31 and we did remeasure as of the end of january so that s our new starting point because there s a curtailment event related to the expected reduction in cost of future pension but i guess the other thing is the interest rate environment will affect the value of the liability and i think right now interest rates are meaningfully lower than they were at the end of the year i haven t done that quick check so we don t run a running tally of whether it s going to be a good or a bad guy we ll see where we are at the end of the year as we get closer we ll give you clear guidance on where we are going to be rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer and tom just to reinforce the points mike has made i mean both of those are macro issues they would affect us as they will everyone else tom gallagher evercore isi analyst understood and then just one quick one on voluntary benefits in forced growth was up substantially year over year but sales growth was more muted can you explain why such a big growth in the in force there rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer yeah i m going to throw to rob but i m very happy with the question and i m very happy that we re focusing on the growth of our employee benefit business we are very pleased with both the stop loss piece the voluntary piece and the group life piece mike mentioned in the opening remarks the 14 growth we happen to hit the 2 billion door mark rob is doing a great job of leading this and i ll let him answer the question robert l grubka president employee benefits yeah no appreciate that rod and the question around vb look at sales and then with what you repaying we ve had tremendous success in what we ve sold over the last few years and executing around the administrative aspect of it extremely well and that s really the big explainer of why the block overall is growing the way it is that s a business i just come back to you and remind folks the level of service intensity the integration and the hand offs that come into play with technology partners the ability to work with those folks and really efficient and effective ways is it s a difference maker at times i know it s easy to well what s the price what s the price but this is a business where what s the service looks like how do you execute it and that s how you build credibility especially in our portion of the market which is the middle and upsized ended the marketplace we ve got to deliver and so we know that we ve done that well and continue to expect to do that in the future rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer well you don t want to speak about any how many of the cases are adding new coverages versus replacing coverages that might be useful to the listeners robert l grubka president employee benefits yeah i think it s a good point and a little bit different than other dynamics as rod pointed now you tend to think about whether it s whatever the workplace business is whether it s retirement or the other benefits more often than not you re taking something from somebody else in this space what we saw in first quarter over half of our groups in lines of coverage that we added were actually new to the product set so they didn t have an accident product or they didn t have hospital indemnity products so on and so there still just net growth in demand for this solution and we ve talked about this at investor day the responsibility being borne by consumers today and the benefit decisions and the accountability with the growth of high deductible health plans we think it s going to be a long term driver of growth for years to come rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer tom i m going to ask rob to add one more piece we were just awarded we can t name the company but a very nice piece of voluntary business and it was particularly given both the administrative capabilities and the integrated claim capabilities and i ll let you speak of that a bit robert l grubka president employee benefits yeah thanks rod for the tee up this is an area again back to the service story and the execution where we think how do we get more connectivity across products and the leveraging now so things that we re doing from a claims management perspective with other products how does that connect to the voluntary products and make that an easy seamless experience for the consumer at the end of the day we think that overtime again that s an area of differentiation in the market and you think about what we did with the roll out of the hsa product and the ability to see consumer activity from a medical claims perspective we think there s a lot of opportunities to leverage that story further operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of john nadel with ubs please proceed with your question john nadel ubs analyst yes thanks good morning everybody so i guess i really have two questions on retirement one i don t want to put words in your mouth but it sounds i mean actually sounds very bullish that there is a lot of activity in the market and a lot of opportunity to win and so along those lines i know you guys recently won a large record keeping plan for new york city i think that s in excess of 20 billion of account value just curious when that should come on board and more broadly it sounds like your expenses are high but this is really just expenses in front of a very likely revenue growth rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer yes john let me start but charlie will jump in part of the point we re trying to make is we re building up a record year and again we re affirming our guidance go forward but the pipelines of the committed sales are robust and they are across a mix of our market over market so some of this is record keeping and that has different characteristics some of this is full service charlie will speak to both charlie charles p nelson chief executive officer retirement and employee benefits yes thanks so as i you re correct when you interpreting my comments in terms of the activity that we re seeing both on the growth on the sales as well as activity in full service as well as in our record keeping business and i mentioned the increase in the number of advisors new advisors selling with us in the first quarter and just the overall growth in our full service and both in tax exempt in corporate so we look at that activity we measure it essentially every day and every week and we re looking at the quotes that are coming in and estimating what the pipeline will be in terms of new plans and implementations and things on the record keeping front thank you for recognizing one of our large wins the city of new york which is close to about 200 000 participants and as you say about 20 billion that will be we expect that to be later part of this year like the latter part of the fourth quarter each time period we re working on the implementation as you would expect right as we speak so we re very very pleased that our value proposition has been resonating both in full service and in record keeping and that the activity is commensurate to really support a lot of the growth in the things that we re hoping for in the future operator our next question comes from the line of ryan krueger with kbw please proceed with your question ryan krueger kbw analyst thanks good morning i just had a follow up for christine on the asset management fee rate and you talked about some of the moving parts and i think some upward trajectory from new wins but just institutional looked pretty low in the quarter so just hoping you could talk a little bit about that and if there were any one off factors that impacted that rodney o martin chairman and chief executive officer christine christine hurtsellers chief executive officer investment management yes ryan on the institutional basis point aside really was a couple of things going back to what s currently funding in the first part of the year is we have more we have more than one very large over a 1 billion clients or mandates funding that started late last year and are moving into this year and sometimes as you know these large mandates may come into two or three stages so and again because of the scale and we tend to price those more competitively but they re again very highly margin accretive and also just a little bit of a nuance in the first quarter we priced a clo that s had a little bit different fee level than what we normally do for institutional flow and that was it was lower because it was a shorter term deal something the market called the inaudible deal which was the first time we ve really done it and speak in really to the strength of that franchise that in january we were able to price a clo deal so what do i mean by that clo s have reinvestment periods typically 5 years to 7 years this was shorter just one year so again because it was shorter we had a more aggressive fee there so again think about it not as a trend but really a mix of business and again number one i mean the momentum on the fixed income side is really strong if you go and take a look at our investment performance you ll see that for fixed income products our assets are outperforming peers or the benchmarks for 90 of the assets that are managed for 1 year 3 years 5 years and 10 years in fact the 5 year number is 100 so again you re going to continue to see good momentum there and as i referenced as we move into the back part of the year i expect and anticipate due to the strength in retail that we mentioned a couple of the new product launches that were going to be going through that are higher margin and then again in 2020 as pomona our private equity business gets back into the market with a new fund raise you should expect to see that the revenue in the flows move up from what you saw or we ll see in the first part of 2019 operator that is all the time we have for questions i d like to turn the call back over to rod martin for any closing remarks rodney o martin

results we had a solid start to the year with continued gsv growth and margin expansion and we are excited to share our detailed results with you what drives us day in and day out is our mission to create economic opportunities so people have better lives we continue to make progress in launching new products features and enhancements to our online talent marketplace advertisement advertisement we do this to improve the quality of the marketplace to capture more of our large addressable market opportunity and to address the needs of our most important constituents the freelancers and clients who work together on our platform on the product front we now have four marketplace offerings to help better serve the needs of our different clients upwork basic upwork plus upwork business and upwork enterprise as background historically we had two marketplace offerings upwork standard and upwork enterprise upwork standard was a self service offering targeted at sole proprietorships and small businesses while upwork enterprise is sold by our sales team and targeted at mid market and enterprise customer it became evident over time that we needed to have additional offerings to better address the needs of our diverse client base therefore in late q1 we remained upwork standard to upwork basic and launched upwork plus and upwork business i will now describe which clients each of these products is targeted at from a more most entry level products to our most advanced products upwork basic is targeted at very small businesses giving them access to our marketplace to find engage and collaborate with talents upwork plus is targeted at small businesses that wish to engage freelancers in a self service way and need the tools to stand out from the crowd and easily collaborate with co workers upwork business is targeted at mid market businesses looking for ongoing flexible access to talent that need consolidated billing and a team of advisors to help them set up their freelancer programs and upwork enterprise is focused on the largest businesses which need a more tailored product solution and hence access to premium talent and upwork and compliance services the pricing of each product offering is as follows advertisement advertisement upwork basic does not have a subscription fee but does have a client payment processing fee and administration fee of 3 up from 2 75 in the previous upwork standard offering the new 3 client fee applies to all new upwork basic clients we have a tiered freelancer service fee schedule based on cumulative lifetime billings by the freelancer to each unique client relationship using upwork basic freelancers working with clients on upwork basic typically pay us 20 for the first 500 10 for the next 9500 and then 5 for any amount over 10 000 that they bill the subscription fee for upwork plus is about 50 per month the freelancer fee is the same tiered fee as upwork basic the client fee is 3 but is waived if the client pays via ach the subscription fee for upwork business is about 500 per month with a client fee of 10 and a freelancer fee of 10 upwork enterprise pricing remains unchanged with a subscription fee that varies based on the complexity of the engagement a freelancer fee of 10 and a client fee of either 10 or 20 depending on whether the client is using our compliance offering or not so both upwork business and upwork enterprise we also offer discounted pricing for what we call bring your own freelancer or byo where the client brings their existing freelancers and agencies onto the upwork platform for freelancers brought in to the byo relationships with clients the freelancer does not pay a fee while upwork plus and upwork business are relatively newly launched we believe these additional products are one way in which we will stabilize our take rate and support future revenue growth we ve seen good early traction from these launches and one such case study is new york based lady m confections a fast growing international e commerce and brick and mortar business with 38 cake boutiques around the world their marketing team came to upwork to tap into our global talent pool of high quality professionals they selected upwork business because it was the best fit for their team in finding talent quickly and upwork handles all of the onboarding this allows their team to focus on work versus the administrative side of hiring freelancers as lady m is opening new boutiques hosting pop up experiences in new markets and growing its online community their marketing team is stepping into freelancers in local markets specifically for photography and social media needs from hawaii washington texas to asia upwork has helped them connect with freelancers quickly we are also focused on making our platform the most trusted on which to get projects done we strive to ensure that it is professional that customers are uniquely and accurately represented and that the matching process results in good outcomes for both parties our trust and safety teams continue to excel in all key pillars of identity trust marketplace quality security fraud and risk management advertisement advertisement with regard to market based quality in april we announced plans to update connects these rolling updates have begun and will continue through the end of june connects are virtual tokens within upwork that allow freelancers to bid on jobs previously a freelancer would receive 60 connects and an agency would receive 80 connects for free every month now existing freelancers will no longer receive free connects each month and newly admitted freelancers to the platform will continue to receive 20 connects to get started with the new connects launch freelancers will purchase connects for 0 15 each which is a decrease from the prior 1 per connect price to take into account the value of different projects the number of connects required to bid for our projects will vary from zero to six connects depending on the size of the project where previously every project required two connects to bid bids submitted in response to invitations from clients will continue to be free these changes in connects are aimed at helping skilled professionals win more projects we expect freelancers will submit fewer proposals focusing on projects for which they are the most qualified and most likely to win as a result clients will have a smaller selection of highly relevant proposals to review making it easier for them to identify the best talent for their project we believe this change in connects will be revenue neutral in the near term as the main objective of this change is to encourage higher quality projects and client relationships on our marketplace during last quarter s call i mentioned several of our priorities for 2019 i would like to provide a quick update on our progress against our categories domestic and enterprise initiatives in categories we ve done a lot to help freelancer differentiate themselves through their profiles you can see these today in the visual nature of some of the design and creative profiles freelancers in those categories now have the option to showcase their portfolios in a more visual fashion and in the second quarter we will expand these enhanced digital functionality to include visual portfolio search for different project types as well as which allow freelancers to showcase their images in search results advertisement advertisement also as of march all freelancers have access to specialized profiles this is particularly pertinent to freelancers who are marketing multiple skills which is the case for many freelancers by allowing each freelancer s accounts to house multiple profiles the skills most relevant to the project at hand are displayed first making for a much cleaner immediate match early indications for this feature are very positive our data shows that freelancers who take advantage of specialized profiles are invited to a project over 30 more often than those that do not one top rated freelancer anton a product designer who also leads a development agency shared with us that since specialized profiles launched many of his clients have commented positively on the new format anton provided feedback that he can better showcase his deep understanding of two different skill sets before anton felt the prior profile titles where too long and by having multiple specialized profiles now he can add specific information in each category that is directly related to what clients are looking for indications make us confident that as additional freelancers adopt specialized profiles project matching algorithms will continue to improve shifting to our domestic marketplace initiatives though on a smaller base our domestic us to us marketplace continues to perform very well we are seeing continued improvements in first job post fill rates and growth in overall project size in the us to us business our uk testing is ongoing but we have no plans to expand that beta at this point there continues to be an exciting opportunity to also address more local needs using our domestic marketplace offering where we have existing liquidity in certain of our categories for clients interested in finding freelancers within the same metropolitan area our local freelancer search option test continues in san francisco bay area los angeles and new york and has expanded to other cities including austin seattle washington dc and chicago within these markets about 50 of clients and a portion of freelancers are able to select the local search option this exposure will expand further this year to additional clients and freelancers as we amplify our efforts in select test markets in 2018 we made the decision to centralize our sales team in chicago strengthening our foundation for our enterprise sales advertisement advertisement hiring is on targets with our total sales team reaching a 120 people at the end of q1 we now have approximately 50 reps on a new business or growth quota which is an increase from around 35 reps in q1 of last year we ve come out of the gate strong in q1 exceeding our overall new business growth as we ve seen a good early traction on the upwork business product since launch we look forward to continued momentum on all of these initiatives as we head through the year as the business grows we are also driving more high level influential conversations as part of our industry leadership with that in mind yesterday we announced our first chief economist as our chief economist dr adam ozimek will drive upworks growing body of research and public data releases our goal is to help businesses better understand hiring trends health professional spot emerging trends and make our data more available to those of us working to create a more positive future of work to the last point i myself participate in the world economic forum through my role as co chair of the organization s working group on the future of work my goal is to help guide constructive conversations that steer the world toward better work scenarios in addition our chief business affairs and legal officer brian levey was recently named to the sec s newly formed small business capital formation advisory committee the committee provides a formal mechanism for the sec to receive advice and recommendations on matters relating to small businesses through these appointments brian intends to further our efforts to enhance market based efficiencies and unlock economic opportunities for entrepreneurs across all regions of the united states and with that i will turn the call to our cfo brian kinion brian kinion chief financial officer advertisement advertisement thank you stephane and good afternoon everyone i will start with a brief update on our key operating metrics then i will discuss both our financial results for the first quarter of 2019 and our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2019 which we included in our earnings release earlier today please note that numbers are rounded for the sake of convenience and unless noted otherwise comparisons of the first quarter of 2019 or to the first quarter of 2018 i will be referring to gaap measures unless explicitly cited as a non gaap measure we monitor and measure our business performance using the following key operating metrics gross services volume or gsv core client and client spend retention we believe these metrics are key indicators of our growth and the overall health of our business gsv which includes both client spend and additional fees we charge for other value added services increased by 21 in the first quarter to 487 million we continue to drive gsv with year over year increases in both core clients and client spend retention the number of core clients increased by 22 to approximately 111 000 as of march 31st 2019 client spend retention was 107 on a trailing 12 month basis as of march 31st 2019 compared to 103 as of march 31st 2018 this is consistent with our expectation that client spend retention will stabilize in the 106 to 108 range for the near term we continue to focus on increasing spend from our expanding base of clients on the platform these key operational metrics in mind i will now turn to our financial results total revenue increased by 16 to 68 9 million in the first quarter marketplace revenue increased by 17 to 60 9 million representing 88 of our total revenue for the first quarter growth in marketplace revenue continues to be driven by an increase in the number of core clients and our client spend retention this is evidenced by strength from our small business customers our focus on customized experience for categories for tailored features and functionalities growth from our us to us domestic marketplace offering and an increase in spend from clients using our enterprise offering as a reminder we have a long standing client that use our managed services offering and we recognize the entire gsv of their projects as revenue managed services revenue increased by 10 to 8 million in the first quarter primarily due to an increase in the amount of freelancers services engaged by this client managed services has grown at a slower rate than our marketplace revenue and we anticipate this trend to continue total revenue of 68 9 million was at high end of our guidance range of 68 million to 69 million advertisement advertisement as we noted in our q4 earnings call in february there are several factors to keep in mind with regard to our revenue growth in 2019 one we were lapping the us to us domestic marketplace launch in our first and second quarters of 2019 which makes for a higher year over year comparison two the number of mondays in any given quarter impacts our sequential and year over year revenue growth rates as the most work in a given week is typically completed on a monday which is also the day we recognize our client payment processing administration fee each week the first quarter of 2019 had 12 mondays whereas the first quarter of 2018 had 13 and the fourth quarter of 2018 had 14 third we ve currently elected to spread our marketing investment in acquisition spend in brand awareness more evenly throughout 2019 as compared to our past practice spending disproportionately in the first quarter while we feel this was the right decision to acquire customers at a lower cost it will impact revenue growth in the short term our take rate which we define as revenue divided by gsv was 14 2 in the first quarter roughly consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018 as noted on our previous calls we expected a slight deceleration in take rate as a result of a long term strategy to align our incentives with one the freelancers that have longer term client relationships and now bill at the 5 fee tier and two clients that continue to adopt ach as a payment method which waves the payment processing and administration fee as mentioned earlier that fee will only be waved for paid subscribers of the newly introduced upwork plus product long term we believe freelancers billing at the 5 tier reduces friction and clients adopting ach encourages larger and longer projects as stephane described freelancer additional value added products to offset some of the take rate deceleration and to increased spend and revenue on our platform we have many levers to increase take rate and we will use them assuming it s beneficial for the health of the platform new product offerings of upwork plus and upwork business are examples of these types of levers non gaap gross profit in the first quarter increased by 21 to 47 9 million we are focused on driving gross margin leverage non gaap gross margin was 70 for the first quarter up from 67 in the first quarter of 2018 gross margins are influenced by multiple factors but primarily by payment processing cost while increased ach adoption puts downward pressure on take rate and revenue it positively impacts our gross margin gross margin is also impacted by our spend on aws which is driven by gsv we continue to focus on growing revenue than our aws cost in the near term and have been successful in achieving this for the last two quarters finally our cost of revenue to provide managed services constitute a drag on our gross margin which becomes less meaningful as our marketplace revenue continues to grow faster than our managed services offering turning to operating expenses non gaap sales and marketing expenses increased by 3 to 19 9 million in the first quarter representing 29 of total revenue compared to 33 in the first quarter of 2018 we also plan to spend significantly more in marketing and advertising in 2019 as compared to 2018 we believe this will allow us to acquire customers on a lower cost to drive brand awareness and attract new users throughout the year we intend to expand our sales team throughout the year in order to execute on our plans to land and expand across mid market and enterprise customers non gaap r d expenses in the first quarter increased by 11 to 14 4 million representing 21 of total revenue compared to 22 in the first quarter of 2018 in 2019 we plan to continue focusing our efforts in developing new products and features such as those in categories for improved profiles and portfolios as well as our continued mobile first transformation we believe continued investment in r d is important for long term strategic objectives non gaap g a expenses in the first quarter increased by 32 to 12 6 million representing 18 of total revenue compared to 16 in the first quarter of 2018 these increases were primarily due to our investments in finance accounting and legal to support being a public company we expect sales and marketing r d and g a expenses to increase in absolute dollars although as a percentage total revenue they may fluctuate from period to period we continue to see improvement from our provision for transaction losses transaction losses decreased by 50 to 0 6 million in the first quarter representing approximately 1 of total revenue this is below our normal range of 2 to 3 of total revenue we expect our reserves to return to our normal range and increased proportionately as our gsv grows net loss was 4 7 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a net loss of 6 8 million in the first quarter of 2018 for the first quarter our basic and diluted net loss per common shares outstanding was 0 04 on a 106 6 million shares non gaap net income was 0 5 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a non gaap net loss of 3 9 million in the first quarter 2018 our basic and diluted non gaap net income share in the first quarter of 2019 was breakeven compared to a net loss per share of 0 11 in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda key metric for us in operating the business was 1 2 million in the first quarter compared to a negative adjusted ebitda of 3 1 million in the first quarter of 2018 we exceeded our adjusted ebitda margin guidance primarily due to gross margin leverage and lower transaction losses we continue to take a long term view and balance investing sustainable profitable growth while building upon our leadership position that is very large and expanding addressable market opportunity moving to the balance sheet and cash flows we ended the quarter with 121 2 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to 129 1 million at december 31st 2018 as of december 31st 2018 and march 31st 2019 we had 24 million in debt outstanding from our two term loans we also temporally do down 25 million from our revolving line of credit to provide working capital to fund our marketplace accounts receivable as of march 31st 2019 which was a sunday as a licensed escrow agent we were required to fund the trust with our operating cash if there s ever a shortage due to the timing of cash receipts from clients for completed hourly billings we repaid the 25 million revolver on the first day of the second quarter please note that the quarter ending june 30 2019 also ends on a sunday and therefore you should expect us to use the revolving line of credit in a similar fashion as we did this quarter and prior quarters that fell on a sunday we used 29 4 million in cash for operating activities in the first quarter which was largely driven by the shift of operating cash to fund our escrow obligations related to the sunday effect that i just mentioned we used 76 3 million in investing activities during the first quarter primarily related to the purchases of 71 7 million of marketable securities and approximately 1 6 million to start the build out of our new santa clara headquarters cash provided by financing activities for the first quarter was 25 8 million primarily due to the temporary draw down from our revolving credit line discussed previously as a reminder our first principal payment to pay down the term loans began in april 2019 to note we will be incurring additional one time capital expenditures of approximately 5 million and 500 000 in the second and third quarter of 2019 respectively to complete the build out of the santa clara office due to our long standing mountain view lease expiring in the second quarter before turning to guidance as noted previously we are lapping the launch of domestic us to us marketplace during the first half of 2019 we are also spreading our marketing spend evenly throughout 2019 for the second quarter 2019 we expect revenue in the range of 72 5 million to 73 5 million we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of breakeven to positive 1 of revenue and weighted average common shares outstanding to be in the range of 109 million to 111 million for the second quarter we are on track with our plans and expect revenue growth to accelerate across the third and fourth quarters and full year revenue in the range of 299 million to 304 million or 19 year over year growth as a midpoint of this range we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of breakeven to approximately 1 of revenue and weighted average common shares outstanding to be in the range of 109 million and 114 million for the full year and now i ll turn it to stephane for closing comments stephane kasriel chief executive officer thank you brian our first quarter performance puts us on a solid trajectory to achieve our plans for 2019 and beyond we continue to lead both our business and our industry ahead as we fulfill our vision to connect businesses with great talent to work without limits we are confident in the strategic initiatives we ve set for long term growth and pleased with our progress against them and with that we will now take your questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from mark mahaney with rbc capital markets your line is open mark mahaney hey guys this is inaudible chipping on for mark stephane i saw you exchange some comments on twitter responding to vc about the growing opportunity of hiring tech talent outside the bay area especially for newer private companies how do you see upwork plus and upwork business addressing those opportunities that jack dorsey bill gurley and you were tweeting about this weekend and a follow up for brian on the core clients this is the highest quarterly sequential increase we ve seen with 6 000 core client net adds is there anything in particular there that team has been focusing on or is this just in the natural progression of the business maybe anything from early adoption of upwork plus or upwork business thank you stephane kasriel chief executive officer so sure thank you for the question i m happy to take the first one there has been a growing trend of what some people in the industry call distributed companies or remote first companies which in some cases don t even have an office anymore and we ve always thought this was a big part of the destiny of this company was to enable businesses that are based in new york and silicon valley which are two of our top cities in the world who really struggle to find good talent locally because the competition is so high to be able to hire great talent from elsewhere in the us and globally and what s been happening over the last few years is the cost of living in the bay area in new york and in other places continues to grow faster than most people s income and so increasingly people are struggling to move to san francisco move to the bay area and companies conversely are increasingly really struggling to find the talent in the bay area so a few years ago when i talked to vc is part of the reason why i replied to bill i mean bill is a vc benchmark who happens to be one of our inaudible historically when we would have these conversations with vc years ago they would say well that s crazy how could you possibly find great talent how could you possibly build a good culture how could you be productive et cetera et cetera if your company is distributed this doesn t this doesn t scale that s not how google operates that s not how microsoft operates therefore that s not how portfolio companies are going to operate but now you at the stage where you have companies like us about 1500 people globally only 400 or so are in an office and more than 1 000 are working from home and we re not the only ones you see this with this basecamp you see this with automattic the company that deals wordpress you see this with mozilla which is firefox you see these with the wikimedia foundation and over the last few weeks we ve seen skype announcing that they have four development centers and they ve been looking to open up a fifth one and after looking all over the world they ve decided the fifth one was going to be distributed meaning their fifth development office is the cloud and i think you re going to see that as an increasing trend and obviously for our part that s a huge opportunity that is what we allow companies to do plus and business specifically are really taking this to the next level historically what we would hear from growing companies is upwork basic was too basic for them if you will and upwork enterprise was too complicated for them and there was kind of missing middle if you will we have this barbell approach to product development and now we say well there s clearly four different segments of customers and we re going to have four different offerings for the four segments brian kinion chief financial officer and then jack your question on core clients the core clients has actually grown 22 year over year for the last four quarters we ve been quarter over quarter about 5 growth rates we ve been adding about 5 000 every quarter over the last year it s too early on the upwork business to see anything there because it was launched in q1 so you d hope to see that come throughout the year though mark mahaney great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from brent thill with jefferies please proceed brent thill jefferies analyst thanks just in terms of the back end loaded year on revenue can you maybe just talk through what you re seeing there and just from the mid market products can you just maybe address what you re seeing i know it s super early but the talk through kind of of trajectory and that adoption what you see currently thank you stephane kasriel chief executive officer sure yes i mean there is a combination of a few things right i mean some of which is just this whole thing about number of mondays i mean there s nothing really magical about this other than we make more money on mondays and so when there s more mondays in a quarter we make more money and when comparatively to the previous year or the previous quarter if you re looking at quarter over quarter or year over year the number of mondays changes it also has an impact on the numbers so that s one thing second one was a decision we made which i mentioned on the previous call a decision we made to spread investment in marketing more evenly throughout the year and the rationale behind this being that the lifetime value of accounts that we signed in q2 or in q3 is similar to the lifetime value of accounts that we sign up in q1 meanwhile if we spend more money q1 and q2 or q3 then the cost of acquisition ends up being higher so the cac to ltv ratio we believe is going to be maximized by spreading marketing investments through the year unfortunately in the short term what that does is depressing the numbers a little bit because instead of acquiring tons of clients in q1 that would then spend through the year we re going to be we acquire fewer clients in q1 and relatively speaking we re going to acquire more clients in q4 and so that s leading to a progressive acceleration of the business through the year the same thing which we mentioned last time is the lapping of a great year last year with the the domestic launch and so this really hurts us more in q1 and q2 and less in q3 and q4 but i think the short answer to your question is the overall plan for the year is on track which is why we are renewing our guidance with pretty much the same that we said last time and i would add again that one of the things that s pretty clear about this business is how predictable it is right and so we tend to have really good visibility into what the client spend retention is going to look like what the core client number is going to be like and these are the two metrics that drive us for the rest of the year and so you asked the question about mid market product i mean these are like long term investments i would say the initial launch is performing better than we expected but it s only small number in a few weeks currently the guidance that we re providing is taking into account all of these launches upwork business upwork plus the changing connects all of that stuff is embedded in there but i would say these are multi year type of bets very much like the investment in local is not going to have a huge impact for 2019 but we think over the long run we ll have a really really big impact for the business and then the last point i would add is we really had a very deliberate effort in managing the costs of amazon web services which we are seeing a lot of leverage from right now and the other thing that is kind of hurting take rates but improving gross margin is the switch from credit card to ach which we think for the overall system is a really good thing or ultimately money that goes to the credit card companies does not benefit either upwork or the clients or the freelancer but it does have an adverse impact on the take rates which we then make up in the gross margin and that s why when you look at gross profit growing faster than revenue this quarter it s the combination of these two things essentially right let s inaudible cost as a percentage of revenue and more ach as a percentage of gsv operator thank you and our next question comes from mark may with citi please proceed mark may citi analyst sorry i was on mute there on the client side the hiring side any interesting changes and the type of clients maybe on the new client side that you re seeing from a mix perspective maybe not but just curious if you are and then i know you provided revenue retention growth rate of course but just wondered if there s anything else that you d add in terms of client retention trends that you re seeing recently thank you stephane kasriel chief executive officer sure so i would say we have a deliberate effort in the company to try to go after bigger companies right so historically if you go back three or four years ago before we had a way of segmenting our user base if you signed up with a yahoo or gmail address or if you signed up with an email address that matched a fortune 500 company we would treat you the same and because we didn t know the difference from an acquisition marketing standpoint we would spend the same amount of money to acquire both as we became more sophisticated it became clear that having a good segmentation was really essential and we are spending much more time thinking about the larger companies i mean definitely the ones that are 10 employees and above but frankly mostly the ones that are 50 employees and above then the people that sign up with yahoo and gmail address so yes overtime we see fewer individuals and fewer sole proprietors and a smaller contribution of them to the overall business which is part of the way we ve improved client spend retention as you can imagine bigger companies tend to retain significantly better than very small businesses so that is a very deliberate approach the other thing that s been happening over the last three years or so is a shift from more of the business being cross border to more of the business being domestic and that s been this success that the domestic marketplace has been and it s been really good for everybody because freelancers in the u s no longer compete against freelances overseas so they re able to have higher rates clients in the u s that otherwise would not be interested in upwork because they felt it was risky to hire people overseas are now spending incrementally and then for us because the hourly rates tend to be higher and our take rate is the same we end up making more money for the same project right so it s been a pretty big win all around and then overall i mean what you see in the numbers also is our international business on the client side is growing faster than the u s business so progressively we are becoming more distributed even on the buyer side not just on the freelancer side brian kinion chief financial officer and on your question for clients retention i just would say it s in the expected brand that we highlighted the 106 to 108 range nothing out of the ordinary for q1 obviously we want to increase that rate over time and a lot of what we re doing with these new products and functionalities to drive those up but this is based upon current cohorts of information we have today mark may citi analyst great thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from ron josey with jmp securities please proceed ronald josey jmp securities analyst great thanks for taking the question i just wanted to maybe just a quick follow up and then another question on the local freelance search so stephane i think in the opening remarks you were talking about the build out of the enterprise sales force and thought i heard you say you re seeing traction in the upwork business post launch upwork for business new marketplace so can you just talk about how the sales group is grouped together whatever focused on each one of these marketplace understanding that probably more on business and enterprise and then the second part of the question just with the local freelancer search options test great to see it expanding to newer markets but can you just talk about maybe the kpis here that give you confidence to expand to these newer markets thank you stephane kasriel chief executive officer sure so maybe starting with the first one the way the sales team is organized is by segments not by products reps only book of business so we have mid market reps that manage companies between 100 and 1000 employees we have large account reps that manage a book of business of companies from 1 000 plus and then we have strategic reps that handle a subset of the fortune 500 if you will as you can imagine the strategic reps are much more likely to be selling upwork enterprise and the mid market reps are now much more likely to be selling upwork business but the goal of the rep is to identify what is the best solution for the customer we just gave them more options to choose from and i think what we ll see because we believe the sales cycle is going to be a lot shorter and the price is obviously a lot lower i think we ll see increased adoption by the mid market segments of the upwork business solution even if later once they ve grown to a certain scale they decide to upgrade to upwork enterprise and then for freelancer search i mean i would say at this stage it s a combination of the data that we have if we believe we have enough density of supply and demand in a given metropolitan areas then it makes sense to launch it but it s also our ability to test and run multiple experiments at the same time so we started maybe a little bit conservatively with just a handful of cities and given that the kpis we re looking at right now which are things like do we get incremental post that we re not getting before are they getting filled do the jobs tend to bill as much as we think they would bill for instance do we get disintermediated would be an example question we would look at and generally does this almost micro marketplace look healthy does it have liquidity are the buyers finding what they want is the quality high just the repeat business happen the way we would expect it to and if so then we go and expand it ronald josey jmp securities analyst super helpful thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from nandan amladi with guggenheim partners please proceed nandan amladi guggenheim partners analyst hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question so as you roll out these new marketing plans how much effort are you spending on attracting freelancers versus businesses and enterprises you talked about how your sales teams are structured can you talk a little bit about your efforts from the freelancer side stephane kasriel chief executive officer yeah i mean overall if you look at the macro level we remain very supply very demand constraint very oversupplied in terms of number of freelancers every day there s over 10 000 people who apply to join upwork as freelancers and we only have jobs for about 2 of them and so in some emerging categories we may find that the supply level is not high enough the way we see it usually is because the fill rates on those jobs is low for the most part freelancers existing freelancers will have adjacent skill to figure this out on their own and they teach themselves the skills if they don t figure this out on their own then we may nudge them a little bit to acquire the skills but it s very rare that we ll have a dedicated sales and marketing effort to try to get more freelancers on the platform it s happening organically through word of mouth right i mean fundamentally if you are a freelancer in the middle of the country in the u s or abroad you have access to better jobs that pay a lot more money that give you more flexibility and more freedom has really not to like about being successful on upwork the tough thing the thing that keeps us up at night is we just don t have enough jobs for people which is why we turn down 98 of people and these are people with a college degree right over 80 of our user base our freelancers that have a college degree so if you just look at the u s alone we ll have close to a million co educated americans that will try to join upworks this year and we don t have jobs for the vast majority of them so the reason why we spend a lot of money on sales and marketing relatively speaking on the client side compared to the freelancer side is because of the imbalance between supply and demand nandan amladi guggenheim partners analyst thank you and anything to note with your partnership with microsoft that you launched last quarter stephane kasriel chief executive officer yeah we re getting a lot of really really good traction with it i would say existing upwork enterprise customers are really interested i mean as you can imagine many large enterprises are microsoft customers and so they re very interested in essentially taking all the best practices that microsoft had internally in learning how to use upwork as well as the integration which deals with power bi and microsoft teams and microsoft flow etcetera etcetera and they re getting deployed at an increasing number of our enterprise clients as well as i would say the other happy thing that s been happening is microsoft has been also sending us a lot of leads that they get on their end from office 365 customers that are saying hey we ve been thinking about using upwork for long time can you get us connected with freelancers inaudible to the upwork product but it s early days right this is going to be a very long journey hopefully full of other product integrations and a lot more joint marketing and joint sales opportunities nandan amladi guggenheim partners analyst right thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from marvin fong with btig please proceed marvin fong btig analyst great good afternoon thank you for taking my questions so two questions i guess the first one brian if you could just help us on the shape of the potential pressure on take rate do you think that the first quarter we have seen the worst of the pressure or do you have a view on that and then the second question is just on the new products if you can give us some additional color on how you think about the opportunity between basic and plus like how much of your the client base that was formerly on standard might be addressed by the upwork plus product and just as a second follow up on that are you guys now set with your go to market with these four different membership plans thank you brian kinion chief financial officer okay so on take rate there s multiple elements that impact take rate so the freelancer tiered service fee as more people get to the 5 that s still a pressure but it makes it much more secure than the platform which helps our client spend retention than our core clients you ve also got the ach adoption as another option that s pressure on take rate as well as revenue but again drives gsv on the platform so these new products have different take rates from the perspective of obviously a plus having a 3 is a little bit of a lift the business is a higher take rate and so as a result we implement these things to try to stabilize take rate but there s always a lot of moving parts in here and as more customers get to the enterprise that s also got a higher take rate as well so i would say you probably see a little deceleration but we re working on trying to stabilize it but our focus really is on driving gsv growth and being profitable and being able to take the product question is on the products basic and plus stephane kasriel chief executive officer the adoption of basic versus plus i mean like in an ideal world i mean the way we ve tried to build a product is that we have four segments of customers four products and everybody selects exactly the right product for them obviously we can t possibly know exactly what every customer is unique and every need is unique and so the mapping may not be exact but nonetheless i think what we said at the time of the ipo about 80 of our business is done with companies that are 100 employees or less many of them in that plus segment a big part of the gsv is there and so we think progressively we are going to see people that are currently on upwork standard which eventually will be discontinued as a product they ll have to choose whether they get the upwork basic product which is a scaled down version of upwork standard or whether they upgrade to upwork plus which is a scaled up version of upwork standard so we re going to have people make an explicit choice and obviously they can upgrade or downgrade from there i think over time we ll get massive adoptions of upwork plus but this is early days and we ll probably need to have quite a few iterations from a product standpoint and possibly from a pricing standpoint before we completely get it right and i would say the go to market itself is in version 1 1 and that s going to be many iterations of that as well marvin fong btig analyst great thank you for taking my questions thanks operator thank you and this concludes our q a session ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation in today s conference this concludes the program you may now disconnect everyone have a great day duration 50 minutes call participants palmira gerlach

million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 54 million for the first quarter of 2018 operating income excluding mark to market adjustments decreased primarily due to a reduction in margin

not be as favorable to the uk as they are now and this would discourage investment in the uk and ultimately mean that uk workers were less productive than they would have been if the uk had stayed in the eu also niesr economist garry young said leaving the eu for a customs union will make it more costly for the uk to trade with a large market on our doorstep particularly in services which make up 80 percent of our economy rbnz orr get ahead of the curve with this week s rate cut rbnz governor adrian orr toned down the chance of another rate cut after yesterday s as he addressed a parliamentary

slowed growth has come off rapidly in europe in china though that s stabilized more recently and australia so key trading partners separately orr also told the morning report that the cut was sensible as our forward projection a lower rate and the question for the committee was do we wait or do we move now orr said moving now is the best choice for us as far as we consider because it means we get

and cash equivalents and short term investments of 11 8 million maintain annual capital and exploration spending estimates on a company wide basis suspending nevada production and cost estimates pending results of comprehensive review because of greens creek s exceptional performance hecla s first quarter was largely as expected financially said phillips s baker jr hecla s president and ceo greens creek exceeded expectations for both gold and silver production due to higher grades and recoveries however casa berardi and our nevada operations both produced less cash flow than expected casa berardi s gold production was lower in part due to lower grades which were expected and also due to the lower mill throughput resulting from some temporary issues in the mill that have now been addressed and we expect results to improve over the rest of the year mr baker continued while nevada operations had better development advance rates the operating metrics including cost grade and negative cash flow were unacceptable we are reviewing our nevada operations to determine the best path forward and expect the results of this review in the second quarter in the meantime we are suspending our annual nevada estimates for production and cost we are maintaining our annual estimates for capital and exploration spending to maintain our liquidity and balance sheet financial

primarily impacted by losses from operations in nevada of 13 8 million due to higher costs as well as lower grades and recoveries than anticipated in addition gross profit was lower by 15 4 million at casa berardi as a result of 11 000 less gold ounces sold as compared to the first quarter 2018 about half was due to planned lower grades and the balance due to the mill maintenance activities operating cash flow of 20 0 million increased 22 over the first quarter of 2018 principally due to the timing of working capital changes offset by lower gross profit adjusted ebitda of 33 4 million decreased 40 over the first quarter of 2018 mainly due to lower margins at casa berardi and negative margins at our nevada operations 2 capital expenditures totaled 36 4 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to 20 0 million in the prior year period with the increase mainly due to the addition of the nevada operations as well as increased expenditures at san sebastian of 1 5 million and

of gold were produced compared to 1 9 million ounces and 13 118 ounces respectively in the first quarter of 2018 the increase was the result of higher silver and gold grades and recoveries partially offset by reduced ore throughput the mill operated at an average of 2 298 tons per day tpd in the first quarter compared to 2 349 the first quarter of 2018 the cost of sales for the first quarter was

24 per silver ounce compared to 0 59 in the first quarter of 2018 5 the per ounce silver costs were higher primarily due to lower by product metals prices and production as well as higher onsite power

pillar emcp pit compared to 40 177 ounces in the first quarter of 2018 the decrease was expected due to lower grades and to lower mill throughput and recovery as a result of adjustments to mill components to accommodate a higher throughput and the requirement for a new carbon in leach cil drivetrain which is being installed in early may the shortfall in production in the first quarter is expected to be made up over the remainder of the year the mill operated at an average of 3 664 tpd in the first quarter a decrease of 5 compared to the first quarter of 2018 the cost of sales was 49 1 million and the cash cost after by product credits per gold ounce was 1 113 compared to 49 2 million and 827 respectively in the first quarter of 2018 4 6 the increase in cash cost after by product credits per gold ounce is mainly due to lower gold production the lower production partially offset by lower capital spending resulted in higher aisc after by product credits of 1 338 per gold ounce compared to 1 086 in the first quarter of 2018 5 san sebastian mine mexico at the san sebastian mine 441 079 ounces of silver and 3 530 ounces of gold were produced in the first quarter compared to 512 192 silver ounces and 4 513 gold ounces in the prior year period the decreases were due to lower grades as expected upon transitioning to increased throughput coming from underground mine material versus higher grade open pit the mill operated at an average of 494 tpd in the first quarter a 29 increase over the first quarter of 2018 the cost of sales was 12 4 million for the first quarter and the cash cost after by product credits was 11 23 per silver ounce compared to 5 8 million and 2 81 respectively in the first quarter of 2018 4 the cash cost after by product credits increased due to lower silver production and lower by product gold production the aisc after by product credits was 16 55 per silver ounce compared to 8 37 in the first quarter of 2018 principally due to the same factors along with higher capital spending partially offset by lower exploration costs 5 a review of the sulfide ore continues including a bulk sample to test the capabilities of the third party plant

amount 15 8 million was for development at fire creek and hollister including 4 2 million for the hatter graben decline the company is demobilizing the mining contractor mining some previously developed remnant stopes at midas and considering other alternatives to reduce the cash spend and improve the cash flow at the nevada operations some of the possible alternatives include third party processing reducing development and changing grade control procedures pending the outcome of the review the annual production and cost estimates for nevada are being suspended lucky friday mine idaho silver production of 173 627 ounces increased 74 over the prior year period mainly due to a shift in focus from development to production by the salaried staff cost of sales for the first quarter was 2 2 million compared to 4 1 million in the first quarter of 2018 with the decrease resulting from lower sales volume due to the timing of concentrate shipments the higher level of production is helping to defray more costs associated with the strike at lucky friday than originally anticipated the mine recently celebrated two years of operations without a restricted work duty injury rwdi or lost time injury lti the construction of the remote vein miner rvm continues in sweden and delivery is expected in the first half of 2020 exploration exploration including corporate development

operating performance it also allows the benchmarking of performance of each mine versus those of our competitors as a silver and gold mining company management also uses the statistic on an aggregate basis aggregating the greens creek lucky friday and san sebastian mines to compare performance with that of other silver mining companies and aggregating casa berardi and nevada operations to compare performance with other gold companies similarly the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic metallurgical and operating characteristics in addition the company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program cash cost

economics of our operations and performance compared to other producers and in the investor s visibility by better defining the total costs associated with production similarly the statistic is useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as it provides a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic metallurgical and operating characteristics in addition the company may use it when formulating performance goals and targets under its incentive program 6 cash cost after by product credits per gold ounce is only applicable to

after the date of this news release or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events except as may be required under applicable securities laws investors should not assume that any lack of update to a previously issued forward looking statement constitutes a reaffirmation of that statement continued reliance on forward looking statements is at investors own risk cautionary statements to investors on reserves and resources reporting requirements in the united states for disclosure of mineral properties are governed by the sec and included in the sec s securities act industry guide 7 entitled description of property by issuers engaged or to be engaged in significant mining operations guide 7 although the sec has recently issued new rules rescinding guide 7 the new rules are not binding until january 1 2021 and at this time the company still reports in accordance with guide 7 however the company is also a reporting issuer under canadian securities laws which require estimates of mineral resources and reserves to be prepared in accordance with canadian national instrument 43 101 ni 43 101 ni 43 101 requires all disclosure of estimates of potential mineral resources and reserves to be disclosed in accordance with its requirements such canadian information is included herein to satisfy the company s public disclosure obligations under regulation fd of the sec and to provide u s holders with ready access to information publicly available in canada reporting requirements in the united states for disclosure of mineral properties under guide 7 and the requirements in canada under ni 43 101 standards are substantially different this document contains a summary of certain estimates of the company not only of proven and probable reserves within the meaning of guide 7 but also of mineral resource and mineral reserve estimates estimated in accordance with the definitional standards of the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum referred to in ni 43 101 under guide 7 the term reserve means that part of a mineral deposit that can be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination the term economically as used in the definition of reserve means that profitable extraction or production has been established or analytically demonstrated to be viable and justifiable under reasonable investment and market assumptions the term legally as used in the definition of reserve does not imply that all permits needed for mining and processing have been obtained or that other legal issues have been completely resolved however for a reserve to exist hecla must have a justifiable expectation based on applicable laws and regulations that issuance of permits or resolution of legal issues necessary for mining and processing at a particular deposit will be accomplished in the ordinary course and in a timeframe consistent with hecla s current mine plans the terms measured resources indicated resources and inferred resources are canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with ni 43 101 these terms are not defined under guide 7 and are not normally permitted to be used in reports and registration statements filed with the sec in the united states except where required to be disclosed by foreign law the term resource does not equate to the term reserve under guide 7 the material described herein as indicated resources and measured resources would be characterized as mineralized material and is permitted to be disclosed in tonnage and grade only not ounces the category of inferred resources is not recognized by guide 7 investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of the mineral deposits in such categories will ever be converted into proven or probable reserves resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of such a resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category or will ever be economically extracted investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of a resource exists or is economically or legally mineable investors are also especially cautioned that the mere fact that such resources may be referred to in ounces of silver and or gold rather than in tons of mineralization and grades of silver and or gold estimated per ton is not an indication that such material will ever result in mined ore which is processed into commercial silver or gold qualified person qp pursuant to canadian national instrument

san sebastian and casa berardi units for the three month periods ended march 31 2019 and 2018 cash cost after by product credits per ounce is an important operating statistic that we utilize to

exploration pre development reclamation and sustaining capital current gaap measures used in the mining industry such as cost of goods sold do not capture all the expenditures incurred to discover develop and sustain silver and gold production cash cost after by product credits per ounce and aisc after by product credits per ounce also allow us to benchmark the performance of each of our mines versus those of our competitors as a silver and gold mining company we also use these statistics on an aggregate basis aggregating the greens creek lucky friday and san sebastian mines to compare our performance with that of other silver mining companies and aggregating casa berardi and nevada operations for comparison to other gold mining companies similarly these statistics are useful in identifying acquisition and investment opportunities as they provide a common tool for measuring the financial performance of other mines with varying geologic metallurgical and operating characteristics cash cost before by product credits and aisc before by product credits include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals including mining processing and other plant costs third party refining expense on site general and administrative costs royalties and mining production taxes aisc before by product credits for

turn the call over to stephane stephane kasriel chief executive officer thank you palmira good afternoon and thank you for joining us to discuss our first quarter 2019 results we had a solid start to the year with continued gsv growth and margin expansion and we are excited to share our detailed results with you what drives us day in and day out is our mission to create economic opportunities so people have better lives we continue to make progress in launching new products features and enhancements to our online talent marketplace we do this to improve the quality of the marketplace to capture more of our large addressable market opportunity and to address the needs of our most important constituents the freelancers and clients who work together on our platform on the product front we now have four marketplace offerings to help better serve the needs of our different clients upwork basic upwork plus upwork business and upwork enterprise as background historically we had two marketplace offerings upwork standard and upwork enterprise upwork standard was a self service offering targeted at sole proprietorships and small businesses while upwork enterprise is sold by our sales team and targeted at mid market and enterprise customer it became evident over time that we needed to have additional offerings to better address the needs of our diverse client base therefore in late q1 we remained upwork standard to upwork basic and launched upwork plus and upwork business i will now describe which clients each of these products is targeted at from a more most entry level products to our most advanced products upwork basic is targeted at very small businesses giving them access to our marketplace to find engage and collaborate with talents upwork plus is targeted at small businesses that wish to engage freelancers in a self service way and need the tools to stand out from the crowd and easily collaborate with co workers upwork business is targeted at mid market businesses looking for ongoing flexible access to talent that need consolidated billing and a team of advisors to help them set up their freelancer programs and upwork enterprise is focused on the largest businesses which need a more tailored product solution and hence access to premium talent and upwork and compliance services the pricing of each product offering is as follows upwork basic does not have a subscription fee but does have a client payment processing fee and administration fee of 3 up from 2 75 in the previous upwork standard offering the new 3 client fee applies to all new upwork basic clients we have a tiered freelancer service fee schedule based on cumulative lifetime billings by the freelancer to each unique client relationship using upwork basic freelancers working with clients on upwork basic typically pay us 20 for the first 500 10 for the next 9500 and then 5 for any amount over 10 000 that they bill the subscription fee for upwork plus is about 50 per month the freelancer fee is the same tiered fee as upwork basic the client fee is 3 but is waived if the client pays via ach the subscription fee for upwork business is about 500 per month with a client fee of 10 and a freelancer fee of 10 upwork enterprise pricing remains unchanged with a subscription fee that varies based on the complexity of the engagement a freelancer fee of 10 and a client fee of either 10 or 20 depending on whether the client is using our compliance offering or not so both upwork business and upwork enterprise we also offer discounted pricing for what we call bring your own freelancer or byo where the client brings their existing freelancers and agencies onto the upwork platform for freelancers brought in to the byo relationships with clients the freelancer does not pay a fee while upwork plus and upwork business are relatively newly launched we believe these additional products are one way in which we will stabilize our take rate and support future revenue growth we ve seen good early traction from these launches and one such case study is new york based lady m confections a fast growing international e commerce and brick and mortar business with 38 cake boutiques around the world their marketing team came to upwork to tap into our global talent pool of high quality professionals they selected upwork business because it was the best fit for their team in finding talent quickly and upwork handles all of the onboarding this allows their team to focus on work versus the administrative side of hiring freelancers as lady m is opening new boutiques hosting pop up experiences in new markets and growing its online community their marketing team is stepping into freelancers in local markets specifically for photography and social media needs from hawaii washington texas to asia upwork has helped them connect with freelancers quickly we are also focused on making our platform the most trusted on which to get projects done we strive to ensure that it is professional that customers are uniquely and accurately represented and that the matching process results in good outcomes for both parties our trust and safety teams continue to excel in all key pillars of identity trust marketplace quality security fraud and risk management with regard to market based quality in april we announced plans to update connects these rolling updates have begun and will continue through the end of june connects are virtual tokens within upwork that allow freelancers to bid on jobs previously a freelancer would receive 60 connects and an agency would receive 80 connects for free every month now existing freelancers will no longer receive free connects each month and newly admitted freelancers to the platform will continue to receive 20 connects to get started with the new connects launch freelancers will purchase connects for 0 15 each which is a decrease from the prior 1 per connect price to take into account the value of different projects the number of connects required to bid for our projects will vary from zero to six connects depending on the size of the project where previously every project required two connects to bid bids submitted in response to invitations from clients will continue to be free these changes in connects are aimed at helping skilled professionals win more projects we expect freelancers will submit fewer proposals focusing on projects for which they are the most qualified and most likely to win as a result clients will have a smaller selection of highly relevant proposals to review making it easier for them to identify the best talent for their project we believe this change in connects will be revenue neutral in the near term as the main objective of this change is to encourage higher quality projects and client relationships on our marketplace during last quarter s call i mentioned several of our priorities for 2019 i would like to provide a quick update on our progress against our categories domestic and enterprise initiatives in categories we ve done a lot to help freelancer differentiate themselves through their profiles you can see these today in the visual nature of some of the design and creative profiles freelancers in those categories now have the option to showcase their portfolios in a more visual fashion and in the second quarter we will expand these enhanced digital functionality to include visual portfolio search for different project types as well as which allow freelancers to showcase their images in search results also as of march all freelancers have access to specialized profiles this is particularly pertinent to freelancers who are marketing multiple skills which is the case for many freelancers by allowing each freelancer s accounts to house multiple profiles the skills most relevant to the project at hand are displayed first making for a much cleaner immediate match early indications for this feature are very positive our data shows that freelancers who take advantage of specialized profiles are invited to a project over 30 more often than those that do not one top rated freelancer anton a product designer who also leads a development agency shared with us that since specialized profiles launched many of his clients have commented positively on the new format anton provided feedback that he can better showcase his deep understanding of two different skill sets before anton felt the prior profile titles where too long and by having multiple specialized profiles now he can add specific information in each category that is directly related to what clients are looking for indications make us confident that as additional freelancers adopt specialized profiles project matching algorithms will continue to improve shifting to our domestic marketplace initiatives though on a smaller base our domestic us to us marketplace continues to perform very well we are seeing continued improvements in first job post fill rates and growth in overall project size in the us to us business our uk testing is ongoing but we have no plans to expand that beta at this point there continues to be an exciting opportunity to also address more local needs using our domestic marketplace offering where we have existing liquidity in certain of our categories for clients interested in finding freelancers within the same metropolitan area our local freelancer search option test continues in san francisco bay area los angeles and new york and has expanded to other cities including austin seattle washington dc and chicago within these markets about 50 of clients and a portion of freelancers are able to select the local search option this exposure will expand further this year to additional clients and freelancers as we amplify our efforts in select test markets in 2018 we made the decision to centralize our sales team in chicago strengthening our foundation for our enterprise sales hiring is on targets with our total sales team reaching a 120 people at the end of q1 we now have approximately 50 reps on a new business or growth quota which is an increase from around 35 reps in q1 of last year we ve come out of the gate strong in q1 exceeding our overall new business growth as we ve seen a good early traction on the upwork business product since launch we look forward to continued momentum on all of these initiatives as we head through the year as the business grows we are also driving more high level influential conversations as part of our industry leadership with that in mind yesterday we announced our first chief economist as our chief economist dr adam ozimek will drive upworks growing body of research and public data releases our goal is to help businesses better understand hiring trends health professional spot emerging trends and make our data more available to those of us working to create a more positive future of work to the last point i myself participate in the world economic forum through my role as co chair of the organization s working group on the future of work my goal is to help guide constructive conversations that steer the world toward better work scenarios in addition our chief business affairs and legal officer brian levey was recently named to the sec s newly formed small business capital formation advisory committee the committee provides a formal mechanism for the sec to receive advice and recommendations on matters relating to small businesses through these appointments brian intends to further our efforts to enhance market based efficiencies and unlock economic opportunities for entrepreneurs across all regions of the united states and with that i will turn the call to our cfo brian kinion brian kinion chief financial officer thank you stephane and good afternoon everyone i will start with a brief update on our key operating metrics then i will discuss both our financial results for the first quarter of 2019 and our guidance for the second quarter and full year 2019 which we included in our earnings release earlier today please note that numbers are rounded for the sake of convenience and unless noted otherwise comparisons of the first quarter of 2019 or to the first quarter of 2018 i will be referring to gaap measures unless explicitly cited as a non gaap measure we monitor and measure our business performance using the following key operating metrics gross services volume or gsv core client and client spend retention we believe these metrics are key indicators of our growth and the overall health of our business gsv which includes both client spend and additional fees we charge for other value added services increased by 21 in the first quarter to 487 million we continue to drive gsv with year over year increases in both core clients and client spend retention the number of core clients increased by 22 to approximately 111 000 as of march 31st 2019 client spend retention was 107 on a trailing 12 month basis as of march 31st 2019 compared to 103 as of march 31st 2018 this is consistent with our expectation that client spend retention will stabilize in the 106 to 108 range for the near term we continue to focus on increasing spend from our expanding base of clients on the platform these key operational metrics in mind i will now turn to our financial results total revenue increased by 16 to 68 9 million in the first quarter marketplace revenue increased by 17 to 60 9 million representing 88 of our total revenue for the first quarter growth in marketplace revenue continues to be driven by an increase in the number of core clients and our client spend retention this is evidenced by strength from our small business customers our focus on customized experience for categories for tailored features and functionalities growth from our us to us domestic marketplace offering and an increase in spend from clients using our enterprise offering as a reminder we have a long standing client that use our managed services offering and we recognize the entire gsv of their projects as revenue managed services revenue increased by 10 to 8 million in the first quarter primarily due to an increase in the amount of freelancers services engaged by this client managed services has grown at a slower rate than our marketplace revenue and we anticipate this trend to continue total revenue of 68 9 million was at high end of our guidance range of 68 million to 69 million as we noted in our q4 earnings call in february there are several factors to keep in mind with regard to our revenue growth in 2019 one we were lapping the us to us domestic marketplace launch in our first and second quarters of 2019 which makes for a higher year over year comparison two the number of mondays in any given quarter impacts our sequential and year over year revenue growth rates as the most work in a given week is typically completed on a monday which is also the day we recognize our client payment processing administration fee each week the first quarter of 2019 had 12 mondays whereas the first quarter of 2018 had 13 and the fourth quarter of 2018 had 14 third we ve currently elected to spread our marketing investment in acquisition spend in brand awareness more evenly throughout 2019 as compared to our past practice spending disproportionately in the first quarter while we feel this was the right decision to acquire customers at a lower cost it will impact revenue growth in the short term our take rate which we define as revenue divided by gsv was 14 2 in the first quarter roughly consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018 as noted on our previous calls we expected a slight deceleration in take rate as a result of a long term strategy to align our incentives with one the freelancers that have longer term client relationships and now bill at the 5 fee tier and two clients that continue to adopt ach as a payment method which waves the payment processing and administration fee as mentioned earlier that fee will only be waved for paid subscribers of the newly introduced upwork plus product long term we believe freelancers billing at the 5 tier reduces friction and clients adopting ach encourages larger and longer projects as stephane described freelancer additional value added products to offset some of the take rate deceleration and to increased spend and revenue on our platform we have many levers to increase take rate and we will use them assuming it s beneficial for the health of the platform new product offerings of upwork plus and upwork business are examples of these types of levers non gaap gross profit in the first quarter increased by 21 to 47 9 million we are focused on driving gross margin leverage non gaap gross margin was 70 for the first quarter up from 67 in the first quarter of 2018 gross margins are influenced by multiple factors but primarily by payment processing cost while increased ach adoption puts downward pressure on take rate and revenue it positively impacts our gross margin gross margin is also impacted by our spend on aws which is driven by gsv we continue to focus on growing revenue than our aws cost in the near term and have been successful in achieving this for the last two quarters finally our cost of revenue to provide managed services constitute a drag on our gross margin which becomes less meaningful as our marketplace revenue continues to grow faster than our managed services offering turning to operating expenses non gaap sales and marketing expenses increased by 3 to 19 9 million in the first quarter representing 29 of total revenue compared to 33 in the first quarter of 2018 we also plan to spend significantly more in marketing and advertising in 2019 as compared to 2018 we believe this will allow us to acquire customers on a lower cost to drive brand awareness and attract new users throughout the year we intend to expand our sales team throughout the year in order to execute on our plans to land and expand across mid market and enterprise customers non gaap r d expenses in the first quarter increased by 11 to 14 4 million representing 21 of total revenue compared to 22 in the first quarter of 2018 in 2019 we plan to continue focusing our efforts in developing new products and features such as those in categories for improved profiles and portfolios as well as our continued mobile first transformation we believe continued investment in r d is important for long term strategic objectives non gaap g a expenses in the first quarter increased by 32 to 12 6 million representing 18 of total revenue compared to 16 in the first quarter of 2018 these increases were primarily due to our investments in finance accounting and legal to support being a public company we expect sales and marketing r d and g a expenses to increase in absolute dollars although as a percentage total revenue they may fluctuate from period to period we continue to see improvement from our provision for transaction losses transaction losses decreased by 50 to 0 6 million in the first quarter representing approximately 1 of total revenue this is below our normal range of 2 to 3 of total revenue we expect our reserves to return to our normal range and increased proportionately as our gsv grows net loss was 4 7 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a net loss of 6 8 million in the first quarter of 2018 for the first quarter our basic and diluted net loss per common shares outstanding was 0 04 on a 106 6 million shares non gaap net income was 0 5 million in the first quarter of 2019 compared to a non gaap net loss of 3 9 million in the first quarter 2018 our basic and diluted non gaap net income share in the first quarter of 2019 was breakeven compared to a net loss per share of 0 11 in the first quarter of 2018 adjusted ebitda key metric for us in operating the business was 1 2 million in the first quarter compared to a negative adjusted ebitda of 3 1 million in the first quarter of 2018 we exceeded our adjusted ebitda margin guidance primarily due to gross margin leverage and lower transaction losses we continue to take a long term view and balance investing sustainable profitable growth while building upon our leadership position that is very large and expanding addressable market opportunity moving to the balance sheet and cash flows we ended the quarter with 121 2 million in cash cash equivalents and marketable securities compared to 129 1 million at december 31st 2018 as of december 31st 2018 and march 31st 2019 we had 24 million in debt outstanding from our two term loans we also temporally do down 25 million from our revolving line of credit to provide working capital to fund our marketplace accounts receivable as of march 31st 2019 which was a sunday as a licensed escrow agent we were required to fund the trust with our operating cash if there s ever a shortage due to the timing of cash receipts from clients for completed hourly billings we repaid the 25 million revolver on the first day of the second quarter please note that the quarter ending june 30 2019 also ends on a sunday and therefore you should expect us to use the revolving line of credit in a similar fashion as we did this quarter and prior quarters that fell on a sunday we used 29 4 million in cash for operating activities in the first quarter which was largely driven by the shift of operating cash to fund our escrow obligations related to the sunday effect that i just mentioned we used 76 3 million in investing activities during the first quarter primarily related to the purchases of 71 7 million of marketable securities and approximately 1 6 million to start the build out of our new santa clara headquarters cash provided by financing activities for the first quarter was 25 8 million primarily due to the temporary draw down from our revolving credit line discussed previously as a reminder our first principal payment to pay down the term loans began in april 2019 to note we will be incurring additional one time capital expenditures of approximately 5 million and 500 000 in the second and third quarter of 2019 respectively to complete the build out of the santa clara office due to our long standing mountain view lease expiring in the second quarter before turning to guidance as noted previously we are lapping the launch of domestic us to us marketplace during the first half of 2019 we are also spreading our marketing spend evenly throughout 2019 for the second quarter 2019 we expect revenue in the range of 72 5 million to 73 5 million we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of breakeven to positive 1 of revenue and weighted average common shares outstanding to be in the range of 109 million to 111 million for the second quarter we are on track with our plans and expect revenue growth to accelerate across the third and fourth quarters and full year revenue in the range of 299 million to 304 million or 19 year over year growth as a midpoint of this range we expect adjusted ebitda in the range of breakeven to approximately 1 of revenue and weighted average common shares outstanding to be in the range of 109 million and 114 million for the full year and now i ll turn it to stephane for closing comments stephane kasriel chief executive officer thank you brian our first quarter performance puts us on a solid trajectory to achieve our plans for 2019 and beyond we continue to lead both our business and our industry ahead as we fulfill our vision to connect businesses with great talent to work without limits we are confident in the strategic initiatives we ve set for long term growth and pleased with our progress against them and with that we will now take your questions questions and answers operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from mark mahaney with rbc capital markets your line is open mark mahaney hey guys this is inaudible chipping on for mark stephane i saw you exchange some comments on twitter responding to vc about the growing opportunity of hiring tech talent outside the bay area especially for newer private companies how do you see upwork plus and upwork business addressing those opportunities that jack dorsey bill gurley and you were tweeting about this weekend and a follow up for brian on the core clients this is the highest quarterly sequential increase we ve seen with 6 000 core client net adds is there anything in particular there that team has been focusing on or is this just in the natural progression of the business maybe anything from early adoption of upwork plus or upwork business thank you stephane kasriel chief executive officer so sure thank you for the question i m happy to take the first one there has been a growing trend of what some people in the industry call distributed companies or remote first companies which in some cases don t even have an office anymore and we ve always thought this was a big part of the destiny of this company was to enable businesses that are based in new york and silicon valley which are two of our top cities in the world who really struggle to find good talent locally because the competition is so high to be able to hire great talent from elsewhere in the us and globally and what s been happening over the last few years is the cost of living in the bay area in new york and in other places continues to grow faster than most people s income and so increasingly people are struggling to move to san francisco move to the bay area and companies conversely are increasingly really struggling to find the talent in the bay area so a few years ago when i talked to vc is part of the reason why i replied to bill i mean bill is a vc benchmark who happens to be one of our inaudible historically when we would have these conversations with vc years ago they would say well that s crazy how could you possibly find great talent how could you possibly build a good culture how could you be productive et cetera et cetera if your company is distributed this doesn t this doesn t scale that s not how google operates that s not how microsoft operates therefore that s not how portfolio companies are going to operate but now you at the stage where you have companies like us about 1500 people globally only 400 or so are in an office and more than 1 000 are working from home and we re not the only ones you see this with this basecamp you see this with automattic the company that deals wordpress you see this with mozilla which is firefox you see these with the wikimedia foundation and over the last few weeks we ve seen skype announcing that they have four development centers and they ve been looking to open up a fifth one and after looking all over the world they ve decided the fifth one was going to be distributed meaning their fifth development office is the cloud and i think you re going to see that as an increasing trend and obviously for our part that s a huge opportunity that is what we allow companies to do plus and business specifically are really taking this to the next level historically what we would hear from growing companies is upwork basic was too basic for them if you will and upwork enterprise was too complicated for them and there was kind of missing middle if you will we have this barbell approach to product development and now we say well there s clearly four different segments of customers and we re going to have four different offerings for the four segments brian kinion chief financial officer and then jack your question on core clients the core clients has actually grown 22 year over year for the last four quarters we ve been quarter over quarter about 5 growth rates we ve been adding about 5 000 every quarter over the last year it s too early on the upwork business to see anything there because it was launched in q1 so you d hope to see that come throughout the year though mark mahaney great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from brent thill with jefferies please proceed brent thill jefferies analyst thanks just in terms of the back end loaded year on revenue can you maybe just talk through what you re seeing there and just from the mid market products can you just maybe address what you re seeing i know it s super early but the talk through kind of of trajectory and that adoption what you see currently thank you stephane kasriel chief executive officer sure yes i mean there is a combination of a few things right i mean some of which is just this whole thing about number of mondays i mean there s nothing really magical about this other than we make more money on mondays and so when there s more mondays in a quarter we make more money and when comparatively to the previous year or the previous quarter if you re looking at quarter over quarter or year over year the number of mondays changes it also has an impact on the numbers so that s one thing second one was a decision we made which i mentioned on the previous call a decision we made to spread investment in marketing more evenly throughout the year and the rationale behind this being that the lifetime value of accounts that we signed in q2 or in q3 is similar to the lifetime value of accounts that we sign up in q1 meanwhile if we spend more money q1 and q2 or q3 then the cost of acquisition ends up being higher so the cac to ltv ratio we believe is going to be maximized by spreading marketing investments through the year unfortunately in the short term what that does is depressing the numbers a little bit because instead of acquiring tons of clients in q1 that would then spend through the year we re going to be we acquire fewer clients in q1 and relatively speaking we re going to acquire more clients in q4 and so that s leading to a progressive acceleration of the business through the year the same thing which we mentioned last time is the lapping of a great year last year with the the domestic launch and so this really hurts us more in q1 and q2 and less in q3 and q4 but i think the short answer to your question is the overall plan for the year is on track which is why we are renewing our guidance with pretty much the same that we said last time and i would add again that one of the things that s pretty clear about this business is how predictable it is right and so we tend to have really good visibility into what the client spend retention is going to look like what the core client number is going to be like and these are the two metrics that drive us for the rest of the year and so you asked the question about mid market product i mean these are like long term investments i would say the initial launch is performing better than we expected but it s only small number in a few weeks currently the guidance that we re providing is taking into account all of these launches upwork business upwork plus the changing connects all of that stuff is embedded in there but i would say these are multi year type of bets very much like the investment in local is not going to have a huge impact for 2019 but we think over the long run we ll have a really really big impact for the business and then the last point i would add is we really had a very deliberate effort in managing the costs of amazon web services which we are seeing a lot of leverage from right now and the other thing that is kind of hurting take rates but improving gross margin is the switch from credit card to ach which we think for the overall system is a really good thing or ultimately money that goes to the credit card companies does not benefit either upwork or the clients or the freelancer but it does have an adverse impact on the take rates which we then make up in the gross margin and that s why when you look at gross profit growing faster than revenue this quarter it s the combination of these two things essentially right let s inaudible cost as a percentage of revenue and more ach as a percentage of gsv operator thank you and our next question comes from mark may with citi please proceed mark may citi analyst sorry i was on mute there on the client side the hiring side any interesting changes and the type of clients maybe on the new client side that you re seeing from a mix perspective maybe not but just curious if you are and then i know you provided revenue retention growth rate of course but just wondered if there s anything else that you d add in terms of client retention trends that you re seeing recently thank you stephane kasriel chief executive officer sure so i would say we have a deliberate effort in the company to try to go after bigger companies right so historically if you go back three or four years ago before we had a way of segmenting our user base if you signed up with a yahoo or gmail address or if you signed up with an email address that matched a fortune 500 company we would treat you the same and because we didn t know the difference from an acquisition marketing standpoint we would spend the same amount of money to acquire both as we became more sophisticated it became clear that having a good segmentation was really essential and we are spending much more time thinking about the larger companies i mean definitely the ones that are 10 employees and above but frankly mostly the ones that are 50 employees and above then the people that sign up with yahoo and gmail address so yes overtime we see fewer individuals and fewer sole proprietors and a smaller contribution of them to the overall business which is part of the way we ve improved client spend retention as you can imagine bigger companies tend to retain significantly better than very small businesses so that is a very deliberate approach the other thing that s been happening over the last three years or so is a shift from more of the business being cross border to more of the business being domestic and that s been this success that the domestic marketplace has been and it s been really good for everybody because freelancers in the u s no longer compete against freelances overseas so they re able to have higher rates clients in the u s that otherwise would not be interested in upwork because they felt it was risky to hire people overseas are now spending incrementally and then for us because the hourly rates tend to be higher and our take rate is the same we end up making more money for the same project right so it s been a pretty big win all around and then overall i mean what you see in the numbers also is our international business on the client side is growing faster than the u s business so progressively we are becoming more distributed even on the buyer side not just on the freelancer side brian kinion chief financial officer and on your question for clients retention i just would say it s in the expected brand that we highlighted the 106 to 108 range nothing out of the ordinary for q1 obviously we want to increase that rate over time and a lot of what we re doing with these new products and functionalities to drive those up but this is based upon current cohorts of information we have today mark may citi analyst great thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from ron josey with jmp securities please proceed ronald josey jmp securities analyst great thanks for taking the question i just wanted to maybe just a quick follow up and then another question on the local freelance search so stephane i think in the opening remarks you were talking about the build out of the enterprise sales force and thought i heard you say you re seeing traction in the upwork business post launch upwork for business new marketplace so can you just talk about how the sales group is grouped together whatever focused on each one of these marketplace understanding that probably more on business and enterprise and then the second part of the question just with the local freelancer search options test great to see it expanding to newer markets but can you just talk about maybe the kpis here that give you confidence to expand to these newer markets thank you stephane kasriel chief executive officer sure so maybe starting with the first one the way the sales team is organized is by segments not by products reps only book of business so we have mid market reps that manage companies between 100 and 1000 employees we have large account reps that manage a book of business of companies from 1 000 plus and then we have strategic reps that handle a subset of the fortune 500 if you will as you can imagine the strategic reps are much more likely to be selling upwork enterprise and the mid market reps are now much more likely to be selling upwork business but the goal of the rep is to identify what is the best solution for the customer we just gave them more options to choose from and i think what we ll see because we believe the sales cycle is going to be a lot shorter and the price is obviously a lot lower i think we ll see increased adoption by the mid market segments of the upwork business solution even if later once they ve grown to a certain scale they decide to upgrade to upwork enterprise and then for freelancer search i mean i would say at this stage it s a combination of the data that we have if we believe we have enough density of supply and demand in a given metropolitan areas then it makes sense to launch it but it s also our ability to test and run multiple experiments at the same time so we started maybe a little bit conservatively with just a handful of cities and given that the kpis we re looking at right now which are things like do we get incremental post that we re not getting before are they getting filled do the jobs tend to bill as much as we think they would bill for instance do we get disintermediated would be an example question we would look at and generally does this almost micro marketplace look healthy does it have liquidity are the buyers finding what they want is the quality high just the repeat business happen the way we would expect it to and if so then we go and expand it ronald josey jmp securities analyst super helpful thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from nandan amladi with guggenheim partners please proceed nandan amladi guggenheim partners analyst hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question so as you roll out these new marketing plans how much effort are you spending on attracting freelancers versus businesses and enterprises you talked about how your sales teams are structured can you talk a little bit about your efforts from the freelancer side stephane kasriel chief executive officer yeah i mean overall if you look at the macro level we remain very supply very demand constraint very oversupplied in terms of number of freelancers every day there s over 10 000 people who apply to join upwork as freelancers and we only have jobs for about 2 of them and so in some emerging categories we may find that the supply level is not high enough the way we see it usually is because the fill rates on those jobs is low for the most part freelancers existing freelancers will have adjacent skill to figure this out on their own and they teach themselves the skills if they don t figure this out on their own then we may nudge them a little bit to acquire the skills but it s very rare that we ll have a dedicated sales and marketing effort to try to get more freelancers on the platform it s happening organically through word of mouth right i mean fundamentally if you are a freelancer in the middle of the country in the u s or abroad you have access to better jobs that pay a lot more money that give you more flexibility and more freedom has really not to like about being successful on upwork the tough thing the thing that keeps us up at night is we just don t have enough jobs for people which is why we turn down 98 of people and these are people with a college degree right over 80 of our user base our freelancers that have a college degree so if you just look at the u s alone we ll have close to a million co educated americans that will try to join upworks this year and we don t have jobs for the vast majority of them so the reason why we spend a lot of money on sales and marketing relatively speaking on the client side compared to the freelancer side is because of the imbalance between supply and demand nandan amladi guggenheim partners analyst thank you and anything to note with your partnership with microsoft that you launched last quarter stephane kasriel chief executive officer yeah we re getting a lot of really really good traction with it i would say existing upwork enterprise customers are really interested i mean as you can imagine many large enterprises are microsoft customers and so they re very interested in essentially taking all the best practices that microsoft had internally in learning how to use upwork as well as the integration which deals with power bi and microsoft teams and microsoft flow etcetera etcetera and they re getting deployed at an increasing number of our enterprise clients as well as i would say the other happy thing that s been happening is microsoft has been also sending us a lot of leads that they get on their end from office 365 customers that are saying hey we ve been thinking about using upwork for long time can you get us connected with freelancers inaudible to the upwork product but it s early days right this is going to be a very long journey hopefully full of other product integrations and a lot more joint marketing and joint sales opportunities nandan amladi guggenheim partners analyst right thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from marvin fong with btig please proceed marvin fong btig analyst great good afternoon thank you for taking my questions so two questions i guess the first one brian if you could just help us on the shape of the potential pressure on take rate do you think that the first quarter we have seen the worst of the pressure or do you have a view on that and then the second question is just on the new products if you can give us some additional color on how you think about the opportunity between basic and plus like how much of your the client base that was formerly on standard might be addressed by the upwork plus product and just as a second follow up on that are you guys now set with your go to market with these four different membership plans thank you brian kinion chief financial officer okay so on take rate there s multiple elements that impact take rate so the freelancer tiered service fee as more people get to the 5 that s still a pressure but it makes it much more secure than the platform which helps our client spend retention than our core clients you ve also got the ach adoption as another option that s pressure on take rate as well as revenue but again drives gsv on the platform so these new products have different take rates from the perspective of obviously a plus having a 3 is a little bit of a lift the business is a higher take rate and so as a result we implement these things to try to stabilize take rate but there s always a lot of moving parts in here and as more customers get to the enterprise that s also got a higher take rate as well so i would say you probably see a little deceleration but we re working on trying to stabilize it but our focus really is on driving gsv growth and being profitable and being able to take the product question is on the products basic and plus stephane kasriel chief executive officer the adoption of basic versus plus i mean like in an ideal world i mean the way we ve tried to build a product is that we have four segments of customers four products and everybody selects exactly the right product for them obviously we can t possibly know exactly what every customer is unique and every need is unique and so the mapping may not be exact but nonetheless i think what we said at the time of the ipo about 80 of our business is done with companies that are 100 employees or less many of them in that plus segment a big part of the gsv is there and so we think progressively we are going to see people that are currently on upwork standard which eventually will be discontinued as a product they ll have to choose whether they get the upwork basic product which is a scaled down version of upwork standard or whether they upgrade to upwork plus which is a scaled up version of upwork standard so we re going to have people make an explicit choice and obviously they can upgrade or downgrade from there i think over time we ll get massive adoptions of upwork plus but this is early days and we ll probably need to have quite a few iterations from a product standpoint and possibly from a pricing standpoint before we completely get it right and i would say the go to market itself is in version 1 1 and that s going to be many iterations of that as well marvin fong btig analyst great thank you for taking my questions thanks operator thank you and this concludes our q a session ladies and
