ratio was 169 the highest of the past nine years despite a 15 lower brent price versus 2018 furthermore average life of total reserves increased from 7 2 to 7 8 years organically 100 of reserve replacement was achieved emphasizing the outstanding performance of primary secondary and tertiary recovery the joint venture with oxy allowed ecopetrol to incorporate 164 mboe of proven reserves 1p in exploration the group and its partners completed the drilling of 20 wells thus exceeding the 12 well goal set for the year we had a geological success rate of 40 with eight 8 successful wells near field exploration strategy has been noteworthy allowing for short cycle reserves addition given their location near production facilities this strategy succeeded in adding over one million cumulative barrels of crude in extensive tests which were tallied to the production of the business group an important milestone for the development of the colombian offshore was the agreement signed between ecopetrol s a and shell whereby shell will acquire a 50 stake in the fuerte sur purple angel and col 5 blocks located in deepwater caribbean sea offshore colombia in the production front we met the annual goal reaching 725 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day despite operational incidents and public order difficulties faced during the year production increase leveraged on the positive drilling results and increased gas sales and marketing in october the entry into operation of the lpg1 plant of the cupiagua field was a remarkable event with an expected production of between 7 000 and 8 000 barrels daily thus escalating national supply of this energy and providing thousands of colombian families with access to energy sources our progress in energy transition and growth in gas production included the agreement signed by hocol an ecopetrol group subsidiary on november 22 2019 with chevron petroleum company to acquire its stake in the chuchupa and ballena fields located in the department of la guajira this agreement is subject to approval by the colombian superintendence of industry and commerce and future developments will be duly reported in the international front we would like to stress the signing of an agreement with shell brasil petróleo ltda to acquire a 30 stake in the gato do mato discovery located offshore in the pre salt santos basin moreover i would also like to highlight the decision of the council of state which allowed making headway in the comprehensive research pilot projects which will provide the country with invaluable information on the feasibility of developing unconventional sites in colombia during 2020 we will continue to report any progress on this front in the midstream segment the volume transported increased by 4 compared to that of 2018 allowing operational stability and positive financial results with an ebitda of ten trillion pesos which represents a 15 increase compared to previous year results furthermore the new crude transportation tariffs process was completed providing a moderate income increase for the segment during 2019 the pipeline network continued to suffer from incidents attributable to third parties however the provisional operations through the bicentennial pipeline allowed us to reduce these impacts with respect to refining during 2019 we achieved a record high average throughput of 374 thousand barrels per day in the two refineries which validates good performance despite some unscheduled operational events the joint gross margin for the downstream segment was 10 usd bbl mainly 1 liquefied petroleum gas 3 affected by the lower product prices and the strengthening of medium and heavy crude in line with the behavior of the international market as part of our efforts to contribute towards preserving the environment in 2019 we declared our commitment to reduce co2 carbon dioxide emissions by 20 for 2030 and reduce the operation s vulnerability to climate change this reduction has been ongoing for several years and in 2019 we achieved a cumulative reduction of 1 6 million tons of co2 equivalent from our direct operations through the uninterrupted implementation of energy efficiency projects the reduction of routine flare stack flaring in chichimene and the use of renewable energies in this latter front the company has the goal of incorporating approximately 300 mw of unconventional renewable energy by 2022 in line with this goal the castilla solar park was inaugurated with 21 mw of installed capacity and the construction of the san fernando solar park with 50 mw capacity is planned for 2020 which will become the largest energy self generation project developed in the country this project will prevent the emission of over 410 thousand tons of co2 into the atmosphere over the next 15 years the renewable energy goal will allow ecopetrol to increase its share in these sources from the current 5 to 20 in 2022 in january 2020 we endorsed the world bank worldled initiative zero routine flaring by 2030 as part of our decarbonization plan alternatively we continue with our commitment to offer the country cleaner fuels in december the diesel distributed in colombia had a weighted average of 10 parts per million of sulphur ppm and 110 ppm in gasoline levels below those required by the current colombian regulation of 50 ppm in diesel and 300 ppm in gasoline socio environmental investment totaled cop 245 462 million evidencing our commitment to the well being of communities and the environment on the governance front most notable is the completed orderly transition as regards to changes in our board of directors as well as the creation of the innovation and technology committee of the board which will promote further progress towards digital transformation one of the enablers of our strategy having reached in advance the most significant operational and financial milestones outlined in our business plan 2019 2021 with a company successfully operating and financially robust we are prepared to face new challenges the 2022 plan includes amongst its most significant goals i reaching production levels of 780 800 mboed ii increase reserves while maintaining the minimum organic replacement rate of 100 net of price effect iii enable an optimal throughput of the integrated refining system at a level between 370 420 mbd iv increase transported volumes to 1 10 1 25 million barrels of oil equivalent per day v invest between usd 13 17 billion which reflect a level of return on capital above 12 at plan prices maintain a strong cash flow position and a gross debt to ebitda ratio of 1 0 1 5 times which safeguards the company s investment grade and consolidate the esg strategy environmental social and governance the plan incorporates continuous portfolio optimization and appraising asset value generation we reiterate our commitment to profitably growing our production and reserves through sustainable results reducing the impact of our operations encouraging good environmental practices and promoting socio environmental development in those territories where the ecopetrol group is present felipe bayón pardo ceo

trillion the strongest of the past six years plus a historical record high ebitda of cop 31 1 trillion this performance was largely due to i higher levels of hydrocarbon production 725 mboed in 2019 as compared to 720 mboed in 2018 in line with the proposed target ii a record refining throughput of 374 mbd similar to that of 2018 despite major scheduled maintenance for their units iii a solid performance of the midstream segment which guaranteed operational continuity despite third party damages to its infrastructure iv an outstanding commercial management that enabled to materialize better oil spreads vs the brent price 5 6 usd bl in 2019 as compared to 8 5 usd bl in 2018 v savings in financial expenses due to the prepayment of debt vi a lower effective tax rate and vii a favorable devaluation environment we accomplished the above despite lower international crude and product prices in addition to this performance net profit was also supported by additional income due to the consolidation of invercolsa and the deferred tax asset associated with the acquisition of permian which offset impacts of impairment of long term assets in all segments table1 financial summary

economic performance a situation primarily caused by the escalation of the trade war between the us and china the recovery of crude oil production in libya and an unexpected increase in us crude oil inventories the above situation was partially offset by an increase of 34 in the spread in the group s crude basket in 2019 as compared to 2018 as it reached record levels in the fourth quarter and full year 2019 this was largely due to proactive commercial management that allowed the group to take advantage of market conditions and offer barrels in the most profitable markets the company continues to work towards greater stability in the quality of its export crude oils which has allowed to improve the reliability and stability of its crude oils and positioned us as a reliable heavy crude supplier in the international market refined products in 2019 the spread in the refined product basket versus the brent price remained the same as that of 2018 this was largely due to better asphalt sales prices and the behavior of diesel crack that partially offset weak gasoline prices furthermore there was a positive effect on the price due to the composition of the basket as more valuable products were sold in 2019 as compared to 2018 natural gas in 2019 the price per barrel equivalent increased 7 6 as compared to 2018 primarily due to the renewal of contracts resulting from the commercialization process of larger fields and incremental sales at prices higher than 2018 prices ecopetrol energía in 2019 ecopetrol energía sold 1 876 gwh as a result of the services rendered

amortization in q4 2019 as compared to the 4q 2018 and the 9 increase in depreciation and amortization in 2019 as compared to 2018 were in each case the result of increased investment levels primarily

9 increase in financial income for 2019 as compared to 2018 were in each case primarily due to the net effect of the following savings in financial interest of the foreign currency debt of cop 679 billion in 2019 compared to 2018 and cop 248 billion for the 4q 2019 as compared to the 4q 2018 primarily due to prepayments of debt in 2018 retroactive dividends received by us in respect of invercolsa s profits which were declared during the time the legal process was underway associated with the increase in equity interest granted to ecopetrol as a result of the favorable ruling cop 141

petroleum corp was announced for the execution of a joint plan for the development of unconventional deposits in the permian midland basin located in the state of texas usa which had its formal kick off on november 13 2019 with the closing of the transaction this partnership marks a milestone in the more than 40 year relationship between the two companies occidental has a 51 share in the jv and contributes its experience as operator and approximately 97 000 acres for development in an area with high hydrocarbon potential located in the permian midland ecopetrol owns the 49 share after an initial payment of 50 at the close of the transaction with the remaining 50 to be paid during the carry period deferred investment over time in activities contemplated within the development plan during the next 3 to 4 years during the carry period ecopetrol will pay 75 of occidental s share in the jv s investments 13 the jv allowed ecopetrol to incorporate proven reserves 1p for 163 6 million barrels of oil equivalent in turn the jv closed 2019 with 4 wells operating online achieving the first oil shortly after closing the transaction by 2020 4 drills will be in operation allowing for the drilling of 80 to 90 wells and implementing the operation of approximately 40 to 50 wells through this activity in 2020 ecopetrol expects to reach a net average production between 7 000 and 9 000 boed barrels of oil equivalent per day this operation will contribute to portfolio diversification given the incorporation of short cycle assets in which production is reached within a very short period of time between the start of activities and extraction it also allows for an increase in the share of light crudes close to 40 degrees api in average to balance the production matrix of the ecopetrol group which is currently comprised mostly by heavy crudes in order for the jv to attain value generation objectives our new subsidiary for unconventional operations in the us has appointed cesar álvarez as president of ecp permian llc mr álvarez is a petroleum engineer with extensive experience in managing this type of partnerships in unconventional basins in the us as well as in knowledge transfer programs the beginning of the knowledge transfer program is worth highlighting the first secondees to oxy operations will be deployed during the first quarter of the year acquisition of 30 of the gato do mato discovery ecopetrol óleo e gás do brasil ltda signed an agreement with shell brasil petróleo ltda to acquire 30 of the interests rights and obligations in two areas corresponding to the bm s 54 concession agreement and the sul de gato do mato shared production agreement located offshore in brazil s pre salt santos basin one of the areas with the greatest potential for hydrocarbons in the world where a hydrocarbons deposit known as gato do mato was discovered according to ecopetrol estimates the company could acquire approximately 90 million barrels of crude oil in contingent resources as of 2020 which will be gradually added to its balance of reserves ecopetrol also estimates that its share of production could reach nearly 20 thousand barrels per day of crude oil in 2025 this transaction is aligned with the company s capital discipline and sustainable growth in reserves and production strategy the share in gato do mato will be an important addition to the pau brasil and saturno blocks included in ecopetrol s exploration portfolio through this agreement ecopetrol strengthens its strategic position in the santos basin in brazil the agreement signed by ecopetrol óleo e gás do brasil ltda and shell brasil petróleo ltda is undergoing the respective approval process by brazil s ministry of mines and energy and its national agency of petroleum natural gas and biofuels preliminary agreement for the acquisition of fields in la guajira on november 22 2019 our subsidiary hocol signed an agreement with chevron petroleum company to acquire its share in the chuchupa and ballena fields located in the department of la guajira these fields are operated by chevron through the guajira association agreement 57 is owned by ecopetrol and 43 by chevron under

business group during q4 2019 the company completed the drilling of 7 exploratory wells of which 3 are under evaluation and 2 wells were successful esox 1 located in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico us is operated by hess which holds a 57 14 stake in association with chevron which holds a 21 43 stake and ecopetrol américa which holds the remaining 21 43 this discovery is located approximately 10 kilometres from the tubular bells production facilities which will allow production to begin during the first quarter of 2020 15 our subsidiary hocol drilled the bullerengue 3 well located in the ssjn 1 block operated by lewis energy which holds a 50 stake with hocol holding the other 50 the presence of gas was confirmed in the northern area of colombia the successful results of the exploration strategy in near field exploration areas allowed for the addition of more than one million barrels of accumulated crude oil in extensive tests which were added to ecopetrol s production the jasper andina and cosecha discoveries are under commercial evaluation on the other hand bullerengue 3 flamencos 1 and boranda are in the appraisal phase and the drilling of 4 appraisal wells is planned for 2020 an important milestone for the development of the colombian offshore is the agreement signed between ecopetrol s a and shell whereby shell will acquire a 50 stake in the fuerte sur purple angel and col 5 blocks located in the deep waters of the colombian caribbean sea the allocation of interests to shell is subject to approval of the assignment by the national hydrocarbons agency anh following the commercial agreement shell will assume the operation of the blocks an appraisal well will be drilled in the area by year end 2021 as well as the completion of the first production test once the respective approvals of the authorities are processed in the event these activities are positive the discoveries could be developed and thus expand domestic gas supply in the medium term during the last quarter four new assets were incorporated into the colombian onshore as a result of the anh s area allocation process ppaa two blocks for ecopetrol s a lla 119 lla

revenues for the upstream segment increased as compared to the same periods in the previous year mainly due to i a higher devaluation of the colombian peso against the us dollar ii the strengthening of the crude oil spread versus brent price iii and greater availability of crude oil for sale due to higher production volumes new purchase contracts with third parties and higher gas sales the aforementioned factors offset the lower prices of the weighted average basket of crude oil fourth quarter and year end 2019 costs of sales increased as compared to the same periods in 2018 mainly as a result of increased purchases of crude oil primarily due to new commercial agreements with third parties and the effect of a higher average cop usd exchange rate on purchases increased midstream costs associated with i a greater volume of crude oil transported through the pipelines ii an increase in the fees for the main pipeline systems and iii an increase in the average cop usd exchange rate increased energy costs higher market rates maintenance fluid treatment and additional activities to ensure well integrity in the q4 2019 there was a decrease in the subsurface maintenance activities increased volume of naphtha purchases primarily due to evaporation loss control in chichimene and castilla offset with lower dilution cost fourth quarter and year end 2019 operational expenses before impairment increased as compared to the same periods of the previous years primarily due to abandonment costs of non productive wells and an increase in community assistance and support costs year end 2019 exploratory expenses decreased as compared to 2018 primarily due to the recognition of the expense for exploratory activities in the leon 1 and 2 wells owned by ecopetrol america llc during the

during q4 2019 the utilization rate had better performance as compared to the same quarter of 2018 and q3 2019 primarily as a result of operational normality and overcoming of unscheduled operational events in the alkylation unit the gross refining margin showed an increase of 16 5 during q4 2019 as compared to q4 2018 mainly due to the positive effect of a higher yield in diesel production together with the lower cost of the feedstock due to greater percentage of domestic crudes for year end 2019 there was a 16 4 decrease in the gross refining margin as compared to 2018 mainly due to

iv the weakening of international fuel prices downstream revenues for the q4 2019 decreased as compared to the same period of 2018 mainly due to the weakening of international refined product prices 2019 cost of sales increased as compared to 2018 was primarily the result of i higher purchases of crude oil associated with the increase throughputs in cartagena and higher feedstock costs for both refineries due to the appreciation of crude vs brent ii higher imports of diesel in barrancabermeja due to first quarter operational events as well as increased purchases of products to reduce the sulphur content of fuels for the local market this increase was partially offset by the inclusion of a higher percentage of domestic crude in cartagena which helped counterbalance the increase in the cost of the feedstock in the q4 2019 costs of sales decreased in comparison to 2018 mainly due to a lower throughput in the barrancabermeja refinery because of reduced availability of light and intermediate crudes 2019 operational expenses before the effect of impairment and the market valuation of invercolsa increased as compared to 2018 primarily due to i an increased in commercial taxes and ii higher administrative and commercial expenses as a result of the ruling issued by the colombian supreme court of justice in favor of ecopetrol in the invercolsa process there was a change in the equity ownership of such entity and this company thus ceased to be an associate and became a subsidiary in compliance with ifrs business combination principles the investment in invercolsa must be recognized at market value and its financial statements must be consolidate into the consolidated financial statements of the ecopetrol group this generated non recurring income of over cop 1 0 trillion corresponding to the difference between the fair value and the book value of invercolsa we decided to place invercolsa into the downstream segment because it is standard industry practice to include both the crude oil refining and natural gas processing and purification 25 the financial result non operational of the downstream segment for both the q4 2019 and full year 2019 as compared to

combination of geopolitical developments including renewed concerns about the impact of a global trade war on china s economy and its prospects for lower stainless steel production and a re assessment of the potential effects of indonesia s ore export ban on supply conditions contributed to a softening of prices and increased inventory levels by the end of the period nickel prices on the london metals exchange lme whipsawed for much of q4 as a result of changing market sentiment nickel prices started at us 7 97 lb climbed to a peak of us 8 16 lb on october 11 and then dropped to a low of us 5 93 on december 10 before closing up at us 6 35 lb on december 31 by the end of the fourth quarter nickel prices had declined by 20 reversing the positive momentum enjoyed for much of 2019 despite the price decrease in q4 nickel remained the best performing metal in 2019 climbing 34 from us 4 74 lb on january 1 2019 the price volatility experienced in q4 was matched by swings in inventory levels on the london metals exchange lme and the shanghai future exchange shfe news that indonesia would implement a nickel ore ban effective with the start of 2020 triggered a considerable de stocking of inventory dropping inventories in october to their lowest levels since the start of the financial crisis in 2007 inventory levels declined almost 50 from 174 000 tonnes to 91 000 tonnes during the month largely because chinese stainless steel suppliers looked to lock in supply and traders hoped to take advantage of anticipated price increases but as market conditions weakened and carrying costs rose inventory began to flow back to the lme and shfe through much of december combined inventory levels on december 31 totaled approximately 190 000 tonnes up almost 8 from the start of the quarter advertisement 7 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the price volatility and significant shifts in inventory levels experienced in q4 2019 are expected to be short lived as underlying nickel market fundamentals remain strong demand for nickel through 2025 is expected to grow by approximately 3 per year to 2 8 million tonnes driven largely by the continued growth of the stainless steel sector according to market research by wood mackenzie over the longer term demand for nickel is expected to accelerate with the increased adoption of electric vehicles since nickel along with cobalt is a key metal needed to manufacture assorted energy storage batteries a shortage of nickel is anticipated over the coming years since current market prices are below incentive levels needed to develop new nickel projects as a result no new nickel supply is expected to come on stream in the near term cobalt cobalt prices decreased by approximately 13 in q4 reversing the upward trend experienced in the third quarter of 2019 when news emerged that mutanda a large cobalt producing mine in the democratic republic congo was to be placed on care and maintenance news of the mine shutdown triggered an immediate lift in cobalt prices by more than us 4 per pound in august standard grade cobalt prices on december 31 closed at us 15 53 lb down from 17 85 lb at the start of the quarter according to data collected by fastmarkets mb prices at the beginning of 2019 were us27 25 lb cobalt prices in 2019 were

year over year decline was driven by a combination of factors that has resulted in increased available supply and decreased demand contributing factors included increased supply of intermediate product from the democratic republic of congo increased available supply of processed cobalt from china continued de stocking of inventory by chinese consumers and the deferral of purchases by consumers waiting for prices to reach floor levels just as significant china s reduction of electric vehicle purchase subsidies has curbed sales and slowed penetration of the world s fastest growth

initiatives including the deployment of new mining equipment that significantly improved mining activities and increased ore stockpile capacity helped to offset lower mixed sulphides production in the second half of 2019 q4 2019 revenue of 123 4 million was up 3 when compared to last year due to a number of factors including a 37 higher nickel realized price and higher cobalt sales volume these

article continues below article content revenue for fy2019 was 461 0 down 7 from 498 1 for 2018 the decline was largely driven by a 61 lower realized cobalt price which offset the positive impact of

lb for q4 2018 mpr costs for fy2019 were 2 higher than fy2018 while fy2019 benefitted from operational excellence initiatives implemented over the past 18 months fy2018 mpr costs were positively impacted by lower opening inventory costs that resulted primarily from lower sulphur and fuel oil prices in 2017 as well as lower 2017 maintenance spending ndcc in q4 2019 was us 3 75 lb up from us 2 94 lb for the same period last year the increase was largely due to lower by product revenue stemming from the 49 decline in realized cobalt prices but partially offset by lower sulphur and fuel oil prices ndcc in fy2019 was us 4 14 lb up 85 from fy2018 primarily due to the decrease in cobalt by product revenue ndcc was positively impacted in fy2019 by higher fertilizer by product contributions

almost 50 from 174 000 tonnes to 91 000 tonnes during the month largely because chinese stainless steel suppliers looked to lock in supply and traders hoped to take advantage of anticipated price

is expected to grow by approximately 3 per year to 2 8 million tonnes driven largely by the continued growth of the stainless steel sector according to market research by wood mackenzie over the longer term demand for nickel is expected to accelerate with the increased adoption of electric vehicles since nickel along with cobalt is a key metal needed to manufacture assorted energy storage batteries a shortage of nickel is anticipated over the coming years since current market prices are below incentive levels needed to develop new nickel projects as a result no new nickel supply is

legal framework for regulating the oil and gas industry in the country the act also provides for the creation of an upstream regulator the petroleum upstream regulatory authority the mid and downstream petroleum as well as gas activities are proposed to be regulated by the current authority the energy and water utilities regulatory authority the act also confers upon on the tpdc the status of the national oil company mandated with the task of managing the country s commercial interest in the petroleum operations as well as mid and downstream natural gas activities the act vests tpdc with exclusive rights in the entire petroleum upstream value chain and the natural gas mid and downstream value chain however the exclusive rights of tpdc do not extend to mid and downstream petroleum supply operations the company is uncertain regarding the potential impact on its business in tanzania the act does provide grandfathering provisions upholding the rights of the company under

downstream activities 2 on october 7 2016 the government of tanzania issued the petroleum natural gas pricing regulation natural gas pricing regulation made under sections 165 and 258 i of the act

fourth quarter results summary offshore wind facilities electricity production including pre completion production increased 22 or 248 gwh compared to the same quarter of 2018 the increase was primarily due to pre completion production from deutsche bucht partially offset by lower wind resource in the north sea and unpaid curtailments at nordsee one due to grid repairs by the system operator and periods of negative market pricing sales of 271 million increased 23 or 50 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to factors affecting production partially offset by lower wholesale market prices at gemini and unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuations of 9 million operating income and adjusted ebitda of 152 million and 193 million respectively were 31 or 36 million and 45 or 60 million higher than the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher sales and lower operating costs thermal facilities electricity production increased 7 or 64 gwh compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to an increase in off peak production and the sale of continued enhancement of capacity at north battleford in 2019 increased dispatches at thorold and the effect of a maintenance outage in 2018 at another northland facility sales of 113 million increased 5 or 6 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher production and the sale of continued enhancement of capacity at north battleford partially offset by lower cost of sales at thorold resulting in lower reimbursements by the counterparty operating income of 58 million increased 3 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to favourable operating results at iroquois falls and north battleford adjusted ebitda of 71 million decreased 3 or 2 million primarily due to the sale of one of northland s managed facilities in 2018 which offset the increase in operating income on shore renewable facilities electricity production in gwh was in line with the same quarter of 2018 noting lower wind resource but higher solar resource sales of 50 million increased 5 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher production at the solar facilities production variances at the solar facilities have a larger effect on sales than the wind facilities since solar facilities receive a higher contracted price per mw operating income and adjusted ebitda of 21 million and 32 million respectively increased 22 or 4 million and 7 or 2 million primarily due to higher production at the solar facilities and lower costs at certain wind facilities general and administrative g a costs g a costs of 30 million increased 37 or 8 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to an increasing level of project development activities including the hai long offshore wind project and higher personnel costs to support northland s growth finance costs net finance costs of 94 million increased 13 or 11 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to the amortization of deferred financing costs related to the subscription receipts partially offset by declining interest costs as a result of scheduled principal repayments on facility level loans and the redemption of convertible debentures in december 2018 impairment of property plant and equipment impairment of property plant and equipment of 98 million was recorded due to a non cash impairment loss for project costs incurred to date associated with the demonstrator project at deutsche bucht fair value gain on derivative contracts fair value gain on derivative contracts was 52 million compared to a 2 million loss in the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to the favourable movement in colombian pesos foreign exchange contracts and natural gas forward contracts net income net income of 61 million decreased 7 or 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of the factors described above partially offset by a 27 million lower tax expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda of 273 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 23 or 51 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 the significant factor increasing adjusted ebitda includes 77 million increase as a result of net pre completion revenues at deutsche bucht factors partially offsetting the increase in adjusted ebitda include 10 million decrease in operating results from gemini due to lower wind resource and wholesale market price below the sde floor partially offset by lower insurance costs 9 million increase in corporate items in adjusted ebitda primarily due to an increasing level of project development activities including the hai long offshore wind project and higher personnel costs to support northland s growth and 7 million decrease in operating results from nordsee one primarily due to lower wind resource unpaid curtailment resulting from grid repairs by the system operator and periods of negative market pricing partially offset by lower costs from operating efficiencies free cash flow free cash flow of 67 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 24 or 21 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 factors decreasing free cash flow include 18 million decrease in overall earnings primarily due to the factors affecting adjusted ebitda except net pre completion revenues from deutsche bucht which are excluded from free cash flow and 8 million increase in corporate g a primarily due to an increasing level of project development activities including the hai long offshore wind project and higher personnel costs to support northland s growth the factor partially offsetting the decrease in free cash flow was a 5 million decrease in net interest expense due to a lower outstanding balance of amortizing debt and the redemption of the convertible debentures in december 2018 as at december 31 2019 the rolling four quarter free cash flow net payout ratio was 68 calculated on the basis of cash dividends paid and on the basis of total dividends compared to 48 and 63 respectively in 2018 the increase in the free cash flow payout ratio calculated on the basis of cash from 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the number of shares due to the redemption of the convertible debentures in december 2018 and also due to a decrease in the drip participation since the discount was reduced to nil effective december 2018 outlook northland actively pursues new sustainable infrastructure opportunities that encompass a range of clean technologies including wind solar and natural gas power generation as well as electricity grid networks northland s development strategy focuses on creating high quality projects underpinned by revenue arrangements that deliver predictable cash flows management actively seeks to invest in technologies and jurisdictions where northland can benefit from an early mover advantage and establish a meaningful presence as such the 2020 guidance range reflects higher development expenses in pursuit of the company s continued execution of its global growth strategy this includes expenditures related to the development and advancement of hai long the

to be higher relative to the revised 2019 guidance primarily due to the following factors all amounts approximate incremental contribution from deutsche bucht for a full year of operations excluding the demonstrator project 140 million to 155 million increase and contributions from la lucha which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020 and from newly acquired ebsa based on the final tariff expected assuming an average exchange rate of cop 2 512 cad 100 million to 105 million increase factors partially offsetting the increase in 2020 adjusted ebitda include lower anticipated contribution from thermal facilities primarily due to stronger than expected performance in 2019 and one time costs expected in 2020 15 million to 20 million impact lower assumed market prices at gemini and higher unpaid curtailments at nordsee one 5 million to 20 million impact assuming an average foreign exchange rate of cad 1 49 euro and higher g a costs primarily due to increased level of development activities 40 million to 50 million impact free cash flow in 2020 management expects free cash flow per share to be in the range of 1 70 to 2 05 per share 2020 free cash flow per share is adjusted from the revised 2019 guidance primarily due to the following factors all amounts approximate contribution from deutsche bucht for the full year including one time excess pre completion

the second half of 2020 and from newly acquired ebsa based on the final tariff expected 30 million to 35 million increase factors partially offsetting the increase in expected free cash flow include lower assumed market prices and higher taxes at gemini and higher unpaid curtailments at nordsee one 10 million to 20 million impact lower anticipated contribution from thermal facilities primarily due to stronger than expected performance in 2019 and one time costs expected in 2020 10 million to 15 million impact higher g a costs primarily due to increased level of development activities 40 million to 50 million impact higher scheduled principal debt repayments at certain operating facilities 20 million impact higher interest on corporate borrowings primarily due to the ebsa acquisition funding offset by lower interest on the 2020 debentures maturing in mid 2020 5 million impact and an increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding as a result of the

drip are sourced from the secondary market fourth quarter results summary offshore wind facilities electricity production including pre completion production increased 22 or 248 gwh compared to the same quarter of 2018 the increase was primarily due to pre completion production from deutsche bucht partially offset by lower wind resource in the north sea and unpaid curtailments at nordsee one due to grid repairs by the system operator and periods of negative market pricing sales of 271 million increased 23 or 50 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to factors affecting production partially offset by lower wholesale market prices at gemini and unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuations of 9 million operating income and adjusted ebitda of 152 million and 193 million respectively were 31 or 36 million and 45 or 60 million higher than the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher sales and lower operating costs thermal facilities electricity production increased 7 or 64 gwh compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to an increase in off peak production and the sale of continued enhancement of capacity at north battleford in 2019 increased dispatches at thorold and the effect of a maintenance outage in 2018 at another northland facility sales of 113 million increased 5 or 6 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher production and the sale of continued enhancement of capacity at north battleford partially offset by lower cost of sales at thorold resulting in lower reimbursements by the counterparty operating income of 58 million increased 3 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to favourable operating results at iroquois falls and north battleford adjusted ebitda of 71 million decreased 3 or 2 million primarily due to the sale of one of northland s managed facilities in 2018 which offset the increase in operating income on shore renewable facilities electricity production in gwh was in line with the same quarter of 2018 noting lower wind resource but higher solar resource sales of 50 million increased 5 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher production at the solar facilities production variances at the solar facilities have a larger effect on sales than the wind facilities since solar facilities receive a higher contracted price per mw operating income and adjusted ebitda of 21 million and 32 million respectively increased 22 or 4 million and 7 or 2 million primarily due to higher production at the solar facilities and lower costs at certain wind facilities general and administrative g a costs g a costs of 30 million increased 37 or 8 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to an increasing level of project development activities including the hai long offshore wind project and higher personnel costs to support northland s growth finance costs net finance costs of 94 million increased 13 or 11 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to the amortization of deferred financing costs related to the subscription receipts partially offset by declining interest costs as a result of scheduled principal repayments on facility level loans and the redemption of convertible debentures in december 2018 impairment of property plant and equipment impairment of property plant and equipment of 98 million was recorded due to a non cash impairment loss for project costs incurred to date associated with the demonstrator project at deutsche bucht fair value gain on derivative contracts fair value gain on derivative contracts was 52 million compared to a 2 million loss in the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to the favourable movement in colombian pesos foreign exchange contracts and natural gas forward contracts net income net income of 61 million decreased 7 or 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of the factors described above partially offset by a 27 million lower tax expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda of 273 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 23 or 51 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 the significant factor increasing adjusted ebitda includes 77 million increase as a result of net pre completion revenues at deutsche bucht factors partially offsetting the increase in adjusted ebitda include 10 million decrease in operating results from gemini due to lower wind resource and wholesale market price below the sde floor partially offset by lower insurance costs 9 million increase in corporate items in adjusted ebitda primarily due to an increasing level of project development activities including the hai long offshore wind project and higher personnel costs to support northland s growth and 7 million decrease in operating results from nordsee one primarily due to lower wind resource unpaid curtailment resulting from grid repairs by the system operator and periods of negative market pricing partially offset by lower costs from operating efficiencies free cash flow free cash flow of 67 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 24 or 21 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 factors decreasing free cash flow include 18 million decrease in overall earnings primarily due to the factors affecting adjusted ebitda except net pre completion revenues from deutsche bucht which are excluded from free cash flow and 8 million increase in corporate g a primarily due to an increasing level of project development activities including the hai long offshore wind project and higher personnel costs to support northland s growth the factor partially offsetting the decrease in free cash flow was a 5 million decrease in net interest expense due to a lower outstanding balance of amortizing debt and the redemption of the convertible debentures in december 2018 as at december 31 2019 the rolling four quarter free cash flow net payout ratio was 68 calculated on the basis of cash dividends paid and on the basis of total dividends compared to 48 and 63 respectively in 2018 the increase in the free cash flow payout ratio calculated on the basis of cash from 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the number of shares due to the redemption of the convertible debentures in december 2018 and also due to a decrease in the drip participation since the discount was reduced to nil effective december 2018 outlook northland actively pursues new sustainable infrastructure opportunities that encompass a range of clean technologies including wind solar and natural gas power generation as well as electricity grid networks northland s development strategy focuses on creating high quality projects underpinned by revenue arrangements that deliver predictable cash flows management actively seeks to invest in technologies and jurisdictions where northland can benefit from an early mover advantage and establish a meaningful presence as such the 2020 guidance range reflects higher development expenses in pursuit of the company s continued execution of its global growth strategy this includes expenditures related to the development and advancement of hai long the new joint venture in japan and other offshore wind projects adjusted ebitda in 2020 management expects adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 1 1 billion to 1 2 billion 2020 adjusted ebitda is expected to be higher relative to the revised 2019 guidance primarily due to the following factors all amounts approximate incremental contribution from deutsche bucht for a full year of operations excluding the demonstrator project 140 million to 155 million increase and contributions from la lucha which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020 and from newly acquired ebsa based on the final tariff expected assuming an average exchange rate of cop 2 512 cad 100 million to 105 million increase factors partially offsetting the increase in 2020 adjusted ebitda include lower anticipated contribution from thermal facilities primarily due to stronger than expected performance in 2019 and one time costs expected in 2020 15 million to 20 million impact lower assumed market prices at gemini and higher unpaid curtailments at nordsee one 5 million to 20 million impact assuming an average foreign exchange rate of cad 1 49 euro and higher g a costs primarily due to increased level of development activities 40 million to 50 million impact free cash flow in 2020 management expects free cash flow per share to be in the range of 1 70 to 2 05 per share 2020 free cash flow per share is adjusted from the revised 2019 guidance primarily due to the following factors all amounts approximate contribution from deutsche bucht for the full year including one time excess pre completion revenue from 2019 net of partial year principal debt repayments and excluding the demonstrator project 120 million to 130 million and contributions from la lucha which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020 and from newly acquired ebsa based on the final tariff expected 30 million to 35 million increase factors partially offsetting the increase in expected free cash flow include lower assumed market prices and higher taxes at gemini and higher unpaid curtailments at nordsee one 10 million to 20 million impact lower anticipated contribution from thermal facilities primarily due to stronger than expected performance in 2019 and one time costs expected in 2020 10 million to 15 million impact higher g a costs primarily due to increased level of development activities 40 million to 50 million impact higher scheduled principal debt repayments at certain operating facilities 20 million impact higher interest on corporate borrowings primarily due to the ebsa acquisition funding offset by lower interest on the 2020 debentures maturing in mid 2020 5 million impact and an increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding as a result of the subscription receipts offering associated with the ebsa acquisition and the maturity of the 2020 debentures the 2020 development expenses are expected to total 0 45 to 0 50 of 2020 free cash flow per share including hai long development costs and development overhead an increase from a total of 0 24 per share in 2019 adoption of advance

china manufacturing versus mexico manufacturing who wins op ed by chris devonshire ellis the recent coronavirus covid 19 outbreak in china has raised many alternative china hands and especially from businesses in the us this coupled with the fairly recent decision to replace the existing north american free trade agreement nafta with the president donald trump initiated united states mexico canada agreement usmca has led some to speculate that bringing jobs and production closer to home or at least to nearby mexico from china may be a viable alternative to retaining sourcing or production in the prc this has been the state of play envisaged by dan harris over at the china law blog whose recent article would the last manufacturing company in china please turn out the lights part 4 states that within three years nobody will be making widgets in china anymore as well claiming that us businesses buying from the prc may be hit with a 200 duty on widgets you bought from china and that us foreign policy is to drive business from china to countries like mexico it is the latest in a long series of anti china sentiment from a lawyer and firm actually based in seattle and with no professional grounding in china or mexico for that matter nonetheless the mexico issue does occasionally crop up so what is the real deal when it comes to manufacturing in mexico compared with china our practice dezan shira associates has close to 30 years experience in china 12 mainland china offices several hundred staff and thousands of clients many are american some mexican and while we don t ourselves have a presence in mexico we have six well established and sizable local partner firms who we meet with regularly at various events these includes three firms in mexico city as well as in guadalajara monterrey and aguascalientes in contrast harris bricken have just one firm they use presumably to sub contract their us clients work in china a local company called deshengde consulting co ltd based in beijing and who they specifically state on their website do not practice chinese law that underlines their actual china legal accreditation capabilities and experience none china law blog and the harris bricken firm isn t actually qualified to practice law in china so go figure and then there is wide difference between what china law blog is saying about china and mexico and what we are experiencing about china and mexico harris states that nearly all of our clients would like to cease having their products made in china and that mexico is the winner in the us china trade war elsewhere the china law blog states manufacturing in china got you down make a run for the mexican border meanwhile harris bricken the firm behind china law blog consistently discuss their clients unhappiness with china on their blog and the fact they wish to leave and have done for the past two years the funny thing is we see very little of that with harris s firm not having had a legal presence in china or mexico and their occasional references to cannabis regulations is it possible the skies above seattle waft a little more pungent than is normal we do enjoy a bit of a laugh at their articles anyway enough of the anti china law blog s pontificating they are amusing in a weird kind of way about how much they get wrong and especially concerning china but more seriously their clients in china must constantly despair at being told the solution to their problems is actually to leave rather than be given any practical on the ground advise the position concerning mexico concerning mexico although there is some hype about relocating us businesses to the country from china we haven t had any inquiries whatsoever from our american client base in china about relocating part or all of their production to the country neither have any of our six mexican partner firms on a map shifting production to mexico makes sense as it is right next door to the us however there are issues not least the current us president s obsession with building a wall between the two countries hardly conducive to bilateral trade in terms of nafta this is still in place at least until the proposed usmca deal is ratified which it hasn t been at this point one issue with this is uncertainty over when the agreement will take place and there remain sticking points not least washington s insistence that mexico raise its minimum wage for autoworkers to us 16 per hour while that is competitive for the us it is a disaster for mexico s exports to other latin and south american countries where the minimum wage is us 6 7 in venezuela us 1 2 in brazil and us 1 65 and us 10 in neighboring belize and guatemala respectively consequently there is mexican push back concerning parts of the usmca while that remains american investors are reluctant to commit that is coupled with the us dollar mexican peso position currency movements are always a factor in longer term business and investment planning and especially within the us as it turns out while the us dollar has been doing fine the mexican peso has been doing better the past year rising in strength against the dollar by 2 3 percent if that continues margins can easily be wiped out in two to four years again this is an issue that is holding investment back and is one reason why us foreign direct investment into mexico has been slipping back the past year and in q3 last year had declined to less than 1 3 of the total in fact spain as a source for mexican fdi is becoming close to surpassing the us as mexico s number one investor investment though is a different animal from trade which increased to us 614 5 billion in 2019 this suggests that while the us is buying more produce from mexico it is holding back on investing there the strength of the peso and outstanding trade issues are currently depressing us appetite for making investments into the country but there are practical considerations too mexico has a crime and labor management problem trade unions are very active and can be disruptive while absenteeism remains an on going issue this is without having to deal with poor infrastructure logistics although mexican port operators are generally first class and transport networks here is a country in which the us really ought to be taking advantage of current low interest rates and doing deals with mexico to upgrade its infrastructure and lead those roads and rail lines back to the us border just as china has been doing with its belt and road initiative in southeast asia instead while the us has reduced aid to mexico the mexican government itself has just launched a us 44 billion plan to upgrade infrastructure within the country by comparison the us invested us 236 million last year in the country far less than the us 1 billion china has just committed to the tiny asian island of sri lanka the issue with mexico s us 44 billion infrastructure plan is that it will benefit mexican trade and not exclusively that with the us these days us 236 million just builds you 50 miles of highway in the us and it is nowhere near enough to significantly increase us trade infrastructure with mexico there is also an issue in mexico with sourcing components mexico imported us 66 billion from china last year while china imported just us 5 billion from mexico in short what this means is that even if a us manufacturer or sourcing business relocated its operations to mexico it would still find itself reliant on mexican imports from china and especially of component electrical and auto parts according to trading economics the top six items mexico imported from china last year were mechanical and electrical products machinery and transport equipment high and new tech products wireless phone components automatic data processing equipment components and integrated circuits basically moving to mexico won t stop the china reliance in comparison in china labor is disciplined the infrastructure works there is a weakening yuan against the us dollar making chinese goods cheaper and a phase two trade deal in the offing later in the year there will always be those who panic when times get tough and the covid 19 spread has shown that nowhere is infallible for now mexico as an alternative to china is too early and panicky a move mexico needs time to start to see the benefits expected by 2024 from its us 44 billion infrastructure drive as well as having to ratify the usmca a weakening peso would also help as for unionization and labor management these are political and educational problems and can be dealt with over time mexico as an investment destination is an interesting option but it is most certainly not an alternative to china for those the article fed up with covid 19 these are the china plus one alternatives is a rather more realistic approach as to how us sourcing and manufacturing businesses can reduce their china risk dependence as for dezan shira associates we ve been warning about that since at least 2012 china will soon come back to operational capacity it just requires a bit of patience running for the borders meanwhile is clearly not the

electricity production including pre completion production increased 22 or 248 gwh compared to the same quarter of 2018 the increase was primarily due to pre completion production from deutsche bucht partially offset by lower wind resource in the north sea and unpaid curtailments at nordsee one due to grid repairs by the system operator and periods of negative market pricing sales of 271 million increased 23 or 50 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to factors affecting production partially offset by lower wholesale market prices at gemini and unfavourable foreign exchange rate fluctuations of 9 million operating income and adjusted ebitda of 152 million and 193 million respectively were 31 or 36 million and 45 or 60 million higher than the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher sales and lower operating costs thermal facilities electricity production increased 7 or 64 gwh compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to an increase in off peak production and the sale of continued enhancement of capacity at north battleford in 2019 increased dispatches at thorold and the effect of a maintenance outage in 2018 at another northland facility sales of 113 million increased 5 or 6 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher production and the sale of continued enhancement of capacity at north battleford partially offset by lower cost of sales at thorold resulting in lower reimbursements by the counterparty operating income of 58 million increased 3 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to favourable operating results at iroquois falls and north battleford adjusted ebitda of 71 million decreased 3 or 2 million primarily due to the sale of one of northland s managed facilities in 2018 which offset the increase in operating income on shore renewable facilities electricity production in gwh was in line with the same quarter of 2018 noting lower wind resource but higher solar resource sales of 50 million increased 5 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to higher production at the solar facilities production variances at the solar facilities have a larger effect on sales than the wind facilities since solar facilities receive a higher contracted price per mw operating income and adjusted ebitda of 21 million and 32 million respectively increased 22 or 4 million and 7 or 2 million primarily due to higher production at the solar facilities and lower costs at certain wind facilities general and administrative g a costs g a costs of 30 million increased 37 or 8 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to an increasing level of project development activities including the hai long offshore wind project and higher personnel costs to support northland s growth finance costs net finance costs of 94 million increased 13 or 11 million compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to the amortization of deferred financing costs related to the subscription receipts partially offset by declining interest costs as a result of scheduled principal repayments on facility level loans and the redemption of convertible debentures in december 2018 impairment of property plant and equipment impairment of property plant and equipment of 98 million was recorded due to a non cash impairment loss for project costs incurred to date associated with the demonstrator project at deutsche bucht fair value gain on derivative contracts fair value gain on derivative contracts was 52 million compared to a 2 million loss in the same quarter of 2018 primarily due to the favourable movement in colombian pesos foreign exchange contracts and natural gas forward contracts net income net income of 61 million decreased 7 or 5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the same quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of the factors described above partially offset by a 27 million lower tax expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda of 273 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 23 or 51 million higher than the fourth quarter of 2018 the significant factor increasing adjusted ebitda includes 77 million increase as a result of net pre completion revenues at deutsche bucht factors partially offsetting the increase in adjusted ebitda include 10 million decrease in operating results from gemini due to lower wind resource and wholesale market price below the sde floor partially offset by lower insurance costs 9 million increase in corporate items in adjusted ebitda primarily due to an increasing level of project development activities including the hai long offshore wind project and higher personnel costs to support northland s growth and 7 million decrease in operating results from nordsee one primarily due to lower wind resource unpaid curtailment resulting from grid repairs by the system operator and periods of negative market pricing partially offset by lower costs from operating efficiencies free cash flow free cash flow of 67 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 24 or 21 million lower than the fourth quarter of 2018 factors decreasing free cash flow include 18 million decrease in overall earnings primarily due to the factors affecting adjusted ebitda except net pre completion revenues from deutsche bucht which are excluded from free cash flow and 8 million increase in corporate g a primarily due to an increasing level of project development activities including the hai long offshore wind project and higher personnel costs to support northland s growth the factor partially offsetting the decrease in free cash flow was a 5 million decrease in net interest expense due to a lower outstanding balance of amortizing debt and the redemption of the convertible debentures in december 2018 as at december 31 2019 the rolling four quarter free cash flow net payout ratio was 68 calculated on the basis of cash dividends paid and on the basis of total dividends compared to 48 and 63 respectively in 2018 the increase in the free cash flow payout ratio calculated on the basis of cash from 2018 was primarily due to an increase in the number of shares due to the redemption of the convertible debentures in december 2018 and also due to a decrease in the drip participation since the discount was reduced to nil effective december 2018 outlook northland actively pursues new sustainable infrastructure opportunities that encompass a range of clean technologies including wind solar and natural gas power generation as well as electricity grid networks northland s development strategy focuses on creating high quality projects underpinned by revenue arrangements that deliver predictable cash flows management actively seeks to invest in technologies and jurisdictions where northland can benefit from an early mover advantage and establish a meaningful presence as such the 2020 guidance range reflects higher development expenses in pursuit of the company s continued execution of its global growth strategy this includes expenditures related to the development and advancement of hai long the new joint venture in japan and other offshore wind projects adjusted ebitda in 2020 management expects adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 1 1 billion to 1 2 billion 2020 adjusted ebitda is expected to be higher relative to the revised 2019 guidance primarily due to the following factors all amounts approximate incremental contribution from deutsche bucht for a full year of operations excluding the demonstrator project 140 million to 155 million increase and contributions from la lucha which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020 and from newly acquired ebsa based on the final tariff expected assuming an average exchange rate of cop 2 512 cad 100 million to 105 million increase factors partially offsetting the increase in 2020 adjusted ebitda include lower anticipated contribution from thermal facilities primarily due to stronger than expected performance in 2019 and one time costs expected in 2020 15 million to 20 million impact lower assumed market prices at gemini and higher unpaid curtailments at nordsee one 5 million to 20 million impact assuming an average foreign exchange rate of cad 1 49 euro and higher g a costs primarily due to increased level of development activities 40 million to 50 million impact free cash flow in 2020 management expects free cash flow per share to be in the range of 1 70 to 2 05 per share 2020 free cash flow per share is adjusted from the revised 2019 guidance primarily due to the following factors all amounts approximate contribution from deutsche bucht for the full year including one time excess pre completion revenue from 2019 net of partial year principal debt repayments and excluding the demonstrator project 120 million to 130 million and contributions from la lucha which is expected to be completed in the second half of 2020 and from newly acquired ebsa based on the final tariff expected 30 million to 35 million increase factors partially offsetting the increase in expected free cash flow include lower assumed market prices and higher taxes at gemini and higher unpaid curtailments at nordsee one 10 million to 20 million impact lower anticipated contribution from thermal facilities primarily due to stronger than expected performance in 2019 and one time costs expected in 2020 10 million to 15 million impact higher g a costs primarily due to increased level of development activities 40 million to 50 million impact higher scheduled principal debt repayments at certain operating facilities 20 million impact higher interest on corporate borrowings primarily due to the ebsa acquisition funding offset by lower interest on the 2020 debentures maturing in mid 2020 5 million impact and an increase in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding as a result of the subscription receipts offering associated with the ebsa acquisition and the maturity of the 2020 debentures the 2020 development expenses are expected to total 0 45 to 0 50 of 2020 free cash flow per share including hai long development costs and development overhead

sydney and kuala lumpur feb 25 2020 ips meeting the president of the republic of korea in september 2019 president donald j trump bragged that the us economy is the envy of the world trump reiterated such claims in his state of the union address in early february hailing his own policies with typical humility trump touted us economic success at the davos world economic forum in january as nothing short of spectacular asserting i m proud to declare the united states is in the midst of an economic boom the likes of which the world has never seen before facts hardly matter to the contrary us economic growth slowed after trump started the trade war with china dropping from 3 5 in the second quarter of 2018 to 2 1 in the last quarter of 2019 much less than the 5 5 per annum peak in the second quarter of 2014 during the obama presidency meanwhile annual growth declined from 2 9 in 2018 to 2 3 in 2019 growth in trump s first three years was well below the clinton era 1993 2000 average around 4 the highest for any presidency in the last half century although growth was even higher at times in earlier years obama inherited a recession following the global financial crisis from september 2008 with the deepest post war contraction when real gdp fell by about 4 p a in the second quarter of 2009 the us economy then turned around by the end of that year while us growth peaked under obama at almost 4 p a in the first quarter of 2015 trump s peak in the last three years was around 3 p a in mid 2018 making america great again the united nations the international monetary fund imf and the world bank all expect the us economy to continue slowing to 1 7 1 8 annually in 2020 2021 us manufacturing growth slowed to its lowest level in almost a decade in august 2019 as the purchasing managers index pmi signalled contraction for the first time since september 2009 meanwhile with its agricultural sector experiencing higher levels of farm debt the number of us farm bankruptcies grew by a fifth in 2019 from 498 in 2018 to 595 despite the government s us 28 billion bailout for farmers double the 2009 bailout of its big three automobile producers the us congressional research service doubts that the supply side incentive effects of trump s tax cuts and jobs act mainly benefiting the wealthiest 10 of americans will be as significant as he claims much of the funds released by the tax cut have been used for a record breaking spree of stock buybacks worth more than us 1 trillion in the first quarter of 2019 augmented by easy money policies in december 2019 the imf noted that global growth recorded its weakest pace since the global financial crisis a decade ago despite monetary policy easing all round meanwhile slower global growth has been increasingly blamed everywhere on the us china trade war hence while trump s attempts to make america great again have largely failed to lift us growth they have been harming the rest of the world election economics president trump kicked off his 2020 re election campaign at an orlando florida rally in june 2019 with his characteristic modesty claiming that the us economy under his watch was perhaps the greatest economy we ve had in the history of our country to enhance his appeal trump has successfully pressured the us federal reserve to keep monetary policy and credit conditions easy however the funds have not gone into productive investments but instead to portfolio investments mergers acquisitions and share buybacks transferring more wealth and income to the rich trump has also been repeatedly promising more tax cuts ostensibly for the middle class his economic advisor larry kudlow told fox news that trump wants to give the middle class a 10 tax cut in september weeks before the polls meanwhile trump has claimed victory and struck a less aggressive tone on international trade conflicts declaring the end of hostilities with china in january after concluding the us mexico canada agreement usmca with some minor largely cosmetic changes to the preceding north american free trade agreement nafta but he has also turned on europe threatening at davos to levy huge tariffs on european car imports this was followed by another threat from treasury secretary steven mnuchin to punish european countries that have the audacity to tax american digital firms the art of the ordeal trump commerce secretary wilbur ross s blatant schadenfreude over the coronavirus outbreak that it could boost us jobs is telling the coronavirus pandemic has shut down chinese businesses and ports as efforts to contain the pandemic wreck china s manufacturing supply chains under the us china phase one trade deal china will increase imports of us farm goods by us 32 billion over two years enhancing his appeal to the us rural farm vote so if anything goes wrong trump can always blame china or the pandemic for any shortfalls while heroically claiming to be protecting the us from a new chinese threat meanwhile trump seems likely to ratchet up his rhetoric against europe s farmers to mitigate the economic impacts of the trade conflicts and the coronavirus outbreak other countries including china are further easing monetary policy the us fed can thus more easily remain dovish at least until november ensuring more buoyant equity markets and helping trump s re election prospects the donald

the outlook for the global economy still recovering from a synchronized slowdown brought on in part by the u s china trade war is bleak according to a new report published by the economist intelligence unit on tuesday global growth is forecast to be just 2 9 percent in 2020 near a decades low the gloomy outlook a reverse from the uptick in growth expected just a few months ago has been brought on by renewed geopolitical uncertainty along with the emergence of the deadly coronavirus while a growth slowdown could be cushioned by ultra loose monetary policy among the world s major central banks the u s has historically low interest rates and a number of countries have negative rates it also may trigger new debt crises in emerging markets while limiting banks powers to respond to recession risks these are the five biggest threats that could endanger the global economy 1 u s iran conflict leads to a spike in global oil prices at the beginning of january president trump authorized a drone strike that killed iran s top security and intelligence commander gen qassim suleimani a serious escalation of washington s growing confrontation with tehran while both sides are reluctant to engage in a full out war nor does iran have the military or financial means to do so tensions between the two countries remain exponentially high complicating communication there s also increased risk that iran could launch a targeted attack against u s interests in the middle east as a result the economist intelligence unit wrote in the paper the risk of an unintended slide into an escalating military conflict cannot be ruled out according to the study there s a 25 percent chance the u s and iran will be dragged into a direct conventional war which would have devastating consequences for the global economy in particular a war would almost certainly force the strait of hormuz which roughly 20 percent of global oil supplies rely on could be closed for an extended period of time 2 a trade war breaks out between the u s and the european union tensions between the u s and eu have remained strained since mid 2018 when the trump administration threatened to impose a 25 percent tariff on vehicles produced in europe while that particular threat seems to have receded the u s is currently at odds with france over the country s digital services tax which targets american tech companies including amazon apple and google what triggers an economic recession because the u s and china signed a partial trade deal it s likely that trump will turn his attention to europe this year according to the paper if the u s and eu are dragged into a trade war the impact on the global economy would be severe the report said it estimated there s a 25 percent chance of a trade war breaking out between the long time allies global growth would slow inflation would rise and consumer and business sentiment would drop it said 3 coronavirus takes a lasting toll on the global economy china the world s second largest economy has responded to a deadly outbreak of the coronavirus by all but halting its production of consumer goods like phones clothing and automobiles instituting mass quarantines in some cities and placing severe restrictions on an estimated 780 million people the verge reported multiple companies and countries are limiting travel to and from mainland china evacuating citizens and scaling back operations the virus has killed close to 3 000 people with more than 80 000 cases reported worldwide mostly in china how deadly is new coronavirus it s still too early to tell the global economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak is set to be more profound than that of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars a similar virus that spread from china in 2003 owing to the much larger role that china plays in the global economy today the report said whether or not it has a significant impact on the global economy however depends on the length of its duration fed says us economic risks easing but warns about coronavirus threat once china gets the disease under control it will likely introduce strong fiscal and monetary stimulus to engineer a recovery in economic expansion resulting in a rebound of growth worldwide the eiu estimated a 20 percent probability that the virus will not be contained in china until mid 2020 and a 5 percent chance it will remain uncontained beyond this year if it spreads further globally the eiu will adjust its global real gdp outlook below 2 5 percent this year 4 debt burdens cause a recession across emerging markets a decade of low interest rates has caused global debt levels to rise with external debt levels now significantly higher than they were in 2009 in some markets the level and risk profile of corporate debt has also risen particularly in the u s the report said as a result global growth prospects have become more vulnerable to a change in financial conditions such as changes in us interest rates or financial market risk appetite which could rapidly translate to higher funding costs for indebted countries the report said this occurred in 2018 when rising us interest rates and a strengthening us dollar against other currencies caused widespread currency volatility among emerging markets triggering currency crises and severe recessions in turkey and argentina 5 hong kong protests cause an exodus from asia s biggest financial center pro democracy protests began in hong kong during the summer over a now shelved bill that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals from hong kong to mainland china where the courts are controlled by the communist party the eiu forecast a distinct chance the protests flare up again if civil rights appear to be under attack and if tensions continue to rise there s a possibility that china could respond to the chaos and mounting pro independence sentiment in hong kong by suspending the one country two systems mode of governance hong kong a former british colony was returned to china in 1997 under an agreement known as one country two systems which allowed the city to retain a high degree of autonomy for 50 years the agreement expires in 2047 escalating unrest could lead to the deployment of the chinese army from the mainland raising the possibility of casualties either of these scenarios would cause serious and sudden economic dislocation and threaten hong kong s status as the world s third most important financial centre the report said they would result in a swift departure of the foreign talent that lubricates hong kong s economy and prompt many possibly most foreign businesses in hong kong to close or relocate to other asian cities such as singapore tokyo taipei or bangkok get fox business on the go by clicking

asset classes such as gold and us treasuries bond yields have dropped like a lead balloon on coronavirus fears as of this writing the 10 year us treasury yield is at its lowest level since 2016 and the 30 year is at its lowest level ever 2 the 10 year 3 month yield curve has inverted and the 10 year 2 year yield curve is close to inverting i have found that historically the 10 year us treasury yield has been a far better gauge of fear than the vix and the 10 year is telling us that there are serious concerns that this contagion will impact global growth global headlines continue to cause concern these worries are not unfounded news and statistics released over the last few days are troubling this contagion is spreading in a variety of countries including south korea iran and italy the situation in italy has caused the catholic church to cancel mass in milan and has caused austria to cancel trains going in and out of italy the world health organization is contemplating labeling this outbreak as a pandemic what is particularly alarming is that younger healthier people are contracting the disease and some have fallen seriously ill in addition recent reports suggest the incubation period could be as long as four weeks and we continue to receive information indicating that businesses are being impacted this is a classic exogenous shock flash pmis for a variety of countries are showing a coronavirus related deterioration and more companies are warning that earnings will be negatively impacted by the covid 19 outbreak in this environment it is easy for investors to panic following are a few things for investors to remind themselves of 1 the 10 year treasury does not have medical training in other words i am taking its yield drop and any resulting yield curve inversion with a grain of salt because the economic impact all depends on the lifespan of the contagion i am concerned about the recent reports of rising infection rates and serious infections among otherwise healthy people however i still hold out hope that this contagion will be short lived echoing the views of international monetary fund managing director kristalina georgieva who said last week that it s too soon to make medical projections but we are still hoping that the impact will be a v shaped curve with a sharp decline in china and sharp rebound after the containment of the virus 3 2 policymakers will be as supportive as possible and supportive policy can supersede decelerating growth in dictating the direction of risk assets china has provided very significant stimulus both fiscal and monetary and is poised to provide more and last week federal reserve fed chair jay powell made it clear that the fed will closely monitor the situation which i believe means it is ready and willing to offer insurance cuts if need be just as it did last year as a preventive measure to stave off the negative economic effects of the us china trade war this should soften the drop at least slightly and certainly encourage a more robust rebound 3 the situation in china is already starting to improve infections have slowed more factories are coming online the work resumption rate is rising it will take time to get back to full capacity but in china the situation has been moving in the right direction economic indicators to watch we need to recognize that there are opportunities created by the current market environment in general stocks have moved upwards for many months without a significant correction and there is a compelling argument to make that a correction is overdue the current sell off could be healthy and provide a buying opportunity especially given the supportive policy backdrop because the situation in china is beginning to improve chinese equities and those global equities with significant exposure to chinese revenues could represent a particularly attractive buying opportunity and lower yields may have some positive effects especially since they have pushed mortgage rates lower what s critical is that we continue to follow economic data closely for indications of the economic impact of the coronavirus upcoming data releases to watch include pmi data for china we want to assess and confirm the view that the economic situation is improving there consumer confidence index this will give us an opportunity to see whether american consumer sentiment is being negatively affected by concerns about the coronavirus eurozone consumer confidence and the eurozone industrial confidence indicators these metrics are usually not followed closely but i believe they take on heightened importance given that the virus is having a significant impact on northern italy and we will want to see how the contagion has affected both consumer confidence and business confidence in the euro area japan industrial production japan is on the front lines of the contagion japanese companies supply chains have been seriously disrupted this will help gauge the impact of the coronavirus in japan and of course we have to follow even more closely the policy response to this contagion which i believe will be adequate and provide support for risk assets 1

the perspective atlanta georgia february 25 2020 paul collins the central bank of liberia cbl has always been an exceptional animal a rare species it is one of a kind in the country just like for every country there is just one central bank cbl is also very different from banks except for its ancillary legal mandate of the fiscal agency where it performs banking services for gol and for banks cbl s core objective is to maintain price stability and to ensure a sound banking and financial system in order to achieve this objective it performs several functions which include issuing banknotes for transaction purposes as the most common form of the lrd currency the lrd currency is represented by both banknotes and lrd account balances banknotes have to be printed some countries have internal arrangements to print their own banknotes others like liberia have no such capacity and therefore must print their banknotes externally printing money to an economist and from the perspective of central banks usually refers to the expansion of money supply or creation of additional credit whereby for expansionary monetary policy purposes the central bank lender of last resort makes more money available to its customers banks or government this credit to central banks customers allows them to put more money into the economy when there appears to be a need to encourage more spending and also gives the central banks some leverage in influencing the direction of both interest and inflation rates but printing money also means the production of physical banknotes as in this case regarding cbl printing money it is important to note that the printing of banknotes for the purpose of meeting the demand for physical cash where there is no expansion of credit or account balances at the cbl may not result in an expansion of the money supply for instance if a commercial bank has an lrd 1bn credit balance at the cbl and decides to withdraw all of this money in cash for whatever agreed purpose the cbl needs to be able to meet this demand for cash if all of this cash is not available the cbl may print and issue the required quantity of banknotes to meet this cash demand the need to print banknotes must be evaluated based on the monetary policy direction of the bank the growth of the economy and as already stated the operational need for cash transaction purposes central banks around the world aim to have enough banknotes available to meet the cash demand of the economy developed economies with less cash based transactions have banknotes in the circulation of around 4 to 5 percent of their gdp for cash intensive economies this average can be within the range of 10 to 15 percent of their gdp the global market average cost of printing each leaf of the banknote is us 0 06 six cents usd the national legislature which has the authority to issue currencies had previously delegated to the cbl the right to print lrd banknotes as it saw fit without seeking authorization from anybody that independence was however curtailed a little over 4 years ago when the cbl act was amended in march 2014 to require that the cbl seek the approval of the national legislature before printing banknotes the national legislature in the public procurement and concessions act ppca has also given the cbl exemptions from following a competitive procurement process when undertaking procurements of a monetary policy nature hence the cbl can argue that procurement activities related to printing banknotes are of a monetary policy nature but it could be argued also that going through a competitive procurement process offers economic benefits which could include a below average cost better security features and high service quality however once a printer is contracted only that printer can continue printing that particular family of banknotes as the production plates are expensive to produce and normally the exclusive property of the printer a new printer would have to develop its own production plates which would change the features of the family of banknotes that s like printing new banknotes different from the previous ones so for instance the cbl can only contract crane currency to print the additional lr 4bn as only crane has the production plates of the existing family of banknotes contracting a different printer would result in a different family of banknotes that s the reason we currently have different families of banknotes on the market because each type was printed by a different printer when the cbl awards a banknotes printing contract to a company it must account for the cost of printing the banknotes upfront which is usual or installment payments result as normal in credit entries to the bank ledger and debit entries to prepayments on the balance sheet when the banknotes are delivered to the cbl the prepayments are canceled and printed material inventories replace the prepayments on the balance sheet these accounting posting entries would be supported by the procurement package which would include the currency printing contract and cbl governance board resolution copies of communication exchanges between the printer and cbl the shipping documentation which specifies exactly what has been shipped delivery and receiving documentation which confirm what has been received physical inventory report at cbl which confirms the exact quality quantity and other specifications of the shipment received reconciliation reports of the physical inventory details shipping details and contract requirements the storage vault detailed report confirming what has been placed in the vault and the updated vault contents and an internal audit report confirming that all of these details are correct as stated these newly delivered banknotes are not considered monies yet but are called printed material inventories and the storage vaults in which they are stored are referred to as reserve vaults not operational vaults they are not money as far as the cbl is concerned but simple pieces of paper whose monetary value is the cost incurred by cbl to print and bring them into storage just like any stationery item that is why they are treated in the accounting system as printed material inventories they become money when they are brought into use by the cbl that is when the printed material inventories are transferred from the reserve storage vaults into the operational vaults the accounting posting entries to transfer the printed materials from the reserve vaults to the operational vaults where the printed materials now become money would be supported by a detailed inventory of what has been transferred ie quantity of bills in their respective denominations along with their associated cost of production and shipment as was booked in the printed materials inventory account on the balance sheet also included would be an updated reserve vault report detailing exactly what was in the vault what has left the vault and the balance of what is in the vault additionally the authorization to make the transfer along with internal audit s report would be attached remember that banknotes are really promissory notes issued by the cbl to holders of the banknotes these promissory notes are negotiable transferable because the holders are authorized to treat them as legal tender for the value indicated on the face of the notes simply put the cbl owes all the holders of its promissory notes banknotes this therefore is a liability of the cbl to the holders of the banknotes hence the cbl credits a liability account on the balance sheet to account for all promissory notes banknotes and calls them lrd currency in circulation cic those banknotes in the operations vault at the cbl however are not considered currency in circulation as they are not actually in circulation additionally because currency in circulation is a liability of the cbl the cbl cannot conceivably have a liability to itself one cannot owe themself but transfers from the reserve vaults to the operations vault as previously stated are credited to the cic account in effect the credits to the cic liability account are effectively netted off or offset by the debits to the operations vault hence the actual currency in circulation balance is the balance sheet amount less than the operations vault amount on the same balance sheet cic is money in circulation and a component of the money supply m0 whereas printed material inventory is not money the value of the printed material on the balance sheet will not be the same as the value of the cic this is because the printed material inventory is valued as normal inventory or stock under ias 2 international financial reporting standards unfortunately there is really no ifrs that deals with cic and other peculiar accounting issues of central banks however central banks around the world value cic using the face value of the banknotes put into circulation this amount is always going to be different from the cost of the banknotes so even though we are talking about the same pieces of papers banknotes they carry different values depending on where they are for instance if it costs cbl 6 cents usd to print one lrd100 banknote the cost is going to be usd 6 cents but the value of the monetized banknote in circulation is going to be lrd 100 using today s rate of us 1 lrd200 the lrd 100 is going to be treated as usd 50 cents in order to make the values balance out the printed material inventory cost is written off to the profit and loss as they are put into circulation so that you have a debit to the p l and a credit to the balance sheet to reduce printed material inventory of the same value as for the cic that is now a credit on the balance sheet its corresponding debit entry is posted to the operations cash vault also on the balance sheet this creates an asset to offset the cic liability payments from this operations cash vault lead to reductions of the operations cash vault holdings credit entries and debits to the accounts of the payee a reduction in the account balance of the payee printing money invariably leads to profit whether it is the expansion of credit or the production of banknotes when credit is created the interest on the credit is a profit to the central bank when banknotes are produced the difference between the cost of production and the face value of the banknotes is the profit this profit has to be calculated and accounted for how central banks account for such profits however is not standardized because of the absence of generally accepted accounting standards such as ifrs on how to deal with that kind of profit economists call this profit seigniorage however modern day central banks don t like to define seigniorage as the difference between the cost and face value of printed banknotes because they claim the definition dates back to the era of coins which were basically in circulation forever had intrinsic value of their own and so were often not recorded as liabilities but as assets instead central banks prefer to define seigniorage as the income earned on the assets financed by the banknotes so for example if the interest rate is 10 an lrd100 note will earn lrd10 a year if it lasts 2 years in circulation the total seigniorage income will be lrd 20 from this one needs to deduct the cost to give the net seigniorage thus for many small notes the seigniorage may be negative the economists view of seigniorage however fits the liberian scenario particularly because the liberian economy is highly dollarized about 70 the us dollar is legal tender and in practice those banknotes could be printed and issued in exchange for usd thus accruing realized profit to the cbl for instance if the difference between printing cost and face value of lrd 100 banknote is 44 cents usd 50 cents usd minus 6 cents usd immediately post issuance one would need to reduce this difference by the future replacement cost of the banknote another 6 cents usd to arrive at a profit of 38 cents usd however if the value of the lrd 100 depreciates by 50 as a result of the excess printing of lrd then the profit of 38 cents would need to be reduced by the loss in value as a result of the depreciation which is a further 25 cents usd deduction final seigniorage would therefore be 13 cents the problem is knowing how much the loss would be and how long it would take to eventually realize the total loss over time wouldn t be immediately known to the cbl at the year end when the financial statements relevant to the printing and issuance of the currency in question are published so the external auditors normally agree with the cbl not to do anything about seigniorage that is why there has been no qualification of the financial statements of the cbl with regards to seigniorage by any of their big four auditors over the last 15 years and this is common to central banks around the world so cbl says nothing about seigniorage in its financial statements even though it is there somewhere hidden in the numbers and below the lines as a financing income this is one way cbl finances its operations and grows its reserves maybe the cbl does not calculate let alone disclose its seigniorage income because it doesn t want to be asked for dividends out of such profits as these profits could be eroded by the depreciation of the currency in the future periods to conclude therefore our folks at the cbl knew how to account for lrd banknotes the cbl could forecast their cash needs correctly perform the procurement activities legally and efficiently account for the exact number and value of banknotes accurately and keep the economy running without any missing billions or cash crisis the system of accountability surrounding the printing of banknotes has always proven adequate to safeguard the banknotes and provide detailed information on their movements and storage this is a system that has involved several different departments and external parties with both internal audit and the external auditor providing assurance on the resilience and effectiveness of the integrity of the system on a regular basis it is instructive to note that in order to effectively audit or review a central bank one must have been a central banker in order to understand how the system works and know how to walk through it otherwise there would certainly be a scope limitation as any such audit or review would fail to successfully achieve its objectives that is one reason why central banks normally only hire international audit firms that have ex central bankers that have audited central banks in other jurisdictions now however usaid is paying kroll a us firm several million dollars to assist the cbl to do what the cbl has been doing for many years even though kroll s understanding of the cbl is doubtful considering its last engagement that produced more questions than answers and whose findings were unreconciliable and inconclusive interesting
where is the inflation this has been an incessant and incredibly frustrating question among gold bugs and assorted hard money enthusiasts since the toxic assets relief program of 2008 and the associated 16 trillion global bailout program revealed in the first ever partial audit of the federal reserve the hackneyed and dry answers from the gold bug community over the last 12 years have mostly consisted of blithe accusations of goal seeking manipulation of the consumer price index and other government calculated price inflation statistics this may be true to a certain extent but even if it is the question remains even if the cpi is manipulated still the â realâ price inflation whatever it may be has been low enough that there has been no global panic out of the us dollar complain as loudly as we want it simply has not happened the other so so explanation offered by the hard money crowd has been that price inflation does exist and is rampant simply that it has been â stuckâ in the bond and equity markets this explanation looks to be true and all you have to do is look at stock and bond markets around the world stocks are at record highs and bond markets are so high that it doesnâ t even make any logical sense at all 13 trillion worth of debt carries guaranteed loss and thatâ s only nominally the entire yield curve in the united states is negative in real terms and we are now pluming new record lows all treasuries at all maturities are yielding less than the current government sanctioned cpi inflation rate now while the explanation â the inflation is stuck in bonds and equitiesâ may actually be true the explanation itself is still very lacking because of its extremely broad strokes approach in trying to answer the question itâ s not satisfying how does money get â stuckâ in bonds and equities exactly what does this really mean what are the mechanics of it and what can those mechanics tell us about the possible route of escape of this money back into the consumer sector if that can even happen in this article i will try to answer these questions using the reasoning of alasdair macleod head of research at goldmoney his three recent articles have helped clarify and hone these issues here i will try to distill his answers a bit more and separate out the layers with a bit of history two ways price inflation can progress according to macleodâ s reasoning there are two basic ways price inflation can become obvious excluding patently corrupt and completely dysfunctional countries like zimbabwe or venezuela the first model is the classic weimar germany experience where inflationary financing of government spending ends up directly in bank deposits owed to individual consumers as consumers spend this money consumer prices gradually rise until the public catches on and starts to dump the currency for anything that might retain its value more effectively the currency then becomes worthless in weimar this process took 9 years from the beginning of the inflationary financing for world war i until the final collapse of the currency in november 1923 it was a gradual process of snowballing that took about a decade a more modern example of the weimar model in a developed country that is almost never mentioned is the case of israel which experienced a process of hyperinflation that also took a similar amount of time to complete this was from october 1970 when israelâ s inflation rate began to break the double digit barrier consistently until the final collapse in 1984 1985 with the inflation rate peaking at 486 the whole process took about 15 years and two currencies died in the process â the lira and the shekel israelâ s currency today is the new shekel however gradual snowballing consumer level hyperinflation is not the only way a currency can die there is a different kind of price inflation that is quick and brutal more like a hurricane hitting all of a sudden out of nowhere it is preceded by a long period of consistent low price inflation coupled with speculative fervor in the capital markets when that fervor dies capital prices collapse the new money moves over to the consumer sector and we see rapid consumer price inflation in the space of only a year or two macleod explains here are differences between the european hyperinflations of nearly a hundred years ago and the situation today in america and britain as well as in some eurozone countries the majority of bank deposits are not owed to individuals because consumer credit predominates with eighty per cent of employees in these countries typically living from paycheck to paycheck and credit card borrowing being the norm there is a greater weighting of institutional deposits in todayâ s banking system than in the past in the case of the us dollar total checking and savings accounts of 12 15 trillion includes about 4 trillion of foreign owned deposits through correspondent banks credit card issuers and other finance companies accumulate significant cash flows and therefore deposits financial speculators such as hedge funds in the interest arbitrage business also maintain significant balances as repo collateral â they are not in the business of spending on goods and do not make relative value judgments in this basic sense they are more likely to be spooked by purely financial developments this is the meaning of inflation being â stuckâ in the debt and equity markets rather than the consumer sector institutions buy and sell capital to one another they donâ t bid up the price of food at the grocery store when the new money being issued by central banks in exchange for buying bonds is used to bid up equities the inflation gets â stuckâ there the vast majority of new government debt is not bought by individual consumers looking to make a return on their savings that would be crazy since real rates are negative across the board so who is buying it letâ s take a look source from this chart going up to q2 2019 we see that individuals are only a tiny fraction of investors in treasury bonds in 1996 they comprised about 25 of global holders the chart above excludes intergovernmental holdings if we include those individuals only hold less than 9 of total issuance the rest are institutional investors which donâ t influence consumer prices directly one thing to note about the graph above is that the recent jump in individual holdings of treasuries around 2017 probably shouldnâ t be taken as an indication of individual investor interest in holding treasuries the jump is likely the tail end of speculative fervor in short term trading of treasuries for capital growth rather than holding them to maturity or at least intending to make some income off the interest payments in any case it is nevertheless true that consumers can get a meager drip of this inflation by going into debt thanks to lower and lower artificial interest rates but consumers are constrained by their ever diminishing power to stay above water and can only bid up consumer prices so far and so fast but at some point it wonâ t be consumers bidding up consumer prices it will be institutions bidding up commodities as the prices of financial assets collapse is there historical precedent for this indeed there is as macleod points out itâ s the john law mississippi bubble of 1719 1720 the collapse of that bubble began in december 1719 and was completed by november of 1720 exactly 300 years ago it did not take long and saw the collapse in value of shares in the mississippi company together with the collapse in the value of the french currency at the time the livre what caused the mississippi bubble and its collapse the mississippi bubble came about as a result of one manâ s monopoly over the french money supply john law a fugitive from england wanted for murder fled to france and made use of his connections with the ruling french regent after the death of king louis xiv law created a scheme where he would issue shares in the french mississippi company which would pay dividends out of the trade profits from the mississippi valley in louisiana further these shares would themselves circulate as money this effectively linked the value of the equity with the value of the french currency itself tying their fates together from the outset i wonâ t go into the whole story here but those interested can read a fuller account from and austrian school perspective in the book early speculative bubbles and increases in the supply of money by douglas french as french the author shows the value of mississippi shares collapsed from 10 100 livres in december 1719 all the way down to 3 300 in december 1720 during that time price inflation skyrocketed as well these two charts from frenchâ s book show the extent of the currency collapse in 1720 and how it was concurrent with the collapse in equity in the mississippi venture as we can see commodity prices jumped 75 from july 1719 to september 1720 in paris while real wages fell 33 the livre in that time fell 70 against the hard backed british pound similarities to today today the fulcrum point of financial asset values is not quite equity as it was in the mississippi bubble but debt itself the value of the dollar is therefore entirely dependent on the value of us treasuries if one falls the other will too equities would be merely caught in the middle of this tango collateral damage as it were if and when this happens all the newly printed money since the 2008 bailouts does not just disappear it would have to find some place to go it would most likely storm the consumer sector in a torrent as speculators would bid up the price of real assets in the commodity sector when the bond bubble bursts the only one buying debt would be the fed itself and sellers would hit the fedâ s bid the fed may be able to keep rates nominally low with enormous quantitative easing but all the money the fed would print in order to keep rates nominally where they are would be used to further pump up real assets and the commodity markets if the fed prints it will then directly flood into consumer prices at that point the problem today is that consumers are so indebted they wonâ t be able to protect themselves from any of this once it happens further unlike lawâ s scheme which tied together the value of mississippi company equity with the livre todayâ s debt based scheme is a much more tangled web with the values of all fiat currencies linked and welded to the dollar which is in turn welded to the value of us treasuries if the latter falls all fiat currencies collapse with it itâ s the mississippi bubble on steroids with consumers left with nothing but debt the only question becomes which commodities climb the fastest since this would be a monetary tragedy first and foremost my belief is that gold gld and silver slv will climb faster than anything else protecting current holders from the worst of what will be global consumer price inflation that will come on like a hurricane except this time it wonâ t be confined to just a few cities in france it will be felt throughout the dollar based world the trigger what triggers it it is impossible to know for sure and i donâ t pretend to know but all speculative bubbles pop when triggered by something there is always something what we do know at this point is that chinaâ s economy the biggest manufacturer by far in the world has effectively been shut down since january 25 the coronavirus has also now infected italy europeâ s most indebted country the global debt pyramid is absolutely dependent on continuous economic growth to pay the interest to keep it going if that falters even a little bit the whole pyramid could quickly collapse conclusion watch the money supply in order to see if this is actually happening i will be tracking money supply statistics specifically at the turn of each month if growth is really slowing then we should see a dramatic slowdown in the growth of the money supply pretty soon the preliminary danger zone for the beginning of the collapse is august september as usual when seasonally money supply growth stalls anyway if we can get past that point without a significant slowdown in monetary expansion then we can perhaps get through another year without a collapse but if monetary growth slows down significantly this year it would mean that the global economy is stalling and the credit cycle may finally turn after 12 long years from the biggest and longest financial asset boom ever to the biggest bust and currency collapse ever seen stay tuned more on what i will be looking for in the money supply statistics in my next article

morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to american woodmark s third fiscal quarter conference call thank you for taking time to participate joining me today is cary dunston chairman and ceo cary will begin with a review of the quarter and i ll add additional details regarding our financial performance after our comments we ll be happy to answer your questions cary s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott and good morning to you all although we are pleased with our positive revenue comps our third fiscal quarter financials proved to be challenging as our margins were impacted by cost headwinds and volatility within our channels the market itself is undergoing change that we have been predicting for some time now although the foreseeable future will be quite dynamic to say the least we continue to make significant strides forward in our long term strategy and remain very optimistic about the market and our future position as an industry leader with regards to net sales for the fiscal quarter we were up 3 within new construction which includes our timberlake and pcs businesses we grew 5 3 over prior year looking specifically at our timberlake direct business revenue was in alignment with overall single family start growth and considering the lag from the start to cabinet installation regarding our unit growth we outpaced our net revenue growth as we continue to gain share as expected as a percentage of opening price point homes continues to expand we are seeing an impact on our average take per cabinet by region we saw strong growth in the southeast texas phoenix and northern california our pcs business in southern california remains a challenge although the market has seen some recent growth in starts pricing on recent bids become so competitive that our business continues to be negatively impacted we are conducting a strategic analysis of this market and we ll continue to make the right decisions for our business overall within new construction we remain optimistic on continued growth particularly within our timberlake direct business as we leverage our low cost origins platform the economy remains strong and our large builders continue to invest and increase our overall share of the u s single family market younger consumers are entering the market and will fuel the growth of the industry for years to come looking at our remodel business which includes our dealer distributor and home center businesses revenue was up 1 6 to prior year our combined home center business was up 3 within this we continue to experience nice double digit growth in our home center kitchen and bath stock business not only are we benefiting from gaining a major stock kitchen market as we communicated previously but our entire business is comping favorably across the country as we see a shift in more affordable solutions in addition we do believe we are seeing some impact of the chinese tariffs on our stock kitchen business i will provide more commentary on the tariffs in a few minutes within our center frameless business we also once again experienced double digit growth this designer series product is simplistic and value focused a reflection of how the market is transitioning unfortunately the higher priced made to order business within home center continues to be challenged promotional activity remains very elevated and is favoring higher priced competitors the opposite of where the market is going we stand firm that promotions are not the solution to driving younger consumers into the stores or to improving closure rates it is very clear in our industry the demand for more affluent baby boomers is declining within r r and younger generation will begin to backfill this demand over time strategically we recognize this new consumer group are requiring much less complex and affordable solution than what exists today and we remain committed to providing a competitive solution in alignment with this changing environment regarding our dealer distributor business we were down 3 3 for the quarter within this we grew our waypoint dealer business over indexing the industry per kcma data however our distribution business comped negatively for the quarter part of this change is a conscious transition of some business from distribution through our direct timberlake channel however we re also seeing a pricing challenge in southern california and in a couple of localized areas in summary significant volatility continues between and within channels we are absolutely seeing a shift in price point in the industry as we have predicted for some time now the challenge remains with regard to strategically helping our retail partners transition to a more simplistic and capable purchasing experience product is a piece of this however the scope extends far beyond product as we must greatly enhance the entire consumer purchasing process including our digital interface we know the next couple of years will be volatile but mean we firmly believe there will be clear winners within our industry we are absolutely investing to ensure we are not only a winner we are leading a change i would like to take a moment to comment on the antidumping lawsuit and associated impact commerce has rolled on the final rate pending approval by the itc although not so significant scott will provide the details on the extent of the change from the initial ruling regarding the overall impact of the tariffs as i mentioned previously we believe we are seeing some transition from the imported all fiber construction cabinets to the stock business however based on kcma data it is also clear that the overall impact on the special order business within america is minimal at best as i mentioned on our call last last call significant inventory was built prior to the antidumping penalty taking effect this inventory is certainly being depleted however it is difficult to know the remaining levels on the positive we do have clear data that shows a very significant decline in chinese cabinet imports at the same time we are seeing a very aggressive ramp up of cabinet imports out of countries like vietnam and malaysia in the past year these two companies alone have transitioned from a relatively insignificant cabinet volumes exporting over 30 of the volume that china was producing prior to the tariffs it is not clear what components are actually being produced within these countries versus how much a legal circumvention is being achieved we do expect this circumvention to continue however thereby greatly reducing the overall impact of the akca only time will tell however we do remain committed to finding a domestic solution that can successfully compete against imports keeping manufacturing in america and expanding our core competitive advantage of service lastly on china i thought many would be interested in any potential impact we may experience from the coronavirus on the positive we had previously built inventory as part of the chinese new year shutdown we are in contact with our china suppliers and have confirmed they have all reopened but they are currently operating at less than full capacities at this time based on the virus mitigation process and supplier ramp up plans we are not anticipating any significant impact we will continue to monitor the situation very closely moving on to our gross margin for the quarter we came in at 18 3 versus 20 in the prior year in general our operations continue to run well and we further capitalize on cost synergies yet we were challenged by some inefficiency due to the number of down days we have to schedule in the quarter we typically always experience our lowest incoming demand rates for the year in the winter months of our third fiscal quarter to better balance our system and retain backlog at appropriate levels we scheduled down days in our system although beneficial overall they do introduce some inefficiency into the system more significantly the cost of tariffs product awards supply disruptions and the move of our facility in california were simply too significant to overcome 301 tariffs are well understood by most in the industry although we have managed to minimize much of the impact there are some products that are very difficult to source outside of china our teams continue to work on options to further minimize the impact with regards to the particleboard supply unfortunately the impact is being prolonged due to extended start up by the new facilities being opened in the u s a significant amount of capacity was renewed within the u s by dp and unfortunately we were more dependent on this supply than our competitors we managed to successfully resource material however has come in at a price and logistics premium significant capacity is ramping up as i speak within the u s however the manufacturers are slightly behind schedule our team is working very closely with our partners however we expect to continue to experience a cost headwind into the near future scott will provide specifics to this in his comments lastly the majority of the cost of our plant relocation in california was incurred in our third fiscal quarter on the positive the move is now complete and finished ahead of our plan on cost moving on to our adjusted ebitda margin we finished the quarter at 12 7 versus 13 6 from prior year the key drivers for the cost headwind and inefficiency impact on our gross margin as i previously discussed in addition to the mix impact of lower than expected sales within our made to order r r business with regards to sg a we did continue the positive leverage of the business and lastly on financial scott will provide details on our cash position however we are extremely pleased with our investment we have paid down our debt following the acquisition our cash generation allows us to not only pay down debt but make important strategic investments for the future in summary it was a challenging quarter on margins as well as made to order buying within home center r r the cost headwinds are frustrating side release however we remain committed to continue to mitigate the impact of both the tariffs and particleboard disruption more importantly as recognizing the changing dynamics of our industry we truly believe our industry is going to be disrupted over the next five years this disruption will come in the form of changing consumer expectations the requirements to offer much more affordable solutions and the need to greatly simplify and enhance our overall remodeling experience these changes will require tremendous strategic thought disruptive innovation and extensive understanding of systems thinking our new vision and related strategy are aggressively moving us forward in all aspects this strategy will require investment over the next three to four years and we are well positioned to make these investments continue to win in our industry and provide strong financial returns for our investors we remain excited about the future and are very confident in our ability to not only disrupt but to create a true competitive space within our industry with that i thank you and i will now turn it back over to scott for the detailed financials m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks cary the financial headlines for the quarter net sales were 396 million representing an increase of 3 over the same period last year adjusted net income was 22 million or 1 30 per diluted share in the current fiscal year versus 24 1 million or 1 40 per diluted share last year adjusted net income was positively impacted by higher sales which is more than offset by tariffs net cost impacts related to our product award supply disruption and duplicate rent move costs related to our california facility move adjusted ebitda was 50 1 million or 12 7 of net sales compared to 52 2 million or 13 6 of net sales for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year for the nine months ending january year to date net sales were 1 251 billion representing an increase of 1 1 over the same period last year adjusted net income was 89 2 million or 5 27 per diluted share in the current fiscal year versus 88 2 million or 5 05 per diluted share last year adjusted ebitda was 182 6 million or 14 6 of net sales compared to 181 1 million or 14 6 of net sales for the same period for the prior fiscal year the new construction market grew during the quarter recognizing a 60 to 90 day lag age from the start and cabinet installation the overall market activity in single family homes was up 8 1 for the financial third quarter our builder channel net sales increased 5 3 for the quarter the made to order frame direct build to order business exceeded starts on a unit basis and this was offset by price net and negative comps in our frameless business the remodel business continues to be challenging on the positive side unemployment and interest rates remain low and existing home sales increased during the fourth calendar quarter of 2019 on the negative side the median existing home price rose 7 8 to 274 500 for december impacting our consumers affordability index and this year first time buyers decreased to 31 in december our combined home center and independent dealer distributor channel net sales grew 1 6 for the quarter with home centers increasing 3 and dealer distributor decreasing 3 3 the company s gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 was 18 3 of net sales versus 20 reported in the same quarter of last year gross margin in the third quarter was unfavorably impacted by tariffs by 1 8 million net cost impacts related to our product award supply disruption of 0 5 million and duplicate rent move costs related to our california facility move of 1 6 million our facility move is complete and i want to thank our operations team for successfully transitioning facility without disruption leverage from higher sales was offset by the cost standard along with operating inefficiencies year to date gross profit margin was 20 3 compared to 21 for the same period in the prior year gross margin for the first nine months of the current fiscal year was unfavorably impacted by tariffs of 5 4 million net cost impacts related to our particleboard supply disruption of 3 million and duplicate rent move costs related to our california facility move of 2 4 million these impacts were partially offset by leverage from higher sales and operating efficiencies total operating expenses were 12 2 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with 12 9 of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2019 selling and marketing expenses were 5 4 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with 5 8 of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2019 the decrease in the ratio was driven by lower spending and leverage from higher sales general and administrative expenses were 6 8 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with 7 2 of net sales for the same period of fiscal 2019 the decrease in ratio was driven by lower spending and leverage from higher sales free cash flow totaled 80 2 million for the current fiscal year compared to 106 2 million in the prior year the decrease is primarily due to a onetime tax benefit received in the prior year related to the acquisition and timing of inventory and accounts receivable net leverage was 2 26x adjusted ebitda at the end of the third fiscal quarter and the company paid down 18 million of its term loan facility during the quarter in closing i wanted to share a recent update on the akca trade case the department of commerce announced its affirmative final determinations yesterday and the international trade commission is scheduled to hold a final vote by april 6 if approved the countervailing duty rate would increase from 16 41 to 20 93 and the antidumping duty cash deposit rate would increase from 28 71 to 37 96 for the quarter we were pleased that we delivered positive comps in repair remodel and new construction for the first time this fiscal year margins were challenged during the quarter with lower than expected sales in the made to order frame and home center and distributor channel and the costs related to the move of our california facility regarding the previously disclosed particleboard supply disruption the company could be negatively impacted by higher pricing and incremental transportation cost of up to 1 5 million to 1 9 million per quarter until fully resolved the company maintains property insurance including business interruption dependent property coverage with a limit of 5 million the company realized a 5 million reimbursement during the nine month period ended january 31 2020 on that 5 million limit the company continues to believe it will grow sales at a low single digit rate for fiscal 2020 this growth rate continues to be dependent upon overall industry and economic growth the company s margins were negatively impacted in the nine month period ended january 31 2020 about 2 4 million for the move of one of our california facilities and 3 million due to the net particleboard supply disruption cost due to ongoing tariff costs and particleboard pricing transportation costs the company expects adjusted ebitda margins for fiscal 2020 to decrease slightly compared to prior year results this concludes our prepared remarks we d be happy to answer any questions you have at this time questions and answers operator we ll hear first today from garik shmois with loop capital garik shmois loop capital analyst so thanks first off i just wanted to ask just on the comments that you made around unit growth outpacing sales growth just wondering if you look out over the next several quarters it seems like this is an ongoing change in the industry and consumers moving down in price points so can you maybe kind of size up the delta between units and sales and maybe switching to margins is there any margin implication from this i guess trade down on pricing s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer garik this is cary look it s really difficult to say quantify the delta between the unit and the revenue growth it really varies by channel it even varies greatly by region by channel so the primary point in my comment there is you add new construction obviously as we see a transition down to the first time homebuyer naturally it s going to be a smaller home and you re going to see a trend down in the price points to quantify that s going to be difficult i think as we get more gain more knowledge with regards to the how aggressive that first time homebuyer enters the market and how aggressively builders make that transition versus the ratio of existing homes because obviously we re seeing some transition down but builders are continuing to build some nicer homes out there as well so that mix is going to be very important with regards to that formula so we ll continue to keep an eye on it with regards to margin particularly in the builder side we committed all along that was one of the key rationalizations of the acquisition is bringing in the low cost origins product and we ve been committed to maintain our margins albeit or price point but to maintain our margin percentage at those price points you get in r r i think it s extremely difficult the market is so dynamic right now particularly with the impact of the tariffs really seeing what others are doing regarding imports and then you throw in the transition that we re all trying to figure out is how much of the impact kcma data right now is driven by the tariffs versus just the move down and let s say the slowdown of the baby boomer population and their r r and the pickup in the younger generation and certainly it s starting but that pace is it s really difficult to assess right now just because of the number of variables that we re all being faced with so i think over the next six months we ll probably get a much better picture us and everybody else we ll get much better picture of how the industry is shaping up but it s something we have to keep a close eye on but right now we re obviously committed to try to maintain relatively close margins albeit scott s point on these headwinds are a little bit of a challenge right now but it s been our stated goal to maintain our margin percentages as we continue to grow garik shmois loop capital analyst okay just one follow up on the margin outlook it seems like you took down your fiscal 20 margin guidance and not looking now for a slight decline which i guess makes sense given though the factors that you identified if you look out into the fourth quarter maybe into fiscal 21 i just want to be clear are some of these cost and margin headwinds expected to continue moving forward or is it just kind of your downdraft in your margin outlook really a function of some of the headwinds that you saw in the third quarter so i just kind of want to be clear on kind of the change in the guidance m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yes sure so let s talk about the three buckets again so the first one would be the facility move which is now complete and behind us so we won t have any of those onetime costs associated going forward into the fourth quarter or in the future fiscal year of course we re not yet releasing any type of outlook perspective on our fiscal year 21 we re just in the process of starting our budget cycle we ll certainly have a lot more to offer around that next quarter we get together but the next bucket we ll talk about is tariffs which continue to impact the business inside q3 certainly expecting that into q4 as cary mentioned our teams are working to mitigate and shift where possible but likely to continue to see some headwinds on tariffs continuing into fiscal year 21 and then the last bucket is around the particleboard so just to give the nuance of that is we ve had a significant impact each quarter however we were getting reimbursed from our coverage in each of the last two quarters so the net impact was being reduced pretty considerably in our fiscal q2 and q3 inside fiscal q4 we re fully exposed and that s what my earlier comment was that could be 1 5 million to 1 9 million assuming the capacity comes online is currently planned that will reduce significantly as we shift into the q1 time period of fiscal year 21 but it s very dependent upon that capacity coming online by the other suppliers garik shmois loop capital analyst okay that s helpful thanks so much entrepreneurial m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator we ll hear next from steven ramsey thompson research group steven ramsey thompson research group analyst morning i wanted to start with starts and you said bids making it tough more challenging to win business there can you maybe put this in context from the recent past and as you look at options and plans to hold share or regain share what options do you have and how quickly will you be making the decisions and changes from kind of your shifting strategy s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yes so the pricing that i referred to was really two isolated areas one in southern california as it s tied to our pcs business and then we also actually have pcs both within new construction and we do have some distribution business in southern california so both of those are being impacted by some pricing and then you got a couple of very localized markets out there that primarily within multifamily that were out there doing some bidding and just given i think just given the downturn a little bit of bouncing you ve seen a slowdown as some others are getting very aggressive on pricing so we re going through a multi stage approach there s two aspects of this obviously we ve been faced with a lot of the headwinds that we talked about tariffs that existed for some time and a reminder that we ve never taken any pricing related to that nor do we plan to so we re in a relatively good position our stock product and our origins product is positioned very well within timberlake so it s really isolated through our pcs and i ll say 95 of that s in southern california so strategically we re evaluating it both from a just a cost to benefit analysis and how do we further address that market from i guess two aspects one was how low are we willing and do we want to go from a price perspective bid perspective and secondly is how much more efficient can we make our operations in southern california to really to make ourselves more competitive most of the data that we have right now shows that the pricing getting to the such a low level that nobody is really making money so it s something that we hope is short term but it is an impact and right now it has definitely impacted our revenue and we re making some conscious decisions not to bid on certain businesses just because it s gotten so low so we ll continue to run the analysis but right now i think it s i keep talking on our call about a lot of forward looking strategic change and part of that change is removing a lot of complexity within our operations both on our made to order platforms as well as our stock and our frameless platforms we have a significant operation or improvements under way to really both analyze and remove a lot of complexity in our business and that complexity not only creates a much better customer experience but also removes a lot of costs from the system so it s not an easy transition because complexity creeps in over years and you have to go after big chunks but that is a process we re going through right now so we re doing that in southern california and our operations that we just moved to riverside obviously we made we took the opportunity to make some changes during the transition but we also have a lot of work under way to really look at the product platform simplify it and take cost out of the system to allow ourselves to be a bit more aggressive but at the same time as we ve always communicated that we differentiate ourselves on service it s pretty rare we re willing to go down and just buy business because we offer a competitive advantage of service and that s true on pcs and that s true on timberlake so that s part of the strategic analysis we re going through so more to come in the future as we learn more and just kind of see how the market shapes up steven ramsey thompson research group analyst excellent and that kind of leads into my next question the long term industry disruption is this going to be is this accelerated or stepped up from what we ve seen is this purely the millennials being the prime customer going forward versus boomers r r and what is kind of the time line or do you have a rough time line on increased investments broadly through your system needed to address this change maybe just any more detail that give us some color on the long term s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer great great great question it s we re learning every day as i mentioned before it s really hard to go out and collect data today specifically to the cabinet industry and that really identifies the transition that we re undergoing with regards to our consumer base the baby boomers are certainly still in the mix and we ve heard for some time now that they re aging in place and that s had a positive impact on r r personally and this is just my personal opinion is we do believe that that s slowing down and over time that will be backfilled by i must say the younger generation so it s not just the millennial there s certainly a younger x gen and as well as the millennial population that you continue to hear that millennials have the largest spending power out there today which is not as relevant in our space cabinetry is very discretionary as well as the fact that there s really been a big lag factor in the younger folks being able to get into single family housing and that really ties more to existing than new we ve said that once they get to existing they re going to be faced with some very old kitchens and so forth and personally we feel that will be a high priority for them certainly they re going to have to replace roofs and certain aspects of the home that are required to do r r on just because it s leaking or has to be repaired they re going to prioritize that first but the kitchen will come we believe relatively quickly just because of the age of the home so in the age of the kitchens within those homes so i think the transition is happening i don t think it s as aggressive as what probably the market would indicate right now just because there s so many other factors that are impacting the market including just overall slowdown in baby boomers the impact of the tariffs and so forth but i definitely believe they re in and they re coming i think when they really start to ramp up is when we re really going to see the impact on the industry and when i talk about disruption that is the true disruption that i think we re going to be faced with and the good thing is we talk about it internally we ve been talking about it for years now we clearly expect the younger generation to come in with a much different set of expectations and the attributes that they value they want a much different experience the average number of visits a consumer has to go back into a retail space today to really finalize the kitchen process would be mindblowing for most and if you ask younger regeneration how many times they d be willing to go back and forth that might be one at most obviously they re going to interface much more digitally they re going to they re willing to make transactions and work directly with designers via chat or live or email so i think we re going to have multiple points of entry for that consumer we re going to have to be willing and able to connect with that consumer in the ideation phase and to really manage that entire process for them because today it s very disjointed it s very difficult for a consumer to go from ideation to cabinet installation and one step process are with one specifier one facilitator of that process so i think that s going to be a high demand and i think we re in a prime position to leverage our builder center platform we have out there to expand our service and really start to offer some opportunities within the r r space that we ve never done before and that nobody in the industry has the capacity or capability to do so we see as a great opportunity i think like i said it s going to be a challenge and we re all learning and we re going to have to really reshape the company in some regards it s super exciting for us and we ve been looking forward to it but wish i had better answers on exactly when and how but i think that s the fun of it i think we re all in this and we re going to see how the younger generation shapes up steven ramsey thompson research group analyst excellent and does this mean that kind of as you get further into this that do you expect to hold the company margins and go forward incremental margins at a similar pace in place or do you think on the other side of this thing that there could be maybe a step down in margins but you can make up for it on volumes s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer certainly when you talk margin dollars versus margin percent obviously it s kind of a different story on margin percent we ve been committed and that we know there s going to be some volatility the industry is i think we ve i ll go back to come out of recession this industry has been pretty volatile quarter to quarter i think you re going to continue to see volatile but long term we do remain committed to our long term margins and there ll be periods of time where we re going to have to make some investments in the business but we do feel comfortable with our ability to continue to grow and do it at a margin rate that s acceptable long term we did commit and if you go back to the acquisition days we did commit to the 15 5 to 16 long term i think long term will be the question now but i think as we come out at the other end of this what i inform you as disruption in the industry is we are absolutely working on solutions and it s product solution it s very creative and innovative product solutions that s taking complexity out of the system and it s a much different approach to the consumer than we ve really ever gone after in the history of the company but i truly believe we can maintain those long term commitments on margin steven ramsey thompson research group analyst so thank you again operator we ll hear next from baird tim wojs s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer hey get some morning tim wojs baird analyst morning just on cary just kind of your commentary on some of the kind of reducing complexity internally and things i mean is this kind of a normal course of kind of planning for you or do you feel like there s some stepped up opportunities on the internal cost base that you re looking to kind of simplify it sounds like it s the latter i just want to kind of understand that better s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer no i actually say it s not normal i think that both the challenge of it and the excitement of it is we are truly looking at the term the phrasing we use internally is that we really can t go after and do what we do better we have to do what we do totally differently and that s really how we are approaching this it has to be step changes in what we do how we do it and the cost of how we do it so when we talk about taking complexity out it s not just you don t really approach it from a cost perspective you approach it from a system and process complexity and it s not just manufacturing it s throughout the entire system because the ultimate end goal for us kind of the bull s eye that we have that s out in front of us is this entire customer experience and being able to successfully manage that and create such a clear and sustainable competitive advantage in that space really forced us to step back and map out the entire process and then understand the complexities and then realize how big of these chunks of complexity we have to take out so the net benefit and obviously there s a lot of case studies out there with regards to system complexity and you have to make some tough decisions along the way but with the net vision of improving that customer experience ultimately you doing that gaining share and you come out as a clear winner so it s going to take the company places we ve never been before it s a very exciting time but it is going to take time to get there at the same time tim wojs baird analyst okay ok and then just on the new construction market how is that performing your builder direct how is that performing relative to your expectations maybe six months ago s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer i d say it s in line with our expectations the market is everybody is trying to guess where the market s going you ve seen growth estimates all over the place both for this past year and calendar year and then for this obviously the current calendar year we re in the growth estimates are all over the place we are in line we re certainly very pleased with our performance with our transitions of the origins business we stated go back 1 5 years to a year ago we stated it was not ramping up as quickly as we had hoped that had nothing to do with our internal capabilities that was just the move of builders just really start that transition in helping price point we re seeing that builders continue to make strong investments and gain improve their overall share in america and obviously given our share with them that helps us and then we actually because of the origins we are actually out bidding on business that historically we would not have been on so it s been a very strong positive for us and like we ve mentioned we are maintaining good margins on that business and it s a continued aggressive growth plan for us so you think about how many quarters we came out and announced results in timberlake stating that we ve over indexed the industry and we gained a lot of market share within new construction because of our direct to builder platform so we re very very pleased with it tim wojs baird analyst okay ok and then just on the margins scott so just to make sure i ve kind of got the pieces right so the facility costs those completely go away in next quarter and into 2021 particleboard will kind of continue to be an unmitigated headwind now that the insurance has kind of been used up and that could be kind of q4 and bleed a little bit into the first quarter and then when do tariffs sort of the unmitigated impact of tariffs lap for you guys m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer when do they lap it s probably going to be in q2 we ll continue to see impacts but it s the items we haven t been able to resource which is principally around hardware glides in a particular top so those are likely going to continue but there will be some relief when you do the year over year comparison versus the items we ve resourced tim wojs baird analyst okay ok and then i ll sneak one more in just you re close to your targeted leverage ratio now of about 2x any change on kind of a go forward basis over the next 12 to 18 months in how you think about capital deployment m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean longer term we as you pointed our key commitment has been to get back to low 2 but longer term i think to grow our business the good thing i mentioned on cash is we absolutely plan to invest cash for our long term shareholder return lots of opportunities to do that and we have internal organic opportunities to invest in our business and everything i just mentioned previously with regards to transforming our business will create a great opportunity to continue to invest in addition as i ll say opportunistic acquisitions we obviously this last one was a very very significant one we don t plan to do anything that large but as we look forward and we think about extending our leverage particularly within new construction and the fact that we enter a very large percentage of new construction homes in america to do the cabinet so how do you leverage that potentially in other areas or the potential acquisition we could conduct to leverage our track to build the platform and offer other products is there opportunity where you get into servicing is there opportunity to get in smart technology that much can leverage what we do so we re going to be very open we want to continue to grow the business and i think i personally we believe there s a lot of opportunities that are going to exist for us to do that tim wojs baird analyst right who can look on camera for you guys m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you tim wojs baird analyst thanks operator we ll hear now from david macgregor with longbow research david macgregor longbow research analyst take one second taking the questions are you seeing limited installation capacity as a growth constraint s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer you said installation tim wojs baird analyst yes installation capacity just your ability s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yes not really we ve knock on wood is we ve maintained a very very good business out there and i think one of the key differentiators we have with our timberlake direct business is we re so consistent so we ve gained market share we re very consistent in the installation business and the folks that we have out there are really dedicated to our business and so no we have not had any restrictions we had a couple of geographical markets that have grown very quickly in the past year that might have a little operational constraint but we got those back on track and so at this time no we re continuing to move along david macgregor longbow research analyst do you feel it s a source of competitive advantage for you it sounds like you re very confident in that s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer absolutely the whole platform is right once again just because of the fact that we re national we re in all the key markets and who we are as a company our build we have as you know we have physical locations and out there we have seven main and 11 satellite facilities that offer a very localized servicing and it just makes a big difference our reputation in the market it has a big impact on our ability to hire people as well and we tend to attract people that know the industry obviously whether it s installers or service techs or service reps the folks that most of the folks have been in the industry for quite some time and they love to work for timberlake it just really makes a difference it is absolutely a very competitive advantage for us david macgregor longbow research analyst yes second question just with regard to the build to order segment what are you seeing in the way of promotional activity within the bto and how do you expect that to change if at all in the next few quarters s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer i m sorry the bto promotional david macgregor longbow research analyst cadence next couple of quarters s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer we ll see we are very i would say we re very engaged with our key retail partners on the promotional activity and i think there s been a lot of i would say trialing over the past perhaps several years but perhaps next six months is continuing as merchants are trying different promotional approaches and so forth and i think we ve been pretty ardent all along with regards to our belief and promotions certainly are not driving new consumers in the door and we re we recognize that it s kind of a doubled edged sword obviously we re very cautious on going out and buying business and setting precedents particularly in the retail space when it comes to conditioning designers and conditioning consumers on promotions and we differentiate ourselves based on service not necessarily price but at the same time you have to be willing to compete so we re continuing to work with them we think it s some hopefully some more strategic decisions will be made in the coming months that not necessarily take promotional activity down but shifted into much much more productive buckets but i we ll just have to wait and see it s something that our team is working very aggressively on and we have very good relationships with our retail partners that obviously we ll continue to leverage and have these types of discussions with david macgregor longbow research analyst do you think you get back to growth in the build to order by just winning share or do you think there s hope for the category s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer the big thing there is category right so the retail space and i ll just speak kcma data obviously special order has been negative for a number of quarters now and i think it goes back to the question asked previously on the younger generation and where the younger generation is going to shop and how they re going to shop and will they walk in the door of the existing retail spaces and we certainly believe a certain percentage of them will but at the same time we believe that the retail spaces are going to have to make some changes to make themselves more inviting for the younger consumer so we are very focused on helping our retailers with that and a lot of the statements i made previously about investing in the digital platform and the overall customer experience is that is designed to help our retailers better manage that customer experience and we ll actually manage a lot of that customer experience for them that will be a win win for them and us so that s our goal david macgregor longbow research analyst thanks very much s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator we ll hear next from justin speer with zelman associates justin speer zelman and associates analyst thank you very much i just wanted to unpack these onetime items or discrete items i guess not onetime but the discrete items in the third quarter can you remind scott can you tell me how much the particleboard net impact was and what the insurance recovery was m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so the net impact inside the quarter was 500 000 justin speer zelman and associates analyst okay and for the full year 3 million net of insurance or is that a gross number m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer it s 3 million net year to date and we fully recovered the full 5 million and then you ve got exposure pushing into q4 between 1 5 million and 1 9 million justin speer zelman and associates analyst okay so as you think about the full year drag from the discrete items in fiscal 20 how does that look on any kind of a margin headwind basis and then how should we think about that as we look to next year in terms of some of these maybe becoming greater relief or offsets or positives next year as they unwind m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so i ll reflect back just on the earlier comments on that particular point so the facility move onetime cost certainly won t repeat as we go forward particleboard certainly continues inside q4 our expectation again as the capacity comes online and we will see relief against that going forward we still believe there will be transportation risk just because of the location of the facilities as we go into fiscal year 21 but we don t have that completely dialed in and finalized as again we re pulling together our budgets as we speak and then tariffs continue or increase or decrease unfortunately that all depends on the pulling or timing exactly how that shakes out but we do expect that to still be somewhat of an issue as we go into the first part of fiscal year 21 justin speer zelman and associates analyst just following up on it so when i look at these discrete items that you re calling out for at least the third quarter it was like 2 5 million of incremental items but when i look at the gross margin that gross margin is down 170 basis points it s closer to like 6 5 million 7 million and 7 5 million but there s about 4 million of other drag in there that is maybe you can help account for and then you mentioned some taking some inventory downtime or some production downtime maybe help us understand the balance of the year over year drag as it pertains to the margin pressure m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer sure we won t get into dollarizing each of those respective items but you heard cary talk earlier about down days we did have an incremental down day from a year over year perspective which creates some disruption we also had some inefficiencies inside the period in our facilities along with freight and healthcare was a bit of a drag on us inside the period the other thing i would encourage you to do is don t necessarily just focus on the gross margin change focus on the ebitda change we do have some dollars that have swapped between the categories year over year so i don t want to get buried in the nuances of that but operating inefficiencies the freight piece we talked about the incremental down day were the other key items justin speer zelman and associates analyst okay and the last question s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer just a little highlight on operating efficiencies as part of it s a down day part of it is some of our operations were actually ramping up so i talk about the growth on the stock side it s been very positive for us but when you ramp up as quickly as we re ramping up it does drive some inefficiency in the system that really is more should be short term because we are most of those operations are ramped up and we do expect continued growth in that but it s been a very nice growth for us but you grow as quickly as we have seen on that side it does create some challenges justin speer zelman and associates analyst okay that makes sense and then the last question for me is just as we were to rewind back five 10 years cabinet category was one that was able to obtain price it was a from an industry standpoint from other building products categories reasonably well positioned from a pricing power standpoint and now we have the antidumping duties rolling through chinese imports have collapsed you think the nature of the industry will allow at least maybe some price power in parts of the portfolio that maybe otherwise wasn t there before antidumping duties s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yes i think you have to define pricing power though relative to the market itself and yes i think the if we are still arriving on the baby boomer growth and that was the key point of our growth going forward i think you would absolutely continue to see some pricing power the challenge is while this is occurring we re seeing younger generation come in that s driving the market down so the market is peaking very clearly out there and where it s a transition into the building price point homes or younger generation starts to get in existing homes absolutely they will not be able to afford the level of kitchen purchases that the baby boomers have been doing for the past 10 years so i think that s just more of a market question once you start to balance that out if you get down to the specific price points and you come up with solutions that you find are competitive in the market i do believe you ll be able to see pricing power within those but the first step that folks really need to understand and the drive toward is being able to offer it s not just demand the ability to offer affordable solution being able to offer affordable solution that offers a clear competitive advantage what you don t want to become is a commodity business where everybody is driving all their capacity down to a lower price point and we know how that shakes out for an industry to do that so there s absolutely going to be the ability with the new generation to create a competitive advantage i think that s what s going to differentiate folks so once you have that clear competitive advantage then you start to differentiate yourself on price because people are going to pay for that value justin speer zelman and associates analyst thank you operator and with no other questions mr culbreth i d like to turn things back to you for closing remarks m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer since there are no additional questions this does conclude our call thank you all for taking

pferdehirt chairman and ceo of technipfmc stated we achieved an unprecedented level of inbound in 2019 including over 50 percent order growth in subsea with this success our backlog now stands at 24 billion an increase of 67 percent versus 2018 backlog grew across all segments with onshore offshore increasing almost 90 percent when compared to the prior year pferdehirt added our success was driven by an acceleration in the market adoption of our new subsea technologies our integrated subsea model iepci and continued strength in both lng and downstream project sanctioning onshore offshore inbound orders grew almost 80 percent versus 2018 driven by more than 8 billion in lng awards subsea integrated award value more than doubled clearly demonstrating that iepci has become the model of choice for most of our customers in addition to this tremendous commercial success in 2019 we have been proactively taking actions to better position ourselves for 2020 and beyond our announced separation into two industry leading diversified pure play companies is a bold visible step in this regard in parallel we are optimizing our subsea organization while transforming our surface technologies business in north america taken together these actions support our long term strategy focused on market leadership and business transformation pferdehirt continued turning to the subsea market we anticipate ongoing momentum in activity for small to mid sized brownfield projects and a continued healthy outlook for greenfield projects strength in project activity as well as our expectation for double digit revenue growth in subsea services provides the framework for 2020 subsea orders to approach the level achieved in 2019 however this remains dependent on the timing of one or two major project awards for our onshore offshore business we remain confident that additional lng projects will be sanctioned in the near to intermediate term despite current weakness in the commodity price the growth outlook for long term demand requires this additional capacity beyond lng we continue to selectively pursue refining petrochemical and biofuel project opportunities in surface technologies we anticipate double digit revenue growth outside north america in 2020 following growth of more than 15 percent in 2019 we expect north american activity to decline 10 percent versus 2019 which assumes improvement in drilling and completions activity in the second half of the year pferdehirt concluded our significant growth in backlog across all segments validates our strategy and provides us with confidence in our outlook we continue to demonstrate our global leadership in subsea lng and the international surface market operational and financial highlights fourth

dame minouche shafik is one of the world s most distinguished academics born in alexandria egypt in 1962 shafik went on to study at amherst college massachusetts the london school of economics and st antony s college oxford and has since worked for some of the most prestigious global institutions at the age of 36 she became the youngest ever vice president of the world bank between 2011 and 2014 she was deputy managing director of the international monetary fund she served as deputy governor of the bank of england until 2017 when she became director of the london school of economics in this interview with kathimerini conducted on the occasion of her visit to athens to speak at an event about the future of the global economy shafik offers her thoughts and ideas on the challenges and opportunities faced today at a greek european and global level in today s world it feels like we are observing the unmaking of globalization trade barriers are being raised and geopolitical tensions are being fueled by populist politics is this the beginning of the end of globalization or it is just a glitch before we get back to normal globalization has been effective in promoting growth around the world and reducing poverty in developing countries so it may not be time to write it off completely but globalization has not benefited everyone equally the middle class in emerging countries have benefited alongside the richest 1 percent while the incomes of the middle and lower middle classes in advanced economies have been stagnant this inequality is coupled with increasing feelings of insecurity as our systems of employment and welfare are under increasing pressure from a rapidly changing world with advances in technology and aging populations we need to put in place policies which will help citizens and workers adapt to changes or we will see worsening divisions and lose some of the benefits gained via globalization what are the chances that a major conflict between big powers the so called thucydides trap could disrupt global peace and cause a major recession this decade the chinese are worried about two traps the thucydides trap and the middle income trap the pattern that many countries rise to middle income level and never become high income countries the determination to become a high income economy is driving the push to become world leading in technology and high value added industries which is part of the conflict with the us we need to find a way for the us and china to achieve a mutual accommodation otherwise the rest of the world will suffer there is an african proverb that when the elephants fight only the ants get hurt smaller countries always benefit more from a rules based system since large countries can use their power to their advantage so for countries which are not one of the big powers the best hope is that the world economy is governed by rules that apply to all it has been said that the root cause of populist politics is widening inequality coupled with the ability of social media to amplify hate speech and division hence advancing the polarization of politics do you agree is democracy in danger there appear to be two strong forces behind the rise in populism a growth in economic insecurity and a sense of threat to identity coming from immigration and other aspects of modernity social media appear to be exacerbating this by spreading misinformation and encouraging extremist views which fuel populism populists do express some valid concerns prosperity from globalization and technological developments has not been widely shared however while some of their diagnoses may be correct their solutions are not populist policies will only lead to stagnation and worsening economic conditions and their anti pluralist rhetoric is a threat to democratic values and norms for example the dismissal of evidence the rise in partisan debate with loyalty rewarded above all else and the avoidance of transparency scrutiny or due process to tackle both the challenges around globalization and rise of populism we need to address the underlying causes create a fairer economy increase social mobility and develop more inclusive counter narratives about identity do you regret brexit do you think it is a major step back for both the united kingdom and the european union could it be the beginning of the slow unraveling of both the uk and the eu it is important to remember that the uk is still european even after brexit the deep historical cultural and human ties across europe remain we will have to find new modes of cooperation outside the eu a new trade agreement is an important step and even some of the more optimistic predictions suggest there will be a hit to the uk economy but there are many other dimensions security research and cooperation on international issues for universities specifically we have serious concerns about the future of student exchanges the immigration system and research funding in the long term international research collaboration and funding are essential in tackling major challenges like global disease and climate change so a long term solution to ensure this collaboration can continue is vital the good news is that everyone i speak to in universities across europe is keen for those collaborations to continue the west is constantly accumulating mountains of public and private debt something that is forcing countries to adopt austerity policies and implement unending central bank interventions quantitative easing negative interest rates etc as a way of preserving solvency and keeping the show on the road you ve been the bank of england s deputy governor for markets and banking and you must have been thinking about this more seriously than others so given all the constraints on modern economies is there any plausible path for western democracies to rapidly rekindle growth and tackle inequality in other words to borrow the title of your athens talk where is the world economy going i will try to tackle this question in my lecture in athens the debts accumulated by the advanced economies is largely the result of trying to cushion the impact of the financial crisis in 2008 instead of having a great depression we had a recession and large amounts of debt accumulation on balance i think that was a better outcome now we are faced with a period of very low interest rates because savings are greater than investment that high level of savings reflects aging societies the low investment is a product of low economic dynamism monetary policy has done a lot of the heavy lifting to sustain our economies in the recent period going forward fiscal policy and economic reform will have to do more of the work in this european and global context where is the greek economy going you were deputy managing director of the imf between 2011 and 2014 a critical period of the greek stabilization program do you think greece should have been treated differently by the imf do you believe the eu institutional lenders should now relax the primary surplus provisions for greece as a way of boosting growth greece bore a heavy burden of adjustment during the years of the eurozone crisis some of the reforms implemented were long overdue but the adjustment could have been eased if the architecture of the eurozone had been better developed the creation of the european stability mechanism and the measures taken by the european central bank certainly helped but the job is not complete we need better risk sharing mechanisms for things like bank deposits and fiscal shocks so that countries hit by negative shocks can adjust more gradually with support from their neighbors in the age of artificial intelligence will work as we know it become obsolete do you support the idea of a universal basic income ubi automation and ai will inevitably have an impact it has been estimated they will affect about 50 percent of jobs within the next 20 years robots can substitute for human labor as well as compliment humans there will be new jobs that we can t even imagine now that will emerge i am not worried that work will disappear i am worried that if we don t prepare people for these changes many of them risk unemployment a key change is people will need to continually retrain in new roles especially as retirement ages rise with aging hence adaptability and the ability to learn are so important and why governments should be investing more in education and lifelong learning i think there are many better options than a ubi paying everyone a fixed income is expensive and inefficient because it pays even rich people rather than targeting those who need it it also implies that some people have nothing to contribute to society which risks undermining the widely held principle that anyone who can work should and it does not take into account the importance of meaningful work to well being i think much better solutions could include part time work wage subsidies earned income tax credits or higher minimum wages combined with better access to services such as education health and other public goods you have said in the past jobs were about muscles now they are about brains but in the future they will be about the heart what do you mean by this tasks that are simple and repeatable are likely to be automated in future robots are poor at tasks that involve creativity empathy and working with people consider the huge progress being made in machines being able to diagnose eye diseases identify breast cancer or do simple surgery doctors jobs will change they will spend less time running diagnostic tests and simple procedures but once that diagnosis or surgery has been performed a person will want to speak to a human being to consult about their treatment get advice about how they will cope and benefit from emotional support it is not obvious at the moment at least how emotional intelligence team working and human understanding can easily be replaced you are a woman who was born in alexandria egypt how many additional barriers have you had to overcome in order to achieve such a distinguished academic and professional career what would you advise young women who are hoping to advance in the areas of politics science and public affairs alexandria a city that benefited enormously from greek influence was when i was growing up a cosmopolitan melting pot open to the world of course i faced barriers from a culture that thought women should marry young and stay at home but i also benefited from those who encouraged me my father whose property was nationalized during the revolution always said to me they can take everything away from you except your education so i was pushed to get a good education from a young age and throughout my career many people opened doors and gave me opportunities that counterbalanced the barriers i faced i always remember that with gratitude and try to do the same for others you ve been director of the lse for more than two years what is the lse s competitive advantage what distinguishes it from other academic institutions in terms of its worldview and the preparation it offers young minds to better tackle the challenges of the future there are several things that are distinctive about lse as it approaches its 125th

and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance please see our sec filings for a more complete listing of these risks and uncertainties inherent in our business and our expectations for the future on slide 3 you will see the agenda for the call david will start with his perspective on the quarter and our nexeo integration progress nick will walk through our results and our outlook and finally david will close with concluding remarks following that we will take your questions with that i ll now turn the call over to david for his opening remarks david c jukes president and chief executive officer thank you heather and good morning everyone we had another pretty hectic but exciting quarter at univar solutions taking many steps forward in executing our growth strategy and integrating nexeo s chemical distribution business i d like to highlight several key accomplishments from the quarter as well as speak to some of the challenges we faced in summary once again we controlled the controllables well despite a challenging macroenvironment in the chemical sector operating performance was commendable and in line with our expectations resulting in higher margins the overall integration of legacy univar and nexeo continues to go well our net synergy cost savings came in ahead of our previous forecast the first wave of erp migration was completed successfully and our second wave has now gone live and is also progressing on track we sold our environmental sciences business using proceeds to pay down debt and achieving our leverage ratio as a public company at 3 3 times our working capital efficiency improved cash flow was strong and our balance sheet continued to strengthen one thing we cannot control is the macro global economy and it continues to be very challenging we have plans in place to continue to execute in our strategies and financial goals in 2020 and i m pleased to introduce nick alexos our new chief financial officer his background of improving business performance is helping sharpen our focus and drive our strategies and financial goals nick has an impressive background in growth and margin expansion strategies most recently as evp and cfo at dentsply sirona and before that as managing director of madison dearborn partners llc concurrently i d like to thank carl lukach for his many invaluable contributions as our cfo and appreciate his expertise now as our executive vice president of corporate development nick will take you through the details of the quarter in a few moments but first let me add a little color to those headlines the double digit growth you see in our gross profits and adjusted ebitda reflects the addition of nexeo plus margin improvement from our disciplined approach to commercial execution from an improving sales force as well as net cost synergies from integrating the legacy organizations yet as we mentioned last quarter we have opposing forces in our results we have a sustained improvement in execution and capture of net cost synergies from the nexeo acquisition where we were able to pull forward an additional 10 million of synergies into 2019 for a total of 30 million however we have headwinds from lower global demand for chemicals dis synergies and a generally discretionary price environment that are partially offsetting these actions as we noted in the last call demand in the fourth quarter was quite low across many of our end markets for the ism pmi index that barometer of industrial demand being well below 50 in the usa with the integration of nexeo across our operations nearly complete we only track our performance by the reported geographies however our best estimates of our q4 results that include nexeo in the prior year indicate that our revenues on a constant currency basis are down low double digit with about two thirds attributable to lower price and one third attributable to volume including estimates for anticipated dis synergies from the acquisition this is generally consistent with the results of our key supplier partners and data from other industry sources our estimates on the same basis for adjusted ebitda indicate we earned about 6 less on a constant currency basis than last year as i said earlier our sustained focus on margin management along with synergy capture were offset by weaker end markets and dis synergies while we re intensely focused on increasing our ebitda we re equally focused on the long term opportunity to serve our suppliers and customers and grow share the global addressable market for distributed chemicals and ingredients is large and the value proposition of univar solutions remains attractive and well received during the past few months we successfully delivered on several significant integration milestones and business investments that i d like to highlight a few of those now the first wave of our migration to a single sap system for the americas successfully went live in q4 in the pacific northwest the second wave in the southwest began in mid january and is also going well i continue to be pleased with how we are executing this program there is no interruption in service our production and transportation schedules are on time invoices are being issued accurately while inventory management processes and records are working well with the successful go live of these two waves we now have approximately 50 of our usa business on sap and are on schedule to have it rolled out to the remainder of the usa before the end of the year our attention now turns to wave 3 which will go live early in q2 with lessons learned from wave 1 and wave 2 now incorporated into the plan while never complacent we move ahead of pace and with confidence this system migration is long overdue for the legacy univar business enables us to build agility into our operating model as well as delivery efficiencies it does however consume a large amounts of human capital to ensure these go lives are successful and disruption free for our customers and i look forward to that day in the near future when our focus can be exclusively turned externally to delighting our partners as we use the platform to grow profitable share a site consolidation plan continued closing eight branches in the quarter bringing 2019 closures to 12 additionally we finalized the sale of two of our more valuable sites as well as five additional sites for a total of 55 million we re in the early stages of realizing the benefits of optimizing our scale but remain true to our strategy of having a strong local presence for our customers one area where that scale really matters is our investments in digitization given the size and complexity of the chemicals ingredient supply chain a robust comprehensive digital infrastructure will be another competitive advantage our customers continue to adopt and use our digital solutions to search select source and self serve in growing numbers during 2019 the number of site visitors and active users of our platform more than doubled for customers it s becoming a more valuable and differentiating part of univar solutions customer experience and in 2020 we ll continue to expand both the capability and geographic reach of this platform meanwhile our advanced analytic team continues to leverage ai to help us better anticipate and serve our customer s needs and further improve our competitive offering our us commercial team with their redesigned sales territories launched dedicated sales support for all field sellers our new sales operating rhythm focuses sales managers on driving behaviors and coaching sessions with sellers weekly and new seller score board has been to align to each line of business to support key kpis that focus on reducing churn and driving growth but before we get carried away with ourselves and as a reminder despite sales territory realignment being complete the business is still operating on two separate crm systems which means we are more clunky than i would want us to be migration to a single crm has been pulled forward to the end of q1 which will make it much easier to get rapid access to key data to drive performance and growth recently we highlighted our abilities and strong commitment to technical differentiation particularly in our global industry verticals such as food ingredients beauty personal care and household industrial cleaning by holding our first ever customer supplier innovation day this was a splendid event with over 150 customers and suppliers in attendance we were able to put our flagship solutions center in houston on full display our focus on commercial innovation that enables us to truly differentiate with specialty chemical suppliers will deliver strong sustainable growth from marketing trend knowledge to concept definition sampling scale up and launch we demonstrated to customers how our technically qualified subject matter experts can help them identify and solve their most crucial problems the event was very well received by all who attended with a significant number of new opportunities to innovate and grow together being brought to univar solutions in the immediate aftermath it is often underestimated with our worldwide network of innovation experts supported by state of the art solutions centers we have as much capability as anyone to deliver technical application development excellence and significantly more than most now let me turn the call over to nick he will walk you through our fourth quarter results and explain our 2020 full year guidance then i would close with some additional comments nicholas w alexos executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks david i m delighted to be part of univar solutions and it s been a welcoming start with a great team of people across the company univar solutions is an enviably positioned in a broad based sector with many opportunities to add value in the supply chain while improving our margins by capitalizing on our scale the team here has accomplished a lot with many accretive strategies ahead as well i look forward to working with all of you on this call as david mentioned our fourth quarter financial results reflect double digit growth in gross profit dollars and adjusted ebitda the benefits from our nexeo acquisition our disciplined approach to commercial execution and improving sales force as well as the realization of net cost synergies of 15 million in the quarter and 30 million for the year drove improved gross margins and adjusted ebitda margins including our integration expenses for q4 we reported gaap net loss of 55 1 million or 0 33 per share compared to net income of 1 2 million or 0 01 per share in the prior year the current gaap eps benefits of nexeo s earnings better operating performance and the environmental sciences divestiture gain were more than offset by various taxes lower demand in global industrial markets a loss on extinguishment of debt and pension mark to market our taxes were significantly higher driven by increased international taxes us tax reform impacts nonrecurring transactions with foreign subsidiaries and a gain on the sale of the es business adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was 0 29 compared to 0 33 in the prior year this decline is attributed to lower demand in global industrial end markets a higher share count at 0 07 impact and a higher depreciation and amortization at a 0 04 impact offset by nexeo earnings and better operating performance page 6 highlights certain key financial metrics on a gaap basis gross profit dollars exclusive of depreciation grew 17 5 to 522 million or 18 4 on a constant currency basis our gross margin expanded by 170 basis points to 24 2 driven by contribution from the nexeo acquisition improved sales force execution and favorable product and market mix when adding legacy nexeo chemical results to last year s financials we estimate gross profit dollars exclusive of depreciation were down about 3 8 on a constant currency basis the positive impact from improved sales force execution and product mix were more than offset by lower volumes with approximately two thirds of this negative impact being driven by global macro conditions impacting demand and both chemical pricing and the remaining one third coming from the synergies our fourth quarter adjusted ebitda of 158 8 million grew 10 3 and 11 3 on a constant currency basis adjusted ebitda margin expanded 10 basis points to 7 4 we were able to achieve this performance despite the tough macroeconomic conditions affecting our volume adjusted ebitda was favorably impacted by the contribution from nexeo and our continuous efforts toward improved sales force execution and product mix as well as the realization of synergies as david mentioned on an estimated basis adding legacy nexeo to last year s results adjusted ebitda was approximately 6 lower on a constant currency basis positive impacts from margin improvement and synergy capture were more than offset by negative volume headwinds driven by the lower market demand and dis synergies our cash flow was significantly ahead of prior year largely due to the reduction of networking capital from lower sales demonstrating the resilient nature of our business model with countercyclical cash flow our top priority for use of cash in the short term continues to be deleveraging our residual cash earnings in the quarter contributed toward a net debt decline of 480 million ending the year at a 3 3 leverage ratio our lowest as a public company and versus 3 9 at the end of q3 2019 return on invested capital is down from 11 in the prior year to 10 1 in 2019 which will improve as we advance toward fully capturing synergies from integration we measure roic by dividing adjusted net income for the last 12 months by net assets deployed excluding goodwill and intangibles moving forward we will be including certain goodwill intangibles which will not only reduce the roic benchmark we will continue to fund a high return investments in our business and use residual cash earnings to pay down debt and plan to end this year 2020 with a relatively flat leverage ratio versus 2019 deleveraging could further benefit from additional portfolio divestitures of noncore businesses during 2019 we captured net cost synergies of 30 million and we are on track to achieve a 120 million annual run rate by the end of the third year from the nexeo closing date our estimate of integration cost remains at approximately 225 million in 2019 we spent roughly 100 million on the nexeo integration excluding deal related expenses and expect to spend 85 million to 100 million in 2020 as we ve said in the past and demonstrated in q4 monetizing excess facilities will provide substantial funding of these integration costs in 2019 we captured about 20 million of working capital and 55 million from property sales let me now share highlights of each of our geographic segments the us segment represents 63 of total consolidated net sales in q4 on a reported basis gross margin was higher up 130 basis points to 24 4 reflecting our focused margin management sales force execution favorable product and end market mix as well as nexeo s synergy capture on the cost front we managed our discretionary spending well and benefited by the net cost synergies from nexeo however in q4 2019 these cost reductions did not outweigh the macro impact on the business upstream oil and gas headwinds of 8 million and caustic price deflation of 4 million result in a flat ebitda margin adding legacy nexeo chemical results to last year s financials estimated adjusted ebitda on the us was down 9 5 the favorable impact from margin expansion efforts and synergy capture were more than offset by negative volume headwinds driven by market demand and the synergies estimated volumes including legacy nexeo chemicals was down 4 7 good performance in some of our verticals like food ingredients and personal beauty care where more than offset by lower demand in the upstream oil and gas markets and deal related revenue dis synergies our canada segment was 12 of total consolidated net sales in q4 our industrial chemical business in canada showed solid performance in the fourth quarter along with a contribution from legacy nexeo business we saw a continued strength in our focus industry lines which includes food ingredients personal and beauty care pharmaceuticals and the case markets the agricultural business also had some pick up due to a better product mix the energy sector continued to be sluggish and saw lower volumes the segment results were also negatively impacted by chemical price deflation our gross margin expanded by 230 basis points and adjusted even our margin by 70 basis points due to our continuous efforts for margin improvement adjusted ebitda increased 4 7 on a constant currency basis our emea segment was 19 of total consolidated net sales in q4 improved performance in our core chemical distribution business more than offset the continued market pressure in the pharmaceutical finished goods one our gross profit margin and ebitda margins also increased by 90 basis points and 60 basis points respectively despite the revenue headwinds adjusted ebitda increased 2 9 on a constant currency basis in a challenging macroeconomic environment our latam segment was 6 of total consolidated net sales in q4 in mexico our team was able to capitalize on the expanding energy market driven by government investment in brazil amid a weak economy we saw some recovery in agriculture and polyurethane adjusted ebitda grew 63 on a constant currency basis benefiting from improved operating performance in mexico energy markets and the brazilian agricultural sector prudent cost management along with the contribution from the legacy nexeo business and onetime gain on brazilian debt recovery excluding the impact of the brazil debt recovery gross profit expanded 26 2 net cash provided by operating activities is 329 7 million in q4 of 2019 37 2 million higher than last year reflecting our countercyclical cash flow business model we re also benefiting from harmonizing payment terms between legacy nexeo and legacy univar capital expenditures were 50 4 million and we ended the year with 122 5 million in total capex above our initial 2019 outlook driven by timing and additional funding of our digital infrastructure and growth initiatives turning toward 2020 outlook net sales gross profit exclusive of depreciation and adjusted ebitda are projected to grow as we benefit from the addition of nexeo our improved operating performance and our net synergies these gains allowed us to achieve margin improvement in 2019 despite the challenging macroenvironment this gives us a clear confidence in stronger margins with a recovering market we expect full year adjusted ebitda to be within a range of 700 million to 740 million with 2019 adjusted ebitda of 704 million and taking into account the environmental sciences divestiture and two months of nexeo the adjusted ebitda growth is up low single digits but is below our long term expectations with a continuation of weak industry demand in certain segments and related soft pricing trends we expect the first quarter of 2020 adjusted ebitda to be in the range of 150 million to 160 million as compared to 160 1 million in q1 of 2019 although we expect additional cost synergies in q1 the result in decline versus prior year is principally driven by low double digit negative trends in upstream energy and commodity chemical pricing deflation especially in relation to caustic soda and hydrochloric acid we expect an improved growth profile particularly in the us market in the rest of the year as many of our integration activities will be completed by midyear allowing for even more effective sales force execution our full year results will also be adversely affected by a decline in the finnish pharma business in emea as this product line becomes a small part of our earnings space the company expects to generate 120 million to 170 million in free cash flow which is net of a build in working capital driven by second half growth versus a decline in q4 2019 in determining our guidance we made the following assumptions flat industrial production weighted to a back half of the year recovery us energy headwinds continued estimated in 20 million of ebitda for the year pricing pressure in certain bulk commodities like caustic and hydrochloric acid impact ebitda by 15 million additionally our guidance excludes any continuing impact from the coronavirus outbreak from a direct sourcing perspective we have limited exposure however the interruption in supply chain both in and out of the region for our customers may have more risk and we ll continue to monitor the situation closely operationally we assume continued improvement in sales efficiency and effectiveness growth from new supplier authorizations especially in our dedicated industry verticals and specialty chemicals and nexeo net cost synergies of approximately 40 million in 2020 furthermore we assume emea finished pharma ebitda decline of 50 million net interest expense of 115 million to 125 million income tax rate for adjusted eps of 20 to 30 with no expected unusual tax items in 2020 diluted weighted average common shares outstanding of 175 million largely due to the shares issued in the nexeo transaction being reflected for the full year of 2020 free cash flow assumes capital expenditures of 120 million to 130 million which includes investment in digital infrastructure and other growth initiatives to increase our competitive advantage overall we are satisfied in how we re performing on our key strategies in the management of our cost during the slowdown in certain sectors the nexeo acquisition and integration has been a clear success which has furthered our ability to deliver and create long term value for all of our stakeholders with that i ll turn it back to you david david c jukes president and chief executive officer thanks nick as nick mentioned during our guidance for a variety of reasons short term customer demand has become more tricky to predict the effects of geopolitics and coronavirus related supply chain disruption mean the market is particularly difficult to read at the moment upstream energy in north america is depressed which reduces consumption of certain inorganic chemicals and has a knock on effect to pricing pressure in those key chemistries but i ve said before we ve operated in these types of constrained tight markets before our asset light model helps us fare better than many others our own focus for the past three quarters has been necessarily overly internal but thankfully that is now heading toward an end and we can be much more externally focused active and aggressive to grow faster than the market and win back any lost share of customer demand in addition we have multiple levers within our control which is roughly 40 million of incremental integration cost synergies in 2020 this affords us the opportunity to continue to invest in our expanded us sales force which as we get progressively less clunky and free of erp integration demands will only get more and more effective every day with greater market coverage and capacity for growth as well as disciplined spending and capital deployment we believe we have all the elements that will help clearly set us apart from the rest as we approach the first anniversary of the launch of univar solutions our confidence in the strategic rationale and value creation opportunity that comes from the merger of legacy nexeo and univar has only grown i m pleased to say that we have clear tangible evidence that the new culture is taking root and our growth strategy is working we remain focused on controlling the controllables while simultaneously building for the future our execution continues to improve we are executing at pace with discipline and are confident in our ability to remain agile and execute effectively sustainably and responsibly but in summary from the year we improved our operating performance with higher margins we achieved very good performance in emea canada asia pacific and latam markets we continue to successfully integrate legacy univar and nexeo with 30 million of synergy cost savings 10 million ahead of our previously disclosed forecast of 2019 we successfully completed two ways of erp migration to sap in the us we decreased our leverage ratio to 3 3 times 20 basis points below our leverage fourth quarter last year we completed two divestitures nexeo plastics and environmental sciences successfully executed on our site consolidation plan including the sale of seven of our sites and operated effectively in a very challenging macro global economic climates to better serve the needs of our suppliers and customers in addition to all these achievements i want to highlight two important strategies that are rooted in the values of the new univar solutions firstly we are ingraining our sustainability and diversity agendas deep into our culture where our signatory the un global compact as well as its 1 5 degree commitments and i m proud that we are now in the high upper quartile of ranking on the human rights campaign foundations corporate equality index recognizing the diversity and inclusion are at our core we remain true to our stated aim of making univar solutions a place where the best people want to work secondly and under our banner streamline innovate grow we continue to invest in innovation through both technical differentiation and advanced utilization to create more value for our customer and supplier partners we define distribution making it easy for us all to manage our businesses together we are becoming more commercially and operationally agile every day and are successfully positioning our company to deliver long term profitable growth and shareholder value thank you for your attention and with that we will open it up for questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from michael mcginn with wells fargo your line is open michael mcginn wells fargo analyst hi thanks everyone thanks for the time i just wanted to start off with free cash flow if you can walk us through if there is like a cadence throughout the year i guess specifically working capital your needs there as the demand environment range a little soft david c jukes president and chief executive officer sure michael thanks this is dave i m going to let nick to talk you through that he has those numbers at his fingertips nicholas w alexos executive vice president and chief financial officer yes michael nice to meet you on the phone clearly working capital varies with our topline and as we saw top line come down q3 and another in q4 we had a good source of cash flow we re also improving our efficiencies particularly on the days receivable side so going into 2020 as we re forecasting growth you re going to see a consumption at the same kind of ratio level into the quarters and that s a use of cash during the year roundly as we said in the 100 million to 150 million range so that will get normalized as we go forward in subsequent periods but that is a use of cash during the year in addition as we ve noted we had some extraordinary tax expenses in 2019 those will get paid out in 2020 and so you have an incremental use of cash there and the last thing i would say is we have a notable positive increase in ag prepayments in canada at q4 and that will stabilize again going into 2020 michael mcginn wells fargo analyst and are you able to frame what that dollar amount of prepayment that basically was built into 2019 number nicholas w alexos executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s roughly around 20 million in q4 or less going into next year about a 20 million differential michael mcginn wells fargo analyst okay and then if i can just switch gears can you give us an update on what you see in terms of the strategic actions on locations and then for freight consolidation how that is going to be benefiting ops going forward in any sort of timeline or i guess momentum building with the current initiatives you have under way david c jukes president and chief executive officer sure mike i mean we have an execution plan for the unite program i think as we said we closed i think in total 12 sites last year the site s closures and the consolidations really follow the erp integration the integration is going well so we ll probably do another 10 to 15 sites in 2020 so we have a very clear plan and a very strict discipline around that plan and you can see us executing on that systematically through 2019 and you should expect the same in 2020 michael mcginn wells fargo analyst appreciate it thanks for the time operator your next question comes from laurent favre with exane bnp paribas your line is open laurent favre exane bnp paribas analyst good morning first question is on the us conversion ratio it was up in q2 year on year up in q3 year on year in q4 it was down about 200 basis points i was wondering if you could talk about that i was a bit surprised that the synergies didn t come through in that lane thank you nicholas w alexos executive vice president and chief financial officer yes laurent nick alexos again thank you we are very mindful of our conversion ratio and clearly targeting an improved ebitda margin going into 2020 and beyond the shortfall in the us was principally as a result of the lower dollar dgp base we are including obviously the benefit of the synergies in the net ebitda number with some improvement but the mix of business and the lower dgp base caused a compression of the conversion ratio in q4 laurent favre exane bnp paribas analyst thank you and then if i may on the synergies so you managed to pull forward 10 million from 2020 i was wondering if there s no improvement in the second half on investment production how much of an opportunity do you have to bring forward some of the synergies from 2021 david c jukes president and chief executive officer hi laurent as i said on the previous call we got a very clear program and a very clear execution strategy against that program we re very confident that we can achieve at least 120 million of net synergies that we ve given guidance toward and we re consistently looking at how we can move from stabilizing the integration to optimizing the processes so that s something which we are looking at and addressing at the moment we are we re used to operating in tough markets and so we re pulling out our playbook to look at the things that we can do to accelerate cost savings or to streamline our business faster than we would want to do but what i won t do is i won t compromise and i won t put the integration program at risk by doing that but we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to now execute and to at least have the 120 million of net synergies laurent favre exane bnp paribas analyst thank you operator your next question comes from laurence alexander with jefferies your line is open laurence alexander jefferies analyst two quick ones can you give us a feel for what s going on with the regional exclusive account wins the larger customer wins and how much of a tailwind that should be giving to growth in 2020 and 2021 and secondly just a follow on to laurent s question given the levers you have could you maybe speak about in terms of apart from a sharp shock from corona what kind of environment would it take for ebitda to actually be posting negative comparisons year over year david c jukes president and chief executive officer sure i mean i think on laurence i think you re thinking about the exclusive supply arrangements that we have the exclusive distribution arrangements we have which will benefit and will support growth particularly in those global industry verticals like food ingredients beauty personal care and we re seeing some benefit in 2020 with our new arrangements in beauty personal care in germany and central eastern europe and also then with novozymes in canada they benefit those global verticals quite significantly so we do see a good amount of growth that we can get there that is a higher value growth it s more sustainable growth it takes longer to get because you have to technically formulate the chemistries and the ingredients into the new season of technologies but it is a key driver for the growth for us i think in terms of the current market we re seeing significant headwinds in energy which is unwelcome and what energy also does that it has a knock on effects on some of the key chemistries that are used in energy so things like in caustic and hydrochloric and so we re trying to understand the global flows on those products to see what we should be doing in terms of pricing and supply we do though have corona who knows i mean corona is it s a day by day thing thankfully we don t have much products which we directly sourced from china however the supply chains are very complex and our customers are affected both from products from china and selling to china so i don t know what we re going to do it is a day by day thing we do have confidence though as the year goes on as time goes on as every day goes on we free our sales organizations to focus what are in fact we have our entire organization we can focus on not integration not sap not sale territory realignment but growing with our customers and we continue to invest in that sales organization and so we re not cutting in sales we re investing in sales we re investing in digital we re investing in more ways to reach and touch customers so we believe that we should be our execution as it gets better and better should allow us to grow share on a relative basis and whatever the market conditions meaning it s a tough market right now we do have some headwinds energy is the biggest of those corona is a big unknown but there is a lot of self help that we can do laurence alexander jefferies analyst thank you operator your next question comes from jim sheehan with suntrust your line is open jim sheehan suntrust analyst thank you good morning on the real estate sales about 55 million in the fourth quarter have you received the proceeds of that yet david c jukes president and chief executive officer yes we have jim sheehan suntrust analyst terrific and regarding the working capital tailwind you had in 2019 was that mostly from lower demand or maybe you can break that out between where you benefited from better execution in integration and related to that how much runway do you have for improvement from integration and better inventory management and dso and dpo improvement david c jukes president and chief executive officer sure jim i mean i think if you look at what we said we would do in terms of working capital improvements as far as the integration program was concerned we ve picked up about 20 million and we achieved that 20 million i think as nick said earlier on we had higher ag prepayments than we would have necessarily expected or we re expecting to 2020 so that was a help and a support so i mean part of it is yes it s we have a countercyclical model and so we re harvesting cash but the chunk of it is stuff that we are doing and as i said we had 20 million in the plan for integration and we ve executed on that and we ll continue to work to improve our efficiency as the year goes on jim sheehan suntrust analyst thank you and can you talk about what your sales force effect in this progress that you ve gotten to date what concrete improvements have you made there david c jukes president and chief executive officer sure i mean i think as i said earlier on we are clunkier than i would like us to be because we re still operating on crms although we do have now one sales force and we are distracted by erp and that again means that i can t have everybody every day focused on knocking on doors and selling to customers we have seen something like 25 in uptick though in our call rate it s something we track every week we have a sales operating rhythm and sales dashboard that sales dashboard is something which my leadership team and i now look at every week so looking at kpis or the things that are driving sales growth so as the year goes on we ll just get better and better because we ll be less clunky i will be on one crm which means our ai can work up one sets of data to provide more information to our sales organizations to go target and win back business or win new business and we will have more and more people who will have nothing else to do but just sell rather than worry about sap worry about integration and i really look forward to that day jim sheehan suntrust analyst thank you operator your next question comes from bob koort with goldman sachs your line is open robert koort goldman sachs analyst thank you maybe adding on to that david you ve carried in excess sales capacity for a while here and the world is not getting any better at some point do you decide that maybe you need to right size that organization and then you talked about new kpis in sales how are those any different than sort of what you ve changed culturally in the sales approach over the last two years david c jukes president and chief executive officer hi bob look i think it s a fair question to say if you right size the sales organization the question is do you right size that against your current sales or do you right size against the opportunity and we ve chosen to right size it again through the opportunity so i think there is plenty of share that we can get here i know others right now are cutting their sales force i don t see that as a way to grow i think the very simple metric is calls equals orders i don t care how you do those calls but the more times you ask for an order the more chance you ve got of getting one and we want to grow our share profitability in all the markets that we re in we demonstrated that we could do that in every market that we operated in last year apart from the us and i understand in the us around the disruption less we give in for 2020 because the distractions go away so i would say that we are right sized again for the opportunity rather than against the current base of business in terms of the kpis i mean they are still very much about value and about value driven and the leading indicators that we re looking at are much more i guess tactical around customer contacts around must wins around must closes around price managements and so we have a pretty clear dashboard which can tell us down to a ground level whether a seller a region or whatever it is performing well or less well so we can take that back into the operating rhythm for the sales managers to manage and coach and develop their people so it s a very consistent against a consistent set of data value driven sets of disciplines to help us to execute patterns of sales organization robert koort goldman sachs analyst got it and i think nick mentioned that your finished pharma emea was going to be a 15 million ebitda hit is that right because it sounds like a very big chunk and how is it that business just goes away that seems pretty substantial david c jukes president and chief executive officer it is it s a product that we ve had or it s an industry we ve been operating in for a very long time the products we have here is coming toward the maturity and so the demand for that product is going down there s a bit more competition in there as well and some newer technologies so this is something which we can have foreseen happening over a number of years this is the first year that it s really impacted significantly but it s kind of anticipated in our long term forecast it s nothing that says there anything fundamentally wrong in the execution of the pharma ingredient business is around particular application nicholas w alexos executive vice president and chief financial officer and as we emphasized it s gotten down now to a pretty small proportion of our ebitda contribution in 2020 robert koort goldman sachs analyst thank you operator your next question comes from kevin mccarthy with vertical research partners your line is open kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst good morning david friday will be the one year anniversary of your acquisition of nexeo just curious what sort of report card would you give univar in terms of key metrics like earnings it integration other sources of synergy talent retention maybe you can run down the list and indicate where you ve been pleasantly surprise or underwhelmed as you ve gone through the first year david c jukes president and chief executive officer and thank you for noting the birthday we re very proud of what we ve achieved in the first 12 months of the business so our net cost synergies are very much on plan and we re executing them as fast as we can and ahead of our original estimates the ic transition of legacy univar to legacy nexeo is as you d expect it s very involved and but we ve successfully completed two ways of that about to launch our third way fairly shortly and already have over 50 of the business on sap and we haven t created the business like many other people do on sap or i may have done earlier on my career with sap so i m very happy with the way that s gone i still can t be complaisant on that and my fingers are crossed every time that we go live but we have a very good program of execution and i think we have a great team on that i think in terms of talent retention we really kept most of the talent we ve had very few less than a handful of regrettable losses that we have haven t gone to competition they ve gone for new opportunities in different places with some very talented people that we have but we managed to retain most of those so that gives us a good a good scorecard on that as well as launching a single company with a single culture so people do talk about legacy not us and them which is huge in this i think the cultural piece of any acquisition is massive and i think we ve handled that really really well so if i look at what we ve done i look at the themes of how they have delivered i think they ve delivered incredibly well i think it s been as good as we could have done it and i think they supply dis synergies are pretty much in line with what we expected i would have liked better sales in the us faster but that s probably unrealistic given a the amount of distraction we ve had as the integration is going on and b just the state of the marketplace at the moment and we re trying to spend a lot of time working out how much it does and how much is the market because we absolutely want to find the truth in there but we haven t had mass defections of customers we haven t had mass defections of people we haven t blown up our systems we haven t missed any of our synergy targets i think we ve done pretty well i have a huge amount of admiration for a team of people who worked phenomenally hard executing with discipline and at pace to deliver something which is now i think really as the next months go on and we get through that next wave of sap integration we get our crm integrated i think that that really does provide a great platform for growth so i would have if you d have asked me just a year ago i would have bitten your hand off kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst thank you for that second question for nick on the subject of free cash flow some others have asked about it i mean at the risk of beating a dead horse i wanted to probe a little bit more about what seems to be an apparent disconnect between your earnings guidance and the free cash flow guidance that relationship is usually counter cyclical as i think you noted in your prepared remarks slide 13 i think indicates some price deflation and so i was wondering if you could help you sort of clarify the relationship there for example does your range include any cash cost for restructuring were there any factoring of receivables or other unusual items that might explain the relationship or outlook for 2020 nicholas w alexos executive vice president and chief financial officer yes kevin i appreciate the question i think the biggest chunk is basically just the expected bounce back of cash working capital use on page 14 which is the recovery of the sales and obviously that would become cyclical if we did not realize those sales but clearly we want to grow into 2020 you had a big source of cash in q4 somewhat in q3 so that s just stabilizing at that level so going forward when we expect working capital to be flat with a normalized growth rate as i mentioned there s the cash taxes which include 30 million to 40 million of one time payments related to certain expenses that we noted in our 2019 results we ve not done any something that we ve planned we have very good receivables and have good collection rates and to your question earlier we do look for some improvement in our dsos but that s not a meaningful driver of cash flow going into next year and then the last piece was a 20 million expected year over year swing on the ag payment so i think our results in q3 q4 highlight the benefit of the countercyclical element that when you have a reduction in growth you do see improvement in cash flows and it will be evident as we move forward kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst thank you for the color operator your next question comes from dave begleiter with deutsche bank your line is open david begleiter deutsche bank analyst nick again just on the free cash flow looking at slide 14 if i look at all the elements bridge into free cash just on the slide 14 elements i get about 250 million i m still short or too high by about 100 million what is that gaap to get to the midpoint of your free cash flow guidance nicholas w alexos executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean there is a line item which you ll see on the cash flow statement which is just kind of other operating items that could flush through the cash flow that includes various accruals and some of the accruals of the one time expenses do flow through that what s not reflected on 14 is we have about the same level in 2020 as we have in 2019 so it s about 100 million use so that david would differential bridging and you ll see that if you look at the 2019 cash flow you ll see about 109 million of other which includes some of those below the line expenses that flow through accruals and those will continue on into 2020 thereafter they should come down to a more normalized level david begleiter deutsche bank analyst very helpful thank you and david just on the commodity chemical price deflation obviously most is caustic it s still be about 50 million this year and with 4 million in q4 what was it all of 2019 and how much of your business or ebitda is generated off of the commodity chemical or caustic distribution david c jukes president and chief executive officer look i mean i think as our bulk caustic business is probably how much we disclosed that in the past half maybe we re going to tell you something brand new here it s about 10 of our us business is in that in terms of earnings we re in that area clearly we then have a knock on effect into the packed business the caustic hydrochloric would be in terms of volumes the largest products that we sell in terms of value and profitability obviously not the largest products that we would sell we have silicon sales in canada and we have silicon sales into energy and other markets in the us and we have a really good business there which manages the market very well and so what we recognized at the moment is that this is going to be a tough year for caustic and it s a tough year for hydrochloric hence the numbers that we ve given for guidance for 2020 which is that kind of 15 million 16 million of headwind that we see in terms of what it may have been in 2019 we think it s maybe something like 4 million and then maybe another 8 million into energy so it could be up to sort of 12 million hit in 2019 operator your next question comes from duffy fischer with barclays your line is open duffy fischer barclays analyst yes good morning just a question around the comments you were making on guidance did you say that guidance excludes any coronavirus impact or it excludes any coronavirus impact getting worse from here nicholas w alexos executive vice president and chief financial officer i think our general view is we don t have a direct impact on coronavirus on the business there could be larger impacts if it persists and that larger impact would not be reflected in the numbers that we ve given for guidance but whatever is impacting the current environment we feel is reflected in our numbers to the extent it becomes something bigger that s clearly not david c jukes president and chief executive officer so for instance duffy i think we ve given guidance to what we know at the moment what we don t know is what s it is going to do to our italian business for instance as italy suddenly what s it is going to do to italian i haven t got a clue our italian business is not massive in the round but this thing is developing on a daily basis and so we don t have a crystal ball for those things we didn t expect the market to drop 1 000 points yesterday it s evolving so we ve told we ve given guidance to be conservative about the things that we know but there s a lot still that we don t know duffy fischer barclays analyst no very fair ok and then second question it seems like you ve got big prepayments in your canadian ag business what does that portend for the outlook for that business this year that s one that suffered a little bit over the last couple of years is there a meaningful bounce back happening in that business this year nicholas w alexos executive vice president and chief financial officer we do not factored in a meaningful bounce back we re looking at it to being stable to slightly positive going into 2020 duffy fischer barclays analyst great thank you guys david c jukes president and chief executive officer well i mean you know we re not weather forecasters nicholas w alexos executive vice president and chief financial officer yes david c jukes president and chief executive officer and so but i mean the farmers are feeling a little more confident it maybe tells you that supply chains are emptier after three bad seasons and of course we re shifting the focus of our ag business and to be slightly less seasonal risky products why the move into bio ag so i think it reflects probably that supply chains are a little emptier than they were and that farmers wanted to secure some deals and stop for this season and then we ll now wait for the weather operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn the call back over to the presenters heather kos vice president of investor relations thank you ladies and gentlemen for your interest in univar solutions if you have any follow up questions please reach out to the investor relations team this does conclude today s

is pandemic pandemonium setting in risk off extended further overnight s p500 down a further 2½ heading into the close selling intensified in the afternoon after the us centers for disease control and prevention indicated they expect a sustained spread of covid 19 in the us and advised communities to prepare it s more a question of when fixed income rallied again as the preferred hedge of choice with us 10y yields slipping a further 5bps to 1 33 30yrs set a fresh record low of 1 8 oil down an additional 2 8 gold lower into the close gold lower say what are the gold markets selling to cover more equity margin calls to suggest the market is a tad skittish over the coronavirus becoming a pandemic could very well be the understatement of the century with the virus morphing into the market s biggest macro worry of the decade given the lack of testing facilities as of monday only five us states california illinois nebraska nevada and tennessee can test for the virus according to the association of public health laboratories aphl reuters it s feared that there are far more cases than what is currently reported and since the containment strategy in the us is thought to be more penetrable owing to looser enforcement and greater reliance on voluntary cooperation suggests a clustered super spreader virus crisis could accelerate exponentially every few minutes i see another travel ban headline while corporations and government agencies are stepping up efforts to stop travel to infected or suspected countries supply chain disruptions are coming and if we were struggling to determine which particular straw broke the market s back its the susceptibility of the us market to this insidious virus that needs to rank beyond all other and you can t unscramble this egg and without question it seems to be the bearer of the truth the global habitat let alone the market is ill prepared to deal with an epidemic of these proportions as the porous containment strategies outside china could lead to an exponential flurry in new cases reported god helps us if as suggested by some medical experts 40 70 of the world s population becomes infected over the next 12 months wasn t this supposed to be over by now and only a week ago it would still have been considered scaremongering to talk of a covid 19 in pandemic terms but now the markets must deal with the harsh reality that the covid 19 s global footprint is likely to grow gold and cross asset markets renewed concerns about the depth and duration of the coronavirus impact on global growth were triggered by apple s lower revenue guidance and exacerbated by us pmi data but the outbreak of cases in the us has seen risk pricing jump to december 2018 levels so far the market sell off has been reasonably well controlled in us markets still the spx is now nearly 8 below its 19 feb intraday high and the vix breached 30 cross asset moves were also plentiful with the us 10 year below 1 4 for the first time since july 2016 rates markets pricing 2 5 cuts over the next year but gold is lower i don t have a particularly salient answer for that still i m wondering just how much of a factor a consorted shift to global fiscal stimulus rather than monetary impulse might be altering the market safe haven view of gold above 1700 modeling for gold fair value indicates the following are consistent treasury 10y yields plummet by 80 bps s p falls by 20 inflation break even drop to 1 35 or below and gold rises to usd 2000 oz indeed we are a long way from paydirt in the fair value analysis especially if fiscal impulse kicks in i guess the big question today is with correlations pointing higher why we did have back to back daily price gaps lower in gold as surely these moves are beyond just a healthy market correction after all its raining rate cuts raining rate cuts a total of 13 em central banks have cut rates in response to the threat of an economic slowdown so far this year with the market convinced the fed would start cutting deep and we are even back to discussing rate cuts in europe which should be positive for gold equity market margin call related sell off but the back to back late ny afternoon gold liquidation has the hallmarks suggesting the sell off could be related to equity margin calls rather than any underlying market weakness given the overtly risk off tone dominating the markets so as was the case yesterday once these margin obligations are covered gold could rebound a touch the facts as most gold traders will tell you it s virtually impossible to understand where the supply and demand factors will drive gold on a daily basis but given the real possibility of pandemic pandemonium setting which will cripple the financial market and could cause a run on the banks similar to the toilet paper hoarding mentality in asia only people want to store cash under their mattress rather than toilet paper under the bathroom sink poor analogy but you get the picture bullion should continue to find more support from accommodative monetary policy worldwide a rapidly shrinking pool of risk free assets and lower beta of traditional risk off currencies even without triggering worst case pandemic fears oil markets the oil market at the best of time isn t known for measured thinking tending to adopt the approach of shoot first ask questions later but oil traders have called this one right from the get go as they were never buying into the g20 view or the idea of a v shaped recovery in china and limited impact on the rest of the world but for immediate concerns the shift in focus from just an external demand shock from china to an overwhelming us economic blow could send oil prices into a faster tailspin the reality is that the coronavirus has not been contained and is now spreading like wildfire across the world and you can t put that smoke back in the wood although i expect the api inventory report to fall through the cracks at least there was one bulb working on a broken string of lights as wti regained the 50 handle on a smaller than expected crude inventory build currency markets i might be excused this morning it is 5 am in bangkok after all as i don t have a blueprint prepared for a rapid spreader scenario across the us markets which from a federal reserve board perspective makes this flu situation different we have to admit the federal reserve is the only central bank that matters and with global supply chains grinding to a halt what the world most desperately needs is a deluge of us dollars sure the ecb and boj can cut further but that is unlikely to happen and another rate cut from a smaller central bank like rba might prop up the domestic housing market but what is that going to do in the bigger global scheme of things so it will be up to the federal reserve board to do the heavy market lifting as such we could be on the precipice of an emergency inter meeting rate cut as the world is in dire straits and in need of a massive fed helicopter drop to buttress the virus crisis the us dollar has lost its teflon status as the coronavirus arriving on the us doorstep with rate fat rate cut probabilities on the rise us bond yields sliding fortunately for the global risk market the us dollar has started to weaken as reverse yankee mania sets in but will it be enough before risk aversion crushes commodity markets as what was perceived as a supply shock from the covid 19 outbreak is morphing into an unknown a negative us demand shock would represent an essential change for markets however before jumping into trades this morning it might be time to catch our breath as i still think its to early to start fading the currency moves at the epicenter of the crisis wall of worry cnh and krw as well as the g 10 china proxies

president and chief financial officer good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to american woodmark s third fiscal quarter conference call thank you for taking time to participate joining me today is cary dunston chairman and ceo cary will begin with a review of the quarter and i ll add additional details regarding our financial performance after our comments we ll be happy to answer your questions cary s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer thank you scott and good morning to you all although we are pleased with our positive revenue comps our third fiscal quarter financials proved to be challenging as our margins were impacted by cost headwinds and volatility within our channels the market itself is undergoing change that we have been predicting for some time now although the foreseeable future will be quite dynamic to say the least we continue to make significant strides forward in our long term strategy and remain very optimistic about the market and our future position as an industry leader with regards to net sales for the fiscal quarter we were up 3 within new construction which includes our timberlake and pcs businesses we grew 5 3 over prior year looking specifically at our timberlake direct business revenue was in alignment with overall single family start growth and considering the lag from the start to cabinet installation regarding our unit growth we outpaced our net revenue growth as we continue to gain share as expected as a percentage of opening price point homes continues to expand we are seeing an impact on our average take per cabinet by region we saw strong growth in the southeast texas phoenix and northern california our pcs business in southern california remains a challenge although the market has seen some recent growth in starts pricing on recent bids become so competitive that our business continues to be negatively impacted we are conducting a strategic analysis of this market and we ll continue to make the right decisions for our business overall within new construction we remain optimistic on continued growth particularly within our timberlake direct business as we leverage our low cost origins platform the economy remains strong and our large builders continue to invest and increase our overall share of the u s single family market younger consumers are entering the market and will fuel the growth of the industry for years to come looking at our remodel business which includes our dealer distributor and home center businesses revenue was up 1 6 to prior year our combined home center business was up 3 within this we continue to experience nice double digit growth in our home center kitchen and bath stock business not only are we benefiting from gaining a major stock kitchen market as we communicated previously but our entire business is comping favorably across the country as we see a shift in more affordable solutions in addition we do believe we are seeing some impact of the chinese tariffs on our stock kitchen business i will provide more commentary on the tariffs in a few minutes within our center frameless business we also once again experienced double digit growth this designer series product is simplistic and value focused a reflection of how the market is transitioning unfortunately the higher priced made to order business within home center continues to be challenged promotional activity remains very elevated and is favoring higher priced competitors the opposite of where the market is going we stand firm that promotions are not the solution to driving younger consumers into the stores or to improving closure rates it is very clear in our industry the demand for more affluent baby boomers is declining within r r and younger generation will begin to backfill this demand over time strategically we recognize this new consumer group are requiring much less complex and affordable solution than what exists today and we remain committed to providing a competitive solution in alignment with this changing environment regarding our dealer distributor business we were down 3 3 for the quarter within this we grew our waypoint dealer business over indexing the industry per kcma data however our distribution business comped negatively for the quarter part of this change is a conscious transition of some business from distribution through our direct timberlake channel however we re also seeing a pricing challenge in southern california and in a couple of localized areas in summary significant volatility continues between and within channels we are absolutely seeing a shift in price point in the industry as we have predicted for some time now the challenge remains with regard to strategically helping our retail partners transition to a more simplistic and capable purchasing experience product is a piece of this however the scope extends far beyond product as we must greatly enhance the entire consumer purchasing process including our digital interface we know the next couple of years will be volatile but mean we firmly believe there will be clear winners within our industry we are absolutely investing to ensure we are not only a winner we are leading a change i would like to take a moment to comment on the antidumping lawsuit and associated impact commerce has rolled on the final rate pending approval by the itc although not so significant scott will provide the details on the extent of the change from the initial ruling regarding the overall impact of the tariffs as i mentioned previously we believe we are seeing some transition from the imported all fiber construction cabinets to the stock business however based on kcma data it is also clear that the overall impact on the special order business within america is minimal at best as i mentioned on our call last last call significant inventory was built prior to the antidumping penalty taking effect this inventory is certainly being depleted however it is difficult to know the remaining levels on the positive we do have clear data that shows a very significant decline in chinese cabinet imports at the same time we are seeing a very aggressive ramp up of cabinet imports out of countries like vietnam and malaysia in the past year these two companies alone have transitioned from a relatively insignificant cabinet volumes exporting over 30 of the volume that china was producing prior to the tariffs it is not clear what components are actually being produced within these countries versus how much a legal circumvention is being achieved we do expect this circumvention to continue however thereby greatly reducing the overall impact of the akca only time will tell however we do remain committed to finding a domestic solution that can successfully compete against imports keeping manufacturing in america and expanding our core competitive advantage of service lastly on china i thought many would be interested in any potential impact we may experience from the coronavirus on the positive we had previously built inventory as part of the chinese new year shutdown we are in contact with our china suppliers and have confirmed they have all reopened but they are currently operating at less than full capacities at this time based on the virus mitigation process and supplier ramp up plans we are not anticipating any significant impact we will continue to monitor the situation very closely moving on to our gross margin for the quarter we came in at 18 3 versus 20 in the prior year in general our operations continue to run well and we further capitalize on cost synergies yet we were challenged by some inefficiency due to the number of down days we have to schedule in the quarter we typically always experience our lowest incoming demand rates for the year in the winter months of our third fiscal quarter to better balance our system and retain backlog at appropriate levels we scheduled down days in our system although beneficial overall they do introduce some inefficiency into the system more significantly the cost of tariffs product awards supply disruptions and the move of our facility in california were simply too significant to overcome 301 tariffs are well understood by most in the industry although we have managed to minimize much of the impact there are some products that are very difficult to source outside of china our teams continue to work on options to further minimize the impact with regards to the particleboard supply unfortunately the impact is being prolonged due to extended start up by the new facilities being opened in the u s a significant amount of capacity was renewed within the u s by dp and unfortunately we were more dependent on this supply than our competitors we managed to successfully resource material however has come in at a price and logistics premium significant capacity is ramping up as i speak within the u s however the manufacturers are slightly behind schedule our team is working very closely with our partners however we expect to continue to experience a cost headwind into the near future scott will provide specifics to this in his comments lastly the majority of the cost of our plant relocation in california was incurred in our third fiscal quarter on the positive the move is now complete and finished ahead of our plan on cost moving on to our adjusted ebitda margin we finished the quarter at 12 7 versus 13 6 from prior year the key drivers for the cost headwind and inefficiency impact on our gross margin as i previously discussed in addition to the mix impact of lower than expected sales within our made to order r r business with regards to sg a we did continue the positive leverage of the business and lastly on financial scott will provide details on our cash position however we are extremely pleased with our investment we have paid down our debt following the acquisition our cash generation allows us to not only pay down debt but make important strategic investments for the future in summary it was a challenging quarter on margins as well as made to order buying within home center r r the cost headwinds are frustrating side release however we remain committed to continue to mitigate the impact of both the tariffs and particleboard disruption more importantly as recognizing the changing dynamics of our industry we truly believe our industry is going to be disrupted over the next five years this disruption will come in the form of changing consumer expectations the requirements to offer much more affordable solutions and the need to greatly simplify and enhance our overall remodeling experience these changes will require tremendous strategic thought disruptive innovation and extensive understanding of systems thinking our new vision and related strategy are aggressively moving us forward in all aspects this strategy will require investment over the next three to four years and we are well positioned to make these investments continue to win in our industry and provide strong financial returns for our investors we remain excited about the future and are very confident in our ability to not only disrupt but to create a true competitive space within our industry with that i thank you and i will now turn it back over to scott for the detailed financials m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks cary the financial headlines for the quarter net sales were 396 million representing an increase of 3 over the same period last year adjusted net income was 22 million or 1 30 per diluted share in the current fiscal year versus 24 1 million or 1 40 per diluted share last year adjusted net income was positively impacted by higher sales which is more than offset by tariffs net cost impacts related to our product award supply disruption and duplicate rent move costs related to our california facility move adjusted ebitda was 50 1 million or 12 7 of net sales compared to 52 2 million or 13 6 of net sales for the same quarter of the prior fiscal year for the nine months ending january year to date net sales were 1 251 billion representing an increase of 1 1 over the same period last year adjusted net income was 89 2 million or 5 27 per diluted share in the current fiscal year versus 88 2 million or 5 05 per diluted share last year adjusted ebitda was 182 6 million or 14 6 of net sales compared to 181 1 million or 14 6 of net sales for the same period for the prior fiscal year the new construction market grew during the quarter recognizing a 60 to 90 day lag age from the start and cabinet installation the overall market activity in single family homes was up 8 1 for the financial third quarter our builder channel net sales increased 5 3 for the quarter the made to order frame direct build to order business exceeded starts on a unit basis and this was offset by price net and negative comps in our frameless business the remodel business continues to be challenging on the positive side unemployment and interest rates remain low and existing home sales increased during the fourth calendar quarter of 2019 on the negative side the median existing home price rose 7 8 to 274 500 for december impacting our consumers affordability index and this year first time buyers decreased to 31 in december our combined home center and independent dealer distributor channel net sales grew 1 6 for the quarter with home centers increasing 3 and dealer distributor decreasing 3 3 the company s gross profit margin for the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 was 18 3 of net sales versus 20 reported in the same quarter of last year gross margin in the third quarter was unfavorably impacted by tariffs by 1 8 million net cost impacts related to our product award supply disruption of 0 5 million and duplicate rent move costs related to our california facility move of 1 6 million our facility move is complete and i want to thank our operations team for successfully transitioning facility without disruption leverage from higher sales was offset by the cost standard along with operating inefficiencies year to date gross profit margin was 20 3 compared to 21 for the same period in the prior year gross margin for the first nine months of the current fiscal year was unfavorably impacted by tariffs of 5 4 million net cost impacts related to our particleboard supply disruption of 3 million and duplicate rent move costs related to our california facility move of 2 4 million these impacts were partially offset by leverage from higher sales and operating efficiencies total operating expenses were 12 2 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with 12 9 of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2019 selling and marketing expenses were 5 4 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with 5 8 of net sales for the same period in fiscal 2019 the decrease in the ratio was driven by lower spending and leverage from higher sales general and administrative expenses were 6 8 of net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 compared with 7 2 of net sales for the same period of fiscal 2019 the decrease in ratio was driven by lower spending and leverage from higher sales free cash flow totaled 80 2 million for the current fiscal year compared to 106 2 million in the prior year the decrease is primarily due to a onetime tax benefit received in the prior year related to the acquisition and timing of inventory and accounts receivable net leverage was 2 26x adjusted ebitda at the end of the third fiscal quarter and the company paid down 18 million of its term loan facility during the quarter in closing i wanted to share a recent update on the akca trade case the department of commerce announced its affirmative final determinations yesterday and the international trade commission is scheduled to hold a final vote by april 6 if approved the countervailing duty rate would increase from 16 41 to 20 93 and the antidumping duty cash deposit rate would increase from 28 71 to 37 96 for the quarter we were pleased that we delivered positive comps in repair remodel and new construction for the first time this fiscal year margins were challenged during the quarter with lower than expected sales in the made to order frame and home center and distributor channel and the costs related to the move of our california facility regarding the previously disclosed particleboard supply disruption the company could be negatively impacted by higher pricing and incremental transportation cost of up to 1 5 million to 1 9 million per quarter until fully resolved the company maintains property insurance including business interruption dependent property coverage with a limit of 5 million the company realized a 5 million reimbursement during the nine month period ended january 31 2020 on that 5 million limit the company continues to believe it will grow sales at a low single digit rate for fiscal 2020 this growth rate continues to be dependent upon overall industry and economic growth the company s margins were negatively impacted in the nine month period ended january 31 2020 about 2 4 million for the move of one of our california facilities and 3 million due to the net particleboard supply disruption cost due to ongoing tariff costs and particleboard pricing transportation costs the company expects adjusted ebitda margins for fiscal 2020 to decrease slightly compared to prior year results this concludes our prepared remarks we d be happy to answer any questions you have at this time questions and answers operator we ll hear first today from garik shmois with loop capital garik shmois loop capital analyst so thanks first off i just wanted to ask just on the comments that you made around unit growth outpacing sales growth just wondering if you look out over the next several quarters it seems like this is an ongoing change in the industry and consumers moving down in price points so can you maybe kind of size up the delta between units and sales and maybe switching to margins is there any margin implication from this i guess trade down on pricing s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer garik this is cary look it s really difficult to say quantify the delta between the unit and the revenue growth it really varies by channel it even varies greatly by region by channel so the primary point in my comment there is you add new construction obviously as we see a transition down to the first time homebuyer naturally it s going to be a smaller home and you re going to see a trend down in the price points to quantify that s going to be difficult i think as we get more gain more knowledge with regards to the how aggressive that first time homebuyer enters the market and how aggressively builders make that transition versus the ratio of existing homes because obviously we re seeing some transition down but builders are continuing to build some nicer homes out there as well so that mix is going to be very important with regards to that formula so we ll continue to keep an eye on it with regards to margin particularly in the builder side we committed all along that was one of the key rationalizations of the acquisition is bringing in the low cost origins product and we ve been committed to maintain our margins albeit or price point but to maintain our margin percentage at those price points you get in r r i think it s extremely difficult the market is so dynamic right now particularly with the impact of the tariffs really seeing what others are doing regarding imports and then you throw in the transition that we re all trying to figure out is how much of the impact kcma data right now is driven by the tariffs versus just the move down and let s say the slowdown of the baby boomer population and their r r and the pickup in the younger generation and certainly it s starting but that pace is it s really difficult to assess right now just because of the number of variables that we re all being faced with so i think over the next six months we ll probably get a much better picture us and everybody else we ll get much better picture of how the industry is shaping up but it s something we have to keep a close eye on but right now we re obviously committed to try to maintain relatively close margins albeit scott s point on these headwinds are a little bit of a challenge right now but it s been our stated goal to maintain our margin percentages as we continue to grow garik shmois loop capital analyst okay just one follow up on the margin outlook it seems like you took down your fiscal 20 margin guidance and not looking now for a slight decline which i guess makes sense given though the factors that you identified if you look out into the fourth quarter maybe into fiscal 21 i just want to be clear are some of these cost and margin headwinds expected to continue moving forward or is it just kind of your downdraft in your margin outlook really a function of some of the headwinds that you saw in the third quarter so i just kind of want to be clear on kind of the change in the guidance m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yes sure so let s talk about the three buckets again so the first one would be the facility move which is now complete and behind us so we won t have any of those onetime costs associated going forward into the fourth quarter or in the future fiscal year of course we re not yet releasing any type of outlook perspective on our fiscal year 21 we re just in the process of starting our budget cycle we ll certainly have a lot more to offer around that next quarter we get together but the next bucket we ll talk about is tariffs which continue to impact the business inside q3 certainly expecting that into q4 as cary mentioned our teams are working to mitigate and shift where possible but likely to continue to see some headwinds on tariffs continuing into fiscal year 21 and then the last bucket is around the particleboard so just to give the nuance of that is we ve had a significant impact each quarter however we were getting reimbursed from our coverage in each of the last two quarters so the net impact was being reduced pretty considerably in our fiscal q2 and q3 inside fiscal q4 we re fully exposed and that s what my earlier comment was that could be 1 5 million to 1 9 million assuming the capacity comes online is currently planned that will reduce significantly as we shift into the q1 time period of fiscal year 21 but it s very dependent upon that capacity coming online by the other suppliers garik shmois loop capital analyst okay that s helpful thanks so much entrepreneurial m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks operator we ll hear next from steven ramsey thompson research group steven ramsey thompson research group analyst morning i wanted to start with starts and you said bids making it tough more challenging to win business there can you maybe put this in context from the recent past and as you look at options and plans to hold share or regain share what options do you have and how quickly will you be making the decisions and changes from kind of your shifting strategy s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yes so the pricing that i referred to was really two isolated areas one in southern california as it s tied to our pcs business and then we also actually have pcs both within new construction and we do have some distribution business in southern california so both of those are being impacted by some pricing and then you got a couple of very localized markets out there that primarily within multifamily that were out there doing some bidding and just given i think just given the downturn a little bit of bouncing you ve seen a slowdown as some others are getting very aggressive on pricing so we re going through a multi stage approach there s two aspects of this obviously we ve been faced with a lot of the headwinds that we talked about tariffs that existed for some time and a reminder that we ve never taken any pricing related to that nor do we plan to so we re in a relatively good position our stock product and our origins product is positioned very well within timberlake so it s really isolated through our pcs and i ll say 95 of that s in southern california so strategically we re evaluating it both from a just a cost to benefit analysis and how do we further address that market from i guess two aspects one was how low are we willing and do we want to go from a price perspective bid perspective and secondly is how much more efficient can we make our operations in southern california to really to make ourselves more competitive most of the data that we have right now shows that the pricing getting to the such a low level that nobody is really making money so it s something that we hope is short term but it is an impact and right now it has definitely impacted our revenue and we re making some conscious decisions not to bid on certain businesses just because it s gotten so low so we ll continue to run the analysis but right now i think it s i keep talking on our call about a lot of forward looking strategic change and part of that change is removing a lot of complexity within our operations both on our made to order platforms as well as our stock and our frameless platforms we have a significant operation or improvements under way to really both analyze and remove a lot of complexity in our business and that complexity not only creates a much better customer experience but also removes a lot of costs from the system so it s not an easy transition because complexity creeps in over years and you have to go after big chunks but that is a process we re going through right now so we re doing that in southern california and our operations that we just moved to riverside obviously we made we took the opportunity to make some changes during the transition but we also have a lot of work under way to really look at the product platform simplify it and take cost out of the system to allow ourselves to be a bit more aggressive but at the same time as we ve always communicated that we differentiate ourselves on service it s pretty rare we re willing to go down and just buy business because we offer a competitive advantage of service and that s true on pcs and that s true on timberlake so that s part of the strategic analysis we re going through so more to come in the future as we learn more and just kind of see how the market shapes up steven ramsey thompson research group analyst excellent and that kind of leads into my next question the long term industry disruption is this going to be is this accelerated or stepped up from what we ve seen is this purely the millennials being the prime customer going forward versus boomers r r and what is kind of the time line or do you have a rough time line on increased investments broadly through your system needed to address this change maybe just any more detail that give us some color on the long term s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer great great great question it s we re learning every day as i mentioned before it s really hard to go out and collect data today specifically to the cabinet industry and that really identifies the transition that we re undergoing with regards to our consumer base the baby boomers are certainly still in the mix and we ve heard for some time now that they re aging in place and that s had a positive impact on r r personally and this is just my personal opinion is we do believe that that s slowing down and over time that will be backfilled by i must say the younger generation so it s not just the millennial there s certainly a younger x gen and as well as the millennial population that you continue to hear that millennials have the largest spending power out there today which is not as relevant in our space cabinetry is very discretionary as well as the fact that there s really been a big lag factor in the younger folks being able to get into single family housing and that really ties more to existing than new we ve said that once they get to existing they re going to be faced with some very old kitchens and so forth and personally we feel that will be a high priority for them certainly they re going to have to replace roofs and certain aspects of the home that are required to do r r on just because it s leaking or has to be repaired they re going to prioritize that first but the kitchen will come we believe relatively quickly just because of the age of the home so in the age of the kitchens within those homes so i think the transition is happening i don t think it s as aggressive as what probably the market would indicate right now just because there s so many other factors that are impacting the market including just overall slowdown in baby boomers the impact of the tariffs and so forth but i definitely believe they re in and they re coming i think when they really start to ramp up is when we re really going to see the impact on the industry and when i talk about disruption that is the true disruption that i think we re going to be faced with and the good thing is we talk about it internally we ve been talking about it for years now we clearly expect the younger generation to come in with a much different set of expectations and the attributes that they value they want a much different experience the average number of visits a consumer has to go back into a retail space today to really finalize the kitchen process would be mindblowing for most and if you ask younger regeneration how many times they d be willing to go back and forth that might be one at most obviously they re going to interface much more digitally they re going to they re willing to make transactions and work directly with designers via chat or live or email so i think we re going to have multiple points of entry for that consumer we re going to have to be willing and able to connect with that consumer in the ideation phase and to really manage that entire process for them because today it s very disjointed it s very difficult for a consumer to go from ideation to cabinet installation and one step process are with one specifier one facilitator of that process so i think that s going to be a high demand and i think we re in a prime position to leverage our builder center platform we have out there to expand our service and really start to offer some opportunities within the r r space that we ve never done before and that nobody in the industry has the capacity or capability to do so we see as a great opportunity i think like i said it s going to be a challenge and we re all learning and we re going to have to really reshape the company in some regards it s super exciting for us and we ve been looking forward to it but wish i had better answers on exactly when and how but i think that s the fun of it i think we re all in this and we re going to see how the younger generation shapes up steven ramsey thompson research group analyst excellent and does this mean that kind of as you get further into this that do you expect to hold the company margins and go forward incremental margins at a similar pace in place or do you think on the other side of this thing that there could be maybe a step down in margins but you can make up for it on volumes s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer certainly when you talk margin dollars versus margin percent obviously it s kind of a different story on margin percent we ve been committed and that we know there s going to be some volatility the industry is i think we ve i ll go back to come out of recession this industry has been pretty volatile quarter to quarter i think you re going to continue to see volatile but long term we do remain committed to our long term margins and there ll be periods of time where we re going to have to make some investments in the business but we do feel comfortable with our ability to continue to grow and do it at a margin rate that s acceptable long term we did commit and if you go back to the acquisition days we did commit to the 15 5 to 16 long term i think long term will be the question now but i think as we come out at the other end of this what i inform you as disruption in the industry is we are absolutely working on solutions and it s product solution it s very creative and innovative product solutions that s taking complexity out of the system and it s a much different approach to the consumer than we ve really ever gone after in the history of the company but i truly believe we can maintain those long term commitments on margin steven ramsey thompson research group analyst so thank you again operator we ll hear next from baird tim wojs s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer hey get some morning tim wojs baird analyst morning just on cary just kind of your commentary on some of the kind of reducing complexity internally and things i mean is this kind of a normal course of kind of planning for you or do you feel like there s some stepped up opportunities on the internal cost base that you re looking to kind of simplify it sounds like it s the latter i just want to kind of understand that better s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer no i actually say it s not normal i think that both the challenge of it and the excitement of it is we are truly looking at the term the phrasing we use internally is that we really can t go after and do what we do better we have to do what we do totally differently and that s really how we are approaching this it has to be step changes in what we do how we do it and the cost of how we do it so when we talk about taking complexity out it s not just you don t really approach it from a cost perspective you approach it from a system and process complexity and it s not just manufacturing it s throughout the entire system because the ultimate end goal for us kind of the bull s eye that we have that s out in front of us is this entire customer experience and being able to successfully manage that and create such a clear and sustainable competitive advantage in that space really forced us to step back and map out the entire process and then understand the complexities and then realize how big of these chunks of complexity we have to take out so the net benefit and obviously there s a lot of case studies out there with regards to system complexity and you have to make some tough decisions along the way but with the net vision of improving that customer experience ultimately you doing that gaining share and you come out as a clear winner so it s going to take the company places we ve never been before it s a very exciting time but it is going to take time to get there at the same time tim wojs baird analyst okay ok and then just on the new construction market how is that performing your builder direct how is that performing relative to your expectations maybe six months ago s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer i d say it s in line with our expectations the market is everybody is trying to guess where the market s going you ve seen growth estimates all over the place both for this past year and calendar year and then for this obviously the current calendar year we re in the growth estimates are all over the place we are in line we re certainly very pleased with our performance with our transitions of the origins business we stated go back 1 5 years to a year ago we stated it was not ramping up as quickly as we had hoped that had nothing to do with our internal capabilities that was just the move of builders just really start that transition in helping price point we re seeing that builders continue to make strong investments and gain improve their overall share in america and obviously given our share with them that helps us and then we actually because of the origins we are actually out bidding on business that historically we would not have been on so it s been a very strong positive for us and like we ve mentioned we are maintaining good margins on that business and it s a continued aggressive growth plan for us so you think about how many quarters we came out and announced results in timberlake stating that we ve over indexed the industry and we gained a lot of market share within new construction because of our direct to builder platform so we re very very pleased with it tim wojs baird analyst okay ok and then just on the margins scott so just to make sure i ve kind of got the pieces right so the facility costs those completely go away in next quarter and into 2021 particleboard will kind of continue to be an unmitigated headwind now that the insurance has kind of been used up and that could be kind of q4 and bleed a little bit into the first quarter and then when do tariffs sort of the unmitigated impact of tariffs lap for you guys m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer when do they lap it s probably going to be in q2 we ll continue to see impacts but it s the items we haven t been able to resource which is principally around hardware glides in a particular top so those are likely going to continue but there will be some relief when you do the year over year comparison versus the items we ve resourced tim wojs baird analyst okay ok and then i ll sneak one more in just you re close to your targeted leverage ratio now of about 2x any change on kind of a go forward basis over the next 12 to 18 months in how you think about capital deployment m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yes i mean longer term we as you pointed our key commitment has been to get back to low 2 but longer term i think to grow our business the good thing i mentioned on cash is we absolutely plan to invest cash for our long term shareholder return lots of opportunities to do that and we have internal organic opportunities to invest in our business and everything i just mentioned previously with regards to transforming our business will create a great opportunity to continue to invest in addition as i ll say opportunistic acquisitions we obviously this last one was a very very significant one we don t plan to do anything that large but as we look forward and we think about extending our leverage particularly within new construction and the fact that we enter a very large percentage of new construction homes in america to do the cabinet so how do you leverage that potentially in other areas or the potential acquisition we could conduct to leverage our track to build the platform and offer other products is there opportunity where you get into servicing is there opportunity to get in smart technology that much can leverage what we do so we re going to be very open we want to continue to grow the business and i think i personally we believe there s a lot of opportunities that are going to exist for us to do that tim wojs baird analyst right who can look on camera for you guys m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer thank you tim wojs baird analyst thanks operator we ll hear now from david macgregor with longbow research david macgregor longbow research analyst take one second taking the questions are you seeing limited installation capacity as a growth constraint s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer you said installation tim wojs baird analyst yes installation capacity just your ability s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yes not really we ve knock on wood is we ve maintained a very very good business out there and i think one of the key differentiators we have with our timberlake direct business is we re so consistent so we ve gained market share we re very consistent in the installation business and the folks that we have out there are really dedicated to our business and so no we have not had any restrictions we had a couple of geographical markets that have grown very quickly in the past year that might have a little operational constraint but we got those back on track and so at this time no we re continuing to move along david macgregor longbow research analyst do you feel it s a source of competitive advantage for you it sounds like you re very confident in that s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer absolutely the whole platform is right once again just because of the fact that we re national we re in all the key markets and who we are as a company our build we have as you know we have physical locations and out there we have seven main and 11 satellite facilities that offer a very localized servicing and it just makes a big difference our reputation in the market it has a big impact on our ability to hire people as well and we tend to attract people that know the industry obviously whether it s installers or service techs or service reps the folks that most of the folks have been in the industry for quite some time and they love to work for timberlake it just really makes a difference it is absolutely a very competitive advantage for us david macgregor longbow research analyst yes second question just with regard to the build to order segment what are you seeing in the way of promotional activity within the bto and how do you expect that to change if at all in the next few quarters s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer i m sorry the bto promotional david macgregor longbow research analyst cadence next couple of quarters s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer we ll see we are very i would say we re very engaged with our key retail partners on the promotional activity and i think there s been a lot of i would say trialing over the past perhaps several years but perhaps next six months is continuing as merchants are trying different promotional approaches and so forth and i think we ve been pretty ardent all along with regards to our belief and promotions certainly are not driving new consumers in the door and we re we recognize that it s kind of a doubled edged sword obviously we re very cautious on going out and buying business and setting precedents particularly in the retail space when it comes to conditioning designers and conditioning consumers on promotions and we differentiate ourselves based on service not necessarily price but at the same time you have to be willing to compete so we re continuing to work with them we think it s some hopefully some more strategic decisions will be made in the coming months that not necessarily take promotional activity down but shifted into much much more productive buckets but i we ll just have to wait and see it s something that our team is working very aggressively on and we have very good relationships with our retail partners that obviously we ll continue to leverage and have these types of discussions with david macgregor longbow research analyst do you think you get back to growth in the build to order by just winning share or do you think there s hope for the category s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer the big thing there is category right so the retail space and i ll just speak kcma data obviously special order has been negative for a number of quarters now and i think it goes back to the question asked previously on the younger generation and where the younger generation is going to shop and how they re going to shop and will they walk in the door of the existing retail spaces and we certainly believe a certain percentage of them will but at the same time we believe that the retail spaces are going to have to make some changes to make themselves more inviting for the younger consumer so we are very focused on helping our retailers with that and a lot of the statements i made previously about investing in the digital platform and the overall customer experience is that is designed to help our retailers better manage that customer experience and we ll actually manage a lot of that customer experience for them that will be a win win for them and us so that s our goal david macgregor longbow research analyst thanks very much s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator we ll hear next from justin speer with zelman associates justin speer zelman and associates analyst thank you very much i just wanted to unpack these onetime items or discrete items i guess not onetime but the discrete items in the third quarter can you remind scott can you tell me how much the particleboard net impact was and what the insurance recovery was m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so the net impact inside the quarter was 500 000 justin speer zelman and associates analyst okay and for the full year 3 million net of insurance or is that a gross number m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer it s 3 million net year to date and we fully recovered the full 5 million and then you ve got exposure pushing into q4 between 1 5 million and 1 9 million justin speer zelman and associates analyst okay so as you think about the full year drag from the discrete items in fiscal 20 how does that look on any kind of a margin headwind basis and then how should we think about that as we look to next year in terms of some of these maybe becoming greater relief or offsets or positives next year as they unwind m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer yes so i ll reflect back just on the earlier comments on that particular point so the facility move onetime cost certainly won t repeat as we go forward particleboard certainly continues inside q4 our expectation again as the capacity comes online and we will see relief against that going forward we still believe there will be transportation risk just because of the location of the facilities as we go into fiscal year 21 but we don t have that completely dialed in and finalized as again we re pulling together our budgets as we speak and then tariffs continue or increase or decrease unfortunately that all depends on the pulling or timing exactly how that shakes out but we do expect that to still be somewhat of an issue as we go into the first part of fiscal year 21 justin speer zelman and associates analyst just following up on it so when i look at these discrete items that you re calling out for at least the third quarter it was like 2 5 million of incremental items but when i look at the gross margin that gross margin is down 170 basis points it s closer to like 6 5 million 7 million and 7 5 million but there s about 4 million of other drag in there that is maybe you can help account for and then you mentioned some taking some inventory downtime or some production downtime maybe help us understand the balance of the year over year drag as it pertains to the margin pressure m scott culbreth senior vice president and chief financial officer sure we won t get into dollarizing each of those respective items but you heard cary talk earlier about down days we did have an incremental down day from a year over year perspective which creates some disruption we also had some inefficiencies inside the period in our facilities along with freight and healthcare was a bit of a drag on us inside the period the other thing i would encourage you to do is don t necessarily just focus on the gross margin change focus on the ebitda change we do have some dollars that have swapped between the categories year over year so i don t want to get buried in the nuances of that but operating inefficiencies the freight piece we talked about the incremental down day were the other key items justin speer zelman and associates analyst okay and the last question s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer just a little highlight on operating efficiencies as part of it s a down day part of it is some of our operations were actually ramping up so i talk about the growth on the stock side it s been very positive for us but when you ramp up as quickly as we re ramping up it does drive some inefficiency in the system that really is more should be short term because we are most of those operations are ramped up and we do expect continued growth in that but it s been a very nice growth for us but you grow as quickly as we have seen on that side it does create some challenges justin speer zelman and associates analyst okay that makes sense and then the last question for me is just as we were to rewind back five 10 years cabinet category was one that was able to obtain price it was a from an industry standpoint from other building products categories reasonably well positioned from a pricing power standpoint and now we have the antidumping duties rolling through chinese imports have collapsed you think the nature of the industry will allow at least maybe some price power in parts of the portfolio that maybe otherwise wasn t there before antidumping duties s cary dunston chairman and chief executive officer yes i think you have to define pricing power though relative to the market itself and yes i think the if we are still arriving on the baby boomer growth and that was the key point of our growth going forward i think you would absolutely continue to see some pricing power the challenge is while this is occurring we re seeing younger generation come in that s driving the market down so the market is peaking very clearly out there and where it s a transition into the building price point homes or younger generation starts to get in existing homes absolutely they will not be able to afford the level of kitchen purchases that the baby boomers have been doing for the past 10 years so i think that s just more of a market question once you start to balance that out if you get down to the specific price points and you come up with solutions that you find are competitive in the market i do believe you ll be able to see pricing power within those but the first step that folks really need to understand and the drive toward is being able to offer it s not just demand the ability to offer affordable solution being able to offer affordable solution that offers a clear competitive advantage what you don t want to become is a commodity business where everybody is driving all their capacity down to a lower price point and we know how that shakes out for an industry to do that so there s absolutely going to be the ability with the new generation to create a competitive advantage i think that s what s going to differentiate folks so once you have that clear competitive advantage then you start to differentiate yourself on price because people are going to pay for that value justin speer zelman and associates analyst thank you operator and with no other questions mr culbreth i d like to turn

compared to prior year earnings benefited from the hydro one termination fee we received said dennis vermillion president and chief executive officer of avista corp during the year we reached settlements in all of our general rate cases with approvals by the commissions in oregon and idaho and we are awaiting the decision from the washington commission on the partial settlement agreement in our 2019 general rate cases in 2019 we established our clean energy goals with an ultimate target of serving our customers with carbon free electricity by 2045 and carbon neutral electricity by the

federal and state combined of 23 05 percent b electric utility margin operating revenues less resource costs increased for the full year and was primarily impacted by the following general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective jan 1 2019 customer growth contributed additional retail electric revenue the above increases were partially offset by a general rate decrease in idaho effective dec 1 2019 an increase in power purchased prices thermal fuel costs and lower hydroelectric generation in 2019 for the full year 2019 we recognized a pre tax benefit of 4 4 million under the erm compared to a pre tax benefit of 6 1 million for the full year 2018 and an accrual of 3 6 million for customer refunds related to our 2015 washington general rate case that was remanded back to the washington commission during 2019 c natural gas utility margin operating revenues less resource costs increased for the full year and was impacted primarily by the following general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective jan 1 2019 customer growth contributed additional retail natural gas revenue d other operating expenses increased for the full year 2019 primarily due to increased transmission and distribution operating and maintenance costs also the company donated 7 million to the avista foundation to support the local community these were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense e for the full year 2019 merger transaction costs most of which were paid in the first quarter were 19 7 million pre tax compared to 3 7 million pre tax for the full year 2018 the merger transaction costs increased for the full year 2019 because 2018 costs consisted primarily of employee time incurred directly related to the transaction whereas 2019 costs included consulting banking fees and legal fees in addition to employee time none of the acquisition costs are being passed through to customers f depreciation and amortization increased from additions to utility plant also in the second quarter 2019 we utilized approximately 6 4 million 5 1 million when tax effected of electric tax benefits to offset costs associated with accelerating the depreciation of colstrip units 3 4 based on a settlement in idaho this amount was recorded as a one time charge to depreciation expense in the second quarter of 2019 and was offset with an amount included in income tax expense g as a result of the termination of the proposed merger hydro one paid avista corp a 103 million termination fee in january 2019 the termination fee was used for reimbursing our transaction costs incurred from 2017 to 2019 these costs including income taxes totaled approximately 51 million the balance of the termination fee was used for general corporate purposes and reduced our need for external financing h other for the full year 2019 was a decrease to earnings primarily due to an increase in the non service portion of pension and other postretirement benefits partially offset by a decrease in property taxes i our effective tax rate was 13 8 percent for 2019 compared to 16 0 percent for 2018 our effective tax rate decreased due to additional tax deductions we were able to utilize in 2019 in addition during the second quarter of 2019 our income taxes decreased due to the settlement agreement in idaho related to colstrip depreciation and the usage of electric tax benefits to offset the accelerated depreciation the above decreases were partially offset by income taxes associated with the receipt of the hydro one termination fee j the increase in earnings at our other businesses was primarily related to a gain on the sale of metalfx during the second quarter of 2019 and net investment gains from our other investments non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures the tables above and below include electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin two financial measures that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap which for utility margin is utility operating revenues the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance we use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations changes in loads as well as power and natural gas supply costs are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms accordingly the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms we present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for avista utilities since each business has different cost sources cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions so we believe that separate analysis is beneficial these measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below the following table presents avista utilities operating

rate federal and state combined of 23 05 percent liquidity and capital resources liquidity 2019 liquidity transactions we have a 400 million committed line of credit that expires in april 2021 we expect to renew or replace this committed line of credit during 2020 as of dec 31 2019 we had 196 million of available liquidity under this line of credit ael p has 22 million of available liquidity under its 25 million committed line of credit that was renewed in november 2019 and expires in november 2024 in november 2019 we issued and sold 180 million of first mortgage bonds due in 2049 pursuant to a bond purchase agreement with institutional investors in the private placement market the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to repay maturing long term debt of 90 million repay a portion of the outstanding balance under our 400 million committed line of credit and for other general corporate purposes in 2019 we issued common stock for total net proceeds of about 65 million 2020 liquidity transactions during 2020 we expect to issue approximately 160 million of long term debt and 60 million of equity in order to refinance 52 million of maturing long term debt fund planned capital expenditures and maintain an appropriate capital structure capital expenditures and other investments for 2019 avista utilities capital expenditures were 434 million and ael p s capital expenditures were 8 million in 2020 we expect capital expenditures to total 405 million at avista utilities and 9 million at ael p in addition we expect to invest about 15 million at our other businesses in 2020 primarily related to non regulated investment opportunities and economic development projects in our service territory 2020 earnings guidance and outlook avista corp is initiating its 2020 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of 1 95 to 2 15 per diluted share which represents over 9 percent growth from the mid point of our original 2019 guidance excluding the effects of hydro one this earnings guidance range assumes approval of our partial general rate case settlement by the washington commission we experienced regulatory lag during 2019 and we expect this to continue through the end of 2021 due to our continued investment in utility infrastructure and because we did not file general rate cases during 2018 due to the terminated hydro one transaction in april 2019 we filed general rates cases in washington partial settlement agreement in november 2019 expected to be effective on april 1 2020 we completed an electric only general rate case in idaho with new rates effective on dec 1 2019 and we also filed a natural gas general rate case in oregon in march with new rates effective on jan 15 2020 we expect these cases to provide rate relief in 2020 and start reducing the regulatory lag that we have been experiencing going forward we will continue to strive to reduce the regulatory timing lag and more closely align our earned returns with those authorized by 2022 to achieve this we anticipate an annual earnings growth rate of 9 percent to 10 percent from 2020 to 2022 with a return to 4 percent to 6 percent growth rate following 2022 the earnings growth rates are based on the mid point of our original 2019 earnings guidance as the starting point and exclude the 1 01 per diluted share related to the hydro one transaction these growth rates also assume timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions our 2020 earnings guidance range reflects unrecovered structural costs estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 90 basis points in addition our 2020 guidance range reflects regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 80 basis points this results in an expected return on equity for avista utilities of approximately 7 7 percent in 2020 we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of 1 89 to 2 01 per diluted share for 2020 the midpoint of our avista utilities guidance range does not include any expense or benefit under the erm our current expectation for the erm is a benefit position within the 90 percent customer 10 percent company sharing band which is expected to add 0 07 per diluted share our outlook for avista utilities assumes among other variables normal precipitation temperatures and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year for 2020 we expect ael p to contribute in the range of 0 08 to 0 12 per diluted share our outlook for ael p assumes among other variables normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year we expect the other businesses to contribute in the range of a loss of 0 02 to earnings of 0 02 per diluted share our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual items such as settlement transactions or acquisitions dispositions until the effects are known and certain note we will host a conference call with financial analysts and investors on feb 26 2020 at 10 30 a m et to discuss this news release the call will be available at 888 771 4371 confirmation number 49314531 a simultaneous webcast of the call will be available on

federal and state combined of 23 05 percent b electric utility margin operating revenues less resource costs increased for the full year and was primarily impacted by the following general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective jan 1 2019 customer growth contributed additional retail electric revenue the above increases were partially offset by a general rate decrease in idaho effective dec 1 2019 an increase in power purchased prices thermal fuel costs and lower hydroelectric generation in 2019 for the full year 2019 we recognized a pre tax benefit of 4 4 million under the erm compared to a pre tax benefit of 6 1 million for the full year 2018 and an accrual of 3 6 million for customer refunds related to our 2015 washington general rate case that was remanded back to the washington commission during 2019 c natural gas utility margin operating revenues less resource costs increased for the full year and was impacted primarily by the following general rate increases in washington effective may 1 2018 and idaho effective jan 1 2019 customer growth contributed additional retail natural gas revenue d other operating expenses increased for the full year 2019 primarily due to increased transmission and distribution operating and maintenance costs also the company donated 7 million to the avista foundation to support the local community these were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense e for the full year 2019 merger transaction costs most of which were paid in the first quarter were 19 7 million pre tax compared to 3 7 million pre tax for the full year 2018 the merger transaction costs increased for the full year 2019 because 2018 costs consisted primarily of employee time incurred directly related to the transaction whereas 2019 costs included consulting banking fees and legal fees in addition to employee time none of the acquisition costs are being passed through to customers f depreciation and amortization increased from additions to utility plant also in the second quarter 2019 we utilized approximately 6 4 million 5 1 million when tax effected of electric tax benefits to offset costs associated with accelerating the depreciation of colstrip units 3 4 based on a settlement in idaho this amount was recorded as a one time charge to depreciation expense in the second quarter of 2019 and was offset with an amount included in income tax expense g as a result of the termination of the proposed merger hydro one paid avista corp a 103 million termination fee in january 2019 the termination fee was used for reimbursing our transaction costs incurred from 2017 to 2019 these costs including income taxes totaled approximately 51 million the balance of the termination fee was used for general corporate purposes and reduced our need for external financing h other for the full year 2019 was a decrease to earnings primarily due to an increase in the non service portion of pension and other postretirement benefits partially offset by a decrease in property taxes i our effective tax rate was 13 8 percent for 2019 compared to 16 0 percent for 2018 our effective tax rate decreased due to additional tax deductions we were able to utilize in 2019 in addition during the second quarter of 2019 our income taxes decreased due to the settlement agreement in idaho related to colstrip depreciation and the usage of electric tax benefits to offset the accelerated depreciation the above decreases were partially offset by income taxes associated with the receipt of the hydro one termination fee j the increase in earnings at our other businesses was primarily related to a gain on the sale of metalfx during the second quarter of 2019 and net investment gains from our other investments non generally accepted accounting principles non gaap financial measures the tables above and below include electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin two financial measures that are considered non gaap financial measures generally a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap which for utility margin is utility operating revenues the presentation of electric utility margin and natural gas utility margin is intended to enhance the understanding of operating performance we use these measures internally and believe they provide useful information to investors in their analysis of how changes in loads due to weather economic or other conditions rates supply costs and other factors impact our results of operations changes in loads as well as power and natural gas supply costs are generally deferred and recovered from customers through regulatory accounting mechanisms accordingly the analysis of utility margin generally excludes most of the change in revenue resulting from these regulatory mechanisms we present electric and natural gas utility margin separately below for avista utilities since each business has different cost sources cost recovery mechanisms and jurisdictions so we believe that separate analysis is beneficial these measures are not intended to replace utility operating revenues as determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance reconciliations of operating revenues to utility margin are set forth below the following table presents avista utilities operating

rate federal and state combined of 23 05 percent liquidity and capital resources liquidity 2019 liquidity transactions we have a 400 million committed line of credit that expires in april 2021 we expect to renew or replace this committed line of credit during 2020 as of dec 31 2019 we had 196 million of available liquidity under this line of credit ael p has 22 million of available liquidity under its 25 million committed line of credit that was renewed in november 2019 and expires in november 2024 in november 2019 we issued and sold 180 million of first mortgage bonds due in 2049 pursuant to a bond purchase agreement with institutional investors in the private placement market the net proceeds from the sale of the bonds were used to repay maturing long term debt of 90 million repay a portion of the outstanding balance under our 400 million committed line of credit and for other general corporate purposes in 2019 we issued common stock for total net proceeds of about 65 million 2020 liquidity transactions during 2020 we expect to issue approximately 160 million of long term debt and 60 million of equity in order to refinance 52 million of maturing long term debt fund planned capital expenditures and maintain an appropriate capital structure capital expenditures and other investments for 2019 avista utilities capital expenditures were 434 million and ael p s capital expenditures were 8 million in 2020 we expect capital expenditures to total 405 million at avista utilities and 9 million at ael p in addition we expect to invest about 15 million at our other businesses in 2020 primarily related to non regulated investment opportunities and economic development projects in our service territory 2020 earnings guidance and outlook avista corp is initiating its 2020 earnings guidance with a consolidated range of 1 95 to 2 15 per diluted share which represents over 9 percent growth from the mid point of our original 2019 guidance excluding the effects of hydro one this earnings guidance range assumes approval of our partial general rate case settlement by the washington commission we experienced regulatory lag during 2019 and we expect this to continue through the end of 2021 due to our continued investment in utility infrastructure and because we did not file general rate cases during 2018 due to the terminated hydro one transaction in april 2019 we filed general rates cases in washington partial settlement agreement in november 2019 expected to be effective on april 1 2020 we completed an electric only general rate case in idaho with new rates effective on dec 1 2019 and we also filed a natural gas general rate case in oregon in march with new rates effective on jan 15 2020 we expect these cases to provide rate relief in 2020 and start reducing the regulatory lag that we have been experiencing going forward we will continue to strive to reduce the regulatory timing lag and more closely align our earned returns with those authorized by 2022 to achieve this we anticipate an annual earnings growth rate of 9 percent to 10 percent from 2020 to 2022 with a return to 4 percent to 6 percent growth rate following 2022 the earnings growth rates are based on the mid point of our original 2019 earnings guidance as the starting point and exclude the 1 01 per diluted share related to the hydro one transaction these growth rates also assume timely and appropriate rate relief in our jurisdictions our 2020 earnings guidance range reflects unrecovered structural costs estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 90 basis points in addition our 2020 guidance range reflects regulatory timing lag estimated to reduce the return on equity by approximately 80 basis points this results in an expected return on equity for avista utilities of approximately 7 7 percent in 2020 we expect avista utilities to contribute in the range of 1 89 to 2 01 per diluted share for 2020 the midpoint of our avista utilities guidance range does not include any expense or benefit under the erm our current expectation for the erm is a benefit position within the 90 percent customer 10 percent company sharing band which is expected to add 0 07 per diluted share our outlook for avista utilities assumes among other variables normal precipitation temperatures and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year for 2020 we expect ael p to contribute in the range of 0 08 to 0 12 per diluted share our outlook for ael p assumes among other variables normal precipitation and hydroelectric generation for the remainder of the year we expect the other businesses to contribute in the range of a loss of 0 02 to earnings of 0 02 per diluted share our guidance generally includes only normal operating conditions and does not include unusual items such as settlement transactions or acquisitions dispositions until the effects are known and certain note we will host a conference call with financial analysts and

thanks president trump for the travel ban on african nations of libya somalia eritrea tanzania nigeria and chad olduvai gorge in tanzania cradle of mankind questions to ponder upon the origin of the name africa stems from the words used by the phoenicians greeks and romans key words include the egyptian word afru ika meaning motherland the greek word aphrike meaning without cold as well as aprica a latin word meaning sunny olduvai gorge in tanzania holds evidence of the earliest human ancestors one would venture to say that by extension we are all tanzanians africa as you can already tell is a continent with a rich history most beautiful cultures highly educated populous just to mention a few 25 of all the languages in the entire universe are spoken on this one continent as noted jared diamond in his 1997 pulitzer prize winning book guns germs and steel why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here trump in january 2018 these remarks included some african countries on january 31st 2020 president trump extended his travel ban to include eritrea nigeria sudan and tanzania it s with this backdrop that i was tempted to delve a little deeper into what africa s potential really is and what it takes for her to realize it several questions come to mind with a population of 1 3 billion why is africa s gdp merely 2 19 trillion while that of the usa is at a staggering 21 44 trillion france united kingdom india germany and japan all have higher gdp than all of africa why is norway s gdp per capita is 81 485 while that of burundi s is 310 why does it take 24 african nations to aggregate 1 trillion in gdp far more than any other region in the world why does most of europe have a single trade zone the european union while africa has 16 trade zone how come it takes 3 hours or less to reach european countries aggregating 70 of europe s gdp and 8 hours for latin america but 15 hours for a comparable trip in africa why does it cost less to ship a car from paris to lagos than from accra to lagos i will proceed to explain my thoughts on how we got here and examine the best means to fully realize our potential acha leke saf and yeboah amankwah in their harvard business review article titled africa a crucible of creativity highlighted that africa has more than 400 companies whose revenue exceeds 1 billion dollars surely africa has all the precursors to be the world s largest economy attain her deserving dignity possible explanation a national geographic report suggested that in by 1850 africa s population would have been 50 million instead of 25 million thanks to slavery the report goes further to suggest that slavery contributed to the colonization and exploration of the continent furthermore it s suggested that as a result infrastructure and communities were damaged and this made africa vulnerable to colonialism what was a huge loss to the continent the slaves actually provided a head start the slave traders had it not been for the slaves in america the cost of building industry and agriculture would have been much higher therefore the standard of living would be much lower today s western culture is a hybrid of that of african and the local customs this ranges from food to music while acknowledging impact of slavery on the continent it s fair to highlight that the westerners didn t settle in large numbers however they were successful in extracting the continents wealth first the human capital through slavery then diamonds copper and rubber just to mention a few today we see africa hosting 60 of the world s arable land that hasn t been cultivated but still imports 35billion worth food annually this figure is projected to increase to 110 billion by 2025 if nothing is done even more mind boggling is the fact that africa export raw material out of the continent and turns around to import the same products processed africa is essentially contributing to her own poverty by exporting jobs in the process a 2018 africa development bank report noted that brazil transformed it tropical cerrados into a 54 billion food industry in just two decades certainly this feat required innovative soil and crop management programs new agriculture technologies just to mention a few africa s savannah is more than double that of brazil and employing a few of the mentioned techniques will certainly make the continent a net exporter of agricultural products the challenge remains on of extractive nature of africa s political and economic systems the world economic forum reports this as part of the reasons why the impact of foreign aid is never seen trickling down to most citizens the aide in turn ends up being a tool to continue enslaving the citizens and at times eroding the continents culture and identity with the attached strings in his book confessions of an economic hitman john perkins elucidated the tricks that are behind the so called loans karen mcveigh s article in the guardian shared a sad finding that in 2015 africa received 32 billion in loans but paid 18 billion in debt interest alone as perkins highlighted such loans aren t structured with africa s interest in mind this coupled with poor leadership means africa finds herself in a perpetual race to end poverty political evolution is what is believed to differentiate the africa from the west the west has proven to host economic and political systems that allow for inclusion and equal opportunities botswana is a perfect example of effects of good governance 50 years ago botswana was a very poor african country today with a gdp per capita of 8 258 this african nation is richer than european nations of bulgaria serbia albania and ukraine this is primarily due to good governance and its handling of the natural resource diamond wealth a good economic institution protects private property right enforcements of contracts is predictable and controlled inflation thabo mbeki s report of the high level panel on illicit financial flows from africa reports that for the past 50 years africa lost over 1 2 to 1 4trillion dollars to illicit flows this was equal to the financial assistance given to the continent in the same period while these transactions are usually dismissed as a result of pure corruption mbeki s report showed that 65 of these illicit flows were commercial transactions some of the means by which this is achieved is through trade mis invoicing multinational corporations have used technics referred to as base erosion and profit shifting which are essentially forms tax evasion from high tax countries to low tax locations basically multinationals decide how much profit to allocate to different parts of the same company operating in different countries and then determine how much tax to pay to each government meanwhile embezzlement and bribery constitute of only 3 of these illicit outflows african countries have done a wonderful job building out modern road systems however only 33 of africans live within 2 kilometers of a paved road that is usable all year round the cost of travel within the continent is ungodly travel cost in africa between five and eight times that of brazil of vietnam the economist reported that despite africa being home to a fifth of the world s population the continent accounts for only 4 of the global electric use about 70 percent of the population has no access to electricity urbanization a challenge and opportunities mckinsey company notes that africa s development is directly correlated with urbanization while this introduces infrastructural challenges in major cities it also implies a growing consumer market between 2010 and 2020 there was a bigger growth in sales of food and beverages in cairo than brasilia and delhi this can be best captured in the facts that today nairobi s per capita income is three times that of kenya those who live in lagos are now earning twice the amount of the nations average in the oil rich nation of angola luanda the capital city accounts for 45 percent of the nation s consumption while this is exciting for the consumer market i am deeply concerned about the disincentives to grow new cities and in turn new economic frontiers the right development policies need to be put in place so growth can be equally dispersed the way forward the african continental free trade area agreement afcfta africa is not resource poor by any means as a matter of fact africa is the richest continent on earth south africa potential mineral wealth is estimated at about 2 5 trillion if fully realized this would put south africa ahead of italy and brazil as the 8th largest economy in the world right behind france simultaneously democratic republic of the congo s mineral wealth is estimated to be worth 24 trillion congo doesn t only have the potential to be the richest nation on the planet but richer than the european union numerous other stunning finds exist about the potential of the continent however africa must trade her way to her fullest potential with a staggering population of 1 3 billion people africa is already her own market so africa s intra trade is paramount the share of intra africa exports have increased over the years to about 17 presently however this is still very low compared to other regions europe is at 69 and asia at 59 the afcfta is believed to be the answer to most intra africa trade related issues this agreement will certainly unlock the continent s economic potential if properly executed the mere removal of tariffs is expected to boost the continental intra trade by 50 billion to 70 billion by the year 2040 to enhance intra trade a key impediment that needs to be removed is the tariff related costs according to the abuja treaty all regional economic communities should have established a common external tariff within customs unions and fully functional free trade agreements by end of 2017 clearly this is yet to take place the economic community of central african states eccas has the lowest intra regional trade this region posts the lowest intra regional trade in the continent and for this to change tariff should essentially be wiped away none tariff barriers also pose an equally challenging obstacle to intra trading these broadly include policies that reduce cost of transactions that stem from custom administrations documents required enhanced transport infrastructure these policies are needed to reduce transaction costs as well as those that create an enabling environment for trade which include reduced bureaucracy and corruption efforts being made international companies such as maersk imperial logistics and a few others have played a key role in facilitating intercontinental trade between 2005 and 2016 the mentioned companies helped increase intra africa trade from 30billion to 64 billion another industry that is playing a key role in connecting the continent is the airline industry as of 2019 ethiopia airlines flies to 37 countries in africa alone leading the way royal air maroc air cote d ivoire and rwanda air are leading the continent in the economic integration efforts conclusion africa may be lacking in hard power but the continent should take control of her soft power very few countries have leveraged the power and impact of branding rarely do you hear that mauritius gdp per capital is more than that of bulgaria or that equatorial guinea is richer than mexico yes there is work to be done on the continent but it s come a point where she must take control of her own narrative talent and capital are increasingly mobile and can have a huge impact on the economy america isn t just a nation but an idea in 2018 about 23 million people applied for the green card lottery which is given to only 55 000 people a year very few of these millions try to make it to the us not because they have done a cost benefit analysis of the key factors the power of the american dream and the iconography of the statue of liberty mean something they have value far beyond feel good expressions of patriotism they represent america as something for which to strive as an expression of hopes and dreams for a better life as a fulfillment of a quest for ultimate safety and prosperity and liberty african nations need rebranding i have seen images of africa on cnn and fox to almost always be of starving children begging for food rarely do we see cnn covering stories such as the ugandan inventor brian turyabagye has created a biomedical smart jacket that can diagnose pneumonia that is responsible for 16 of deaths of children under the age of 5 square kilometer array ska in south africa which once completed is set to be world s largest telescope that will allow us to see many times deeper into space nigeria s osh agabi has created a device that fuses live neurons from mice stem cells into a silicon chip for the first time the device can be used to detect explosives and cancer cells these examples are endless africa indeed should take the travel bans as an opportunity to look inward and seek out her deep inner capabilities the above issues highlighted aren t difficult to resolve if african leaders place their hearts in the right place with africa s median age of 19 the continent has the energy human capital and vigor to allow the continent to realize her fullest potential of the biggest economy in the word all precursors are present as we strive to realize africa s dream let s not lose sight of the health of her children the quality of their education or the joy of their play let s world know of the beauty of her poetry and the intelligence of their vibrant and rich public debates the world ought to know more about the wit courage wisdom and compassion of africans we must choose to make this goal our solemn mission this decision should be made not because it s easy but rather because it s hard it s the continental collective effort that will organize her citizens and bring forth the best of her skills and energies this is a challenge the continent must accept now and must be unwilling to postpone and one the continent must achieve i leave you with two questions to

a truck at the vast oyu tolgoi mine near the gobi desert in southern mongolia photo by rio tinto with its heavy dependence on the extractive industry facilitated by a powerful mining lobby mongolia is quickly resembling what naomi klein has described as an environmental sacrifice zone the country s generous corporate tax breaks and policies that are increasingly friendly toward foreign enterprises have encouraged north american companies to freely capitalize on mongolia s mineral resources most recently mongolia s giant copper and gold mine oyu tolgoi has been in industry headlines for the massive underground expansion that is now underway a move that has faced few critiques in the international press or from environmental groups the project is the largest financial undertaking in mongolia s history but apart from its more well known deposits of coal copper and gold mongolia is becoming a frontier for lithium exploration and extraction global demand for lithium is increasing due to its use in lithium ion batteries and other components for electric vehicles light rail trains and personal electronic devices such as apple s iphone and has long been on the market as a mood stabilizer in the pharmaceutical industry industry publications expect lithium stores to triple by 2025 and prices to rise significantly as electric vehicles become more popular the rare earth metal also has significant military uses in unmanned vehicles and for large energy storage systems such as earlier versions developed by lockheed martin for aecom northrop grumman s lithium ion battery for use on nuclear submarines or more recently the nearly invincible battery developed by the us army research laboratory the lithium isotope li 7 which is a by product of refining natural lithium also has potential use in producing tritium for thermonuclear weapons in recent years the us government accountability office notably remarked that it was concerned with domestic li 7 supply the popular argument that lithium is necessary to transition vehicles away from fossil fuels and coal reliant countries away from dependency on coal usually doesn t go deeper to critique the influence of canadian and us companies on economic priorities and policies in those countries with substantial lithium deposits for at least two decades mineral prospecting in mongolia and across central asia has gone hand in hand with neoliberal policy intervention and the looming lithium boom signals that this will only intensify first movers in the region with confirmed reserves of at least 203 000 tonnes of lithium mongolia is among the world s most significant prospective sources of the rare earth metal confirmed lithium deposits are largely concentrated in southeastern mongolia closer to chinese projects like baotou in inner mongolia surveying is ongoing in western salt lakes like hyargas noor where mongolia also harbours deposits of uranium more recent discoveries of lithium have included a deposit found by mongolian company buman olz in 2018 in the eastern dornod province the company s ceo tsogtjargal dondovdorj confirmed intentions to further develop exploration and signaled the redevelopment of the matad soum korean company posco daewoo whose parent corporation posco international has investments in indonesian palm oil and was previously exposed for using child labour in uzbek cotton farms has already expressed interest in working with mongolian state owned company erdenes mongol llc to continue exploration for lithium canadian mining and extractive companies have a long history of exploration and development in mongolia and they have faced minimal backlash for the social and environmental damages caused by the building and operation of extractive megaprojects some of the biggest names in canadian mining are operating in mongolia including kincora copper centerra gold and rio tinto s subsidiary turquoise hill top canadian mining executives like former ceo of oyu tolgoi cameron mcrae have played a significant role in lobbying the mongolian government including pushing for changes to corporate tax rates in favour of mining companies this legislation was implemented in january 2020 mcrae is deeply embedded in the mining and private sector lobby in mongolia through his role as founding president of a policy think tank the institute of national strategy and as a director on the business council of mongolia since 2018 he is also a director for the canadian owned mining company erdene resources development corp one of the major gold producers in mongolia which as of 2019 is financed by the european bank for reconstruction and development in 2017 the government of mongolia signed a foreign investment promotion and protection agreement fipa with canada to ensure greater predictability and certainty for canadian investors working in the country françois philippe champagne then minister of international trade described the intentions of the fipa in the following way the opportunities to strengthen our middle class relate directly to creating the right conditions for canadian businesses to compete internationally and that is precisely what this agreement is all about and yet as yves engler pointed out in a recent article for canadian dimension fipa agreements ultimately empower corporations to sue governments for pursuing policies that interfere with their profit making oyu tolgoi a combined open pit and underground mining project in mongolia photo from wikimedia commons such agreements have no doubt empowered canadian corporations to make significant strides toward tapping into mongolia s unexploited lithium reserves one of the largest mining licenses in mongolia was awarded in 2017 to toronto based company ion energy for the development of the baavhai uul lithium brine project in the eastern sukhbaatar province at around 30 kilometres from the border with china ion energy s baavhai uul site is located in strategic proximity to planned megafactories in china as well as existing battery production facilities in south korea taiwan and japan in an interview with investing news ion s ceo ali haji recently described how ion wanted to be first movers in the region and that the company was founded in 2017 with the sole purpose of obtaining a lithium exploration license in mongolia no doubt anticipating a boom in lithium demand canadian ambitions in exploration and mining in mongolia nonetheless fit into larger strategic maneuvers to sway political influence in central asia toward western geopolitical priorities competing colonialism through a network of projects in transport infrastructure and resource extraction china is aiming to integrate mongolia into the economic corridor of its belt and road initiative bri proposals for bri integrated infrastructure have included highways connecting copper and gold mines from the gobi to china and a railroad that would increase chinese imports of coal directly from the expanding tavan tolgoi coal fields there are legitimate concerns for mongolia around the environmental and social accountability of belt and road projects the bri has been criticized for displacing indigenous populations exploiting lax environmental regulations and contributing to pollution in its host countries the bri has also been blamed for inflating project costs creating debt traps and exploiting smaller economies by asserting unilateral chinese interests over regional priorities the creation of special economic zones to serve the economic corridor such as kyaukphyu in myanmar also allows for chinese companies to escape tax obligations in host countries mongolia however relies heavily on this close trade relationship as most mineral resources are exported in raw form to china rather than being domestically processed and with about two thirds of the world s lithium ion battery plants based in china the proximity of mongolian lithium brine deposits is convenient for chinese producers the demand for lithium is also expected to grow over the coming years due largely to china s growing electric vehicle ev industry and recent state subsidies for new ev purchases as well as global increases in the procurement of electric military aircraft china has also been investing in the lithium industry in bolivia one of the three countries making up the south american lithium triangle that dominates global lithium supplies the wide reach of the bri ultimately symbolizes an economic threat to the hegemony of western corporate investments and influence beyond just northeast asia after all bri free trade zones are not markedly different from those developed with the help of the us agency for international development usaid democracy building in northeast asia with its rich mineral deposits and strategic location mongolia has long been a target of corporate led economic reforms that empower private foreign investment over regional interests both the us and canada have positioned themselves as third neighbours to mongolia to counteract the influence of china and russia and many of the economic reforms have gone hand in hand with democracy building projects in the region in july 2019 the us announced a strategic partnership with mongolia that includes deepening national security and law enforcement ties and intensifying cooperation as strong democracies the government of canada has similarly described its interests in mongolia as promoting sustainable economic growth and democratic development buman olz coal project located in matad soum of dornod aimag near the lithium deposit find john baird foreign affairs minister under the harper government visited mongolia in 2014 with the mission to contribute to the democratic development of the country according to a government press release including promoting reforms in mongolian public service and mining governance the atlantic council a us military lobby group funded by nato and top us military officials has also promoted the integration of mongolia into the us military infrastructure in the region when mongolia s collaboration with nato was finalized in 2012 the atlantic council celebrated the good will mongolia earned through its participation in nato s training exercises like the khaan quest training the afghan national army and participating in the us led iraq war in a cable from september 2006 published by wikileaks former us ambassador to mongolia pamela j slutz summarized the motivations and pivotal influence of her diplomacy term mongolia is not of strategic importance to the us at least not in the conventional defense and security context rather mongolia s value to the us lies in it becoming a base of democracy in an otherwise unfriendly region slutz described how usaid has helped mongolia get its house in order by paying particular attention to the private sector while blatantly framing mongolia s ideological confrontation between asian values and western values slutz also decried mongolian political leaders as steeped in socialist doctrine she went on to claim that ith a better western educated populace wider integration into regional and global organizations and greater confidence in building and managing bilateral and multi lateral relationships beyond its traditional immediate neighbors mongolia could in many respects become the poland of northeast asia this claim that the country could follow the steps of poland s neoliberalisation reflects the long legacy of western corporate intervention in mongolia following the collapse of the soviet union mongolia became the locus for as journalist richard tomlinson described in a 1998 piece for fortune magazine the likes of harvard graduates who a few years back descended on ulaanbaatar to teach the locals capitalism and yet despite the so called democratic development in mongolia s governance transparency international s 2019 corruption perceptions index still gave mongolia a relatively low score of 35 alongside brazil and egypt in october 2018 mongolia s small and medium enterprise sme scandal spurred protests against government corruption when state officials were found to be embezzling state money from the sme fund to start their own enterprises it was also only that year when mongolia along with panama and macau was removed from the european union s non cooperative tax haven list in january 2019 al jazeera reported that the mongolian government was perceived to be in danger of slipping into authoritarianism and was clearly hostile toward mongolian media and anti corruption agencies the machinations for sustainable economic growth and democracy building that have been led by the us and canada have proven to be a means of pushing neoliberal reforms that empower foreign companies at the expense of the priorities of local governments as the demand for lithium in so called green energy grows and canadian mining companies become more established in mongolia so too must the oversight and public awareness of long standing canadian activities in the resource rich country after all canadian mining projects in mongolia and agreements like fipa are not so much about strengthening the middle class as minister françois philippe champagne has put it but rather about advancing a broader agenda of corporate intervention and

coronavirus continues to spread around the world it inflicts an insidious blow not only on the population of about four dozen countries but also affects the global economy unprecedentedly international auditors predict pessimistic scenarios if it comes to a pandemic unian learned what awaits ukraine in such conditions coronavirus continues to sow fever across the world despite the statement by the director general of the world health organization that the peak of the epidemic in china the center of the outbreak has passed the new 21st century plague is not about to recede the number of patients in china who have contracted covid 19 continues to grow over the past day 71 people have died from pneumonia caused by the new type of virus in china the number of infected has increased by 508 people in general in the celestial empire covid 19 was discovered in 77 658 patients 2 663 people died while 27 323 recovered to this day million plus cities are blocked in the country hundreds of enterprises have ceased operations despite all the measures taken by the chinese side the virus continues to spread beyond the prc cases of infection were detected in 36 countries with the number of infected having reached 2 438 thus the total number of infected around the world exceeded 80 000 the second largest outbreak of the virus is in south korea where 893 cases were confirmed and nine people died the infection also got to europe an acute outbreak has been reported in italy a total of 230 cases were confirmed and seven patients died ten cities in the northern regions of lombardy and veneto are isolated authorities asked around 50 000 residents to stay at home the so called red zone included the municipalities of va euganeo and codogno castiglione d adda casalpusterlengo fombio maleo somalia bertonico terranova dei passerini castelgerundo and san fiorano authorities have banned entry to or exit from the outbreak areas schools shops and museums have been shut down while government agencies operate in a limited mode the police and if necessary the armed forces will be empowered to enforce emergency procedures non compliance with the measures may be punished in accordance with the article of the criminal code which provides for a fine and arrest for up to 3 months видео дня neighboring countries of italy said that they did not rule out complications and were already preparing for the adoption of stringent isolation measures for ukraine the situation is complicated by the fact that quite a lot of our citizens work in italy who may wish to return to their homeland in addition italy is one of the leaders in europe in terms of tourism therefore migration is quite difficult to control virus strikes economies everything that happened could not but affect the global economy oil and gas prices collapsed to an annual minimum only gold quotes went up this is how investors react to news about the spread of coronavirus american stocks japanese and european stock indices are sliding the base index of australia and new zealand fell especially the international monetary fund has already made a disappointing forecast coronavirus will slow down the global economy by 0 1 percentage points to 3 2 but this is at best if the chinese economy returns to normal in the second quarter that is the impact on the global economy will be relatively minor and short lived meanwhile as noted by imf managing director kristalina georgieva the fund is considering more pessimistic scenarios according to which the spread of the virus will continue longer and more globally and the consequences for the economy will be long lasting the imf is ready to help including through the disaster protection fund which can provide grants to ease the debt burden for the poorest and most vulnerable members georgieva emphasized the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy is further complicated by the fact that it is already on the verge of a new wave of crisis it is predicted for the second year in a row by all international institutions recording a slowdown in growth in all sectors what awaits ukraine so far in ukraine no patients with coronavirus have been identified the authorities are taking measures to control the situation inside the country including those coming to ukraine prime minister oleksiy honcharuk assured that everything possible was being done for a prompt response minister of economic development trade and agriculture tymofiy mylovanov assures that there are no negative consequences for the ukrainian economy due to the coronavirus epidemic in the world according to him the ministry is monitoring the situation and the export of goods from ukraine to china despite the spread of the disease there continues we have a certain export we sell goods to china but most of the goods there is oil and other food products they will not be affected the minister emphasized meanwhile a worrying note was still heard in his words ukraine continues to import certain consumer goods from china although in general imports of chinese goods in particular have declined on the one hand this may somehow affect the economy but on the other hand it allows ukrainian businesses to enter this niche and develop that is it is an opportunity another opinion is shared by anastasia holovach senior economist at the world bank in ukraine she believes that the situation in china where the coronavirus epidemic broke out could reduce the flow of investment in ukraine last year our country received more than 4 billion in portfolio investments and now the prospect of this trend continuing is in great doubt the passivity of investors has become one of the reasons for the low results of the latest placement of government bonds by the ministry of finance if this trend continues it will affect the exchange rate of the national currency holovach said adding that the world bank does not expect significant risks for the global economy due to the coronavirus epidemic provided that in a month the wave of diseases will decline member of the nbu council vitaly shapran draws attention to the fact that the first measures taken to counter the coronavirus epidemic in italy show that the virus inflicts a big blow on the economic activity of the population due to quarantine he admits that the effect can be far greater than we can imagine it is difficult to forecast here since the prc economy is far from being in good shape it needs only a small push for problems the expert said the leading analyst of the institute for socio economic transformation slava cherkashyn believes that most likely the pressure on the economy from the coronavirus will be short term and will not have a serious impact on the recovery of the domestic economy the only factor is chinese imports from which vat is collected at the border this could be discussed and potentially the volume amounted to 9 1 billion last year in general a gap of 150 190 million in tax is not critical but sensitive especially against the backdrop of a total budget failure by the customs authorities the second aspect of the slowdown in chinese imports is the possible disruption in the timing of supplies of equipment goods and the consequences for ukrainian companies with established production chains from china other special risks have not yet been observed the expert emphasized president of univer investment group taras kozak noted that while the situation with coronavirus is unclear therefore several scenarios are not ruled out including for ukraine if a few days ago it was believed that the epidemic in the world was on the decline in particular in china the number of those healed exceeded the number of new cases per day then over the past 2 3 days the situation has changed significantly new mass cases in japan and italy increase the threat of a pandemic in this regard two scenarios for ukraine can be distinguished if our country does not have an epidemic that is if there are no cases of illness or if there are several cases and it is possible to localize the problem then the potential losses for the economy will consist only in a decrease in global demand for ukrainian exported goods we can assume that this scenario is conditionally positive there will be no serious consequences for ukraine if the epidemic spreads in the world and there are massive cases in ukraine which will result in quarantines and shutdowns of companies and enterprises then in this case a reduction in gdp growth is possible the expert said adding that most likely it won t result in the fall of the ukrainian economy even in the worst case scenario even if the direct effect of coronavirus for the ukrainian economy is insignificant secondary effects cannot be ruled out they will depend on how markets react to what is happening moreover there is a risk of deterioration in the global financial markets this year as well and for ukraine this year is the year of peak payments on external debts nana chornaya

hdfc securities spot gold markets in india remained shut due to countrywide lockdown to prevent spreading of covid 19 hdfc securities said in times of a crisis investors globally view gold as a safe haven just the way they treat us government bonds and currencies such as the us dollar japanese yen and the swiss franc analysts say the precious metal acts as an effective portfolio diversifier and serves as a store of value besides being a shield against inflation and a lender of last resort during economic uncertainties analysts said the rapid spread of coronavirus cases outside of china and its potential negative impact on the global economy are prompting investors to take refuge in safe havens like gold gold prices they noted have remained firm despite aggressive policy easing measures carried out by china to shore up its economy and moderate physical market activities a weak rupee often pushes up gold prices as india meets bulk of its gold demand from through imports a rise in gold prices however hits local demand for physical gold besides any slowdown in global growth muted inflation and fears of a recession cause central banks to pivot towards an accommodative stance which buoys gold prices central banks hold gold as a reserve asset which is classified as monetary gold data showed central banks owned almost 34 000 tonnes of gold on last count making them the third largest reserve asset in the world the increase in central bank demand for gold reflects current geopolitical political and economic conditions as well as structural changes in the global economy gold is both a liquid counter cyclical asset and a long term store of value as such it can help central banks meet their core objectives of safety liquidity and return central banks continued to buy gold in last two years and they including the reserve bank of india have been buying upwards of 650 tonnes besides india and china the rest of the world has also turned to gold it is a great diversifier and return generator pr somasundaram india managing director of world gold council told etnow edelweiss securities says easy money flows are driving global equities along with other asset classes particularly gold gold prices globally it noted had been consolidating for seven years before finally breaking out eight months back interestingly holdings in gold etfs are forming fresh records having climbed for 20 days in a row by value in etfs investors cumulatively held about 135 billion of gold 2 609 metric tonnes as on 19 february since 2019 investors have bought 399 metric tonnes of gold raising their exposure by 18 per cent and the yellow metal shot up by 26 per cent during the period this gold etf binge also suggests investors are diversifying to cushion their portfolios against any sell off in equities it said according to the world gold council many of the global dynamics seeded over the past few years will remain generally supportive for gold in 2020 in particular financial and geopolitical uncertainty combined with low interest rates will likely bolster gold investment demand if you take india itself in the last 15 years gold has returned about 9 per cent return it looks like there is certainly a lot of momentum that is there in this price rally but we also have to be cautious of what is happening now has also much to do with anxiety as and when clarity emerges over virus spread you will not have the same momentum there interest rates strategic factors and also certain short term anxieties play a part somasundaram of world gold council said jimmy patel md ceo of quantum mutual fund in an article to et said that one must allocate a small portion around 10 15 per cent of entire investment portfolio to gold with a long term investment horizon this would serve as a sensible and smart strategy gold exchange traded funds etfs and or gold savings funds are smart ways of investing in gold he said earlier this month
there is renewed concern about the sustainability of rising debt levels in many african countries much of this debt is being incurred through foreign currency denominated eurobonds issued on international financial markets the total value of eurobonds issued between 2018 and 2019 was more than the value of all bonds sold between 2003 to 2016 african countries paying too much for debt guest column misheck mutize there is renewed concern about the sustainability of rising debt levels in many african countries much of this debt is being incurred through foreign currency denominated eurobonds issued on international financial markets the total value of eurobonds issued between 2018 and 2019 was more than the value of all bonds sold between 2003 to 2016 african governments are issuing and listing their eurobonds on established international debt markets usually london and irish stock exchanges african governments would venture offshore a lot less if domestic bond markets were active and liquid but besides south africa african bond markets are largely underdeveloped with inactive and illiquid secondary markets this makes it difficult to attract international investor participation locally the international monetary fund imf believes that african countries are on a eurobond issuing spree and half of them are near or at distressed levels it argues that african governments are piling on debt without evaluating the exchange rate risks and the real costs of repaying the debt but in my view the debt alarm being set off by international debt management organisations is exaggerated the problem is not that african countries are borrowing too much but rather they are paying too much interest there are a number of reasons for this including badly informed ratings by rating agencies as well as the behaviour of issuers there are solutions but these require african governments to stand up and take action doing the calculations there are two key elements that are taken into account in assessing a country s debt burden one is the level of debt based on the ratio of debt to gross domestic product gdp the other is the cost of servicing the debt interest payments debt levels on the continent for example are on average way below the 100 debt to gdp ratio mark but the impression created is that they are much higher this exaggerated perception of african debt levels has resulted in countries paying higher interest rates on debt the premiums are much higher than those paid by other countries in my view these are not justified by the risk profile of african countries save for four countries cape verde djibouti congo and mozambique all the other african countries have debt to gdp ratios averaging 60 a debt to gdp ratio of 60 is the imf s and african monetary co operation programme s threshold for prudent debt levels the scale of debt issuances in africa amounts to only 1 of the continent s total gdp annually whose average annual growth rate is 4 in simple terms this means the value of income generation is higher than the rate of government debt accumulation these ratios gives a snapshot of the a country s fiscal sustainability on the contrary the amount of interest expenditure has been disproportionate to the debt to gdp ratio studies show that in developed economies an increase of 1 in debt to gdp ratio is associated with an increase of between 0 02 and 0 03 in interest rates african governments are paying interest of 5 to 16 on 10 year government bonds compared to near zero to negative rates in europe and america on average the interest repayment is the highest expenditure portion and remains the fastest growth expenditure in sub saharan africa s fiscal budgets the rising interest rates on africa s debt should be of major concern african countries are shortchanging themselves by accepting high yield curves in their eurobond initial public offerings this unjustifiably cements the perception that they are high risk issuers the drivers the high interest rates are driven by several key factors first the mismatch between the short term duration of the debt that african governments have taken on by issuing eurobonds compared to the long term nature of the infrastructure projects they propose to fund with the money raised through eurobonds the excessive need to attract investors is forcing african governments to borrow short term to finance long term projects second fungibility of eurobonds proceeds flexibility to be utilised for purposes other than the ones they were raised for exposes the funds to the downside vulnerabilities of misappropriation and non productive expenditures third poor credit ratings as the majority of countries are in junk status credit ratings are pivotal in the determination of both interest rates and the demand for bonds the weaknesses of rating agencies risk assessments have widely been criticised according to sovereign credit methodologies of the big three rating agencies economic growth is a decisive factor in past sovereign credit events there is a strong positive correlation between economic strength and credit worthiness but in africa high economic growth has not translated to better sovereign ratings despite consistent positive economic growth averaging 3 6 among 32 rated african states data shows that the number of downgrades and negative outlooks are almost double that of upgrades and positive outlooks this implies that african countries are now worse off than they previously were this overlooks the continent s significant progress in governance economic growth and human development over the past years take ethiopia it has a current economic growth of 8 5 and has been hovering between 8 11 for over 10 years but it has not had a single upgrade activity from any of the three international rating agencies senegal one of africa s most stable countries experiencing three peaceful political transitions since its independence in 1960 has maintained an economic growth averaging 6 over the past 10 years it still remains in junk status rating part of what drives higher interest rates also rests with africa governments for example a lack of sufficient information about the specific use of proceeds in prospectuses during eurobond initial public offerings is magnifying the risk of fiscal indiscipline it means that funds have no conditionalities or any lines of accountability it is also the case that governments use the money they raise on loss making projects and non productive fiscal expenditure two examples illustrate the point the failing kuraz mega sugar project in ethiopia was funded from the 2014 eurobond as was the kenyan standard gauge railway which is failing to stimulate any new economic activity solutions african countries can act to address the rising interest burden and to avert falling into a debt trap through the following mechanisms governments should use the money raised to fund profitable projects and use the profits from these projects to repay interest owed governments must take control of the bond issuance process during the bond structuring stage they must exercise their choice of accepting or rejecting investors bids it is imperative for african countries to structure bonds with favourable yields and tenure this process should not be entirely renounced to syndicates of lead managers originators and investment banks the oversubscription of recent eurobond issues eurobond issuances have been oversubscribed by three times on average simply shows that demand is outweighing supply countries should manage lead issuance advisors to negotiate for the lowest interests possible to be saved from unnecessary costs governments should bargain for competitive interest rates and accept only favourable bids governments should borrow for productive expenditure and manage proceeds from international bonds more prudently with integrity and transparency african countries should establish a continental position adopt international standards and guidelines to establish lines of accountability in rating agencies this will create a platform to enforce adherence to scientific rating methodology rating appeals regulating rating agencies and sufficient involvement of rated countries in the rating process

small assets that no longer fit our long term strategic direction we stepped up investment in our digital information products such as ovid and our european legal research solutions to enhance their

rolled out a new global hr technology platform accelerated ongoing investments and programs to facilitate our cloud products and extended the use of standardized technology platforms and components during 2019 our decisive response to the detection of ransomware in a portion of our it environment led to a disruption in certain business activity for a few days mainly in our governance risk compliance and tax accounting divisions as reported previously the financial impact on overall group results was not material financial policy leverage and capital allocation wolters kluwer uses its cash flow to invest in the business organically and through acquisitions to maintain optimal leverage and provide returns to shareholders we regularly assess our financial position and evaluate the appropriate level of debt in view of our expectations for cash flow investment plans interest rates and capital market conditions while we may temporarily deviate from our leverage target at times we continue to believe that in the longer run a net debt to ebitda ratio of around 2 5x remains appropriate for our business given the high proportion of recurring revenues and resilient cash flow net debt at december 31 2019 was 2 199 million and the year end net debt to ebitda ratio was 1 6x dividend policy for more than 30 years wolters kluwer has increased or maintained its annual dividend per share in euros or euro equivalent in 2007 the company established a progressive dividend policy and since 2011 all dividends are paid in cash in 2015 we introduced an interim dividend payment aligning cash distributions closer to our seasonal cash flow pattern wolters kluwer remains committed to a progressive dividend policy under which we aim to increase the dividend per share in euros each year independent of currency fluctuations the pay out ratio2 can vary from year to year proposed annual increases in the dividend per share take into account our nancial performance market conditions and our need for nancial exibility the policy takes into consideration the characteristics of our business our expectations for future cash ows and our plans for organic investment in innovation and productivity or for acquisitions we balance these factors with the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet 2019 dividend in light of our strong financial position and in view of our expected capital needs for the duration of our current three year strategic plan 2019 2021 we are proposing to increase the total dividend per share for financial year 2019 by 20 we will therefore recommend a final dividend of 0 79 per share bringing the total dividend to 1 18 per share 2018 0 98 the 2019 final dividend is subject to approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting on april 23 2020 for 2020 we intend to maintain the interim distribution at 40 of prior year total dividend assuming the 2019 dividend is approved this will result in a 2020 interim dividend of 0 47 per share shareholders can choose to reinvest both interim and nal dividends by purchasing additional wolters kluwer shares through the dividend reinvestment plan drip administered by abn amro bank n v share buybacks 2019 and 2020 as a matter of policy since 2012 wolters kluwer will offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases anti dilution policy in addition from time to time when appropriate we return capital to shareholders through further share buyback programs shares repurchased by the company are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or held to meet future obligations arising from share based incentive plans during 2019 we spent 350 million on share buybacks comprising 5 5 million shares at an average price of 63 80 of this 1 0 million shares were released in respect of share based incentive plans today we are announcing our intention to spend up to 350 million on share repurchases during 2020 including repurchases to offset incentive share issuance of this 50 million has already been completed in the period january 2 2020 up to and including february 24 2020 assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially we believe this level of cash return leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans to sustain organic investment in innovation and productivity and to make selective acquisitions the share repurchases may be suspended discontinued or modified at any time for the period february 28 2020 up to and including april 30 2020 we have engaged a third party to execute 75 million in share buybacks on our behalf within the limits of relevant laws and regulations in particular regulation eu 596 2014 and the company s articles of association the maximum number of shares which may be acquired will not exceed the authorization granted by the general meeting of shareholders repurchased shares are added to and held as treasury shares and will be used for capital reduction purposes or to meet future obligations arising from share based incentive plans developments 2020 on january 14 2020 wolters kluwer health signed an agreement to sell its remaining

compensation expense foreign exchange gain loss acquisition related expenses non ordinary course disputes and restructuring and other exit costs income a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure follows we have included adjusted ebitda in this press release because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends allocate internal resources prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and long term operating plans determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more in our platform we believe that adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for period to period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain non cash items and certain variable charges adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect other non operating expenses net of other non operating income including net interest expense adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of foreign exchange gain loss adjusted ebitda does not reflect acquisition related expenses adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of non ordinary course disputes adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of restructuring and other exit costs income and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net income and our other gaap results reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda unaudited three months ended

northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney assembly speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick members of the 219th legislature chief justice rabner and judge grant members of the cabinet former governors mcgreevey and codey first lady tammy murphy and the many special guests sitting with her before me distinguished faith leaders veterans members of organized labor honored guests and my fellow new jerseyans as president franklin delano roosevelt said in our personal ambitions we are individualists but in our seeking for economic and political progress we all go up or else we all go down as one people that was the ideal we brought to our first two budgets and which we now bring to our third for new jerseyans to succeed individually and for our state to succeed as a whole that is our north star ours is a vision of long term and sustainable investment in our people and our communities in their futures and in ours the choices we make come from a belief that the conversations taking place around the kitchen table are more important to our future than those happening around any backroom table the answer to the question of affordability isn t found in rewarding the special interests it is found in creating new opportunities that reward our middle class fixing what s broken and addressing the everyday needs of new jersey s families this has been our focus and because of that new jersey is confidently moving forward our administration took office with a clear and unshakable goal to grow and strengthen new jersey s middle class that means creating opportunity shrinking inequalities restoring fiscal responsibility delivering property tax relief growing our economy and investing in our future we were told that all of this couldn t be done we were told we were dreaming we were told the math couldn t possibly work they said we couldn t be pro growth and progressive that we couldn t make new jersey stronger and fairer but we have stayed true to our beliefs we are who we said we d be and today we are proving the naysayers wrong believe me there is so much more work to do but today property taxes are stabilizing for middle class families and seniors today wages are rising and more new jerseyans are working than ever before our unemployment rate is below four percent for the longest period of time than at any other point in the past 20 years our economy has supported the creation of more than 72 000 private sector jobs and at the same time we have kept our state workforce level more job creating businesses are opening in new jersey and we are far outpacing our peers and indeed the nation in their rate of growth today 8 500 residents are participating in one of 988 recognized apprenticeship programs gaining the skills they will need to get good paying mostly union jobs hundreds of high school students in burlington new brunswick and paterson are preparing for the stem jobs of tomorrow in innovative p tech classrooms working toward a high school diploma a no cost associate s degree and workforce credentials all at the same time and right now students in trenton are preparing to join them today tens of thousands of three and four year olds in school districts up and down our state have a fully funded seat in a pre k classroom an opportunity nearly 6 000 of them across over 90 districts didn t have two years ago more than 7 500 qualified students are working toward an associate s degree tuition free under the community college opportunity grant program that didn t exist two years ago nearly a quarter million residents have been able to purchase affordable individual health care plans under the affordable care act and at a time when health care costs are rising across the country these policies are coming with lower average costs than before our administration took office and we ve secured the aca s protections for millions more consumers today we have a stronger surplus we have been disciplined and anticipate making back to back deposits into the rainy day fund for the first time in 20 years and we re putting the brakes to the financial roller coaster our state has been on for far too long we are making progress not despite our progressive and forward leaning policies but because of them i stand here today with a vision for how our state can work for everyone with a proposed budget built to see it to fruition and with our progress as prologue now i know that the budget i receive back won t look exactly like the one i am handing you but i know that by working together we will arrive at a budget that continues to restore the faith that we can work together for the common good and that we can deliver upon the promises we ve made to our middle class families and just as importantly to those striving to join our middle class to invest in them and to put their needs before those of the special interests to make our state fairer for them and stronger for our future and to change the culture of trenton so that it works for ordinary new jerseyans the values we share will shape that final document a stronger state is a state that does more to invest in its people a fairer state is a state which ensures all of its residents can be part of its progress we will continue to provide real property tax relief and meaningfully and honestly attack the core problems that have long vexed property taxpayers and we will continue to fight for middle class tax fairness we re getting results and making progress we ve relied upon reasonable revenue estimates and early indications are that we may like last year exceed them i don t intend to stop our streak in fiscal 2021 under this budget we will also continue growing our surplus to a projected 1 6 billion triple the surplus of my predecessor s final budget proposal and we will make another roughly 300 million deposit into the rainy day fund our second in as many years and the first back to back deposits in 20 years it s not enough to have the resources to meet the challenges of today we must ensure we can meet the unseen challenges yet to come a stronger surplus and another payment into the rainy day fund are important signs to new jerseyans that we like them understand that we can t rush out and spend everything we have without regard to future risks and it sends an unmistakable signal to the credit rating agencies that we will not follow the irresponsible ways of the past that led to 11 consecutive downgrades we ve reduced our dependence on one shot revenues those one shots may help balance the books for one year but always always lead to a mad scramble to close an even bigger hole the next today i propose bringing one shots down to only eight tenths of one percent of our budget continuing our progress to build our state s fiscal house on a foundation of reliable and recurring revenues we re cutting back the raids and diversions that have been a key reason why so many residents don t trust us with their money in the first place as with last year the affordable housing trust fund will pay for affordable housing we ll build on last year s progress and keep even more in the clean energy fund to support projects that counter the threat of climate change and we will ensure that millions more remain at the ready to build the modern next generation 9 1 1 emergency services infrastructure our communities need and because of the work we ve done together over our first two years to restore our state s fiscal standing we re also able to fulfill our obligation by making a nearly 4 9 billion total payment into our pension system but i know our work is not done the senate president and i agree we need to do all we can to ensure the stability of our pension system so in addition to a 794 million increase for fiscal 2021 our administration will make an extra 279 million payment into the pension system this current fiscal year this is a roughly 1 1 billion increase in our overall pension payment this administration will have put more back into the system in just three years than the preceding one did in eight we can keep this progress going but only with recurring and sustainable revenues and there is no better alternative than a millionaire s tax it s the way we both ensure tax fairness for our middle class and fairness to the dedicated rank and file women and men of our public workforce after all the millionaire s tax is a matter of fairness to our middle class homeowners and renters our seniors and the countless working families reaching to pull themselves up and into the middle class the property tax is the most unfair regressive and cruelest of taxes a middle class family in merchantville or milford or moonachie after all pays a greater percentage of their income in property taxes than a millionaire anywhere else it s easy to see how our middle class can feel cheated their tax burden is real and when put side by side with that of the wealthiest in our state proves to be the exact opposite of fair it isn t the wealthy who bear the burden of our tax system it s the middle class asking the wealthiest 22 000 new jerseyans to pay two cents more in income tax for every dollar they make over 1 million so we can provide nearly 500 million more in property tax relief to new jersey s families is simple fairness as i noted in my state of the state address six weeks ago the 400 wealthiest americans now pay a lower tax rate than the nation s middle class the first time this has happened in our nation s history by the way the number of millionaires in new jersey keeps growing every year and i do not begrudge their financial success i want them and many more to come and stay and they will why because of proximity to the best job opportunities in america to the best schools for their kids in america and the best communities to call home in america there is not one iota of hard economic evidence that has proven the myth of millionaire tax flight and yet i have heard from countless middle class families and seniors who are afraid that they may have to leave because of high property taxes they should be our focus in making new jersey more affordable and tackling income inequality we go nowhere without our middle class and right now they re the ones getting squeezed let s be clear a millionaire s tax doesn t punish the rich it lifts up the middle class and that s good for everybody so i thank the senate president and welcome his willingness to embrace a millionaire s tax in this budget when we have tax fairness we can continue our historic investments in our pension systems and in our middle class families let s secure hundreds of millions of dollars of constitutionally dedicated property tax relief for more school aid for more senior freeze relief for more and larger direct middle class relief to support more shared services and to more fully secure the long term stability of our pension system the millionaire s tax won t make us less competitive it will allow us to continue fighting against high property taxes and allow us to become even more competitive we need to treat every discussion about spending as a family would around their kitchen table and we must properly invest in a way that will return dividends to our entire state and our taxpayers the evidence is clear the steps we are taking are making a difference no other administration has done so much in its first two years to control property taxes or to deliver more property tax relief in just our first two years of working together we have achieved the first and fourth lowest year over year increases in property taxes on record and statewide property values have grown more in our first two years than at any point since the great recession we re helping families by protecting the single most important investment most of them will ever make their homes this hasn t happened by accident it s happening because we re making critical investments in property tax relief for our communities investments in our schools investments to alleviate the other forces that drive up property taxes investments that are making our communities stronger and fairer and we re being honest with taxpayers we re not going to defeat the decades old if not century old problem of property taxes with gimmicks or in one fell swoop but we are making real progress and moving in the right direction this administration s approach undertaken with your partnership has been to combat directly and consistently the costs that drive property taxes higher in the first place the first budget i signed two years ago began what i pledged would be a ramping up of school funding to meet the needs of both our school districts and our property taxpayers our public schools rank as the very best in the nation in large part because of our commitment to investing in classrooms in every community in our highly talented students and our highly skilled educators and educational support professionals school funding is an investment in our future but just as important school funding is property tax relief let s be absolutely clear every new dollar in school funding is a new dollar of property tax relief every new dollar we provide is a dollar that doesn t have to come out of the pockets of property taxpayers now is no time to let up so our budget proposes keeping us on our upward trajectory with an additional 336 million investment in our k through 12 classrooms for the upcoming school year on thursday i ll visit the bound brook school district as we release our state aid amounts and we ll invest an additional 83 million in pre k allowing us to expand opportunities for an additional 3 000 children funding pre k specifically is directly making our communities more affordable for thousands of young families and it is making communities more attractive to prospective homebuyers in just three years we will have restored nearly 900 million in direct formula aid to our public schools a nearly 11 percent increase in just three years and every penny is property tax relief and through reforms championed by senate president sweeney those new school funding dollars are working more efficiently and effectively our schools benefit and our property taxpayers benefit and because of that our future benefits as we properly fund the school funding formula we know that some districts continue to face challenges so our budget also includes 50 million to stabilize their finances without cutting vital student programs school taxes make up more than half of the average property tax bill in new jersey so there is urgency in our action and as we make up for the years of aid cuts and flat funding that preceded us taxes in more than 250 school districts are stabilizing and as we continue to reinvest that number will grow it bears repeating school funding is property tax relief it is the most aggressive way we can attack the single largest root cause of our high property taxes although we in this building do not set property taxes the decisions we make can relieve the strain they place on our families and seniors that s why i am so proud of the work our administration has undertaken over the past year to seek out hundreds of millions of dollars in health care savings alongside our public workforce i ve said it before our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are the women and men who make our communities our schools and our state function and they too are property taxpayers and when we can work together in partnership to ensure high quality health care for them at a lesser cost to us all it s the best kind of win win and this concept is at the heart of our work to provide chapter 78 relief to our educators and esps and we must deliver for them we are making real progress on health care even with inflationary cost pressures running rampant throughout the health care marketplace overall spending on public employee health care across fiscal 2020 dropped by 300 million more than nine percent but the good news isn t just at the state level for active local government employees enrolled in the state health benefits program premiums decreased 4 3 percent for the 2020 plan year school districts enrolled in the school employees health benefits program saw an even bigger 4 5 percent drop in coverage rates for our educators and staff health care costs continue to be one of the biggest drivers of local and school budget growth and therefore one of the biggest drivers of property taxes lowering health care costs is property tax relief in fiscal year 2021 we aim to reduce budgeted amounts for state paid health care benefits by another 174 million this will be a significant achievement in the face of national trends and the first time in memory that we have year over year over year reductions in the overall cost of health care and we will be more aggressive than ever in directly controlling the costs of health care delivery we will close gaps that incent the use of costly out of network providers or which misclassify certain services so providers can reap a big payday we will no longer tolerate providers who send out big bills for reimbursement because they know the insurance company will settle by just sending a big check in return these seemingly small steps alone can save us literally tens of millions of dollars we re not simply cutting costs we re cutting out the drivers of cost increases while ensuring quality services it is in this same vein that we are so committed to promoting shared services the goal should not be to deliver fewer services or diminished services our goal should be to ensure the high quality services that our people need and expect in a way that is more efficient and effective with the leadership of lieutenant governor oliver and our shared services czars mayors nic platt and jordan glatt we recently passed the milestone of 1 000 shared service agreements this budget will support their work and further our progress so that is why our budget will maintain our 10 million investment to keep bringing local governments and school districts together to share services we are also creating a new grants management office co located in my office here and in our state office in washington to marshal resources and help county and local governments bring home more federal grant dollars to further alleviate the property tax burden one reason why we ve been dead last in returning federal dollars to our state is because we ve never had a whole of government approach to get them that will change and our budget will extend our commitment to direct property tax relief for middle class families through the homestead benefit and for our seniors through the senior freeze and i thank in particular speaker coughlin for his commitment to this in doing each of these things funding our public schools and delivering direct property tax relief providing high quality health benefits to our public employees educators and educational support professionals at a lower cost both to them and to taxpayers and making it not only possible but easier for communities to adopt shared services and better compete for federal grants we are being more effective in combating our property tax crisis than any administration that has come before the two leaders behind me have made many of these efforts their key priorities as have most of you and in partnership we will continue step by step to challenge the property tax crisis that has been atop our state s to do list for well over a generation when we do these things we will continue to make new jersey not only a go to place for business but a come to place we re already competing and winning that s a fact our economy is performing well in large part because we are keeping our promises and making transparent and stable investments the census bureau tracks the creation of what it calls high propensity business applications the newly born businesses it sees as growing into enterprises with employees and payrolls which is an important indicator for future economic growth and one we track closely throughout 2019 high propensity business applications in new jersey grew every quarter the fourth quarter alone grew by 3 4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2018 which had in turn grown by 3 5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2017 and our fourth quarter 2019 growth rate was nearly double that across the rest of the entire northeast new jersey has become more attractive to and supportive of business creation than both massachusetts and new york and we far outpaced the national growth rate of 2 percent this is a strong indicator that businesses see the advantages of new jersey it s a strong indicator that our economy will continue to create jobs in 2020 it s a strong indicator that our policies are working this is why our budget will continue to invest in making new jersey more competitive for businesses in workforce development through jobs nj and in our successful apprenticeship programs to ensure expedited permitting so more private investment such as that from the offshore wind industry can flow into our state to grow jobs and new opportunities and in the work of the commission on science innovation and technology so we can prove ourselves worthy as the heirs of thomas edison and bell labs and fully reclaim our place as the true home of the global innovation economy and let s also acknowledge that our work to deliver property tax relief by investing in our schools and communities also benefits our businesses especially the small businesses in our downtowns and the startups that have outgrown their incubator and are looking to build their permanent homes and at the same time there are large corporations in new jersey that do not provide health benefits to their employees and their families or who offer policies that their employees cannot afford when these families turn to medicaid it s our taxpayers who pick up their health care costs new jersey pays an average of 1 000 per person without any contribution by their employers our budget will require these corporations to pay their fair share through a corporate responsibility fee every page of our budget is filled with investments that will make our state stronger and fairer i could name them all but here are just a few beginning the work of our new office of health care affordability and transparency to lower the costs of health care for millions of our residents and build upon the successful out of network reforms championed by speaker

the garden state guarantee will build upon the already successful model of the community college opportunity grant program and provide the first two years of study at one of our four year public colleges and universities tuition free to thousands of eligible students tomorrow i will visit william paterson university to open a deeper discussion about this new initiative and with the public health challenges we face from the tragedy suffered at wanaque to today s rightful concerns over the coronavirus our budget will continue to invest several million dollars to partner with local health authorities to support infectious disease control i also call once again for you to join me in raising the cost of handgun permits for the first time since 1966 this is not about the 2nd amendment this is about public safety these fees are meant to cover the costs of state police background checks on prospective gun buyers and right now they don t come close to doing so it s still just 2 to get a handgun permit it s still more expensive to buy a dog license that s entirely backwards let s fix this so we can keep guns out of the wrong hands our budget will continue our work fixing nj transit increasing our investment by another 132 million to a record total of nearly 600 million this increase will help train an additional 98 new locomotive engineers fund service enhancements at both newark and new york penn stations and start a new electric bus program among much more it will also protect nj transit s commuters from a fare hike for a third straight year this record investment will dovetail with the mission and values of nj transit s forthcoming ten year strategic and five year capital plans this is an investment in nj transit but it is even more an investment in our commuters and our communities it is an investment in giving new jerseyans the freedom to leave their cars at home and to take our trains and buses and with the federal government s long awaited green lighting of the portal bridge replacement we are finally moving forward in alleviating one of nj transit s commuters other headaches wondering if a cranky obsolete century old bridge is going to hold it together for another day the portal bridge is just one part of a much larger project one new span doesn t in any way eliminate the need for new tunnels under the hudson and it in no way signals our retreat in the fight to get gateway done and by the way it bears repeating that had it not been canceled the arc tunnel would today be open and serving our commuters that ghost continues to haunt us but make no mistake the portal bridge decision is a big victory for our commuters and i thank our federal delegation in congress for their tireless help it is also a big victory for the building trades and it is a big victory for a state whose economic lifeblood can only flow with modern infrastructure by now i bet you thought i was going to get through this speech without mentioning tax incentives but this is too important this is about who we stand with and what we stand for this is about how we create jobs and for whom we create jobs these are our choices are we on the side of protecting taxpayers hard earned money or with the millions of dollars spent with no oversight and too often with no results are we on the side of small businesses and the entrepreneurs women veterans and people of color who want to start a business or do we only welcome the big fish and the well connected are we on the side of communities and residents or do we reward those who ignore them are we on the side of transparency and accountability or do we close our eyes to those gaming the system we should all agree that a targeted program with strong compliance standards is a good thing we should all agree that we need a program whose focus is on expanding our economy not rewarding special interests and we should all agree that just as much as we need strong compliance standards we must have clear annual overall caps in place blank checks are bad policy no family budgets that way neither should we as i ve said countless times most companies are good corporate citizens who play by the rules but some are not we are seeing progress in the name of our taxpayers in getting back some of the millions of dollars we now know were inappropriately awarded the first 11 million of some 500 million being investigated i am committed to not reliving the mistakes of the past the mistakes that put huge tax breaks for the well connected before tax breaks for the middle class and let s be perfectly clear billions given away in open ended corporate tax breaks will be billions we will not have to make our state more affordable for both residents and businesses tax incentives cannot be about rewarding special interests they must be about making our state more competitive creating jobs and growing the next great wave of new jersey based companies period i am pro jobs pro growth and pro accountability that is why i am for reforming a failed incentives system just as i am for reforming our ethics laws to let more light shine in when we reject transparency in any forum bad deals are made and taxpayers are hurt the public needs to see unmistakably that we work for them and not the other way around and i ask you to join me in this cause the goal isn t to win for the sake of politics but to win for the sake of our future that s also an apt way of thinking about our first two years two years speaking to our core value that new jersey is at its strongest when it is at its fairest two years speaking to the need for us to focus not on gimmicks but on long term and sustainable solutions for real property tax relief two years speaking to the need to change the culture of trenton from one that shields the wealthy and special interests to one that secures progress for our entire new jersey family we re doing what no one thought possible we re making real progress against high property taxes restoring new jersey s fiscal standing growing our economy repositioning our state for success and at the same time investing in our future here we are with a record of unmistakable progress on all fronts and with a budget that promises to keep us moving forward thank you all very much may god continue to bless the great state of new jersey and the united states of america
in chapter 5 we reviewed the textbook analysis of how a central bank buys government debt in open market operations to add reserves to the banking system with which commercial banks can then advance loans to their own customers however in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008 the federal reserve and other central banks around the world adopted new tools the term often used to influence economic activity in this chapter we will first elaborate on conventional monetary policy and then explain why it had apparently lost traction after the fall of 2008 we will then summarize some of the major changes to the practice of central banking since the financial crisis although we will focus on the federal reserve much of our commentary is applicable to other central banks before proceeding we should clarify for the reader that most of the discussion in this chapter will be standard with many of the details coming from federal reserve publications however even though it is legitimate to rely on establishment sources to document what they did it is more dubious to take at face value their explanations for why they did it some cynics for example might argue that particular changes in fed policy such as buying not just treasurys but also mortgage backed securities or initiating the payment of interest on bank reserves were implemented in order to benefit particular firms and coalitions with political influence rather than out of concern for the general welfare however it lies outside the scope of the present volume to address the motivations behind the changes described in this chapter federal reserve monetary policy before the 2007 8 crisis in chapter 5 we introduced the mechanics through which a central bank that wished to engage in looser or easier monetary policy could 1 buy assets in so called open market operations and thereby 2 increase commercial bank reserves that would normally 3 result in more commercial bank lending and thus 4 push down market interest rates however in actual practice the federal reserve has historically adopted different targets that are the immediate object of its use of this conventional mechanism another way of stating this is that the fed s policy regime has changed over time for example economists believe that it was sometime in the 1980s that the fed moved away from targeting the total amount of money and or bank reserves and instead began to use its powers to target interest rates specifically from the 1980s until the eve of the 2008 financial crisis the fed s official announcements of policy decisions concerned its target for the so called federal funds rate the federal funds rate is the interest rate that commercial banks charge each other for overnight loans of reserves because of legal reserve requirements commercial banks must hold a certain quantity of reserves which recall consist of either paper currency in the bank vault or electronic deposit balances with the fed itself to back up the outstanding demand deposits held with the bank by its own customers for example with a 10 percent reserve requirement if citibank s customers collectively hold 1 billion in their checking accounts then citibank must hold 100 million in reserves perhaps 30 million in actual paper currency in citibank s vaults and the remaining 70 million in citibank s electronic account balance in the fed s computer system now because commercial banks have a reserve requirement which is enforced at the end of each business day if they make new loans they might need to obtain more reserves in order to satisfy the requirement to continue our example from above if citibank granted 10 million in loans to new borrowers then immediately after crediting the 10 million to their checking accounts but before they spent any of it citibank s new position would be 1 01 billion in outstanding customer checking account balances with 30 million still in the vault and 70 million still on deposit with the fed at the end of the business day to avoid being assessed a penalty citibank would now need to have 101 million in reserves 1 01 billion x 10 101 million but at the moment it only has 100 million 30 million 70 million 100 million being short 1 million in reserves citibank would go out into the federal funds market and borrow overnight 1 million in excess reserves from other commercial banks that have more reserves at that moment than they need to satisfy their own legal reserve requirements the market determined rate of interest quoted on an annualized basis even though the loan would only be for one day on this overnight loan of 1 million would be the federal funds rate to reiterate during the period from the 1980s up until the brewing crisis in 2007 8 when the federal reserve made an announcement it would typically tell the world what it was doing regarding its target for the federal funds rate when the actual federal funds rate in the market was higher than the fed s target the fed would buy more assets injecting new bank reserves into the system and thus push down the fed funds rate on the other hand when the fed raised its target and wanted to push up the actual fed funds rate it would do the opposite it would sell off some of its assets thereby draining bank reserves from the system and since the quantity was now smaller pushing up the interest rate that bankers themselves had to pay to other bankers in order to borrow reserves another old school tool the discount window although the use of open market operations to achieve its desired federal funds rate target was the primary tool that the fed used from the 1980s up through 2008 another power that the fed has held from its very inception is the ability to directly lend to financial institutions through the so called discount window as the fed s website explains when the federal reserve system was established in 1913 lending reserve funds through the discount window was intended as the principal instrument of central banking operations although the window was long ago superseded by open market operations as the most important tool of monetary policy it still plays a complementary role the discount window functions as a safety valve in relieving pressures in reserve markets extensions of credit can help relieve liquidity strains in a depository institution and in the banking system as a whole for the purposes of an introductory text the important thing to note is that when the fed tries to push down interest rates through open market operations the fed is not directly lending new reserves to the banks instead it is paying newly created reserves over to the sellers of financial assets in exchange for their property when those new reserves are deposited into the banking system the recipient banks lend them out to other banks and thereby tend to push down the fed funds rate in contrast when a depository institution uses the discount window it is directly borrowing newly created reserves from the federal reserve itself in order to keep the discount window as a fallback option the fed typically sets the interest rate on its discount window lending called the discount rate above the federal funds rate out with fed funds rate targets in with qe the most obvious change in the conduct of monetary policy since 2008 was the de emphasis on interest rates and the focus on the size and composition of asset purchases specifically investors and the public at large began fretting over what the fed would do with its various rounds of quantitative easing or simply qe note that the federal reserve itself has never officially used this popular term to describe its operations prior to the financial crisis most people probably never thought about and the fed itself certainly didn t emphasize the fact that when the fed cut or raised interest rates it didn t simply turn a dial but instead had to buy or sell assets and thereby create or destroy dollar reserves in the financial system but when the federal funds rate collapsed from 4 percent in late 2007 to just about zero percent by the end of 2008 it was clear that fed officials could no longer announce additional rate cuts to show the world they were helping to be clear many austrian economists would disagree that easier money is the solution to an ailing economy as we explain in chapter 9 in this context soon after the financial crisis struck the fed began announcing not merely its plans for the future path of the federal funds rate but also its intentions for the scale pace and composition of its asset purchases for example in november 2010 the federal open market committee fomc announced its plans for what the financial press would soon dub qe2 to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation over time is at levels consistent with its mandate the committee decided today to expand its holdings of securities the committee will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings in addition the committee intends to purchase a further 600 billion of longer term treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011 a pace of about 75 billion per month when this second round of quantitative easing didn t do the trick the fed in september 2012 announced what would be dubbed qe3 in which it would buy 40 billion in additional mortgage backed securities per month because there was not a set dollar limit on the total plan this program was also dubbed qe infinity by some cynics a few months later in december 2012 the fed announced that it would also begin buying an additional 45 billion per month in longer term treasury securities meaning that qe3 at that point consisted of adding 85 billion in new assets monthly to the fed s balance sheet and thus what were once mechanical considerations kept behind the scenes now became front and center the fed no longer relied merely on interest rate targets to communicate its intentions to the public but now announced detailed descriptions of its planned asset purchases since the federal funds rate had hit rock bottom by late 2008 the subsequent rounds of quantitative easing allowed the fed to show that it hadn t run out of ammunition and could continue to inject money in an attempt to boost spending through a wealth effect and reduced longer term interest rates another major innovation fed begins paying interest on reserves another significant change in fed policy was its announcement in september 2008 that in october it would begin paying interest to commercial banks on the reserve balances that they kept on deposit or parked with the fed because many commentators argue that this new policy was at least partially responsible for the failure of the fed s extraordinary injections of new reserves to lead to a comparable increase in bank lending and consumer price inflation we will cover this topic in detail in chapter 14 for our purposes in the present chapter it is enough to note that the new policy of paying interest on reserves allowed the fed to decouple its asset purchases from its target for the federal funds rate specifically in october of 2008 the fed wanted to among other things calm the panic in the financial sector by buying large quantities of mortgage backed securities which were then considered toxic assets normally such large asset purchases would flood the system with new reserves and push down the federal funds rate but since the fed had not yet wanted the fed funds rate to sink to zero percent it established a floor under the fed funds rate by paying commercial banks interest on the reserves that they kept on deposit with the fed the intuition here is that a commercial bank could always earn a guaranteed return from the fed by keeping its excess reserves parked at the fed rather than lending them to other commercial banks therefore if a commercial bank needed to borrow excess reserves in order to satisfy its reserve requirements it would have to offer at least as much as the prevailing rate that the fed itself was paying on reserve balances at the other end of the cycle when the fed began normalizing its policy stance and finally began raising its target for the federal funds rate in december 2015 it did not do so by selling off some of its assets and thereby draining reserves out of the banking system as the textbook description of monetary policy would have it instead the fed maintained its outstanding stock of assets and caused the fed funds rate to increase by raising the interest rate that it paid to banks on their reserves kept at the fed in this way the fed could raise interest rates without selling off its large holdings of treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities actions that may have jeopardized the still fragile recovery in financial markets to sum up among other implications the new policy begun in october 2008 of paying interest on reserves allowed the fed to decouple its asset purchases from its desired target for the market clearing federal funds rate a timeline of additional tools added to the fed s kit

loans source st louis federal reserve as the table above makes clear the brewing crisis in the housing and credit markets in 2007 8 allowed for an extraordinary increase in the power of the federal reserve this development led the present author to describe then chair of the fed ben bernanke as the fdr of central bankers image were the fed s post crisis asset purchases legal as explained in the previous section since the advent of the financial crisis the federal reserve has drastically increased not merely the amount of assets that it purchases but also the types of assets the figure below illustrates the dramatic expansion and change in composition of the fed s balance sheet image in addition to the profound questions concerning the efficacy and wisdom of the fed s dramatic new role in the economy there is also the stark issue of whether the fed s post crisis actions were legal in order to avoid the obvious invitation to corruption the legislation authorizing the federal reserve put limits on what the u s central bank could buy after all if the people running the new york federal reserve bank could create money electronically with which to buy specific shares of wall street stock there would be vast opportunities for abuse when justifying the new powers that it took after the financial crisis struck fed officials typically appealed to the section of the federal reserve act giving it liberal powers to lend money to financial institutions in practice the fed lent money to newly created limited liability corporations llcs named maiden lane referring to the street in new york s financial district that would then use the money borrowed from the fed to purchase the desired assets see the endnote for an article discussing the dubious legality of this arrangement

nyse hbb today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 kitchen collection completed the closure of its retail operations by december 31 2019 and its results are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented fourth quarter 2019 compared to fourth quarter 2018 continuing operations revenue grew 4 1 to 207 1 million compared to 199 0 million as a result of increased u s consumer and international consumer sales partially offset by a modest decrease in global commercial sales continued progress with the company s strategic growth initiatives led to a significant increase in ecommerce sales and sales of the company s premium or only the best products also grew u s small kitchen appliance industry market sales grew in low single digits while the mass segment in which the hamilton beach and proctor silex brands compete declined moderately and the smaller premium segment increased while the company was pleased that its results outpaced the industry its revenue growth was not as robust as expected due to the ongoing adverse impact of tariffs growth was further dampened by the compressed holiday selling season that resulted from a late thanksgiving despite strong pre season retailer promotions the late holiday ultimately delayed industry and company peak sales by several weeks with the result that retailer reorders anticipated by the company did not materialize the shortened season also reduced store traffic for many retailers resulting in softer than expected sales the company s global commercial revenue decline was primarily due to the adverse impact of tariffs on sales to the u s food service and hospitality industries operating profit increased 45 5 to 25 5 million compared to 17 5 million gross profit increased 8 1 to 44 9 million or 21 7 of revenue compared to 41 6 million or 20 9 the improvements in gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily due to the higher sales volume and the sale of higher priced higher margin products selling general and administrative expenses decreased 19 5 to 19 1 million compared to 23 7 million primarily due to lower advertising and promotion expenses and decreased environmental expense net income from continuing operations increased 53 2 to 19 4 million or 1 43 per diluted share compared to 12 7 million or 0 93 per diluted share full year 2019 compared to full year 2018 continuing operations revenue for the full year decreased 2 7 to 612 8 million compared to 629 7 million due to lower volume across all markets continued progress with the company s strategic growth initiatives helped increase global ecommerce sales by 27 and sales of the company s only the best products grew 7 4 lower u s consumer revenue was attributable to the adverse impact of tariffs fewer low margin placements in the dollar store and warehouse club channels and ongoing reduced foot traffic at certain retailers lower international consumer revenue was due to softness in all markets lower global commercial revenue was due to the adverse impact of tariffs and demand softness in the u s food service and hospitality industries operating profit decreased 3 4 to 36 9 million compared to 38 2 million gross profit decreased 5 8 to 129 5 million or 21 1 of revenue compared to 137 5 million or 21 8 primarily due to the lower sales volume increased inbound freight expenses and unfavorable foreign currency movements selling general and administrative expenses decreased 6 8 to 91 3 million compared to 98 0 million the decrease was primarily attributable to lower environmental advertising and employee related expenses partially offset by a one time charge for a contingent loss related to patent litigation income tax expense on income from continuing operations of 34 4 million was 9 3 million an effective tax rate of 27 1 income tax expense included 2 0 million of deferred tax expense related to a change in judgment regarding valuation allowances recorded

discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations net of tax was 28 6 million in 2019 compared to a loss of 5 4 million in 2018 the 2019 amount included 15 2 million for the estimated costs to terminate lease agreements as a result of the decision to wind down the kitchen collection business all obligations under the kitchen collection revolving line of credit facility were paid in full in accordance with a forbearance agreement with the lender and the facility was terminated on december 3 2019 the company expects the wind down of kitchen collection to continue through the first half of 2020 to facilitate the settlement of remaining liabilities as of december 31 2019 kitchen collection s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by 24 3 million the company expects that once available assets are paid out remaining liabilities will be reversed and reflected as income from discontinued operations likely in the last half of 2020 neither hamilton beach brands holding company

compared to 17 3 million in 2018 while inventory decreased 13 8 million trade receivables increased 25 6 million as a result of the late order pattern in the holiday selling season which shifted the

term shareholder value this investor perspective is designed to assist investors in understanding the company s long term objectives over the next three to five years the strategic initiatives that have been implemented to achieve them the momentum that has been built and continues to build and anticipated future achievements hbbhc believes that growth opportunities for hamilton beach brands hbb are significant over time the history of hbb dates back to 1904 since that time hbb has been a leading innovator and provider of small kitchen appliances for consumer and commercial uses today hbb provides a comprehensive offering of iconic consumer brands ranging from value to luxury across a wide range of price points and product categories hbb s consumer business has historically been focused on north america and more recently has expanded into latin america south america china and india hbb has a strong presence in all of the retail channels where consumers want to buy small kitchen appliances including ecommerce in 2019 the hamilton beach brand continued to hold the number one position in the u s small kitchen appliance industry for brand units sold in both the brick and mortar and ecommerce channels hbb s strategically important global commercial business is a leading small appliance participant globally serving food service and hospitality customers around the world innovation and new product development are deeply ingrained in hbb s culture and are guided by research driven consumer needs for the past three years the company introduced an average of 85 new product platforms per year hbb typically generates approximately 30 of its revenue from products that are less than three years old hbb plans to continue its strong focus on new products as a key strategy to drive revenue growth in the coming years with an increased emphasis on new categories and higher priced products to further strengthen its core business as well as drive growth in new business areas hbb is investing in six strategic initiatives over time these initiatives are expected to significantly enhance hbb s market position and financial performance and thereby increase long term shareholder value hamilton beach brands strategic initiatives establish a leading share of the only the best segment of the small kitchen appliance market enhance the company s leadership position in the ecommerce channel globally expand the company s global commercial leadership position enter new emerging markets enter new categories that leverage the company s strong sourcing and distribution capabilities acquire companies that meet strategic criteria the company believes that its investments in these strategic initiatives will contribute significantly to the achievement of its long term financial objectives hbb s goal is to reach 750 million to 1 billion in annual revenue and 9 to 10 operating profit margin over time hbb expects to generate results within these ranges by increasing revenue and leveraging its current infrastructure the company s objective is to achieve these goals over the next few years however some of the initiatives are more developed while others will take more time to come to fruition and the company may adjust certain initiatives based on changes in the market and competitive environment organic growth of 4 to 5 annually would reach the lower end of the target revenue range in four to five years acquisitions could accelerate the progress and the company is committed to increasing its focus on acquisition opportunities while continuing with a disciplined approach regarding the right fit at the right valuation the operating profit goal would be achieved at a level closer to 1 billion if the company holds gross margin in line with historical levels expanding gross margin by 200 basis points would achieve the goal with revenue closer to 750 million the progress and plans for each strategic initiative are outlined below establish a leading share of the only the best segment of the small kitchen appliance market within the u s small kitchen appliance industry premium or the only the best otb products account for approximately one third of annual sales hbb was not a participant in this part of the industry until 2014 when the company began to build what is now a strong otb portfolio today the company s otb brands include its owned brands of hamilton beach professional which leverages the company s commercial product expertise and weston a provider of field to table and farm to table food preparation equipment and its licensed brands of wolf gourmet countertop appliances and chi premium garment care products in 2019 hbb began selling the bartesian premium cocktail delivery system through an exclusive multi year agreement in 2019 the company s otb revenue grew 7 4 and accounted for 9 of the company s total revenue this followed growth of 40 in 2018 which included the first full year of revenue from the chi line which was launched in late 2017 looking ahead continued growth will be driven by new products and expanded distribution including the ecommerce channel where a high percentage of otb products are purchased hbb plans to enter virtually every meaningful otb category with its existing brands and potentially other brands to further increase its share of this important market over the next five years hbb is pursuing a significant increase in its current share of the otb market by targeting a double digit compound annual growth rate over the next several years enhance the company s leadership position in the ecommerce channel globally the ecommerce channel represents a very strong and fast growing part of the company s business as time constrained and price sensitive consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience of online shopping hbb focused on this channel early and has invested in the infrastructure needed to facilitate online sales and growth today in the u s small kitchen appliance industry hamilton beach is the number one brand in units in the ecommerce channel the company s products generally earn favorable reviews and ratings of four stars and above hbb s global ecommerce sales grew 27 in 2019 and accounted for 25 of total revenue hbb believes it is well positioned to leverage its leading position and capabilities in the ecommerce channel as its growth accelerates additionally sales of commercial appliances through the ecommerce channel while lower as a percentage of revenue compared to consumer products are becoming more significant expand the company s global commercial leadership position hbb is expanding its leading position in the global commercial small appliance market the company s commercial products generally sell at higher prices and higher margins than most of its consumer products since 2010 hbb s global commercial products have achieved a compound annual growth rate of more than 5 the key elements of growth have included a strong experienced team expansion of hbb s high performance blender and mixing product line and further expansion into new categories and price points in 2019 hbb s commercial revenue decreased modestly mostly due to the unfavorable impact of tariffs on the u s business and accounted for 8 of total revenue the international food service business grew in 2019 reflecting the impact of several major wins with restaurant customers hbb believes its global commercial business will return to annual revenue growth rates of greater than 5 moving forward as the company builds on the new business obtained in 2019 and the anticipated closure of some large pending opportunities hbb has increased the resources dedicated to this initiative with a goal to further accelerate the annual growth rate to more than 10 over time in the next few years hbb expects to see particularly strong sales generated by global and regional food service and hotel chains and by emerging chains in the asia pacific region enter new emerging markets hbb has been a leading industry participant in canada and mexico and parts of latin america for many years more recently hbb has expanded selectively into several emerging markets including brazil china and india where consumers have increasing purchasing power and are just beginning to establish brand preferences while expanding into emerging markets can be challenging due to the complexity and differing characteristics of distribution channels and local consumer desires as well as a complex web of agency approvals and voltage differences hbb is taking a thoughtful and targeted approach to capture specific key opportunities additionally hbb is selectively selling into europe the middle east and asia hbb licenses brands in south korea and other markets while hbb s international markets generated a compound annual growth rate of more than 5 for the years 2013 2018 in 2019 the company experienced a modest downturn sales were flat to down in most markets revenue generated in international markets accounted for 24 of total revenue in 2019 hbb expects a return to growth in international revenue in 2020 and believes there is potential to deliver significant international revenue growth in future years focus on the ecommerce channel will support hbb s efforts to increase the role of international sales in its portfolio enter new categories that leverage the company s strong sourcing and distribution capabilities hbb has expanded outside of the traditional small kitchen appliance market where it has identified opportunities to leverage its branding sourcing distribution and ecommerce expertise the ecommerce channel enables hbb to introduce new products quickly and relatively inexpensively and to react on a timely basis to consumer responses to new offerings for example the oral care category has a large and growing presence in the ecommerce channel and hbb introduced a sonic rechargeable toothbrush under the new brightlinetm brand name in 2019 hbb plans to introduce additional categories and products and will invest more in those new categories that gain strong traction this initiative is in its early stages and hbb believes it can deliver significant long term growth acquire companies that meet strategic criteria hbb s target profile for acquisitions includes both consumer and commercial businesses with a competitive position a strong brand or channel presence and the potential to enter new product categories a bolt on acquisition with revenue in the 50 million to 100 million range or potentially two or three smaller acquisitions totaling up to that range could accelerate hbb s progress in achieving its long term revenue objectives hbb is disciplined and seeks acquisitions that are value creating and accretive hbb believes in investing for the long term and has made significant commitments to people products and processes to support the strategic initiatives many of the initiatives have gained strong traction and have generated above market revenue growth hbb expects to increase returns over the next several years as the initiatives achieve higher levels of maturity and the company focuses on its growing brand portfolio introduces new products expands distribution channels and leverages its current cost structure a low debt level positions the company for many forms of investing in growth hbb is an asset light business with a relatively low level of capital investment and the potential to generate strong free cash flow and strong return on total capital employed which has generally been high relative to industry standards the company plans to continue its long standing focus on a strong balance sheet financial flexibility and historically strong cash flow generation as it works to build long term shareholder value conference call the company will conduct an earnings conference call and webcast on thursday

summary china s growing role in international finance has remained obscure mostly due to a lack of data and transparency the authors research based on a comprehensive new data set reveals that between 1949 and 2017 the state and its subsidiaries lent about 1 5 trillion to more than 150 countries across the globe much of which has been hidden from public view they found that china tends to lend at market terms meaning at interest rates that are close to those in private capital markets rather than the concessional rates offered by other official entities such as the world bank or imf and their analysis found that 50 of china s loans to developing countries go unreported which distorts the views of the official and private sectors in three material ways 1 official surveillance work is hampered when parts of a country s debt are unknown 2 private sectors will misprice debt contracts such as sovereign bonds if they fail to grasp the true scope of a government s debts a problem that s compounded by the collateral clauses in many chinese official loans meaning that china will get preferential treatment when it comes to repayments and 3 forecasters of global economic activity are missing an important swing factor influencing aggregate global demand

company has posted its fiscal fourth quarter 2019 earnings release and supplemental financial information related to the results on its website at www redrobin com in the investor relations section now i would like to turn the call over to red robin s ceo paul murphy paul j b murphy president and chief executive officer good afternoon and thank you for being with us today i m joined by lynn schweinfurth our chief financial officer who will review our quarterly financial results and annual guidance let me begin by briefly addressing q4 within the context of our strengthening business we were encouraged to see our second consecutive quarter of positive comparable restaurant revenue as anticipated we achieved this top line performance while intentionally unwinding discounting and with reduced year over year marketing spend you may recall that we allocated more of our annual marketing spend to the third quarter in 2019 when we launched our new omnichannel creative campaign you can see from our q4 results that the campaign continues to resonate and drive sales momentum importantly the sales momentum has continued into 2020 we also believe our core business and turnaround process is taking shape as evidenced by improvements in key performance indicators such as staffing retention ticket times and ultimately our guest satisfaction scores 2019 was a period of diagnosis change and setting the foundation in 2020 we are executing our 4 point plan to accelerate our turnaround and drive long term value creation for all constituents the elements of this plan are as follows one recapturing the sole of the red robin brand two delivering the brand promise three telling our story to reinforce emotional connections and core brand equities and four accelerating profitable growth recapturing the soul of our brand is about clarifying red robin s positioning and ensuring that our guest experience aligns with why guests choose red robin for their meal occasion what we learned in q4 through our research is that our guests defined a red robin experience through four criteria that enable them to create memorable moments of connection these are one the flavor of americana on the menu through gourmet burgers and other favorites two the family friendly and playful atmosphere that connects people not only around the table but also with team members three the spirit of sharing brought to life by our bottomless steak fries towering onion rings and more recently in test markets with donatos pizza and four engaged service that offers the gift of time where guests have the ability to determine their pace of experience during their red robin visit importantly these are all actionable items which we are emphasizing to our general managers and field leadership must be delivered to our guests when these items are executed consistently at a high level our guests become our strongest brand advocates and in turn increase their frequency of dining at red robin in delivering the brand promise and moments of connection we are implementing a new service model in 2020 which is designed to improve the functionality of our service while elevating our hospitality sams the handheld pos terminals are a foundational element of the new service model in combination with the new service model we are receiving positive feedback from our operators in test locations including a reduction in ticket times and increasing our top line sales performance turning to menu rationalization we believe that by rationalizing our menu size we can improve both ordering experience and overall guest satisfaction through reduced ticket times and consistent high quality execution in the heart of the house our investments in technology are critical to us connecting with our guests both in and outside of our restaurants and strengthening our ability to leverage red robin royalty which is already one of the largest loyalty programs in casual dining with more than nine million members in q4 we began testing marketing automation as part of our loyalty platform upgrade initiative with email offers targeted by visit frequency and purchase behavior initial results are very encouraging and we continue to optimize the effectiveness and profitability of this functionality through testing finally restaurant manager staffing remains above 98 general manager manager and hourly turnover are consistently trending downwards and both general manager and manager turnover are now exceeding our best in class target benchmarks these metrics correlate positively to guest satisfaction as retention and staffing improves guest satisfaction rises telling our story to reinforce emotional connections and core brand equities the third part of our plan is about aligning our messaging with the brand in q3 last year we launched the all the fulls omnichannel campaign which is driving guest engagement and an emotional connection with red robin as it showcases americana aspect of our menu coupled with our family friendly and playful atmosphere previous to this campaign our message was largely price driven yet in research guests told us it was moments of connection that activated their use of red robin not just price when we corrected this messaging misalignment red robin scored as one of the top two brands for search engagement volume across all casual dining during our q4 media flight notably social engagement doubled year over year with increased positive sentiment and therefore we are allocating increased resources to social and digital channels in 2020 accelerating profitable sales growth represents the fourth and final part of our plan we will accomplish this through several means beginning with growing our off premise business including to go catering third party marketplaces with delivery services and red robin delivery red robin delivery was rolled out nationally in january to the majority of our company operated restaurants guests ordered directly from red robin but the deliveries outsourced to a third party and this offers us three advantages one the economics are favorable two we retain guest data and three guests can use the red robin royalty program which is particularly important as 30 of our business is driven through the loyalty program continued growth of our off premise business in the future will be supported by our new digital platform which we believe will enhance the guest ordering experience and order completion rates along with other initiatives and process focused on improving our to go and delivery execution within the restaurants we are also enhancing our menu with the introduction of donatos pizza to our system over the next three years we believe this menu enhancement will drive frequency appetizer sales and delivery as has been successfully demonstrated in our test markets and finally we are developing a new restaurant prototype to drive profitable development in the future we plan to open our first restaurant utilizing this new prototype design in early 2021 the new prototype will further inform our restaurant refreshes going forward as well before i turn over to lynn i want to comment on our recent announcement appointing allison page to our board of directors allison is an accomplished industry executive and currently serves as the co founder and president of sevenrooms she brings a unique consumer lens to revolutionizing the restaurant guest experience and we look forward to benefiting from allison s expertise finally we are laser focused on maximizing value for all shareholders we have identified significant and achievable opportunities have a clear path forward and our turnaround is already in process and building our top line momentum is continuing our operational metrics are rising our creative campaign is working and we have proven and tested profitable sales catalysts to positively impact our business with that i ll turn the call over to lynn lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you paul and good afternoon everyone as we turn around our performance and invest in the business we are encouraged by our improving sales trajectory in the fourth quarter of 2019 comparable restaurant revenues increased 1 3 which as paul mentioned marked our second consecutive quarter of positive comparable sales growth the q4 improvement was driven by a 4 7 increase in average check partially offset by a 3 4 decline in guest traffic overall pricing increased 1 8 while we also realized an additional 1 8 increase from our decision to lower discounting mix increased by 1 1 driven by our menu and promotional strategies put in place this year resulting in lower tavern mix and higher gourmet and finest mix q4 total company revenues decreased 1 2 to 302 9 million down 3 8 million from a year ago driven primarily from 2018 fewer restaurants due to closures during 2019 dine in sales were down 3 8 partially offset by off premise sales growth off premise sales growth continues to be meaningful and rose 26 9 in q4 representing 13 9 of total food and beverage sales catering continues to be an important growing sales category with material long term potential delivering approximately 12 growth in the fourth quarter over the same quarter in 2018 our sales team is focusing on among other things driving business to business national accounts supporting recurring catering occasions and refining our core catering menu including expanding our carbonated beverage offerings q4 restaurant level operating profit as a percentage of restaurant revenue was 18 9 down 50 basis points versus a year ago driven by the following factors cost of sales of 23 improved by 60 basis points compared to a year ago and improved sequentially compared to q3 as anticipated primarily driven by lower pork and steak fry cost partially offset by unfavorable ground beef costs restaurant labor costs of 34 5 were favorable 20 basis points versus a year ago due primarily to lower group insurance costs in q4 partially offset by higher average wage rates of approximately 5 and higher manager staffing levels within the restaurants other operating costs increased 110 basis points to 14 7 due primarily to third party delivery commissions driven by higher delivery sales and higher restaurant technology costs compared to a favorable adjustment in q4 2018 occupancy costs increased 20 basis points to 8 9 due primarily to higher general liability costs in q4 2019 partially offset by decreases in rent due to fewer company owned restaurant locations since the fourth quarter of 2018 general and administrative costs increased 40 basis points to 6 4 of total revenues driven primarily by increased team member salaries and benefits partially offset by decreases in miscellaneous corporate expenses selling expenses decreased 30 basis points to 5 4 of total revenues due primarily to a decrease in local media spend due in part to higher spending in q3 to support the launch of our new creative campaign net interest expense and other was 0 9 million lower versus the prior year due primarily to a higher gain in our deferred compensation plan assets compared to the same period a year ago as well as a reduction in interest expense our weighted average interest rate was 5 1 the quarter over quarter unfavorable change in the effective tax rate is due primarily to gaap requirements for calculating taxes on a quarterly basis this q4 expense is in the range of where we expect it to be based on the tax benefit we booked q3 year to date and where we expected our full year tax benefit to be during the quarter we recognized net other charges of 4 1 million which included charges of 1 4 million related to restaurant closures and refranchising costs 1 million related to asset impairments 0 8 million in board and stockholder matter costs 0 5 million in executive transition and severance costs and 0 4 million in executive retention costs q4 adjusted ebitda was 26 7 million as compared to 28 4 million in q4 2018 and q4 adjusted loss per diluted share was 0 36 as compared to adjusted earnings per diluted share of 0 43 in q4 2018 now turning to the balance sheet we invested 24 2 million in capex in q4 which was primarily related to investments in information technology facilities improvements and costs related to our rollout of donatos in the fourth quarter we completed the rollout of handheld pos terminals that along with headsets will enable our team members to deliver an even better guest experience fundamental to the rollout of our service model we ended the quarter with 30 million in cash and cash equivalents our lease adjusted leverage ratio was 4 72 times and we were in compliance with all debt covenants during the quarter we drew 18 million on our revolving credit facility resulting in a quarter end outstanding debt balance of 206 million in addition to letters of credit outstanding of 7 5 million in early january we refinanced our revolving debt agreement with our lenders we now have in place a 5 year 300 million credit facility which provides ample liquidity through early 2025 to fund our operational and strategic capital needs and provides capital allocation flexibility and surety our capital allocation strategy focuses on disciplined investment in growth projects including donatos reinvestment in maintaining our restaurants and infrastructure paying down debt and return of capital to our stockholders through increased share repurchases we intend to use at least 50 of our free cash flow to delever our balance sheet and return capital to stockholders by increasing share repurchases under our existing 75 million authorization during the fourth quarter we bought back approximately 34 800 shares for a total of approximately 1 million turning to our real estate portfolio in the third quarter and during our earnings call we announced the strategic decision to exit company operations in canada as a result during the fourth quarter we closed our five remaining restaurants in the edmonton area and refranchised the remaining 12 restaurants in british columbia to an experienced restaurant operator in 2019 the canada restaurants generated 38 6 million in restaurant revenues and 0 5 million in restaurant level operating profit we continue to assess our restaurant portfolio and are continuing to develop a refined restaurant prototype that optimizes both the dine in and off premise restaurant experience for future development and restaurant refreshes and remodels we have included our guidance for 2020 as published in our earnings release this afternoon we expect to commit between 50 million and 60 million to capex spend in 2020 and expect adjusted ebitda of at least 101 million flat to 2019 consistent with what we announced at the icr investor conference in january we expect low single digit positive comparable restaurant revenue growth in 2020 we further expect that incremental restaurant level operating profit will be offset by preopening expenses marketing and project expenses associated with our growth initiatives before i conclude i d like to take a moment to thank our red robin team in the restaurants and at the restaurant support center for their significant contributions toward the improvements we are seeing in our business as we invest in and build a sustainable long term foundation to create value for our stockholders with that i will turn the call back over to paul paul j b murphy president and chief executive officer thank you lynn to conclude i m even more encouraged now than when i first joined red robin about the company s potential our passion to succeed is contagious across the restaurant support center and in the restaurants and i know that our remaining focused on initiatives i have articulated we can transform the company accelerate growth and maximize value for shareholders the early indicators are positive and we are confident in our ability to deliver the plan thank you with that we would be happy to take your questions questions and answers operator our first questions come from the line of alex slagle with jefferies please proceed with your questions alex slagle jefferies analyst thank you a question on donatos and as you ve continued to test there i m wondering how the operators have responded i imagine it s operationally fairly straightforward and also could you remind us the equipment upgrades needed paul j b murphy president and chief executive officer well so far the operators have responded extremely well in fact we just had our general manager conference and at that conference every general manager actually had the opportunity to get their hands dirty and make a pizza and cook it to the oven and actually get to eat it after they made their own pizza so the enthusiasm is high for it the general managers that already have it in their locations very bullish they like the results that they re seeing from a top line and bottom line in their locations and they were great ambassadors for at the general manager conference to the other general managers so we re excited to begin that rollout which is really going to be in just the next couple of weeks beginning here in the colorado market i m going to turn it over to lynn for the equipment side of it lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer okay and we will be incorporating into our kitchens a pizza then in a make station and moving around some other parts of our kitchen to accommodate the implementation of donatos the capital spend is estimated at 145 000 per restaurant and we also expect to incur about 20 000 in preopening expense per restaurant alex slagle jefferies analyst okay and in your initial test have you seen any cannibalization to speak of and if there s anything in terms of channel mix whether it s dine in or delivery where you re seeing something different lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer yes alex i ll start and then paul if you d like to chime in we have seen the donatos sales to be highly incremental and we do see a sku of delivery orders but we also see dine in sales improving as well including as an appetizer in the restaurant paul j b murphy president and chief executive officer no we alex we ve been very pleased with the certainly the top line result we re seeing that it s driving transactions into the restaurants there s a high degree of incrementality to it and we see it as lynn mentioned is fitting very well into the delivery side of the business and we re seeing it used very much as an appetizer which we love from a the spirit of sharing that we ve seen is one of the criteria that gests say that the reason they use the brand from a cannibalization it s been extremely minimal and we re pleased so far with the results that obviously we ve committed to the rollout alex slagle jefferies analyst thanks long operator our next questions come from the line of gregory francfort of bank of america please proceed with your question gregory francfort bank of america analyst hey guys thanks thanks for the questions i had two the first is just on the to go mix where do you envision that going and kind of how long do you think it will get there any sort of expectations on the longer term plan around that front lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer our current to go percent of sales is well it represents about 6 7 of our sales today we do expect that number to grow i m not sure we re prepared to provide a target today but we have actually dialed back some of our marketing around to go as we were rolling out other initiatives and really stabilizing the business in 2019 gregory francfort bank of america analyst got it and then just the other question i have was just on labor and i think you had said in the prepared remarks you re seeing wage rates up about 5 and i think you ve also been investing in labor hours but the labor cost as a percent of sales was down year over year can you maybe talk about what are the biggest deltas of that is that anything on maybe health insurance or is it just kind of efficiencies you re finding kind of what are the biggest drivers lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and as you mentioned we are experiencing about 5 of wage rate inflation part of the benefits we saw that helped to offset that number included lower group insurance costs and we also believe just having higher staffing levels in the restaurants are also helping turnover at the hourly level which also reduces related training gregory francfort bank of america analyst thank you very much operator our next questions come from the line of chris o cull of stifel please proceed with your questions chris o cull stifel analyst thanks um could you guys describe the donatos test maybe how many locations had to test for a year or more and what regions of the country are had to test paul j b murphy president and chief executive officer yes we ve had about 25 locations that have been in test the regions that have been over a year have been on the east coast in the north carolina raleigh area and then in the phoenix area that was purposeful just to make sure that frankly we weren t testing in donatos backyard certainly wanted to make sure that the donatos pizza resonated and would perform in areas that it might have a little bit less brand awareness so we re very pleased to be rolling over to see the the mix sustaining and that we re just we re excited about the impact both as i mentioned earlier both the top line of about a 3 5 traffic lift and the influence on the average check chris o cull stifel analyst okay great and then just a follow up lynn if you include the investments in the service model rollout and the donatos introduction do you expect restaurant margin to be flat for the year and also do you expect the timing of the investments to have any kind of outsized impact on margins or restaurant margin in any one quarter lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think we believe restaurant level margins can be actually a little bit better year over year there are a few moving pieces to that one is we did close 30 restaurants or refranchised a total of 30 restaurants last year so having those stores out of the system do help just overall margins from that standpoint we also believe it or not from a cost of sales perspective we ve been able to lock in and we expect our fixed contracts pricing lower waste and again the store closures i mentioned to offset the higher costs we re seeing in our ground beef and our bacon so we will see pressures on our labor and on our other operating expenses but going back to the closures that i mentioned initially we will see a benefit on the occupancy expense line as well chris o cull stifel analyst should we expect any kind of variation or volatility in the margin performance in any one quarter lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer i think there may be some pressures in the first two quarters of the year and that has to do with some of our initiative rollouts that we ve been talking about primarily donatos and then as we start to roll out the new service model in the middle part of the year we ll see some effect associated with that chris o cull stifel analyst great thanks guys operator our next questions come from the line of brian vaccaro of raymond james please proceed with your questions brian vaccaro raymond james analyst thanks and good evening i just wanted to circle back the press release talked about the quarter to date trends and characterize it as the momentum has continued and i know you usually don t get too specific but hoping you might be a little bit this quarter given some of the unique dynamics that you saw in the fourth quarter on the unwind of the discounts which i assume negatively impacted traffic so would you be willing to be a little more specific on what you re seeing quarter to date either from a comp or traffic perspective paul j b murphy president and chief executive officer i think the only thing i would say as i mentioned in my remarks that the momentum has continued and we re pleased with how the results have responded to the initiatives that we put in place in terms of things that we re doing against the operating model and the overall operations of the company so i think please is a word that shows i have a high degree of confidence in where we re going brian vaccaro raymond james analyst all right fair enough and on the guidance lynn i m curious what have you embedded in terms of g a and i know there are some investments in the initiatives and then some savings that i think are offsetting that can you walk through some of the details within that lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i ll probably keep my comments a little bit more general but we do believe that investments and initiatives inflation and variable based compensation will be offset by savings initiatives within the corporate structure brian vaccaro raymond james analyst thank you operator our next questions come from the line of gregory francfort of bank of america please proceed with your question gregory francfort bank of america analyst hey guys i just had an extra follow up i know you talked about the margin benefits next year of some of the closures and refranchising you guys have done can you maybe help quantify either what the margins were on those stores or what the margin benefit will be from sort of taking those out of the base that would be helpful lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i m not sure we re prepared to actually quote a number but i will tell you that as you piece together some of the disclosures we made over 2019 we specifically provided numbers associated with the restaurant closures as we move throughout the year gregory francfort bank of america analyst okay great thank you operator our next questions come from the line of chris o cull of stifel please proceed with your question chris o cull stifel analyst yes i may have missed this and i apologize if i did but did you see the donatos agreement is that a licensing arrangement that you have with donatos and so what s the rate or duration of the agreement paul j b murphy president and chief executive officer yes it is a licensing agreement but we re not right at this moment prepared to give the rate on it as for duration i would have to refer to lynn on that lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s certainly a multiple year agreement and it really takes the form of kind of a more traditional franchise agreement but we are unable to disclose the financial terms related to that agreement chris o cull stifel analyst okay ok thanks operator our next question comes from the line of jon tower of wells fargo please proceed with your question jon tower wells fargo analyst great thanks just a couple for me first and i apologize if i missed this but i was curious if you had provided the cadence for how we should think about the donatos rollout especially the impact on the preopening line related to the ovens being pushed to the stores and then secondarily when you were testing this product what was the competitive response you were seeing in the markets and what have you seen to date when you do advertise this in markets lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer okay well there were a few questions thrown out there so maybe let me start with your first question on the cadence of the implementation of donatos we ve begun to roll out donatos in the colorado area generally so that has begun in the past two weeks and then we ll complete the rollout by early in the fourth quarter jon tower wells fargo analyst okay so in terms of thinking of preopening from a dollar standpoint can you help us is it going to be front half weighted or back half is there a way to frame it lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i m just kind of looking at my schedule here again it s a little bit lighter in the first quarter because we ve just begun to roll out donatos and then it gets to be fairly consistent in the following three quarters jon tower wells fargo analyst okay and in terms of competitive response paul j b murphy president and chief executive officer this is paul we really haven t seen any we positioned as premium and really has been no noticeable competitor response either in the phoenix market or in north carolina we re not haven t noticed anything jon tower wells fargo analyst okay great thank you operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session i will now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks paul j b murphy president and chief executive officer yes thank you for attending we appreciate the questions and appreciate you dialing into the call today and look forward to the q1 call thank you very much operator duration 36 minutes call participants paul j b murphy president and chief executive officer lynn schweinfurth executive vice president and chief financial officer

and alarm products tracking devices and monitoring service revenues this decrease was partially offset by higher volumes for our oem and factory authorized dealer installer products the segment s gross margin declined due to a reduction in sales volume and adverse sales mix stoneridge brazil s adjusted operating margin decreased to 3 5 due to a lower gross margin which was partially offset by lower sg a costs as a percentage of sales degaynor continued we believe the actions we executed in 2019 positioned each of our segments for continued long term success by divesting our non core products rationalizing our manufacturing footprint and investing in strategically differentiated products and capabilities control devices is increasingly well positioned to outpace our underlying markets in electronics we expect that headwinds in commercial vehicle end markets will temper revenue growth in 2020 before the ramp up of several large programs at the end of the year and into 2021 considering our additional mirroreye awards in 2019 as well as the potential for significant take rate improvement we are planning for continued and increased investment to support those awards in 2020 in 2020 the integration of stoneridge brazil into the global electronics strategy will continue with expanded regionalized product development and the ramp up of oem awards overall we will continue to focus our resources on the areas of largest opportunity for the company and drive long term value creation for our shareholders cash and debt balances as of december 31 2019 stoneridge had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling 69 4 million total debt as of december 31 2019 was 129 1 million total debt less cash and cash equivalents yields a current net debt to trailing twelve month adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 0 7x 2020 outlook the company announced 2020 sales guidance of 750 0 770 0 million bob krakowiak chief financial officer commented we are expecting reduced 2020 revenue relative to 2019 excluding the impact of divested product lines with midpoint revenue guidance of 760 0 million driven primarily by reduced end market production forecasts and the continued ramp down of our legacy shift by wire programs we have included a modest amount of mirroreye retrofit revenue in our guidance and will continue to evaluate our assumptions as the year progresses our 2020 revenue guidance considers the fact that divested product lines contributed approximately 37 4 million to sales in 2019 moving forward we expect that the impact of new program launches will drive significant growth in 2021 and have updated our 2021 targeted revenue to reflect a growth rate of approximately 12 relative to 2020 guidance further the company announced guidance for 2020 adjusted gross margin of 28 0 29 0 adjusted operating margin of 5 0 6 0 and adjusted ebitda margin of 9 0 10 0 the company announced adjusted earnings per share guidance of 0 95 1 15 and an effective tax rate of 20 0 25 0 krakowiak continued with respect to adjusted earnings per share for comparison purposes the divested product lines reduce eps in 2020 by approximately 0 09 in 2020 we are expecting 8 to 12 million of incremental operational improvements that will be partially offset by on going investment in resources to support multiple future program launches and continued new product development finally we anticipate our effective tax rate in 2020 to be 20 to 25 compared to 8 4 in 2019 which reduces eps by approximately 0 23 based on the midpoint of our guided tax rate in consideration of the impact of divested product lines reduced revenue due primarily to externalities operational improvements and incremental investment to support future growth as well as the increased tax rate we are expecting a midpoint adjusted eps of 1 05 in 2020 share repurchase program krakowiak commented our expectations are for continued strong growth due in part to increasingly optimistic views related to the penetration rate of oem mirroreye programs as well as significant opportunities for margin expansion because of these strong expectations the company s board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program for up to 50 million over the next 18 months this is in addition to the 50 million share repurchase authorization we announced late in 2018 we believe that executing share repurchases is a prudent way to drive value for our shareholders in addition to the share repurchase program we will continue to evaluate opportunities to put our capital to use through organic or inorganic investments the company s common shares may be repurchased from time to time at prevailing prices subject to market conditions common share price and other considerations the repurchases may be made from time to time in either open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions no assurance can be given as to the times when the common shares will be repurchased or to whether and to what extent the common share program repurchase will be consummated conference call on the web a live internet broadcast of stoneridge s conference call regarding 2019 fourth quarter and full

by david randall and megan davies new york reuters as fears about the coronavirus catch up to u s markets investors are watching closely to see if the outbreak freezes global supply chains and spreads far enough to be called a pandemic italy south korea and iran reported sharp rises in coronavirus cases on monday as the virus reach continued to spread the world health organization said on monday that the virus has pandemic potential although it was premature to declare that level of severity yet u s stocks slid more than 3 while treasury yields tumbled and the yield curve inversion deepened a sign that signals potential recession the smart money is paying attention and positioning for that particular word pandemic to drop said wouter jongbloed head of political risk analysis exante data the fear right now is focused on supply chains if the who does feel the pressure to use the p word then those supply chain fears will race to the front if the virus is eventually labeled as a pandemic it would sweep fear into consumers and could impact spending said andrew richman managing director of fixed income strategies at suntrust advisory services in jupiter florida that could add another dimension to the economic damage that the virus has already wrought from the perspective of the consumer i think it would change things said richman i think you would see another fear induced leg down in the equities market already companies such as iphone giant apple inc nasdaq have warned that supply chain disruptions could lead to short term product delays any further spread of the virus will likely exacerbate those problems and hurt demand said eric marshall a portfolio manager at hodges capital the market has been too complacent with how it was pricing in those risks he said we expect to see extended impacts on the supply chain that could slow economic growth overall downside risk analysts cautioned that a dip in the yield of benchmark 10 year treasuries yields move inversely to prices below its record low of 1 32 touched in 2016 would likely exacerbate the stock market sell off this isn t just an issue of economic fundamentals there is a lot of fear in the market now said jim paulsen chief investment strategist at the leuthold group a break in new lows for treasury yields would brings up a whole new host of fears of what does the bond market know that the stock market doesn t a continued sell off in equities while the bond market continues to rally would also put an end to a synchronicated rally that had pushed both risk on assets like u s stocks and typical safe havens like the dollar and treasuries all up by 3 or more this year especially in the bond market the fear of this becoming more pandemic in nature has really spread said charlie ripley senior investment strategist for allianz de investment management as volatility in the equity market has started to pick up it s possible that we are seeing a divergence from what we were seeing over the previous four weeks when both equities and bonds rallied he said financial markets on monday ratcheted up bets the u s federal reserve will be pressed to cut interest rates to cushion a feared hit to economic growth from the spread of the coronavirus jeff grills head of emerging markets debt at aegon asset management cautioned that further stimulus measures by global central banks may not ease concerns about the impact of the virus on the supply chain pumping liquidity into the system does a lot to support financial markets but doesn t encourage people to leave their houses and go to work or spend money grills said
as the coronavirus outbreak enters a potentially dangerous new phase with cases widening in europe and expected to spread in the united states economists have begun to raise their estimates for the risk of a global recession and fallout to the american economy economists say the stock market sell off in recent days reflects a reassessment of the likely magnitude of the hit to corporate earnings in the virus wake suggesting the economic pain could last longer and the recovery may not be as swift as initially thought advertisement businesses of all kinds in a lot of places being impaired really me skeptical that this is something that would fade quickly and from which we would recover quickly said carl tannenbaum chief economist at northern trust in chicago and that realization is now cascading through both to investors and to policymakers that this is a situation that is more serious than initially thought many american companies rely on overseas sales and production in china for a significant share of their revenue and profits and a growing number of firms including apple starbucks and the chipmaker qualcomm have lowered their earnings guidance in recent days tannenbaum now sees the federal reserve cutting interest rates by a quarter of a point in april just a few weeks ago he and many other analysts expected the central bank would stand pat on rates for the rest of the year advertisement fed officials aren t sounding alarm bells yet but say they re closely monitoring the situation and while they don t want to react to volatile swings in financial markets deepening losses in stocks could undercut consumer confidence which in turn could cause a retrenchment in spending and push the economy into recession oil prices treasury yields and stock indexes all have sunk this week the dow lost ground for a fifth straight session wednesday and is now down more than 8 from a week ago the equity market is central to the u s economy said mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics noting that the large baby boom population is particularly susceptible to a market downturn because they have much of their nest egg in it advertisement zandi considered the rapid spread of the virus in italy a major turning point and after tuesday s warning from the u s centers for disease control and prevention that infections were bound to increase in the united states he raised the odds of a global recession to 50 up from just 20 last week if it goes to a pandemic then i think the economy is in recession he said the world health organization hasn t yet classified the outbreak as a pandemic as of late wednesday its daily tracking reported more than 81 000 confirmed cases in more than 36 countries with the death toll exceeding 2 750 the vast majority in china the rate of increase in cases is now fastest outside of china in fact china where the covid 19 virus was first detected in december has seen a steady decline in reports of new infections in recent days and key parts of the chinese economy which had been in virtual lockdown have picked up notably as many operations have resumed advertisement but even as things look better in china a surge of new cases in south korea italy and iran has sparked fears that the economic impact will only widen as other countries and the companies that operate there adopt similarly stringent responses to keep the virus in check such as travel restrictions and temporary closures of factories and businesses in the face of heightened uncertainties some companies are taking more extreme measures nestle this week told all of its 291 000 employees worldwide to hold off on business travel until the middle of next month even before the virus outbreak the global economy was smarting from president trump s trade wars uncertainties about brexit and rising tensions in south america and the middle east advertisement now it looks like several major economies japan germany italy south korea could slide into a technical recession defined as two consecutive quarters of negative output fed officials seemed unruffled by the stock market declines or that the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note fell to an all time low tuesday as investors fled riskier assets for the safety of u s government bonds fed vice chair richard h clarida speaking at an economic conference in washington on tuesday afternoon said that it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook advertisement clarida added that the u s economy and the central bank s current monetary policy were both in a good place essentially repeating public comments made by fed chair jerome h powell two weeks ago trump s chief economic advisor larry kudlow has insisted that even if the rest of the world tumbled into recession the u s could remain an island of prosperity right here we re doing awfully well now he said on cnbc on tuesday as stocks were rapidly falling advertisement we have contained this he said i won t say airtight but it s pretty close to airtight as of wednesday there were at least 60 confirmed cases in the u s with no deaths trump who returned wednesday from a trip to india appeared frustrated by the increased concern at home and sought to reassure americans in an evening news conference in a tweet earlier wednesday he praised his administration s response to the virus and lashed out at the news media for making the coronavirus look as bad as possible including panicking markets advertisement trump has frequently touted the stock market gains under his watch something that he sees as a validation of his successful stewardship of the economy ahead of the november election u s job growth in particular has held up very well and the fed s low interest rates have given a boost to the housing market and are helping household balance sheets at the same time corporate debts are high manufacturing remains in recession and business investment is sluggish analysts say it s possible the u s could skirt a recession in a global downturn but it ll be close advertisement research firm oxford economics this week also revised its outlook writing that the economic impact to the u s and global economy was believed to be mostly contained last week but rising volatility plunging stock prices and a strengthening dollar will likely exacerbate the economic shock on the u s economy even if the world avoids a coronavirus pandemic oxford economics said the u s economy will barely be able to stay above water in the first quarter and that growth for the year as a whole was likely to come in at a subpar rate of 1 5 one of the biggest threats is interruptions in global supply chains the network of manufacturers vendors distributors and transporters needed to get goods from factories to customers advertisement despite kudlow s assertion that there s no supply disruptions out there yet many companies and analysts in various industries can attest otherwise ipc an electronics industry trade group said this week that manufacturers were already hurting and surveys indicate they are expecting on average product shipment delays of at least five weeks said john mitchell ipc s president and chief executive the delays will likely have ripple effects for the rest of the year

2019 was 179 2 million up 25 4 year over year and gross margin was 66 4 down 500 basis points compared with 71 4 in the fourth quarter of 2018 the contraction in gross margin was primarily driven by amortization related to our recent acquisition of reverb and our consolidated ad platform etsy ads total operating expenses were 154 1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019 up 35 9 year over year the increase in operating expenses was driven primarily by investments in brand marketing related to our global holiday campaign and decreases in the amount of employee related costs capitalized in 2019

ebitda a non gaap financial measure that represents our net income adjusted to exclude interest and other non operating expense net benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense foreign exchange gain loss acquisition related expenses non ordinary course disputes and restructuring and other exit costs income a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure follows we have included adjusted ebitda in this press release because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends allocate internal resources prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and long term operating plans determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more in our platform we believe that adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for period to period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain non cash items and certain variable charges adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect other non operating expenses net of other non operating income including net interest expense adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of foreign exchange gain loss adjusted ebitda does not reflect acquisition related expenses adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of non ordinary course disputes adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of restructuring and other exit costs income and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net income and our other gaap results reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda unaudited three months ended

reconciliation detail on the normalizing adjustments for the full year 2019 stoneridge reported gross profit of 213 7 million and adjusted gross profit of 219 9 million 26 5 of adjusted sales 2019 operating income was 71 3 million and adjusted operating income was 48 0 million 5 8 of adjusted sales 2019 adjusted ebitda was 80 3 million 9 7 of sales jon degaynor president and chief executive officer commented we experienced a challenging fourth quarter primarily as a result of non recurring events such as the general motors strike and incremental facility closure costs as well as inefficiencies in one of our plants it is important to place our short term performance in the context of the strides we have made in positioning stoneridge for the future we accelerated our transformation of the company in 2019 by rationalizing our product portfolio optimizing our manufacturing footprint and investing in significant new programs that will drive long term profitable growth most importantly we continued to transition our investments into advanced technologies and systems such as mirroreye that allow stoneridge to establish a highly differentiated position in our end markets as a result of our pivot toward advanced technology this year we were awarded three additional mirroreye oem programs including the largest single program in company history these awards solidify our position as the global leader in oem camera mirror systems the customer platforms on which we have been awarded mirroreye programs represent approximately 75 of the north american oem production volume with at least one major oem yet to make a sourcing decision for a frame of reference our currently awarded programs at customer quoted penetration rates represent more than 75 million of peak annual revenue if camera mirror systems were to become standard equipment our awarded programs would represent peak annual revenue of approximately 500 million with our recently awarded programs and mirroreye at customer quoted penetration rates our backlog grew by over 6 percent excluding recently divested product lines and the impact of current currency exchange rates and production forecasts full year in review control devices adjusted sales excluding the impact of divested non core product lines in 2019 totaled 396 4 million a decrease of 2 1 relative to 2018 the reduction is due to the impact of the general motors labor strike and decreased sales volumes due to volume reductions related to the legacy shift by wire programs these decreases were partially offset by increases in our china automotive european automotive and european commercial vehicle markets control devices adjusted gross margin decreased due to lower sales and increased overhead and direct material costs partially attributable to increased expediting and tariff costs compared to 2018 reductions in gross margin were partially offset by reduced sg a and d d costs resulting in adjusted operating margin of 12 1 excluding the impact of recently divested non core product lines electronics sales of 368 9 million decreased by 3 4 relative to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in sales volume in our european commercial vehicle market and unfavorable currency translation this decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales volume in our north american and china commercial vehicle markets and increased sales of european and north american off highway vehicle products electronics segment gross margin decreased due to lower sales an unfavorable product mix and increased costs related to electronic component shortages resulting in increased direct material costs the segment s adjusted operating income decreased as a result of a lower gross margin partially offset by reduced d d costs resulting in adjusted operating margin of 7 0 stoneridge brazil formerly known as pst sales of 67 5 million decreased due to lower volumes for our argentina aftermarket channel audio and alarm products tracking devices and monitoring service revenues this decrease was partially offset by higher volumes for our oem and factory authorized dealer installer products the segment s gross margin declined due to a reduction in sales volume and adverse sales mix stoneridge brazil s adjusted operating margin decreased to 3 5 due to a lower gross margin which was partially offset by lower sg a costs as a percentage of sales degaynor continued we believe the actions we executed in 2019 positioned each of our segments for continued long term success by divesting our non core products rationalizing our manufacturing footprint and investing in strategically differentiated products and capabilities control devices is increasingly well positioned to outpace our underlying markets in electronics we expect that headwinds in commercial vehicle end markets will temper revenue growth in 2020 before the ramp up of several large programs at the end of the year and into 2021 considering our additional mirroreye awards in 2019 as well as the potential for significant take rate improvement we are planning for continued and increased investment to support those awards in 2020 in 2020 the integration of stoneridge brazil into the global electronics strategy will continue with expanded regionalized product development and the ramp up of oem awards overall we will continue to focus our resources on the areas of largest opportunity for the company and drive long term value creation for our shareholders cash and debt balances as of december 31 2019 stoneridge had cash and cash equivalent balances totaling 69 4 million total debt as of december 31 2019 was 129 1 million total debt less cash and cash equivalents yields a current net debt to trailing twelve month adjusted ebitda ratio of approximately 0 7x 2020 outlook the company announced 2020 sales guidance of 750 0 770 0 million bob krakowiak chief financial officer commented we are expecting reduced 2020 revenue relative to 2019 excluding the impact of divested product lines with midpoint revenue guidance of 760 0 million driven primarily by reduced end market production forecasts and the continued ramp down of our legacy shift by wire programs we have included a modest amount of mirroreye retrofit revenue in our guidance and will continue to evaluate our assumptions as the year progresses our 2020 revenue guidance considers the fact that divested product lines contributed approximately 37 4 million to sales in 2019 moving forward we expect that the impact of new program launches will drive significant growth in 2021 and have updated our 2021 targeted revenue to reflect a growth rate of approximately 12 relative to 2020 guidance further the company announced guidance for 2020 adjusted gross margin of 28 0 29 0 adjusted operating margin of 5 0 6 0 and adjusted ebitda margin of 9 0 10 0 the company announced adjusted earnings per share guidance of 0 95 1 15 and an effective tax rate of 20 0 25 0 krakowiak continued with respect to adjusted earnings per share for comparison purposes the divested product lines reduce eps in 2020 by approximately 0 09 in 2020 we are expecting 8 to 12 million of incremental operational improvements that will be partially offset by on going investment in resources to support multiple future program launches and continued new product development finally we anticipate our effective tax rate in 2020 to be 20 to 25 compared to 8 4 in 2019 which reduces eps by approximately 0 23 based on the midpoint of our guided tax rate in consideration of the impact of divested product lines reduced revenue due primarily to externalities operational improvements and incremental investment to support future growth as well as the increased tax rate we are expecting a midpoint adjusted eps of 1 05 in 2020 share repurchase program krakowiak commented our expectations are for continued strong growth due in part to increasingly optimistic views related to the penetration rate of oem mirroreye programs as well as significant opportunities for margin expansion because of these strong expectations the company s board of directors has authorized a share repurchase program for up to 50 million over the next 18 months this is in addition to the 50 million share repurchase authorization we announced late in 2018 we believe that executing share repurchases is a prudent way to drive value for our shareholders in addition to the share repurchase program we will continue to evaluate opportunities to put our capital to use through organic or inorganic investments the company s common shares may be repurchased from time to time at prevailing prices subject to market conditions common share price and other considerations the repurchases may be made from time to time in either open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions no assurance can be given as to the times when the common shares will be repurchased or to whether and to what extent the common share program repurchase will be consummated conference call on the web a live internet broadcast of stoneridge s conference call regarding 2019 fourth quarter and full

kitchen collection completed the closure of all of its retail stores by the end of 2019 and its results are reported as discontinued operations for all periods hamilton beach brands holding company nyse hbb today announced results for the fourth quarter and full year 2019 kitchen collection completed the closure of its retail operations by december 31 2019 and its results are reported as discontinued operations in all periods presented fourth quarter 2019 compared to fourth quarter 2018 continuing operations revenue grew 4 1 to 207 1 million compared to 199 0 million as a result of increased u s consumer and international consumer sales partially offset by a modest decrease in global commercial sales continued progress with the company s strategic growth initiatives led to a significant increase in ecommerce sales and sales of the company s premium or only the best products also grew u s small kitchen appliance industry market sales grew in low single digits while the mass segment in which the hamilton beach and proctor silex brands compete declined moderately and the smaller premium segment increased while the company was pleased that its results outpaced the industry its revenue growth was not as robust as expected due to the ongoing adverse impact of tariffs growth was further dampened by the compressed holiday selling season that resulted from a late thanksgiving despite strong pre season retailer promotions the late holiday ultimately delayed industry and company peak sales by several weeks with the result that retailer reorders anticipated by the company did not materialize the shortened season also reduced store traffic for many retailers resulting in softer than expected sales the company s global commercial revenue decline was primarily due to the adverse impact of tariffs on sales to the u s food service and hospitality industries operating profit increased 45 5 to 25 5 million compared to 17 5 million gross profit increased 8 1 to 44 9 million or 21 7 of revenue compared to 41 6 million or 20 9 the improvements in gross profit and gross profit margin were primarily due to the higher sales volume and the sale of higher priced higher margin products selling general and administrative expenses decreased 19 5 to 19 1 million compared to 23 7 million primarily due to lower advertising and promotion expenses and decreased environmental expense net income from continuing operations increased 53 2 to 19 4 million or 1 43 per diluted share compared to 12 7 million or 0 93 per diluted share full year 2019 compared to full year 2018 continuing operations revenue for the full year decreased 2 7 to 612 8 million compared to 629 7 million due to lower volume across all markets continued progress with the company s strategic growth initiatives helped increase global ecommerce sales by 27 and sales of the company s only the best products grew 7 4 lower u s consumer revenue was attributable to the adverse impact of tariffs fewer low margin placements in the dollar store and warehouse club channels and ongoing reduced foot traffic at certain retailers lower international consumer revenue was due to softness in all markets lower global commercial revenue was due to the adverse impact of tariffs and demand softness in the u s food service and hospitality industries operating profit decreased 3 4 to 36 9 million compared to 38 2 million gross profit decreased 5 8 to 129 5 million or 21 1 of revenue compared to 137 5 million or 21 8 primarily due to the lower sales volume increased inbound freight expenses and unfavorable foreign currency movements selling general and administrative expenses decreased 6 8 to 91 3 million compared to 98 0 million the decrease was primarily attributable to lower environmental advertising and employee related expenses partially offset by a one time charge for a contingent loss related to patent litigation income tax expense on income from continuing operations of 34 4 million was 9 3 million an effective tax rate of 27 1 income tax expense included 2 0 million of deferred tax expense related to a change in judgment regarding valuation allowances recorded against certain deferred tax assets of kitchen collection net income from continuing operations was 25 1 million or 1 83 per diluted share compared to 27 1 million or 1 98 per diluted share discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations net of tax was 28 6 million in 2019 compared to a loss of 5 4 million in 2018 the 2019 amount included 15 2 million for the estimated costs to terminate lease agreements as a result of the decision to wind down the kitchen collection business all obligations under the kitchen collection revolving line of credit facility were paid in full in accordance with a forbearance agreement with the lender and the facility was terminated on december 3 2019 the company expects the wind down of kitchen collection to continue through the first half of

term shareholder value this investor perspective is designed to assist investors in understanding the company s long term objectives over the next three to five years the strategic initiatives that have been implemented to achieve them the momentum that has been built and continues to build and anticipated future achievements hbbhc believes that growth opportunities for hamilton beach brands hbb are significant over time the history of hbb dates back to 1904 since that time hbb has been a leading innovator and provider of small kitchen appliances for consumer and commercial uses today hbb provides a comprehensive offering of iconic consumer brands ranging from value to luxury across a wide range of price points and product categories hbb s consumer business has historically been focused on north america and more recently has expanded into latin america south america china and india hbb has a strong presence in all of the retail channels where consumers want to buy small kitchen appliances including ecommerce in 2019 the hamilton beach brand continued to hold the number one position in the u s small kitchen appliance industry for brand units sold in both the brick and mortar and ecommerce channels hbb s strategically important global commercial business is a leading small appliance participant globally serving food service and hospitality customers around the world innovation and new product development are deeply ingrained in hbb s culture and are guided by research driven consumer needs for the past three years the company introduced an average of 85 new product platforms per year hbb typically generates approximately 30 of its revenue from products that are less than three years old hbb plans to continue its strong focus on new products as a key strategy to drive revenue growth in the coming years with an increased emphasis on new categories and higher priced products to further strengthen its core business as well as drive growth in new business areas hbb is investing in six strategic initiatives over time these initiatives are expected to significantly enhance hbb s market position and financial performance and thereby increase long term shareholder value hamilton beach brands strategic initiatives establish a leading share of the only the best segment of the small kitchen appliance market enhance the company s leadership position in the ecommerce channel globally expand the company s global commercial leadership position enter new emerging markets enter new categories that leverage the company s strong sourcing and distribution capabilities acquire companies that meet strategic criteria the company believes that its investments in these strategic initiatives will contribute significantly to the achievement of its long term financial objectives hbb s goal is to reach 750 million to 1 billion in annual revenue and 9 to 10 operating profit margin over time hbb expects to generate results within these ranges by increasing revenue and leveraging its current infrastructure the company s objective is to achieve these goals over the next few years however some of the initiatives are more developed while others will take more time to come to fruition and the company may adjust certain initiatives based on changes in the market and competitive environment organic growth of 4 to 5 annually would reach the lower end of the target revenue range in four to five years acquisitions could accelerate the progress and the company is committed to increasing its focus on acquisition opportunities while continuing with a disciplined approach regarding the right fit at the right valuation the operating profit goal would be achieved at a level closer to 1 billion if the company holds gross margin in line with historical levels expanding gross margin by 200 basis points would achieve the goal with revenue closer to 750 million the progress and plans for each strategic initiative are outlined below establish a leading share of the only the best segment of the small kitchen appliance market within the u s small kitchen appliance industry premium or the only the best otb products account for approximately one third of annual sales hbb was not a participant in this part of the industry until 2014 when the company began to build what is now a strong otb portfolio today the company s otb brands include its owned brands of hamilton beach professional which leverages the company s commercial product expertise and weston a provider of field to table and farm to table food preparation equipment and its licensed brands of wolf gourmet countertop appliances and chi premium garment care products in 2019 hbb began selling the bartesian premium cocktail delivery system through an exclusive multi year agreement in 2019 the company s otb revenue grew 7 4 and accounted for 9 of the company s total revenue this followed growth of 40 in 2018 which included the first full year of revenue from the chi line which was launched in late 2017 looking ahead continued growth will be driven by new products and expanded distribution including the ecommerce channel where a high percentage of otb products are purchased hbb plans to enter virtually every meaningful otb category with its existing brands and potentially other brands to further increase its share of this important market over the next five years hbb is pursuing a significant increase in its current share of the otb market by targeting a double digit compound annual growth rate over the next several years enhance the company s leadership position in the ecommerce channel globally the ecommerce channel represents a very strong and fast growing part of the company s business as time constrained and price sensitive consumers are increasingly attracted to the convenience of online shopping hbb focused on this channel early and has invested in the infrastructure needed to facilitate online sales and growth today in the u s small kitchen appliance industry hamilton beach is the number one brand in units in the ecommerce channel the company s products generally earn favorable reviews and ratings of four stars and above hbb s global ecommerce sales grew 27 in 2019 and accounted for 25 of total revenue hbb believes it is well positioned to leverage its leading position and capabilities in the ecommerce channel as its growth accelerates additionally sales of commercial appliances through the ecommerce channel while lower as a percentage of revenue compared to consumer products are becoming more significant expand the company s global commercial leadership position hbb is expanding its leading position in the global commercial small appliance market the company s commercial products generally sell at higher prices and higher margins than most of its consumer products since 2010 hbb s global commercial products have achieved a compound annual growth rate of more than 5 the key elements of growth have included a strong experienced team expansion of hbb s high performance blender and mixing product line and further expansion into new categories and price points in 2019 hbb s commercial revenue decreased modestly mostly due to the unfavorable impact of tariffs on the u s business and accounted for 8 of total revenue the international food service business grew in 2019 reflecting the impact of several major wins with restaurant customers hbb believes its global commercial business will return to annual revenue growth rates of greater than 5 moving forward as the company builds on the new business obtained in 2019 and the anticipated closure of some large pending opportunities hbb has increased the resources dedicated to this initiative with a goal to further accelerate the annual growth rate to more than 10 over time in the next few years hbb expects to see particularly strong sales generated by global and regional food service and hotel chains and by emerging chains in the asia pacific region enter new emerging markets hbb has been a leading industry participant in canada and mexico and parts of latin america for many years more recently hbb has expanded selectively into several emerging markets including brazil china and india where consumers have increasing purchasing power and are just beginning to establish brand preferences while expanding into emerging markets can be challenging due to the complexity and differing characteristics of distribution channels and local consumer desires as well as a complex web of agency approvals and voltage differences hbb is taking a thoughtful and targeted approach to capture specific key opportunities additionally hbb is selectively selling into europe the middle east and asia hbb licenses brands in south korea and other markets while hbb s international markets generated a compound annual growth rate of more than 5 for the years 2013 2018 in 2019 the company experienced a modest downturn sales were flat to down in most markets revenue generated in international markets accounted for 24 of total revenue in 2019 hbb expects a return to growth in international revenue in 2020 and believes there is potential to deliver significant international revenue growth in future years focus on the ecommerce channel will support hbb s efforts to increase the role of international sales in its portfolio enter new categories that leverage the company s strong sourcing and distribution capabilities hbb has expanded outside of the traditional small kitchen appliance market where it has identified opportunities to leverage its branding sourcing distribution and ecommerce expertise the ecommerce channel enables hbb to introduce new products quickly and relatively inexpensively and to react on a timely basis to consumer responses to new offerings for example the oral care category has a large and growing presence in the ecommerce channel and hbb introduced a sonic rechargeable toothbrush under the new brightlinetm brand name in 2019 hbb plans to introduce additional categories and products and will invest more in those new categories that gain strong traction this initiative is in its early stages and hbb believes it can deliver significant long term growth acquire companies that meet strategic criteria hbb s target profile for acquisitions includes both consumer and commercial businesses with a competitive position a strong brand or channel presence and the potential to enter new product categories a bolt on acquisition with revenue in the 50 million to 100 million range or potentially two or three smaller acquisitions totaling up to that range could accelerate hbb s progress in achieving its long term revenue objectives hbb is disciplined and seeks acquisitions that are value creating and accretive hbb believes in investing for the long term and has made significant commitments to people products and processes to support the strategic initiatives many of the initiatives have gained strong traction and have generated above market revenue growth hbb expects to increase returns over the next several years as the initiatives achieve higher levels of maturity and the company focuses on its growing brand portfolio introduces new products expands distribution channels and leverages its current cost structure a low debt level positions the company for many forms of investing in growth hbb is an asset light business with a relatively low level of capital investment and the potential to generate strong free cash flow and strong return on total capital employed which has generally been high relative to industry standards the company plans to continue its long standing focus on a strong balance sheet financial flexibility and historically strong cash flow generation as it works to build long term shareholder value conference call the company will conduct an earnings conference call and webcast on thursday

specifically the 3m10s and 2s10s yield curve spreads dropped from 30 bps and 34 bps respectively at the beginning of the year to the latest measurements of 0 17 and 0 16 this largely stems from the

ebitda a non gaap financial measure that represents our net income adjusted to exclude interest and other non operating expense net benefit for income taxes depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense foreign exchange gain loss acquisition related expenses non ordinary course disputes and restructuring and other exit costs income a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income the most directly comparable gaap financial measure follows we have included adjusted ebitda in this press release because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to evaluate our operating performance and trends allocate internal resources prepare and approve our annual budget develop short and long term operating plans determine incentive compensation and assess the health of our business as our adjusted ebitda increases we are able to invest more in our platform we believe that adjusted ebitda can provide a useful measure for period to period comparisons of our business as it removes the impact of certain non cash items and certain variable charges adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap some of these limitations are adjusted ebitda does not reflect other non operating expenses net of other non operating income including net interest expense adjusted ebitda does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted ebitda does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of stock based compensation expense adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of foreign exchange gain loss adjusted ebitda does not reflect acquisition related expenses adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of non ordinary course disputes adjusted ebitda does not consider the impact of restructuring and other exit costs income and other companies including companies in our industry may calculate adjusted ebitda differently which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations you should consider adjusted ebitda alongside other financial performance measures including net income and our other gaap results reconciliation of net income to adjusted ebitda unaudited three months ended

in face of the stern challenges in posing by the covid 19 to the economy the chinese government is taking measures to gradually revitalize the economy according to a report by the shanghai institutes for international studies manageable effects given the robust regulatory measures expected to be taken by the government if the economic fallout can be confined in hubei and substantially contained by the first quarter the epidemic s overall impact will be manageable the report pointed out the report said that the disease has in practical terms clobbered national consumption and tourism with supply chains severely impacted since early february in order to curb the spread of covid 19 the highest emergency response levels were activated across china after wuhan was placed on lockdown on january 23 people were advised to stay at home and avoid large gatherings while almost all leisure and entertainment venues were closed according to china s civil aviation administration air passenger traffic from january 27 through february 12 plummeted by 70 percent compared with last year s spring festival travel rush thirty two of the 41 trains running between beijing and shanghai have also been suspended said the report but fresh data suggests that the spread of the novel coronavirus is showing signs of slowing down central china s hubei province the epicenter of the epidemic reported 499 new confirmed cases of novel coronavirus and 68 new deaths on monday elsewhere on the chinese mainland nine new infections were reported the first time a single digit increase had been recorded in weeks after a near eight percent dive in the shanghai benchmark index on february 3 china s stock markets rebounded the following few days showing a deep v pattern which spells rosy market sentiment in addition largely due to rising pork prices china s consumer inflation rose 5 4 percent in january year on year the fastest acceleration since october 2011 the overall inflation is manageable according to the report economic package businesses and factories had been gradually reopening since february 10 after an extended lunar new year holiday but small and middle sized enterprises on a slim budget are experiencing raw material shortages logistical difficulties and cash crunches targeted economic policies have been rolled out in china to help enterprises ride out the epidemic since early february in line with the flexible and moderate monetary policy adopted at the central conference on economic work last year china s central bank has vowed to ensure market liquidity with various monetary policy tools chen yulu deputy governor of the people s bank of china pboc said on monday the bank will level up the utilization of structural monetary policy tools and enable the country s three policy banks to better pull their weight she called for the dismissal of concerns over more non performing loans as a result of more support for small businesses on february 11 a total of 1 848 trillion yuan 264 9 billion u s dollars in new local government bond quota were allocated much earlier than previous years to finance infrastructure construction and shore up the economy according to the ministry of finance experts forecast that fiscal deficit may exceed the alert level of 3 percent in 2020 according to the report to further help companies china announced it is cutting some pension contributions and insurance fees farmers and households involved in livestock and poultry production that suffered large losses from the epidemic will also be provided with financial support including extended loan repayments the measures worked in east china s zhejiang province 79 percent of provincially owned enterprises essential for the fight against the epidemic resumed production as of february 12 moreover 99 7 percent of companies in beijing have resumed business further plan the negative economic effects of the epidemic may accelerate the formation nationwide of consensus on high quality development smoothing the way for deeper social and economic reforms in china the report said also the need for telecommuting will promote the improvement of technologies such as vr and big data as well as their integration with other technologies like medical care the spontaneous response of the public such as staying home all the time and keeping a good social order demonstrates full support for government leadership which is also proved through a series of actions from the government including effectively mobilizing national resources and building numerous temporary hospitals it s preferable to exploit china s high foreign exchange reserves as a quasi fiscal tool to buy emergency supplies which can not only add to china s financial flexibility at this critical juncture but also allay the long standing concern over china s holding of u s treasury securities based on the report also china has integrated into the global economy due to its labor intensive industries and participation in the international division of labor through foreign capital expanding capital market access can provide improved corporate liquidity for chinese companies to invest more in research and development finally driving economic growth through strong innovation capacity the report emphasizes everyone s responsibility during the fight against the coronavirus outbreak especially social relief and assistance calling for the reduction of corporate operational costs as much as possible impact on china u s economic ties the impact on the u s

based on subscriptions or other recurring revenues 78 of total revenues in 2019 augmented by implementation services revenues as well as volume based transactional or other non recurring revenues renewal rates for our digital information software and service subscriptions are high and are one of the key indicators by which we measure our success we have been evolving our technology towards

margin and our return on invested capital roic in this timeframe we expect to maintain product development at between 8 10 of total revenues we expect to fund the modernization of back office systems by deriving additional cost savings the strategy is based on organic growth although we may make further bolt on acquisitions or non core disposals to enhance our value and market positions acquisitions must fit our strategic direction strengthen or extend our existing business be accretive to diluted adjusted eps in their first full year and when integrated deliver a return on invested

expanding the global reach of products such as uptodate teammate cch tagetik onesumx and enablon and working to strengthen key distribution partnerships expert solutions revenues grew 7 organically we extended into the selected adjacencies of contract lifecycle management and barrier based risk management with the acquisitions of clm matrix in may 2019 and cge risk management in february 2020 we divested several small assets that no longer fit our long term strategic direction we stepped up investment in our digital information products such as ovid and our european legal research solutions to enhance their content functionality and user interfaces and to add capabilities that leverage artificial intelligence we made significant progress on several key initiatives to drive operational agility in 2019 we rolled out a new global hr technology platform accelerated ongoing investments and programs to facilitate our cloud products and extended the use of standardized technology platforms and components during 2019 our decisive response to the detection of ransomware in a portion of our it environment led to a disruption in certain business activity for a few days mainly in our governance risk compliance and tax accounting divisions as reported previously the financial impact on overall group results was not material financial policy leverage and capital allocation wolters kluwer uses its cash flow to invest in the business organically and through acquisitions to maintain optimal leverage and provide returns to shareholders we regularly assess our financial position and evaluate the appropriate level of debt in view of our expectations for cash flow investment plans interest rates and capital market conditions while we may temporarily deviate from our leverage target at times we continue to believe that in the longer run a net debt to ebitda ratio of around 2 5x remains appropriate for our business given the high proportion of recurring revenues and resilient cash flow net debt at december 31 2019 was 2 199 million and the year end net debt to ebitda ratio was 1 6x dividend policy for more than 30 years wolters kluwer has increased or maintained its annual dividend per share in euros or euro equivalent in 2007 the company established a progressive dividend policy and since 2011 all dividends are paid in cash in 2015 we introduced an interim dividend payment aligning cash distributions closer to our seasonal cash flow pattern wolters kluwer remains committed to a progressive dividend policy under which we aim to increase the dividend per share in euros each year independent of currency fluctuations the pay out ratio2 can vary from year to year proposed annual increases in the dividend per share take into account our ﬁnancial performance market conditions and our need for ﬁnancial ﬂexibility the policy takes into consideration the characteristics of our business our expectations for future cash ﬂows and our plans for organic investment in innovation and productivity or for acquisitions we balance these factors with the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet 2019 dividend in light of our strong financial position and in view of our expected capital needs for the duration of our current three year strategic plan 2019 2021 we are proposing to increase the total dividend per share for financial year 2019 by 20 we will therefore recommend a final dividend of 0 79 per share bringing the total dividend to 1 18 per share 2018 0 98 the 2019 final dividend is subject to approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting on april 23 2020 for 2020 we intend to maintain the interim distribution at 40 of prior year total dividend assuming the 2019 dividend is approved this will result in a 2020 interim dividend of 0 47 per share shareholders can choose to reinvest both interim and ﬁnal dividends by purchasing additional wolters kluwer shares through the dividend reinvestment plan drip administered by abn amro bank n v share buybacks 2019 and 2020 as a matter of policy since 2012 wolters kluwer will offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases anti dilution policy in addition from time to time when appropriate we return capital to shareholders through further share buyback programs shares repurchased by the company are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or held to meet future obligations arising from share based incentive plans during 2019 we spent 350 million on share buybacks comprising 5 5 million shares at an average price of 63 80 of this 1 0 million shares were released in respect of share based incentive plans today we are announcing our intention to spend up to 350 million on share repurchases during 2020 including repurchases to offset incentive share issuance of this 50 million has already been completed in the period january 2 2020 up to and including february 24 2020 assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially we believe this level of cash return leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans to sustain organic investment in innovation and productivity and to make selective acquisitions the share repurchases may be suspended discontinued or modified at any time for the period february 28 2020 up to and including april 30 2020 we have engaged a third party to execute 75 million in share buybacks on our behalf within the limits of relevant laws and regulations in particular regulation eu 596 2014 and the company s articles of association the maximum number of shares which may be acquired will not exceed the authorization granted by the general meeting of shareholders repurchased shares are added to and held as treasury shares and will be used for capital reduction purposes or to meet future obligations arising from share based incentive plans developments 2020 on january 14 2020 wolters kluwer health signed

platforms and components during 2019 our decisive response to the detection of ransomware in a portion of our it environment led to a disruption in certain business activity for a few days mainly in our governance risk compliance and tax accounting divisions as reported previously the financial impact on overall group results was not material financial policy leverage and capital allocation wolters kluwer uses its cash flow to invest in the business organically and through acquisitions to maintain optimal leverage and provide returns to shareholders we regularly assess our financial position and evaluate the appropriate level of debt in view of our expectations for cash flow investment plans interest rates and capital market conditions while we may temporarily deviate from our leverage target at times we continue to believe that in the longer run a net debt to ebitda ratio of around 2 5x remains appropriate for our business given the high proportion of recurring revenues and resilient cash flow net debt at december 31 2019 was 2 199 million and the year end net debt to ebitda ratio was 1 6x dividend policy for more than 30 years wolters kluwer has increased or maintained its annual dividend per share in euros or euro equivalent in 2007 the company established a progressive dividend policy and since 2011 all dividends are paid in cash in 2015 we introduced an interim dividend payment aligning cash distributions closer to our seasonal cash flow pattern wolters kluwer remains committed to a progressive dividend policy under which we aim to increase the dividend per share in euros each year independent of currency fluctuations the pay out ratio2 can vary from year to year proposed annual increases in the dividend per share take into account our ﬁnancial performance market conditions and our need for ﬁnancial ﬂexibility the policy takes into consideration the characteristics of our business our expectations for future cash ﬂows and our plans for organic investment in innovation and productivity or for acquisitions we balance these factors with the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet 2019 dividend in light of our strong financial position and in view of our expected capital needs for the duration of our current three year strategic plan 2019 2021 we are proposing to increase the total dividend per share for financial year 2019 by 20 we will therefore recommend a final dividend of 0 79 per share bringing the total dividend to 1 18 per share 2018 0 98 the 2019 final dividend is subject to approval of shareholders at the annual general meeting on april 23 2020 for 2020 we intend to maintain the interim distribution at 40 of prior year total dividend assuming the 2019 dividend is approved this will result in a 2020 interim dividend of 0 47 per share shareholders can choose to reinvest both interim and ﬁnal dividends by purchasing additional wolters kluwer shares through the dividend reinvestment plan drip administered by abn amro bank n v share buybacks 2019 and 2020 as a matter of policy since 2012 wolters kluwer will offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases anti dilution policy in addition from time to time when appropriate we return capital to shareholders through further share buyback programs shares repurchased by the company are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or held to meet future obligations arising from share based incentive plans during 2019 we spent 350 million on share buybacks comprising 5 5

repurchases during 2020 including repurchases to offset incentive share issuance of this 50 million has already been completed in the period january 2 2020 up to and including february 24 2020 assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially we believe this level of cash return leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans to sustain organic investment in innovation and productivity and to make selective acquisitions the share repurchases may be suspended discontinued or modified at any time for the period february 28 2020 up to and including april 30 2020 we have engaged a third party to execute 75 million in share buybacks on our behalf within the limits of relevant laws and regulations in particular regulation eu 596 2014 and the company s

northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney assembly speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick members of the 219th legislature chief justice rabner and judge grant members of the cabinet former governors mcgreevey and codey first lady tammy murphy and the many special guests sitting with her before me distinguished faith leaders veterans members of organized labor honored guests and my fellow new jerseyans as president franklin delano roosevelt said in our personal ambitions we are individualists but in our seeking for economic and political progress we all go up or else we all go down as one people that was the ideal we brought to our first two budgets and which we now bring to our third for new jerseyans to succeed individually and for our state to succeed as a whole that is our north star ours is a vision of long term and sustainable investment in our people and our communities in their futures and in ours the choices we make come from a belief that the conversations taking place around the kitchen table are more important to our future than those happening around any backroom table the answer to the question of affordability isn t found in rewarding the special interests it is found in creating new opportunities that reward our middle class fixing what s broken and addressing the everyday needs of new jersey s families this has been our focus and because of that new jersey is confidently moving forward our administration took office with a clear and unshakable goal to grow and strengthen new jersey s middle class that means creating opportunity shrinking inequalities restoring fiscal responsibility delivering property tax relief growing our economy and investing in our future we were told that all of this couldn t be done we were told we were dreaming we were told the math couldn t possibly work they said we couldn t be pro growth and progressive that we couldn t make new jersey stronger and fairer but we have stayed true to our beliefs we are who we said we d be and today we are proving the naysayers wrong believe me there is so much more work to do but today property taxes are stabilizing for middle class families and seniors today wages are rising and more new jerseyans are working than ever before our unemployment rate is below four percent for the longest period of time than at any other point in the past 20 years our economy has supported the creation of more than 72 000 private sector jobs and at the same time we have kept our state workforce level more job creating businesses are opening in new jersey and we are far outpacing our peers and indeed the nation in their rate of growth today 8 500 residents are participating in one of 988 recognized apprenticeship programs gaining the skills they will need to get good paying mostly union jobs hundreds of high school students in burlington new brunswick and paterson are preparing for the stem jobs of tomorrow in innovative p tech classrooms working toward a high school diploma a no cost associate s degree and workforce credentials all at the same time and right now students in trenton are preparing to join them today tens of thousands of three and four year olds in school districts up and down our state have a fully funded seat in a pre k classroom an opportunity nearly 6 000 of them across over 90 districts didn t have two years ago more than 7 500 qualified students are working toward an associate s degree tuition free under the community college opportunity grant program that didn t exist two years ago nearly a quarter million residents have been able to purchase affordable individual health care plans under the affordable care act and at a time when health care costs are rising across the country these policies are coming with lower average costs than before our administration took office and we ve secured the aca s protections for millions more consumers today we have a stronger surplus we have been disciplined and anticipate making back to back deposits into the rainy day fund for the first time in 20 years and we re putting the brakes to the financial roller coaster our state has been on for far too long we are making progress not despite our progressive and forward leaning policies but because of them i stand here today with a vision for how our state can work for everyone with a proposed budget built to see it to fruition and with our progress as prologue now i know that the budget i receive back won t look exactly like the one i am handing you but i know that by working together we will arrive at a budget that continues to restore the faith that we can work together for the common good and that we can deliver upon the promises we ve made to our middle class families and just as importantly to those striving to join our middle class to invest in them and to put their needs before those of the special interests to make our state fairer for them and stronger for our future and to change the culture of trenton so that it works for ordinary new jerseyans the values we share will shape that final document a stronger state is a state that does more to invest in its people a fairer state is a state which ensures all of its residents can be part of its progress we will continue to provide real property tax relief and meaningfully and honestly attack the core problems that have long vexed property taxpayers and we will continue to fight for middle class tax fairness we re getting results and making progress we ve relied upon reasonable revenue estimates and early indications are that we may like last year exceed them i don t intend to stop our streak in fiscal 2021 under this budget we will also continue growing our surplus to a projected 1 6 billion triple the surplus of my predecessor s final budget proposal and we will make another roughly 300 million deposit into the rainy day fund our second in as many years and the first back to back deposits in 20 years it s not enough to have the resources to meet the challenges of today we must ensure we can meet the unseen challenges yet to come a stronger surplus and another payment into the rainy day fund are important signs to new jerseyans that we like them understand that we can t rush out and spend everything we have without regard to future risks and it sends an unmistakable signal to the credit rating agencies that we will not follow the irresponsible ways of the past that led to 11 consecutive downgrades we ve reduced our dependence on one shot revenues those one shots may help balance the books for one year but always always lead to a mad scramble to close an even bigger hole the next today i propose bringing one shots down to only eight tenths of one percent of our budget continuing our progress to build our state s fiscal house on a foundation of reliable and recurring revenues we re cutting back the raids and diversions that have been a key reason why so many residents don t trust us with their money in the first place as with last year the affordable housing trust fund will pay for affordable housing we ll build on last year s progress and keep even more in the clean energy fund to support projects that counter the threat of climate change and we will ensure that millions more remain at the ready to build the modern next generation 9 1 1 emergency services infrastructure our communities need and because of the work we ve done together over our first two years to restore our state s fiscal standing we re also able to fulfill our obligation by making a nearly 4 9 billion total payment into our pension system but i know our work is not done the senate president and i agree we need to do all we can to ensure the stability of our pension system so in addition to a 794 million increase for fiscal 2021 our administration will make an extra 279 million payment into the pension system this current fiscal year this is a roughly 1 1 billion increase in our overall pension payment this administration will have put more back into the system in just three years than the preceding one did in eight we can keep this progress going but only with recurring and sustainable revenues and there is no better alternative than a millionaire s tax it s the way we both ensure tax fairness for our middle class and fairness to the dedicated rank and file women and men of our public workforce after all the millionaire s tax is a matter of fairness to our middle class homeowners and renters our seniors and the countless working families reaching to pull themselves up and into the middle class the property tax is the most unfair regressive and cruelest of taxes a middle class family in merchantville or milford or moonachie after all pays a greater percentage of their income in property taxes than a millionaire anywhere else it s easy to see how our middle class can feel cheated their tax burden is real and when put side by side with that of the wealthiest in our state proves to be the exact opposite of fair it isn t the wealthy who bear the burden of our tax system it s the middle class asking the wealthiest 22 000 new jerseyans to pay two cents more in income tax for every dollar they make over 1 million so we can provide nearly 500 million more in property tax relief to new jersey s families is simple fairness as i noted in my state of the state address six weeks ago the 400 wealthiest americans now pay a lower tax rate than the nation s middle class the first time this has happened in our nation s history by the way the number of millionaires in new jersey keeps growing every year and i do not begrudge their financial success i want them and many more to come and stay and they will why because of proximity to the best job opportunities in america to the best schools for their kids in america and the best communities to call home in america there is not one iota of hard economic evidence that has proven the myth of millionaire tax flight and yet i have heard from countless middle class families and seniors who are afraid that they may have to leave because of high property taxes they should be our focus in making new jersey more affordable and tackling income inequality we go nowhere without our middle class and right now they re the ones getting squeezed let s be clear a millionaire s tax doesn t punish the rich it lifts up the middle class and that s good for everybody so i thank the senate president and welcome his willingness to embrace a millionaire s tax in this budget when we have tax fairness we can continue our historic investments in our pension systems and in our middle class families let s secure hundreds of millions of dollars of constitutionally dedicated property tax relief for more school aid for more senior freeze relief for more and larger direct middle class relief to support more shared services and to more fully secure the long term stability of our pension system the millionaire s tax won t make us less competitive it will allow us to continue fighting against high property taxes and allow us to become even more competitive we need to treat every discussion about spending as a family would around their kitchen table and we must properly invest in a way that will return dividends to our entire state and our taxpayers the evidence is clear the steps we are taking are making a difference no other administration has done so much in its first two years to control property taxes or to deliver more property tax relief in just our first two years of working together we have achieved the first and fourth lowest year over year increases in property taxes on record and statewide property values have grown more in our first two years than at any point since the great recession we re helping families by protecting the single most important investment most of them will ever make their homes this hasn t happened by accident it s happening because we re making critical investments in property tax relief for our communities investments in our schools investments to alleviate the other forces that drive up property taxes investments that are making our communities stronger and fairer and we re being honest with taxpayers we re not going to defeat the decades old if not century old problem of property taxes with gimmicks or in one fell swoop but we are making real progress and moving in the right direction this administration s approach undertaken with your partnership has been to combat directly and consistently the costs that drive property taxes higher in the first place the first budget i signed two years ago began what i pledged would be a ramping up of school funding to meet the needs of both our school districts and our property taxpayers our public schools rank as the very best in the nation in large part because of our commitment to investing in classrooms in every community in our highly talented students and our highly skilled educators and educational support professionals school funding is an investment in our future but just as important school funding is property tax relief let s be absolutely clear every new dollar in school funding is a new dollar of property tax relief every new dollar we provide is a dollar that doesn t have to come out of the pockets of property taxpayers now is no time to let up so our budget proposes keeping us on our upward trajectory with an additional 336 million investment in our k through 12 classrooms for the upcoming school year on thursday i ll visit the bound brook school district as we release our state aid amounts and we ll invest an additional 83 million in pre k allowing us to expand opportunities for an additional 3 000 children funding pre k specifically is directly making our communities more affordable for thousands of young families and it is making communities more attractive to prospective homebuyers in just three years we will have restored nearly 900 million in direct formula aid to our public schools a nearly 11 percent increase in just three years and every penny is property tax relief and through reforms championed by senate president sweeney those new school funding dollars are working more efficiently and effectively our schools benefit and our property taxpayers benefit and because of that our future benefits as we properly fund the school funding formula we know that some districts continue to face challenges so our budget also includes 50 million to stabilize their finances without cutting vital student programs school taxes make up more than half of the average property tax bill in new jersey so there is urgency in our action and as we make up for the years of aid cuts and flat funding that preceded us taxes in more than 250 school districts are stabilizing and as we continue to reinvest that number will grow it bears repeating school funding is property tax relief it is the most aggressive way we can attack the single largest root cause of our high property taxes although we in this building do not set property taxes the decisions we make can relieve the strain they place on our families and seniors that s why i am so proud of the work our administration has undertaken over the past year to seek out hundreds of millions of dollars in health care savings alongside our public workforce i ve said it before our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are the women and men who make our communities our schools and our state function and they too are property taxpayers and when we can work together in partnership to ensure high quality health care for them at a lesser cost to us all it s the best kind of win win and this concept is at the heart of our work to provide chapter 78 relief to our educators and esps and we must deliver for them we are making real progress on health care even with inflationary cost pressures running rampant throughout the health care marketplace overall spending on public employee health care across fiscal 2020 dropped by 300 million more than nine percent but the good news isn t just at the state level for active local government employees enrolled in the state health benefits program premiums decreased 4 3 percent for the 2020 plan year school districts enrolled in the school employees health benefits program saw an even bigger 4 5 percent drop in coverage rates for our educators and staff health care costs continue to be one of the biggest drivers of local and school budget growth and therefore one of the biggest drivers of property taxes lowering health care costs is property tax relief in fiscal year 2021 we aim to reduce budgeted amounts for state paid health care benefits by another 174 million this will be a significant achievement in the face of national trends and the first time in memory that we have year over year over year reductions in the overall cost of health care and we will be more aggressive than ever in directly controlling the costs of health care delivery we will close gaps that incent the use of costly out of network providers or which misclassify certain services so providers can reap a big payday we will no longer tolerate providers who send out big bills for reimbursement because they know the insurance company will settle by just sending a big check in return these seemingly small steps alone can save us literally tens of millions of dollars we re not simply cutting costs we re cutting out the drivers of cost increases while ensuring quality services it is in this same vein that we are so committed to promoting shared services the goal should not be to deliver fewer services or diminished services our goal should be to ensure the high quality services that our people need and expect in a way that is more efficient and effective with the leadership of lieutenant governor oliver and our shared services czars mayors nic platt and jordan glatt we recently passed the milestone of 1 000 shared service agreements this budget will support their work and further our progress so that is why our budget will maintain our 10 million investment to keep bringing local governments and school districts together to share services we are also creating a new grants management office co located in my office here and in our state office in washington to marshal resources and help county and local governments bring home more federal grant dollars to further alleviate the property tax burden one reason why we ve been dead last in returning federal dollars to our state is because we ve never had a whole of government approach to get them that will change and our budget will extend our commitment to direct property tax relief for middle class families through the homestead benefit and for our seniors through the senior freeze and i thank in particular speaker coughlin for his commitment to this in doing each of these things funding our public schools and delivering direct property tax relief providing high quality health benefits to our public employees educators and educational support professionals at a lower cost both to them and to taxpayers and making it not only possible but easier for communities to adopt shared services and better compete for federal grants we are being more effective in combating our property tax crisis than any administration that has come before the two leaders behind me have made many of these efforts their key priorities as have most of you and in partnership we will continue step by step to challenge the property tax crisis that has been atop our state s to do list for well over a generation when we do these things we will continue to make new jersey not only a go to place for business but a come to place we re already competing and winning that s a fact our economy is performing well in large part because we are keeping our promises and making transparent and stable investments the census bureau tracks the creation of what it calls high propensity business applications the newly born businesses it sees as growing into enterprises with employees and payrolls which is an important indicator for future economic growth and one we track closely throughout 2019 high propensity business applications in new jersey grew every quarter the fourth quarter alone grew by 3 4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2018 which had in turn grown by 3 5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2017 and our fourth quarter 2019 growth rate was nearly double that across the rest of the entire northeast new jersey has become more attractive to and supportive of business creation than both massachusetts and new york and we far outpaced the national growth rate of 2 percent this is a strong indicator that businesses see the advantages of new jersey it s a strong indicator that our economy will continue to create jobs in 2020 it s a strong indicator that our policies are working this is why our budget will continue to invest in making new jersey more competitive for businesses in workforce development through jobs nj and in our successful apprenticeship programs to ensure expedited permitting so more private investment such as that from the offshore wind industry can flow into our state to grow jobs and new opportunities and in the work of the commission on science innovation and technology so we can prove ourselves worthy as the heirs of thomas edison and bell labs and fully reclaim our place as the true home of the global innovation economy and let s also acknowledge that our work to deliver property tax relief by investing in our schools and communities also benefits our businesses especially the small businesses in our downtowns and the startups that have outgrown their incubator and are looking to build their permanent homes and at the same time there are large corporations in new jersey that do not provide health benefits to their employees and their families or who offer policies that their employees cannot afford when these families turn to medicaid it s our taxpayers who pick up their health care costs new jersey pays an average of 1 000 per person without any contribution by their employers our budget will require these corporations to pay their fair share through a corporate responsibility fee every page of our budget is filled with investments that will make our state stronger and fairer i could name them all but here are just a few beginning the work of our new office of health care affordability and transparency to lower the costs of health care for millions of our residents and build upon the successful out of network reforms championed by speaker coughlin expanding eligibility for the pharmaceutical assistance for the aged and disabled or paad and senior gold programs to thousands more new jerseyans investing an additional 200 million to further lower the costs of health insurance for individuals purchasing plans through the aca fully funding women s health care and family planning maintaining our data driven and whole of government fight against our opioid scourge continuing the partnerships the first lady has built to meaningfully combat the infant and maternal mortality disparities among our communities of color investing in programs and services for youth so they don t get entangled in the juvenile justice system fully funding the amistad commission expanding the size of the earned income tax credit and making thousands more young adults eligible helping ensure safe learning environments for our kids and communities of faith for the first time exempting combat pay earned by our active duty military men and women from taxes making a down payment for our communities to replace lead water service lines and modernize our infrastructure and building the futures of our college students through the garden state guarantee the garden state guarantee will build upon the already successful model of the community college opportunity grant program and provide the first two years of study at one of our four year public colleges and universities tuition free to thousands of eligible students tomorrow i will visit william paterson university to open a deeper discussion about this new initiative and with the public health challenges we face from the tragedy suffered at wanaque to today s rightful concerns over the coronavirus our budget will continue to invest several million dollars to partner with local health authorities to support infectious disease control i also call once again for you to join me in raising the cost of handgun permits for the first time since 1966 this is not about the 2nd amendment this is about public safety these fees are meant to cover the costs of state police background checks on prospective gun buyers and right now they don t come close to doing so it s still just 2 to get a handgun permit it s still more expensive to buy a dog license that s entirely backwards let s fix this so we can keep guns out of the wrong hands our budget will continue our work fixing nj transit increasing our investment by another 132 million to a record total of nearly 600 million this increase will help train an additional 98 new locomotive engineers fund service enhancements at both newark and new york penn stations and start a new electric bus program among much more it will also protect nj transit s commuters from a fare hike for a third straight year this record investment will dovetail with the mission and values of nj transit s forthcoming ten year strategic and five year capital plans this is an investment in nj transit but it is even more an investment in our commuters and our communities it is an investment in giving new jerseyans the freedom to leave their cars at home and to take our trains and buses and with the federal government s long awaited green lighting of the portal bridge replacement we are finally moving forward in alleviating one of nj transit s commuters other headaches wondering if a cranky obsolete century old bridge is going to hold it together for another day the portal bridge is just one part of a much larger project one new span doesn t in any way eliminate the need for new tunnels under the hudson and it in no way signals our retreat in the fight to get gateway done and by the way it bears repeating that had it not been canceled the arc tunnel would today be open and serving our commuters that ghost continues to haunt us but make no mistake the portal bridge decision is a big victory for our commuters and i thank our federal delegation in congress for their tireless help it is also a big victory for the building trades and it is a big victory for a state whose economic lifeblood can only flow with modern infrastructure by now i bet you thought i was going to get through this speech without mentioning tax incentives but this is too important this is about who we stand with and what we stand for this is about how we create jobs and for whom we create jobs these are our choices are we on the side of protecting taxpayers hard earned money or with the millions of dollars spent with no oversight and too often with no results are we on the side of small businesses and the entrepreneurs women veterans and people of color who want to start a business or do we only welcome the big fish and the well connected are we on the side of communities and residents or do we reward those who ignore them are we on the side of transparency and accountability or do we close our eyes to those gaming the system we should all agree that a targeted program with strong compliance standards is a good thing we should all agree that we need a program whose focus is on expanding our economy not rewarding special interests and we should all agree that just as much as we need strong compliance standards we must have clear annual overall caps in place blank checks are bad policy no family budgets that way neither should we as i ve said countless times most companies are good corporate citizens who play by the rules but some are not we are seeing progress in the name of our taxpayers in getting back some of the millions of dollars we now know were inappropriately awarded the first 11 million of some 500 million being investigated i am committed to not reliving the mistakes of the past the mistakes that put huge tax breaks for the well connected before tax breaks for the middle class and let s be perfectly clear billions given away in open ended corporate tax breaks will be billions we will not have to make our state more affordable for both residents and businesses tax incentives cannot be about rewarding special interests they must be about making our state more competitive creating jobs and growing the next great wave of new jersey based companies period i am pro jobs pro growth and pro accountability that is why i am for reforming a failed incentives system just as i am for reforming our ethics laws to let more light shine in when we reject transparency in any forum bad deals are made and taxpayers are hurt the public needs to see unmistakably that we work for them and not the other way around and i ask you to join me in this cause the goal isn t to win for the sake of politics but to win for the sake of our future that s also an apt way of thinking about our first two years two years speaking to our core value that new jersey is at its strongest when it is at its fairest two years speaking to the need for us to focus not on gimmicks but on long term and sustainable solutions for real property tax relief two years speaking to the need to change the culture of trenton from one that shields the wealthy and special interests to one that secures progress for our entire new jersey family we re doing what no one thought possible we re making real progress against high property taxes restoring new jersey s fiscal standing growing our economy repositioning our state for success and at the same time investing in our future here we are with a record of unmistakable progress on all fronts and with a budget that promises to keep us moving forward thank you all very much may god continue to bless the great state of new jersey and the united states of america

financial update benitec s loss after tax for the half year ended december 31 2019 was 4 708m compared to a profit of 9 065m the previous corresponding period the loss of 4 708m is explained by decrease in revenue of 14 429m under the terms of the license agreement between axovant and benitec benitec received an upfront payment of 13 568m in july 2018 there was no such payment in the current period and the license agreement between axovant and benitec was terminated in september 2019 under the terms of the license agreement between axovant and benitec benitec received an upfront payment

limited page 4 interim report for the half year ended december 31 2019 benitec biopharma limited directors report for the half year ended december 31 2019 review of operations benitec biopharma is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel genetic medicines the proprietary platform called dna directed rna interference or ddrnai combines rna interference or rnai with gene therapy to create medicines that facilitate sustained silencing of disease causing genes following a single administration benitec endeavours to develop and commercialise bb 301 for the treatment of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy or opmd the ddrnai based genetic medicine currently under development by benitec bb 301 represents a proprietary product candidate that can potentially be used to meaningfully improve upon the existing standard of care for a rare chronic life threatening form of muscular dystrophy in the past the research and development efforts of the company have been directed towards disorders that include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or hnscc wet age related macular degeneration or amd and chronic hepatitis b or hbv through the combination of the targeted gene silencng effect of rnai together with the durable gene expression associated with the use of modified viral vectors ddrnai has the piotential to produce durable silencing of disease causing genes following a single administration of the proprietary genetic medicine this novel attribute of the investigational agent that is being advanced through nonclinical development could facilitate the achievement of robust clinical activity while greatly reducing the dosing frequencies traditionally expected for medicines employed for the management of chronic diseases additionally the establishment of chronic gene silencing via ddrnai based genetic medicines could significantly reduce the risk of patient non compliance during the course of medical management of potentially fatal clinical disorders axovant termination on june 6 2019 the termination of the license and collaboration agreement with axovant sciences was announced as the benitec team endeavored to conduct several additional exploratory analyses of bb 301 prior to the initiation of a clinical study in order to potentially improve the biological efficacy of the compound via further optimization of the proprietary delivery method employed to dose the target tissues preclinical data derived from recently concluded in vivo evaluations of bb 301 in two distinct large animal species suggest that the opportunity exists to further improve the biological efficacy of the compound via additional optimization of the proprietary delivery method employed to dose key target tissues that underlie the morbidity and mortality associated with the progression of opmd the initial biological efficacy profile observed for bb 301 following in vivo testing in the a17 mouse model of opmd including full correction of the disease phenotype remains unchanged however the benitec team plans to conduct several additional exploratory analyses prior to the initiation of clinical testing completion of the experimental work noted above will delay the initiation of the bb 301 clinical study beyond the timelines that were initially outlined by axovant sciences following the execution of the license and collaboration agreement between benitec biopharma and axovant sciences as such the license and collaboration agreement between benitec biopharma and axovant sciences was terminated and all rights and licenses granted to axovant sciences will cease including the rights to bb 301 which was in preclinical development for the treatment of opmd and all other early stage research collaboration programs the termination of the license and collaboration agreement was effective on september 3 2019 benitec biopharma limited page 5 interim report for the half year ended december 31 2019 benitec biopharma limited directors report for the half year ended december 31 2019 review of operations continued proprietary research programs oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy opmd opmd is an insidious autosomal dominant late onset degenerative muscle disorder that typically presents in patients at 40 to 50 years of age the disease is characterized by progressive swallowing difficulties dysphagia and eyelid drooping ptosis opmd is caused by a specific mutation in the poly a binding protein nuclear 1 or pabpn1 gene opmd is a rare disease and has been reported in at least 33 countries patients suffering from opmd are well identified and are geographically clustered which we believe should simplify clinical development and global commercialisation efforts bb 301 is a monotherapy delivered using an innovative aav single vector system with the capability to both silence and replace disease causing genes in addition to using rna interference to silence the mutant pabpn1 gene expression that causes opmd bb 301 simultaneously introduces a functional copy of the same gene thus providing the potential to restore normal biological function to the treated tissues and in the process improve treatment outcomes this single gene therapy product versus an equivalent system with two or more vectors vastly simplifies the manufacturing and regulatory processes and reduces the complexity of the clinical strategy for bb 301 the benitec team in collaboration with several industry experts and key opinion leaders has significantly progressed the preclinical development of the primary ddrnai product candidate bb 301 in second half of 2019 the company partnered with a team of clinical and nonclinical experts in academic and practice areas focused on the treatment of opmd adeno associatedvirus based gene therapy and proprietary muscle specific dosing methods for adeno associated virus based therapeutics and other complex biologics this collaboration facilitated the final design of the tissue transduction study in large animals that will definitively outline the efficiency of transduction of bb 301 in the muscles of the pharynx which underlie the most significant impairments of swallowing in patients suffering from opmd these preclinical tissue transduction experiments will provide data regarding the fundamental transduction efficiency of bb 301 when administered at distinct doses via a proprietary mode of delivery and the results will be instrumental in the design and execution of the remaining ind enabling studies dosing in this preclinical study will begin in march 2020 and final data is expected later this year head and neck squamous cell carcinoma bb 401 is a dna plasmid that expresses an antisense rna molecule targeting the egfr mrna thus preventing its translation into its cognate protein via post transcriptional gene silencing benitec acquired the rights to bb 401 from nant capital in 2016 and bb 401 has undergone clinical evaluation in a phase 2 study in patients with advanced hnscc egfr is the cell surface receptor for members of the epidermal growth factor family or egf family of extracellular protein ligands key updates include in december 2018 the company completed the investigation of the single agent activity of bb 401 in a phase 2 clinical trial which was designed as an open label study to explore the safety tolerability and efficacy of bb 401 following intratumoral injections the phase 2 study patients were refractory to all standard therapies such as surgery chemotherapy and immunotherapy the study was conducted at clinical trial sites in australia and russia bb 401 in a phase 2 clinical trial which was designed as an open label study to explore the safety tolerability and efficacy of bb 401 following intratumoral injections the phase 2 study patients were refractory to all standard therapies such as surgery chemotherapy and immunotherapy the study was conducted at clinical trial sites in australia and russia on december 21 2018 benitec announced the interim clinical trial results for the phase 2 study involving the assessment of the single agent activity of bb 401 benitec biopharma limited page 6 interim report for the half year ended december 31 2019 benitec biopharma limited directors report for the half year ended december 31 2019 review of operations continued proprietary research programs continued an interim analysis was conducted to evaluate the objective response rate observed for the initial 12 patient cohort treated in stage 1 of the phase 2 study 12 patient cohort treated in stage 1 of the phase 2 study benitec s scientific and clinical teams will continue to follow patients that were treated in the first cohort of this phase 2 study however based on the initial analysis the objective response rate required to support continued patient enrollment into the phase 2 study was not achieved there are several critical points to note regarding the underlying nature of bb 401 as it relates to the other distinct investigational agent in the benitec pipeline at the molecular level the investigational agent that is currently under development by benitec bb 301 is fundamentally different from bb 401 bb 301 employs ddrnai which facilitates gene silencing via the production of short hairpin rna based molecules whereas bb 401 represents a modified antisense oligonucleotide bb 301 functions by a mechanism of action that is completely distinct from that of bb 401 as bb 401 achieves gene silencing via a mechanism described as post transcriptional interference bb 301 ultimately achieves gene silencing via rna interference driven by activation of the rna induced silencing complex bb 301 employs a tissue specific delivery vector aav9 whereas bb 401 has no delivery vector and was delivered intratumorally as a naked plasmid the company has terminated the clinical development of bb 401 along with the discovery stage programs directed at the engineering of follow onanti egfr strategies bb 501 hepatitis b hbv the company is developing bb 103 for the treatment of hbv results of in vivo and in vitro studies from december 2016 march 2016 and december 2015 demonstrated the potential utility of an approach that combines rnai with gene therapy to treat hbv in april 2017 the company completed a pre ind submission with the fda in which the feedback provided by the agency included details regarding steps required to initiate a clinical trial for bb 103 the company is seeking strategic partnerships to support the progression of bb 103

currency of the parent company these general purpose interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the corporations act 2001and aasb 134 interim financial reporting they do not include all of the information required in annual financial statements in accordance with international accounting standards and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the group for the year ended june 30 2019 and any public announcements made by the group during the six months in accordance with continuous disclosure requirements arising under the australian securities exchange listing rules and the corporations act 2001 the interim financial statements have been approved and authorised for issue by the board of directors on february 26 2020 basis of accounting the half year financial report is a general purpose financial report which has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the corporations act 2001 applicable accounting standards including aasb 134 interim financial reporting and other mandatory professional reporting requirements this financial report has been prepared on a going concern basis going concern during the half year ended december 31 2019 comparative period profit 9 065m and had net 6 232m cash inflows the consolidated entity incurred a loss after tax 4 708m 2018 operating cash outflows of 5 181m 2018 comparative period the directors having performed a review of the cash flow forecasts considering the cash flow needs of the group believe that funding will be sufficient to maintain the going concern status of the group the financial report does not contain any adjustments to the amounts or classifications of recorded assets or liabilities that might be necessary if the group does not continue as a going concern the financial statements take no account of the consequences if any of the effects of unsuccessful product development or commercialisation nor of the inability of the group to obtain adequate funding in the future the financial report has been prepared in accordance with the historical convention for the purpose of preparing the financial report the six months has been treated as a discrete reporting period summary of significant accounting policies the interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies adopted in the group s last annual financial statements for the year ended june 30 2019 with the exception of new accounting standards aasb 16 leases which was adopted by the group on july 1 2019 and by interpretation 23 uncertainty over income tax treatment the nature and effect of the changes arising from these standards is summarized below benitec biopharma limited page 16 interim report for the half year ended december 31 2019 benitec biopharma limited notes to the consolidated financial statement for the half year ended december 31 2019 1 basis of preparation of the consolidated financial report continued aasb 16 leases the aasb has issued a new standard for the recognition of leases this has replaced aasb 117 leases the new standard introduces a single lessee accounting model that no longer requires leases to be classified as operating or financing other major changes include the recognition of a right to use asset and liability depreciation of right to use assets in line with aasb 116 property plant and equipment variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate are included in the initial measurement of lease liability option for lessee to not separate non lease components and account for all components as a lease and additional disclosure requirements the group has applied aasb 16 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore comparative information has not been restated this means comparative information is still reported under aasb 117 and interpretation 4 for any new contracts entered into on or after july 1 2019 the group considers whether a contract is or contains a lease a lease is defined as a contract or part of a contract that conveys the right to use an asset the underlying asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration to apply this definition the group assesses whether the contract meets three key evaluations which are whether the contract contains an identified asset which is either explicitly identified in the contract or implicitly specified by being identified at the time the asset is made available to the group the group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset throughout the period of use considering its rights within the defined scope of the contract the group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use the group assess whether it has the right to direct how and for what purpose the asset is used throughout the period of use measurement and recognition of leases as a lessee at lease commencement date the group recognizes a right of use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet the right of use asset is measured at cost which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability any initial direct costs incurred by the group an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date net of any incentives received the group depreciates the right of use assets on a straight line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right of use asset or the end of the lease term the group also assesses the right of use asset for impairment when such indicators exist at the commencement date the group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the group s incremental borrowing rate lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments including in substance fixed variable payments based on an index or rate amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised subsequent to initial measurement the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest it is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification or if there are changes in in substance fixed payments when the lease liability is remeasured the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right of use asset or profit and loss if the right of use asset is already reduced to zero benitec biopharma limited page 17 interim report for the half year ended december 31 2019 benitec biopharma limited notes to the consolidated financial statement for the half year ended december 31 2019 1 basis of preparation of the consolidated financial report continued the group has elected to account for short term leases and leases of low value assets using the practical expedients instead of recognizing a right of use asset and lease liability the payments in relation to these are recognized as an expense in profit or loss on a straight line basis over the lease term the following is a reconciliation of total operating lease commitments as at june 30 2019 to the lease liability recognised at july 1 2019 total operating lease commitments disclosed at june 30 2019 920 883 recognition exceptions lease with remaining lease term of less then 12 months 7 621 operating leases liabilities before discounting 913 262 discounted using incremental borrowing rate 70 169 operating lease liabilities 843 093 interpretation 23uncertainty over income tax treatment the australian accounting standard board has published a new interpretation 23 uncertainty over income tax treatments specifying how entities should reflect uncertainty in accounting for income taxes aasb 112 income taxes specifies how to account for current and deferred tax but not how to reflect the effects of uncertainty interpretation 23 addresses this previous lack of guidance management believes that interpretation 23 has no material impact on the tax position for benitec estimates when preparing the interim financial statements management undertakes a number of judgements estimates and assumptions about recognition and measurement of assets liabilities income and expenses the actual results may differ from the judgements estimates and assumptions made by management and will seldom equal the estimated results the judgements estimates and assumptions applied in the interim financial statements including the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those applied in the consolidated entity s last annual financial statements for the year ended june 30 2019 benitec biopharma limited page 18 interim report for the half

and analysis of financial condition and review of operations for the half year ended december 31 2019 operating results benitec biopharma is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development of novel genetic medicines the proprietary platform called dna directed rna interference or ddrnai combines rna interference or rnai with gene therapy to create medicines that facilitate sustained silencing of disease causing genes following a single administration benitec endeavours to develop and commercialise bb 301 for the treatment opmd the ddrnai based genetic medicine currently under development by benitec bb 301 represents a proprietary product candidate that can potentially be used to meaningfully improve upon the existing standard of care for a rare chronic life threatening form of muscular dystrophy in the past the research and development efforts of the company have been directed towards disorders that include head and neck squamous cell carcinoma or hnscc wet age related macular degeneration or amd and chronic hepatitis b or hbv through the combination of the targeted gene silencing effect of rnai together with the durable gene expression associated with the use of modified viral vectors ddrnai has the potential to produce durable silencing of disease causing genes following a single administration of the proprietary genetic medicine this novel attribute of the investigational agent that is being advanced through nonclinical development could facilitate the achievement of robust clinical activity while greatly reducing the dosing frequencies traditionally expected for medicines employed for the management of chronic diseases additionally the establishment of chronic gene silencing via ddrnai based genetic medicines could significantly reduce the risk of patient non compliance during the course of medical management of potentially fatal clinical disorders the company may potentially earn revenue from partnering in house programs with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies forming strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies and out licensing the ddrnai platform for therapeutic areas outside of the company s in house pipeline there can be no assurance however as to whether the company will enter into any additional such arrangement or what the terms of any such arrangement could be the company s current operating plan may change as a result of many currently unknown factors and it may need to seek additional funds in the future these additional funds could be raised through public or private equity or debt financings government or other third party funding strategic alliances and licensing arrangements or a combination of these approaches however the company may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favourable terms or at all the company s failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on its financial condition and compromise its ability to develop its product candidates and pursue its strategy because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development in its field the company is unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if it will be able to generate product revenue or achieve or maintain profitability the company s ability to generate revenue from licensing strategic alliances and collaboration arrangements and product sales will depend on a number of factors including among others obtaining and maintaining adequate coverage and reimbursement from third party payees for any of its product candidates that may receive regulatory approval if the company fails to become profitable or is unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis then it may be unable to continue its operations at planned levels and could be forced to reduce its operations benitec biopharma limited page 28 interim

financial operations overview to date the company has derived revenues from licensing fees and interest income the company has not generated any revenues from the sales of products revenues from licensing fees and interest income are included in the revenue line item on the statement of profit or loss the company s licensing fees have been generated through the licensing of its ddrnai technology to biopharmaceutical companies the company s grant income is generated through the australian federal government s research and development tax incentive program under which the government provides a cash refund for the 43 5 of eligible research and development expenditures including salaries by small australian entities having a tax loss for this purpose small australian entities are defined as those with less than 20m in aggregate turnover this grant is available for the company s research and development activities in australia as well as activities in the united states to the extent such us based expenses relate to its activities in australia do not exceed half the expenses for the relevant activities and are approved by the australian government employment related costs employment related costs include salaries for all the company s employees and related benefits including the grant of share options which are valued and included in the statements of profit or loss and other comprehensive income as share based expenses impairment the company assesses at the end of each fiscal year and half year whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired if any such indication exists or when annual impairment testing is required for an asset such as goodwill intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use the company makes an estimate of the asset s recoverable amount an asset s recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value in use and is determined for an individual asset unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets and the asset s value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value in such cases the asset is tested for impairment as part of the cash generating unit to which it belongs when the carrying amount of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount the asset or cash generating unit is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount in assessing value in use the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset impairment losses relating to continuing operations are recognised in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset unless the asset is carried at revalued amount in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation

do not expect to generate significant revenue from product sales unless and until we obtain regulatory approval of and commercialise one of our current or future product candidates unless and until we establish significant revenues from licensing programs strategic alliances or collaboration arrangements with pharmaceutical companies or from product sales we anticipate that we will continue to generate losses for the foreseeable future and we expect the losses to increase as we continue the development of product candidates and begin to prepare to commercialise any product that receives regulatory approval we are subject to the risks inherent in the development of new gene therapy products and we may encounter unforeseen expenses difficulties complications delays and other unknown factors that may adversely affect our business we have based our projections of operating capital requirements on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect and we may use all of our available capital resources sooner than we expect because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with research development and commercialisation of pharmaceutical products we are unable to estimate the exact amount of our operating capital requirements our future funding requirements will depend on many factors including but not limited to the timing and costs of our planned clinical trials for our

of our product candidates the duration costs and timing of clinical trials and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors including the scope rate of progress and

in clinical trial enrolment rates or drop out or discontinuation rates of patients drop out or discontinuation rates of patients potential additional safety monitoring or other studies requested by regulatory agencies significant and changing government regulation and the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals a change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a product candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate for example if the fda or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we anticipate will be required to complete clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrolment in any of our clinical trials we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development we plan to increase our research

objective is to become the leader in discovering developing clinically validating and commercialising ddrnai based therapeutics for a range of human diseases with high unmet clinical need or large

a worldwide economic collapse will happen this summer warns israeli economist rafi farber the financial journalist spoke candidly with breaking israel news explaining why based on his calculations the dollar will collapse in late august september 2020 and more importantly what you can do to minimize the damage it will cause farber begins by explaining that all major market crashes such as the one that catalyzed the 1929 depression were all sparked by panic thus farber believes that his summer people will realize that something is wrong and when that happens the value of the dollar will collapse and the entire collapse will take a matter of months maybe a year at most he explains why the summer farber points out that all major historic crashes happened during august september including 1929 1987 and 2008 the reason he explains is because of the way the economy works the money supply in america keeps expanding all the time if it ever stops prices of bonds go down the money supply always seems to slow down by august september every year farber said when questioned about his experience in predicting financial collapses farber quipped before the 2015 august 24 black monday stock market crash i wrote an article about it before it happened and shorted the nasdaq and longed the vix nine days later i did very well this isn t 2008 but farber highlights the difference between 2008 and the upcoming dollar collapse noting what is happening this year the bubble is not in housing it s in the dollar itself treasury bonds are at an all time low the government admitted that the cpi inflation rate is 2 3 per year the interest rate paid on treasury bond 1 3 this means you re guaranteed to lose money if you buy a 10 year treasury bond in the us in europe it s even worse so why are banks buying these bonds the reason farber explains is because they assume that someone else will buy it from them later that is insanity since the value of the dollar is based on the people s imagination that debts can be paid which it can t the role of coronavirus the collapse will start suddenly and take about a year not 10 15 just one the crux of it is this most of the dollars you deal with and entrepreneurs and industrialists generally deal with are locked up in institutional bank deposits not consumer bank accounts those dollars are being bounced between institutional investors not being used to bid up goods and services directly they bid up assets not consumer goods but when growth stalls possibly because of this coronavirus shutting down production the entire pyramid falls and all those dollars have nowhere to go but the commodities sector so instead of institutions bidding up the price of bonds and equities they bid up commodities directly it s not consumers bidding up goods and services it s institutions that will do it this time consumers are left with nothing but debt and hyperinflation shows up within months instead of taking 10 15 years as it did in weimar 1914 1923 and israel from 1970 1985 it will take a year like what happened in paris 1719 1720 during the john law mississippi bubble farber explained but even before the coronavirus happened on sept 2019 overnight interest rates shot up to 10 nobody really understands why but since then the fed has been printing about 30 200 billion a day there s already a liquidity crisis he added if production in china is still shut down we ll be in negative supply rates by august or september farber warns can it be stopped at this point there is nothing at all that can deter this unfortunately the best thing that could possibly be done which will not be done is to massively and draconianly cut spending like cut the budget right now by 50 and get rid of the income tax entirely then get rid of the fed and back the dollar with gold reserves and stop printing money entirely many would suffer obviously banks would collapse but it would save the dollar and spare the country the worst of what is to come farber said how will it affect elections in america according to farber people will blame trump for the crash and that could lead to the election of bernie sanders and if that happens farber has a dire warning for the jews of america get out of america that s because when bernie is president americans will blame the jews farber warns that old people starving to death and mass rioting on the streets is entirely plausible what about israel farber notes that israel is not anymore safe than america is explaining israel went through hyperinflation from 1984 1985 since the new shekel is based on the dollar the shekel will fall too how can we survive the upcoming collapse you can t come out unscathed farber warns however he did offer some tips for mitigating the damage calling on americans to own hard assets like gold or silver then you ll have some purchasing power so you won t starve to death everyone should have some gold or silver regarding digital currencies farber doesn t recommend bitcoin as anything other than a risky speculative bet adding that it is not safe if you want safety gold and silver bitcoin is a game it may work but it also may just die he concludes

participants prepared remarks operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by my name is tiffany and i am your event operator today i would like to welcome everyone to today s conference public service enterprise group fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings conference call and webcast as a reminder this conference is being recorded today wednesday february 26 2020 and will be available for telephone replay beginning at 1 00 p m eastern time today until 11 30 p m eastern time on march 5 2020 it will also be available as an audio webcast on pseg s corporate website at www pseg com i would now like to turn the conference over to carlotta chan please go ahead carlotta n chan senior director investor relations thank you tiffany good morning pseg released its fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings results earlier today the earnings release attachments and slides detailing results by company are posted on the ir website and our 10 k will be filed shortly the earnings release and other matters we will discuss on today s call contain forward looking statements and estimates that are subject to various risks and uncertainties we also discuss non gaap operating earnings and non gaap adjusted ebitda which differ from net income as reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states reconciliations of our non gaap financial measures and a disclaimer regarding forward looking statements are posted on our ir website and included in today s earnings materials i will now turn the call over to ralph izzo chairman president and chief executive officer of public service enterprise group joining ralph on today s call is dan cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer at the conclusion of their remarks there will be time for your questions ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer thank you carlotta and good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on the call today pseg reported non gaap operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 0 64 per share that s an increase of 14 versus non gaap results of 0 56 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 non gaap operating earnings for the full year were 3 28 per share which are 5 higher than 2018 s non gaap results of 3 12 per share we achieved solid operating and financial results in 2019 which marked the 15th consecutive year that pseg delivered results within or above our original guidance earnings guidance our gaap results for 2019 of 3 33 per share compared to net income of 2 83 per share for 2018 and reflected higher earnings due to several factors these included the conclusion of pse g s 2018 distribution rate review a partial year of zero emission certificates or zecs as i ll refer to them later on mark to market gains and nuclear decommissioning trust fund gains compared to losses in 2018 and higher pension credits from benefit plan changes in 2019 net income for 2019 also included a loss recorded on the sale of pseg power s ownership interest in the coal fired keystone and conemaugh units in pennsylvania that closed in the third quarter details on the results for the quarter and the full year can be found on slides six and seven at pse g net income grew by 17 to 2 46 per share in 2019 and rate base grew to over 20 billion at year end representing an increase of 6 we invested over 2 7 billion at pse g in 2019 directed at improving the reliability and resiliency of our transmission and distribution system while also reducing methane emissions through the second phase of our gas system modernization program or gsmp as i will also refer to later on pse g completed its energy strong resilience work for nearly 200 million less than the authorized amount and we finalized the second energy strong agreement to invest an additional 842 million on system hardening to better adapt to a climate challenged world for 2019 pse g once again achieved top quartile osha scores for safety and posted our best ever j d power scores for electric and gas customer satisfaction we outpaced the industry the average industry improvement on metrics that consider total monthly cost bill clarity fairness of pricing and options and ability to manage monthly usage we were also gratified to receive for the 18th year in a row pa consulting s reliability one award as the most reliable electric utility in the mid atlantic region we remain strongly supportive of new jersey governor murphy s goals of reaching reductions in electric usage of 2 and gas usage of 0 75 within five years of programmatic energy efficiency implementation last week we agreed to extend the procedural schedule of our clean energy future energy efficiency proposal from march to the end of september 2020 in order to provide regulators with additional time to complete their review of our 2 5 billion filing which is essential for new jersey to reach its carbon neutral energy goal by 2050 this agreement was approved by the new jersey board of public utilities our bpu at the february 19 meeting at the same time our existing programs were authorized to invest an additional 111 million of note the bpu lifted a statewide moratorium on advanced metering infrastructure ami if you will and directed the electric distribution companies to file new proposals or in our case to update previously filed proposals to install ami across the state this is a significant advance for customers as it will help them better manage their energy use and improve outage restoration times ami will also support the integration of ee programs which can limit growth in the customer bill we look forward to applying best practices learned from our experience installing about one million smart meters at pseg long island over the last three years in addition the bpu staff has circulated draft procedural schedules covering the remaining 1 billion of proposed clean energy future investments in ami electric vehicles and energy storage addressed schedules outlined concluding these cases by bpu decisions in the first quarter of 2021 or possibly later this year if settlements can be agreed to by the parties in the cases since we filed pse g s four part clean energy future program in january of 2019 much has happened on the clean energy front in new jersey and surrounding states last april the bpu awarded three years of zec to each of our new jersey nuclear units supporting their continued operation as new jersey s largest source of baseload carbon free generation in june the bpu awarded the state s first offshore wind solicitation to the 1 100 megawatt ocean wind project and at the start of 2020 new jersey reentered the regional greenhouse gas initiative or rggi pennsylvania and virginia are considering joining rggi as well which could address some of the price disadvantage or leakage experienced by lower carbon states surrounded by non rggi participants the bpu finalized the state s energy master plan last month which broadly supports the decarbonization and modernization of new jersey s energy system in order to achieve its goal of 100 clean energy by 2050 a cornerstone of meeting that objective is retaining nuclear generation through 2050 maximizing energy efficiency the deployment of offshore wind and other renewable generation as well as electrifying the transportation and building sectors the final version of the energy master plan also mentioned the bpu s intent to be more proactive in matters related to transmission citing cost allocation and financial returns determined by the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc this is an issue that has come into sharp focus following the ferc s november 2019 order narrowing the methodologies used to determine the return on equity for a group of midwest transmission owners we are reaffirming the earnings sensitivity for transmission returns we have provided in the past where each 10 basis point move in roe from our base of 11 18 would result in a 0 01 per share change in annual utility earnings i must tell you the market appears to have assumed a reduction of pse g s transmission roe as a result of the midwest roe order and then some i would point out that the midwest roe order appears far from final the complexity expense and uncertainty on timing and which calculation methodologies ferc ultimately adopts makes the outcome of any potential complaint should one be filed difficult to predict i also would like to address the energy master plan s goal to maintain existing gas pipeline system reliability and safety while planning for future reductions in natural gas consumption tied to energy efficiency we believe that it may become more difficult to site new natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines and power plants in new jersey that said regulators have been publicly supportive of maintaining and modernizing existing gas infrastructure to ensure safety and to minimize harmful methane emissions both of these are benefits of our gas system modernization program from a practical standpoint 80 of new jersey households already use natural gas to heat their homes or to cook and in fact many of our customers converted to natural gas from using oil or electricity for these purposes conversion cost per customer would be upwards of 10 000 or higher this would be a significant economic burden on every household and contrary to most customers personal preferences pse g customers enjoy the lowest natural gas prices in the region so a mandated switch to electrification of homes would also diminish the decade long price benefit shale gas has provided to new jersey moreover it would be worse for the environment until zero carbon generation dominated the fuel mix we strongly believe and the bpu acknowledges that natural gas and nuclear power are essential to new jersey s energy mix and will remain that way for the foreseeable future with this backdrop of clean energy progress the urgency for needed climate action and major elements of the 2018 clean energy act awaiting implementation pse g s 3 5 billion clean energy future filing is as important as ever to get done our proposed energy efficiency programs give every customer the opportunity to reduce their energy bills while lowering emissions as part of the bpu approved extension of the energy efficiency filing pse g will expand investment in several of its existing programs by 111 million the previous extension authorized last fall quickly sold out underscoring the demand for our energy efficiency offerings providing universal access to energy efficiency is but one of the many ways we demonstrate our commitment to minimizing the customer build as we have always recognized this to be a vitally important factor in our ability to make system investments in an affordable manner in addition to the build comparisons we ve highlighted previously and i will repeat here that combined customer bills are 30 lower than they were 10 years ago and are 40 lower in real terms it should be noted that over the 2018 to 2023 period pse g will lower bills by nearly 3 billion of tax reform related benefits with approximately 650 million in 2019 alone over half of that 380 million went to lower transmission bills we re able to pass through these savings and in some cases on an accelerated basis in 2019 pse g returned all eligible excess deferred tax balances at transmission offsetting a scheduled formula rate increase that resulted in a 52 million rate reduction we continue to be mindful that pse g s balance sheet strength enables us to pass through these savings on an accelerated basis which in turn aids the affordability of investing in large infrastructure projects that benefit customers let me turn my attention to pseg power for a moment power s non gaap operating earnings for the full year of 409 million or 0 81 per share were 19 below 2018 reflecting the effect of recontracting at lower market prices and lower capacity revenues that were partly offset by zecs starting in april we completed power s 1 800 megawatt combined cycle construction program with the placement into service of bridgeport harbor 5 we also made significant progress in replacing reactor vessel bolts at salem 1 power continues to exercise stringent cost discipline to remain competitive in a challenging market pseg power made progress in 2019 to reduce the already low carbon footprint of its 11 gigawatt fleet with an output profile now comprised of over 50 baseload zero carbon nuclear generation given the completed sale of nearly 800 megawatts of coal interest in keystone and conemaugh power expects it will eliminate all coal fired generation from its fuel mix by mid 2021 the scheduled early retirement of bridgeport harbor 3 on the power market and policy front the recent capacity auction held in iso new england produced a weak capacity clearing price that reflected a significantly lower demand forecast however our largest asset in new england is the new bridgeport harbor five combined cycle gas turbine which as you know cleared the 2019 2020 auction and locked in a 231 per megawatt day capacity payment for seven years thereby limiting our exposure to this latest auction result the long awaited ferc capacity order to expand the application of the minimum offer price rule and i ll just refer to that as mopr going forward puts pjm states that want to support clean energy resources on notice that they will need to seek an alternative to the capacity market auction in order to procure their preferred resources and avoid the risk of costly double payments to satisfy that capacity obligation pjm is expected to update their price floors for all pjm nuclear units soon and will submit these default avoidable cost rates or acrs to ferc in their compliance filing on march 18 the acr will be used as the price floor for subsidized nuclear units and will likely determine whether our new jersey nuclear units can clear the pjm capacity auction for the 2022 2023 energy year as a reminder our capacity revenues are locked in through may 2022 as the ferc order currently stands the mopr will also be applied to new state supported renewable generation such as offshore wind which will have the net cost of new entry as it s price floor that price flow results in a very remote possibility of clearing the capacity auction which has prompted several pjm states to consider a fixed resource requirement or frr self supply option we will work cooperatively with the board of public utilities in new jersey and pjm to find the best path forward whether that is to bid and clear the capacity auction under a business as usual scenario or seek the frr alternative in partnership with new jersey to preserve its preferred zero carbon resources and let s remember that the underlying rationale for ferc s action was to eliminate price suppression caused by units that were receiving out of market payments also at power we ve reached an agreement to sell our interest in the yards creek pump storage generating station that we jointly own with firstenergy this sale reflects our ongoing commitment to optimize the value of the generating fleet these proceeds will add to the improved cash flow at power given the completion of the combined cycle construction program and power s declining capital needs pseg s long term strategy to transition our business to a mostly regulated company with predictable cash flows is on track our financial condition remains strong with a healthy balance sheet that provides us the ability to finance our five year capital plans and provides the opportunity for growth in the common dividend without the need to issue equity our total capital program for the 2020 to 24 time period is now 12 billion to 16 billion with over 90 of that amount directed at regulated utility growth that improves the reliability and efficiency of our operations and supports new jersey s energy policy goals pse g s planned capital spending program over 2020 to 2024 is 11 5 billion to 15 billion and is projected to produce compound annual growth in rate base of 6 5 to 8 starting from 2019 year end base of just over 20 billion so that denominator in the cagr keeps growing for 2020 we are forecasting consolidated non gaap operating earnings of 3 30 to 3 50 per share which at the midpoint represents approximately a 4 increase 3 6 to be precise over 2019 results full year 2020 consolidated guidance remains at a consistent 0 20 band as provided in recent years while subsidiary guidance ranges are modestly wider to allow for variability by business that is often offset in consolidated results the increase for 2020 is led by a higher contribution from regulated earnings at pse g approaching 80 of consolidated results partially offset by an expected decline in power s results to account for lower expected market prices for energy and capacity this guidance includes the benefit from a full year of zecs for all three of our new jersey nuclear plants the board of directors recent decision to increase the company s common dividend to the indicative annual level of 1 96 per share is the 16th increase in the last 17 years and reflects our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders as well as preserving the financial flexibility to pursue growth we finished 2019 well positioned to execute on our policy and regulatory priorities as well as our environmental social and governance priorities pseg recently adopted the sustainability accounting standards board or sasb disclosure practice and incorporated the u n sustainable development goals in our 2019 sustainability report pseg power adopted a net zero by 2050 goal in july assuming advancements in technology public policy and customer behavior and this coming april we expect to issue our first climate report using the task force on climate related financial disclosures framework pseg was again named to the dow jones sustainability index for north america for the 12th consecutive year in 2019 most recently pseg was recognized among america s most just companies for 2020 by forbes and just capital and forbes included pseg in its 2020 list of america s best employers for diversity for the third year in a row with that in mind i want to thank all of our employees for their dedication and customer commitment each and every day that help make these results possible i will now turn the call over to dan for more details on our operating results and we ll be available for your questions after his remarks daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer great thank you ralph and good morning everybody as ralph said pseg reported non gaap operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 of 0 64 per share versus 0 56 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 our earnings in the quarter brought non gaap operating earnings for the full year to 3 28 per share which is 5 higher than 2018 s non gaap operating earnings of 3 12 per share and on slide six we provide you with a reconciliation of non gaap operating earnings to net income for the quarter we also provide you with information on slide 12 regarding the contribution to non gaap operating earnings by business for the quarter and slides 13 and 15 contain waterfall charts that take you through the quarter over quarter and year over year net changes in non gaap operating earnings by major business i ll now review each company in detail starting with pse g pes g reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 of 0 54 per share compared with 0 47 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 full year 2019 net income was 1 250 billion or 2 46 per share an improvement of over 17 compared with net income of 1 067 billion or 2 10 per share in 2018 as shown on slide 17 pse g s net income in the fourth quarter increased as a result of expanded investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure and distribution rate relief for the full quarter as new rates were put into effect on november 1 2018 growth in pse g s investment in transmission improved quarter over quarter net income comparisons by 0 04 per share gas margin improved by 0 02 per share as a result of rate relief and recovery of investment in gas distribution made under the gas system modernization program electric margin was flat in the quarter as one month of incremental rate relief versus 2018 s fourth quarter was offset by lower weather normalized volume and demand operating and maintenance expense improved by 0 02 per share compared with the prior quarter reflecting lower tree trimming and preventative maintenance work and in addition retiree medical plan benefit changes implemented in 2019 had a 0 03 per share positive impact on net income compared to the year earlier quarter these positives were partially offset by 0 01 per share of higher depreciation expense on higher plant balances 0 01 of higher interest expense on higher debt outstanding and higher taxes and other items that were 0 02 unfavorable compared to the year earlier quarter for the full year weather normalized residential electric sales were 0 2 lower and weather normalized residential gas sales declined by 1 8 total electric and gas customers for the full year increased by 0 9 and 0 6 respectively last october pse g updated its transmission formula rate filing for 2020 to implement a rate increase after having completed the return of excess deferred tax benefits in 2019 in 2019 pse g s formula rate filing included the flow back to customers of the tax benefits related to accumulated deferred income taxes on an accelerated basis in a single year which had the effect of lowering the annual revenue requirements in transmission revenue for 2019 after reflecting system investments pse g s investment of over 2 7 billion in its transmission and distribution infrastructure in 2019 resulted in 6 growth in rate base to over 20 billion and of this amount pse g s investment in transmission represents 45 or just over 9 billion of the company s consolidated rate base at the end of 2019 pse g s net income for 2020 is forecasted at 1 310 billion to 1 370 billion now let s turn to power pseg power reported non gaap operating earnings of 0 10 per share in the fourth quarter compared with non gaap operating earnings of 0 11 per share a year ago the results for the quarter brought power s full year non gaap operating earnings to 409 million or 0 81 per share compared to 2018 s non gaap operating earnings of 502 million or 0 99 per share power s non gaap adjusted ebitda for the quarter and the year amounted to 198 million and 1 035 billion respectively this compares with non gaap adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2018 of 176 million and for the full year of 1 059 billion the earnings release as well as slides 13 and 15 provide you with detailed analysis of power s operating earnings quarter over quarter and year over year from changes in revenue and cost power reported net income that increased by 0 39 per share and non gaap operating earnings that declined by 0 01 per share compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 as shown on slide 23 a scheduled decline in capacity prices in pjm and iso new england in the second half of 2019 reduced fourth quarter non gaap operating earning comparisons by 0 11 per share lower generation output for the quarter also reduced comparisons by 0 02 per share the benefits of a full quarter of zec revenues of 0 06 per share and lower cost to serve of 0 05 per share were partly offset by a 0 03 per share decline from recontracting at lower market prices gas operations were flat as lower commodity prices pressured margins and limited off system sales the decline in our o m expense improved comparisons by 0 03 per share reflecting savings from the keystone and conemaugh sale and lower fall 2019 fossil outage expense that more than offset higher costs related to the hope creek refueling outage and bridgeport harbor fives in service as of midyear 2019 higher interest and depreciation expenses were offset by savings from retiree medical plan benefit changes that were implemented in 2019 and lower taxes improved non gaap operating earnings by 0 01 over the fourth over the prior year s fourth quarter gross margin in the fourth quarter stabilized at 31 per megawatt hour from the same level in 2018 s fourth quarter as a scheduled decline in capacity prices that began on june one in pjm and iso new england was largely offset by the zecs awarded in april for the year gross margin declined to 32 per megawatt hour from 33 per megawatt hour reflecting the average decline in 2019 hedge prices for energy of approximately 3 per megawatt hour now let s turn to power s operations we ve provided you with detail on generation for the quarter and for the year on slides 24 and 25 output from power s generating facilities in the fourth quarter declined by 6 2 from last year primarily reflecting the sale at the end of the third quarter of the keystone and conemaugh coal fired generating units as well as an extended refueling outage at hope creek full year 2019 output of 57 terawatt hours was at the low end of our 57 to 59 terawatt hour forecast the nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 81 9 in the quarter resulting in a full year capacity factor of 88 7 and total production of approximately 30 terawatt hours the combined cycle fleet operated at an average capacity factor of approximately 54 8 in the quarter resulting in a full year capacity factor of 52 2 and total production of approximately 23 terawatt hours for the year an increase of over 20 year over year reflecting the addition of bridgeport harbor five and high capacity factors achieved at the other two new combined cycle units keys and sewaren coal fired generation for the quarter and the year was significantly reduced as a result of the sale of keystone and conemaugh an update of power s hedge position following the bgs auction in early february is provided on slide 27 pseg power is forecasting a decrease in output for both 2020 and 2021 to 50 to 52 terawatt hours down two terawatt hours since the third quarter 2019 update primarily reflecting weak prices and lower market demand following completion of the recent basic generation service or bgs auction in new jersey approximately 85 to 90 of production for 2020 is hedged at an average price of 37 per megawatt hour with baseload production hedged at approximately 1 lower than the average hedge price in 2019 for 2021 power has hedged 45 to 50 of forecast output of 50 to 52 terawatt hours at an average price of 36 per megawatt hour and for 2022 power has hedged 20 to 25 of forecast output of 50 to 52 terawatt hours at an average price of 36 per megawatt hour the forecast for 2020 to 2022 volumes fully reflects the sale of keystone and conemaugh which had produced approximately five terawatt hours of annual generation in prior years the generation from the three new ccgts approximately three terawatt hours of lower generation in each year consistent with current market conditions and the planned retirement of 383 megawatts of coal fired generation at the bridgeport harbor three station in june of 2021 power s 2020 non gaap operating earnings and non gaap adjusted ebitda forecasted is projected to be 345 million to 435 million and 950 million to 1 050 billion respectively moving on to enterprise and other for the fourth quarter of 2019 enterprise and other reported net income that increased by 0 01 per share and non gaap operating earnings that increased by 0 02 per share compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 net income of 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with a net loss of 5 million or 0 01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the full year of 2019 pseg enterprise and other reported a net loss of 25 million or 0 06 per share compared with net income of 6 million or 0 01 per share for all of 2018 enterprise and other reported non gaap operating earnings for the fourth quarter 2019 of 2 million bringing full year results to 7 million or 0 01 per share which compares to non gaap operating loss of 12 million or 0 02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 that brought results to 13 million or 0 03 per share for full year 2018 for 2020 enterprise and other is expected to produce a non gaap operating loss of 5 million and this guidance reflects the continued pseg long island results that are more than offset by higher parent interest expense pseg concluded 2019 with 147 million of cash on hand and debt representing 52 of our consolidated capital position power s debt was 33 of its total capital base and its year end debt position stood at just over 2 7 times 2019 non gaap adjusted ebitda we expect internally generated cash flow will enable us to fund our current 2020 to 2024 capital program of 12 billion to 16 billion and accommodate incremental investment in previously identified opportunities without the need to issue equity while providing the opportunity to grow our dividend so to recap we re guiding to non gaap operating earnings for 2020 of 3 30 to 3 50 per share an approximate 4 increase over 2019 with regulated operations at pse g approaching 80 of consolidated earnings we also raised pseg s common dividend by 0 08 to the indicative annual level of 1 96 per share a 4 3 increase over 2018 this level continues to represent about a 58 payout of consolidated earnings at the midpoint of 2020 guidance and is comfortably covered by utility only earnings and has contributed to a 4 7 annual rate of growth in the dividend over the last five years and with that tiffany we are now ready to take some questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of praful mehta with citigroup thanks so much hi guys ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hi praful mehta citigroup analyst hi so ralph on the pjm capacity auction i m sure you re expecting the question unfortunately the way ferc has left it it s going to be difficult to see how states stay in it if they really want to push the renewable mandates especially like you said offshore wind and we ll see how the net acr comes out from nuclear but what is your view on that if states were to separate or at least have their own frr like you said what does that mean for new jersey what does the process and timing take and what does that mean for your portfolio in particular ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so that s a very thanks praful that is a very complicated question and so much of it is really summarized in two words it depends i don t think new jersey wants to pay twice for capacity from carbon free sources in particular from offshore wind so under the current construct which as you know many people have filed for rehearing but under the current construct that would be new jersey would have to have either a zonal or a statewide frr which to me is suboptimal right because now you re going to be solving a small problem with a rather large tool if your aspirations are for 7 000 megawatts of offshore wind the need to pull out 15 000 megawatts from the capacity market seems to be a bit of overkill it also depends upon the design of the frr are you taking out what is the engineering assessment of the reserve margin you need at 15 16 if so you re leaving behind a residual market that is protestingly oversupplied and crushing capacity prices in that market how is price set i mean there s just a ton of questions what i feel good about is number one we have an energy master plan that says nuclear is important to 2050 so that has to be economically supported number two we have fossil assets that are located close to the load centers and have deliverability advantages that will make them important factors in any capacity reliability construct that is created so candidly we ve already filed comments and by virtue of those comments i think it s safe for me to say that we ve said ferc didn t quite get this right and it looks like the most likely outcome is folks that are not close to load centers and that are in other regions may face a residual market that is that does experience some price depression which is the exact opposite of what ferc said they wanted to do so everything i said after the first two words of it depends you should take with a little bit of a very cloudy crystal ball in terms of its ability to be precise and i ll end where i started which is it depends daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer and praful just one thing to add the we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we will find out a little bit more from pjm on the 18th of march with respect to the acrs which is part of your question as well so that depends as well but we ll get a little bit more insight and we anticipate that to come out on the 18th of march ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes and you do know praful i m sure that the imm numbers would suggest that our nuclear plant should we choose to participate would be certainly competitive praful mehta citigroup analyst right no daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer for capacity growth praful mehta citigroup analyst yes and obviously i do appreciate that nuclear should at least based on imm numbers but i guess given all of the it depends and uncertainty from a timing perspective if ferc were to go ahead do you think new jersey can react in time to get the frr if that were the path forward like you said a big tool for a smaller problem but if that was the only path forward what is the timing expectation you think that ferc that new jersey can get together and kind of solve the problem from an frr perspective ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so remember our capacity prices are set through 2022 so we have a little bit of time there depending upon whether or not ferc responds promptly to the march 18 filing that dan referenced it s conceivable that the next auction would take place late in q4 of this year and new jersey will not have offshore wind collecting payments until sometime in 2024 so it doesn t start paying double until the second auction from now right because we re still working on the 2019 auction just yet for the 2024 energy year as a 2021 auction so new jersey has a little bit of time and in conversations with cef we believe and we re hearing from cef that they also believe that they may not need legislation to go forward with an frr now it s not 100 certain but i do think that there will be adequate time for new jersey to avoid double paying for capacity for 2024 it won t be a walk in the park praful mehta citigroup analyst got it fair enough i ll get back into you guys lots more questions for thank you operator your next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst thank you good morning kim ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer raise your hand julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hey excellent so let me turn the subject to a slightly different more utility oriented subject the e p talked at least a little bit about transmission returns i d be curious to get your latest thoughts on new jersey specific dynamics obviously you already alluded to in your prepared remarks to the miso situation and specifically with the new jersey do you think that there s a potential to file like a 205 to get ahead of any kind of process in new jersey or how do you see this playing out if at all curious on your reaction there ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so i don t know how to predict whether or not there ll be a 205 at all julien i mean we ve often talked about a 206 and there is a high threshold for someone who files a 206 i think we have to do a better job here quite candidly reminding people of the enormous value of our transmission investments over the years right if i take you back to august of 2003 when the grid was very different in its structure and how much more improved it is now from a reliability point of view we ve literally reduced transmission outages by 300 i believe over that period of time once upon a time when there was low cost fuel for generators in the west new jersey faced prices with that at a 20 basis uplift in the east and nowadays the nature of that low cost fuel in the west has changed from coal to gas but it s still a lower cost fuel in the west new jersey doesn t have any natural gas and basis differential is now sort of being positive 20 or negative 3 so there s been a bunch of advantages associated with the transmission and we still have no shortage of 90 year old transmission assets that need to be replaced having said that we are not likely to file a 205 to change our roe because we really don t know what the ferc rules are going to be it seems pretty clear to me that ferc has as professionally as is humanly possible basically said oops maybe we need to rethink what we did here and i believe the chairman himself has said that they are open to potentially rehearing this case so a 206 filing is extremely complicated it takes many years just take a look at what happened in new england take a look at what happened in midwest and that s when people knew what the methodology was going to be so now in the absence of a known methodology with that complexity i think it s not particularly beneficial to our customers or to us to begin to go in and talk to surmise what those rules might be in the form of a 205 so i m proud of every dollar we spent on transmission and the customer benefits we ve delivered and as soon as ferc gets the rules straight then maybe we can have an intelligent conversation with our regulators and our customers about what is a fair return but right now the market seems to have anticipated every bit and then some so julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst indeed and then if i may just to follow up on the sort of bridging the two conversations in power and utilities obviously pressure across the market and then also a potentially slowing utility growth trajectory even on the margin how do you think about the power business again strategically as you think about dividends and cash flow required back into the utility again trying to bridge that financing conversation against both sides of this business and all of this in light of the latest asset sale too ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes no so first of all remember because of the delay in cef combined with the 6 growth in rate base which was part of a 17 growth in utility earnings yes we do have lowered the bottom end of our rate base growth to 6 5 but i would take issue with the slowing utility growth i think that we are very mindful of customer bills and the impact and the customer value creation associated with the type of investments we are making right we re not here to just grow the rate base we re here to reward shareholders by doing better things for customers and so that 6 5 to 8 i would still say is not only robust but at the risk of being a little bit well it s real so let me just leave it at that instead of describing it and so 6 5 is programs and things that we know and 8 is if we hit some part of cef and what the bpu is saying please bring in an ami or modify your ami proposal i think it s safe to assume that some part of cef both ee and ami will be approved now in terms of power to your to the heart of your question i just sorry julien but i just want to take issue with some of the assumptions behind the question we re making progress we ve sold keystone and conemaugh because that made sense we re selling yards creek because that makes sense right now we re not selling bethlehem because it seems that we can get more value out of it than the market was willing to pay for it and the utility is going to be almost 80 of our earnings this year with 90 of our capital deployed in that direction in the next five years so the cash flow from power is an attractive way to fund the utility operations the debt capacity of power is an attractive way for us to fund the equity component of the utility and we ll keep doing that but as people come forward and say we can make better use of that asset fill in the blank as to what that asset is then we re more than happy to have a conversation and those conversations take place all the time and sometimes they re fruitful and other times we realize people are just trying to say something that s quite valuable at a discount price and we re not going to let them do that daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and i think julien the only other thing to add really is if you think about it we have talked for a long time about a growing base of rate base it s going to trend toward the potential for a lower growth rate off of that because of the higher base and that s a little bit about what you see from the standpoint of the range that we have put out in addition to the fact if you think about some of the clauses that are in place related to gsmp related to energy strong have five year run rates which run through 2023 the five year plan that we talk about now runs through 2024 so remember the low end of the range is what we know is approved and is moving forward and so it kind of fall off one year within our five year forecast from the standpoint of what is approved and we ve also talked about there s a lot of gas pipe gas iron pipe that s out there that has a longer run rate from the standpoint of being able to move through all that to eliminate all the methane leaks that come from that so i think some consistency with that that s not approved as yet into 2024 it s approved through 2023 so you see some drop off on the lower end of that range for that reason julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jonathan arnold from vertical research jonathan arnold vertical research analyst guys daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer hey john jonathan arnold vertical research analyst thank you just a quick on the capex updated slide i just was curious in 2023 there s obviously a big increase in the orange segment the electric distribution can you just remind us what s in that piece is the ami in there or is that sort of still up in the green hashed out section daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer jonathan i think there s maybe two things that you can think about a little bit from that perspective one is the fact that and i just referenced energy strong and gsmp and there s usually some of what we call stipulated base within the overall spend that is there and that spend can tend to lag a little bit across the five year period of the clauses that we have so to the extent that the stipulated base comes through toward the end of those programs you may see some of that come through and usually there s a little bit of capital that a capital adder as we move toward the rate case here just based upon ultimately pulling capital together so those are the two things that would come to mind related to that jonathan arnold vertical research analyst okay and as i look the orange and blue bits 23 particularly had really increased a lot versus what you were showing us just recently so ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer an ami is above in the cross hatch recent jonathan jonathan arnold vertical research analyst okay so that s not what s driving it and then just sort of generally when i sort of try to design numbers underlying the slide with the slide rule it seems that you re spending through 2023 is probably up 1 billion maybe a little more and but the rate base is more or less spending up in the same place am i on base with that observation or not quite daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer with respect to i m not quite sure i follow your question jonathan arnold vertical research analyst just if you look at what your slide implies in terms of the 2022 2023 kind of time frame rate base although you ve had all this moving around on the capex it looks like it ends up in more or less the same place i just want to make sure i m right about that daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer 2023 ends up in the same place as what jonathan arnold vertical research analyst same as before daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer how it was ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer we ll have that comparison daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer are you saying that as compared to jonathan arnold vertical research analyst yes i mean you would have to let me rephrase it has your 2023 vintage type of rate base forecast changed very much in aggregate once you have put all this together daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer i think from the lower end of the range i would say no and what you re seeing on the top end of the range basically is inclusive of both the cef potential as well as the iip potential so we can pull our slide rules together and kind of look through what s there you re basically looking at what was a 7 to 8 increase off of 2019 versus a 6 5 at the lower end off of 2020 and you re seeing a 6 increase year over year so net net that just becomes math jonathan arnold vertical research analyst okay so the destination does seem to be kind of not that different not that daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think that s fair jonathan ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i don t think it s that different daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and i think the dependency of cef is a part of that that s been what s been the biggest part of our range and remains that way because we are still in progress with respect to those filings jonathan arnold vertical research analyst perfect and then just one other thing what was the goodwill impairment power that you took in the quarter daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer oh that jonathan that was from many years ago when we acquired a location in new york which ultimately became the bethlehem energy center and we ve built that so i m going to guess a couple of years to build that it might have been in the 2001 2002 time frame something like that we acquired a site of the old albany steam station from niagara mohawk and at the time of that acquisition there was some goodwill that came on the books and that goes through an annual impairment test and that was impaired as we went through this year it was a fairly modest amount but ultimately it was just that accounting test as we went through it jonathan arnold vertical research analyst okay so it was none not one of your core assets okay daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes noncash and relatively small amount jonathan arnold vertical research analyst thank you operator the next question comes from the line of michael lapides with goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys just a quick question on the transmission capex embedded in the five year outlook just curious how much clarity do you have at this point in time on 2021 and 22 transmission capex levels daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer i would answer generally it s a very high degree if you think about a lot of those projects they end up being multiyear projects and so a lot of that spend is not awaiting approval in those years it s more related to spend on projects that have a longer term run rate michael lapides goldman sachs analyst okay and the only reason why i asked that question is historically if you go back over time when you all put out a five year forecast of transmission spend what the actual spend in years three through five were versus what the forecast were a couple of years earlier turned out to be vastly different numbers i m just curious if we re looking at something where there could be a significant uptick relative to what we re seeing on slide 19 in terms of expected transmission spend especially since the rollover seems to be occurring really next year in 2021 normally it s kind of years three through five when you guys have forecast that out ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so mike i mean i think you could rest assured that we re putting out there the best of our knowledge right now we have said in the past that some of the larger projects which tended to make the future a little bit lumpier so to speak as new projects were approved those large projects are not in the forecast we don t envision any i mean you never say never depending on what pjm does with the rtep much of the transmission improvements now are end of life projects and 69kv upgrade projects so the susquehanna roseland type projects the northeast carda projects which could take something that was at x and make it much bigger than x as it gets approved are not likely to show up in the near term michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it and then one follow on i just want to make sure can you remind me what happens now on the ami process is that spin that s approved does that spin that s part of the ongoing dockets on the cef that needs to get approved and would i and if it s a separate part of that when does that kind of roll in is that just part of the energy cloud docket ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so what so the bpu listed the moratorium said ok based on some work that was done at rockland electric and an independent consultant report this makes sense we should do this statewide so they put forth a procedural schedule which would if it were fully litigated in its outcome based on our experience that would wrap up sometime in q1 of next year and they said to utilities ok please submit your filing you could do it under the rubric of the infrastructure improvement program which you may recall was passed in december of 2018 since we already have a filing in we don t need to write a new filing so we are going to simply take the ami component of our cef the energy cloud component and make sure it doesn t need to be tweaked in any way and pilot under the infrastructure improvement clause recovery mechanism so i would think i would hope that we have a very strong opportunity to come to a negotiated settlement on that since everybody recognizes the value of ami and since the recovery mechanism and the iip is pretty well documented and has been used extensively so maybe this is something we can actually get done this year but we ll see michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it and last question can you remind me on energy efficiency spend at pse g how was that treated from an earnings perspective ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer rate base rate of return and we ve had a mechanism in all of our prior programs which continues in this case to recover we have the opportunity to recover the lost revenue through an administrative fee that is set in a way that allows us to run the programs and have the opportunity if we run them efficiently to recover that as a lost revenue component michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you much appreciated guys operator your next question comes from the line of paul patterson with glenrock associates paul patterson glenrock associates analyst good morning how you doing ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey how you paul patterson glenrock associates analyst just really quickly is there any reason to think that i mean that there d be a significant difference between the pjm s acr values versus the imm s ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer there s nothing that jumps out at us paul they don t always agree as you know on either policy or their analysis but there s nothing that jumps out at us at this moment right now paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then with respect to the frr if that s the route that s taken how should we think about the amount of capacity that new jersey would be procuring i guess and how it would be selected i guess ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer that s really to be determined we would want to work with the state to make sure that reliability concerns are met but that the state doesn t oversupply itself and therefore pay more people than it needs to but that all needs to be determined paul patterson glenrock associates analyst does that daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer the state would provide information to pjm to ensure that they have actually met the requirements that they need to meet so you can kind of i think you can think about the concept of needing to meet the reliability is being consistent with pjm from the standpoint of what kind of a credit you would give to particular types of units like a so you wouldn t get a megawatt per megawatt credit because it s not dispatchable but i think that the details are to be determined paul patterson glenrock associates analyst so it would be it would basically one would normally think that it will be basically the pjm rules for capacity and what have you and what their what the goal is for reserve margin for pjm is that how we should probably think about it or ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer that s the way i think about it paul because clearly you want to avoid the free rider case because new jersey is not going to sever its interconnections to the rest of pjm and if and you re not suggesting this but if new jersey designed an frr that created greater opportunities for reliability concerns in new jersey to be backstopped by the rest of pjm but the new jersey doesn t pay for it that does not seem to be fair but yes i mean i think that we all know that pjm right now has reserve margins that exceed its stated requirements and presumably if new jersey just followed the pjm frr requirements that would be more akin to what they ve traditionally said in the 16 range not 20 plus percent range and that s why i think there ought to be concerns about the residual market paul patterson glenrock associates analyst absolutely okay thanks so much ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer tiffany will take a final question operator your next question will come from the line of shahriar pourreza with guggenheim partners constantine guggenheim partners analyst hi morning it s actually constantine here for sure ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hi constantine constantine guggenheim partners analyst it s actually constantine here for shar just a quick one we re kind of slipping from distribution to transmission to generation fairly frequently but just high level when we re thinking about kind of the clean energy future programs and advanced metering kind of energy efficiency opportunities with kind of this update that you re potentially thinking about how does that kind of translate into opportunity and i m just thinking in aggregate that you have about 2 3 million customers and what s kind of an efficient rate at which you think you would deploy ami and kind of how should we think about the trajectory overall so the annual rate i don t have it committed to memory constantine but the 2 5 billion for energy efficiency was over six years and we are convinced that we can deploy that right now we have the authority to commit 111 million over the next six months that one will get spent in six months but if we could commit it based upon the demand for our programs i m pretty confident i m very confident of that the ami estimate we ve made is about 500 million to 600 million investment and that s for all two million electric customers our gas system has got a fairly extensive amount of driveby reading capability and on electric vehicles and storage that s the one that really is just a question of what is the regulatory appetite and enthusiasm the state has like a 600 megawatt battery storage goal for 2021 which clearly is not going to hit and we re just proposing 100 million for 30 megawatts so as the state wants to really aggressively pursue that 2021 target we could do a lot more and then electric vehicles is similar question of what is the appetite we ve proposed a 300 million program for a variety of different charging station infrastructure deployments so in the aggregate if we add those numbers up it s 3 5 billion over six years with the ee being the single biggest piece and the ami probably being a little bit more of the back end loaded piece in terms of once you get the approval and then are doing the deployment daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think that deployment is going to run a few years by the time you roll it out to everybody and i think a couple of unique aspects of the ami is that it certainly feels more like an all or none scenario you re not going to do every third house with ami it s going to you re really going to roll out ami or you re not so it s got a more of a binary aspect to it and to do that full rollout is going to take i don t know maybe three or four years or so depending upon the pace so it ll take a little bit of work through it all constantine guggenheim partners analyst okay that s very helpful and just one quick follow up on kind of offshore wind and the timing and kind of opportunities going forward kind of have you made the commitment or is there a time line for making a commitment with orsted and how are you positioning for any kind of future rfps new jersey or otherwise ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so we have not made the commitment yet we do need to resolve that by the third quarter of this year i think both we and orsted would like to see that sooner rather than later but we don t want to do that in the absence of being fully comfortable that our due diligence is complete and we have retained ownership of another site that is a residual from our prior partnership with deepwater wind which was acquired by orsted and that site has access really i think to three states to maryland delaware and new jersey in terms of future solicitation constantine guggenheim partners analyst okay that s very helpful and kind of any way that you re thinking about kind of partnerships and structures going forward or is that a little too early to tell ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i mean those discussions are under way with orsted and i d rather not have a lengthy public conversation about that until we resolve that with our future partner constantine guggenheim partners analyst that s very helpful thanks so much operator mr izzo mr cregg that is all the time we have for questions please continue with your presentation or your closing remarks ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so thank you for joining us today and we will be on the road for the balance of next week and a few days after that so we d be more than happy to have to meet with folks and have further conversations i know that there s a little bit of a there s a fair amount to talk about in terms of the ferc mopr and the future of the regulatory decisions but i must admit that we are encouraged by some of the things that have happened in new jersey of late you may recall the white paper on the utility role and energy efficiency that came out at the end of last year the energy master plan has come out we are seeing procedural schedules for all aspects of our cef filing and we do have an extension of 111 million for just the next six months so i d say that of course we re never satisfied with pace but we are directionally satisfied with the dialogue and the substance of our continued growth of the utility in ways that benefit the customer so look forward to seeing you all on the road and thank you for joining us today operator duration 66 minutes call participants carlotta n chan senior director investor relations

re globalization in latin america can turmoil lead to reforms carlos cruz infante follow 7 min read feb 6 2020 listen share all of latin america burns literally nicolás maduro s dictatorship in venezuela the populisms of andrés lópez obrador in mexico and jair bolsonaro in brazil the dismantlement of peru s congress by its president and the social crises in ecuador chile colombia and bolivia the whole continent is in upheaval profound changes are in sight and perhaps even imminent one example being the debate over a new constitution for chile where even the richest part of the population and the elite admits that the road traveled so far has come to an end the good news is the classic teaching crisis creates consciousness could latin america s turmoil ultimately lead to profound and substantial systemic reforms that could become a blueprint for reforming globalization as a whole in the important framing essay for this series roland benedikter and ingrid kofler have described current global change very accurately and have rightly pleaded for a five fold model of re globalization in my view and in that of most latin american s all five r s are necessary if not unavoidable and must be seen as an interconnected whole yet i believe that from a latin american and perhaps global south point of view the main two challenges for re globalization over the coming few years will be reframing and reforming how did latin america end up like this the roots of latin america s latam s discontent are its extractive institutions designed to extract incomes and wealth from one subset of the society to benefit a different subset 1the spanish and portuguese empires established commodity based economies where locals worked and settlers enriched inequality was not reduced during the 19th and 20th centuries and this eventually led to social crises and civil wars then dictatorships arrived since the 1970s military coups have occurred all over the continent after too much time spent fighting those impoverished governments received loans at very low rates but by then fiscal responsibility was not an important priority in 1989 the u s had just won the cold war yet it perceived that the menace of socialism was still alive south of the border so the u s summoned the world bank and the international monetary fund to renegotiate loans and advise the governments of latam countries to handle the debt crisis through austerity measures they suggested reducing deficit budget and inflation rates reforming trading conditions to facilitate more participation in the global economy and reducing state intervention promoting privatization instead seemingly overnight latam governments had democracy and a role in the world economy the u s assumed that this would foster more inclusive institutions instead the extractive institutions simply adapted their practices and resorted to their old ways the 21st century extractive institutions pass the buck after three decades of explosive economic growth during which the region more than doubled its gdp between 2000 and 2017 2and reduced poverty rates by 14 percent 3poverty began to rise again in 2016 as growth stagnated this can be attributed to two main factors the dutch disease coined by the economist this term refers to a boom of commodity exploitation orienting capital and whole economies to that activity this causes productivity to decline because other sectors of a national economy stop receiving investment and they furthermore become less competitive in international markets because the local currency gets stronger it is a latam wide disease now resource rich countries are running out of the capital to add value to their commodities excess inequality income inequality also declined during the boom but recently the trend is diminishing the s80 s20 index decreased from 20 9 in 2002 to 13 1 in 2017 4the european union s average is five also the rate of reduction is declining from 2002 to 2008 the gini index s rate reduction was 1 3 from 2014 to 2017 it plunged to 0 3 5finally according to eclac 6the concentration of physical and financial assets is far higher than the concentration of real incomes in latam this excess of inequality impacts people s well being 7and social mobility and therefore also affects productivity as well as support for democracy and the development of state capacities when one combines the dutch disease with an excess of inequality the result is institutional mistrust fifty three percent of latin americans declare that corruption has increased in their countries 8this is typical of extractive societies where corruption finds an easy foothold and latam is full of them mexico panama brazil peru and argentina are the most well known cases reforming globalization for latam all international recommendations point in the same direction redistribute economic and political power and transition to more inclusive institutions it is suggested that these societies need to focus on promoting the participation of traditionally excluded groups in commerce and the job market investing in early education reforming their tax laws promoting a public integrity agenda and investing in fiscal and legal state capacities one of the proposals for overcoming the crisis has been the agreement in chile to pursue a new constitution the country has had four until now the first being promulgated in 1828 and the next two in 1833 and 1925 respectively the last and most controversial was promulgated by augusto pinochet in 19809 during his military dictatorship and it is this constitution that prevails to this day it established the notion of the subsidiary state 10 limiting government intervention exclusively to guaranteeing public order and the functioning of markets and exempting the state of any obligation as the provider of basic social services since the return to democracy in 1990 pinochet s constitution was reformed once in 2005 but it has not been replaced a new constitution for chile exemplary reform in november 2019 the chilean government and its opposition agreed to start a new constitutional process 11in the beginning they focused on more and better public services as a tonic for social unrest having failed on that diagnosis however élites concluded that it was more of an institutional problem the prevailing constitution from the time of pinochet s dictatorship lacked legitimacy changing it could reshape chilean extractive institutions into more inclusive ones the most relevant point of this new process is that it will start as a tabula rasa dismissing 1980 s constitution and doing a completely new one says pablo contreras 12from autonomous university of chile in the second place this will be the first time that chileans could vote on both the mechanism and the ratification of the law according to marcela ríos 13from undp chile the process is as important as the content of this new constitution it has to be participative transparent diverse i hope we have community leaders women and representatives of the native people what should this new constitution portend it has to be flexible enough to leave freedom for each government s agenda but it also has to be very clearly delineated in three areas power organization and distribution the role of the forces of public order and the fundamental rights of the people we have to discuss if we want a subsidiary state or a social and democratic one says maría jaraquemada 14from the think tank espacio público moreover ríos argues that social welfare and income distribution will be very important the process itself has not started as sure footedly as expected many are skeptical that congress members will put fundamental reforms ahead of campaign politics indeed the question remains whether a new chilean constitution can be exemplary jaraquemada says we know that the region has its eyes set on us the other countries think that if this process fails here it won t work in any other latin american country reframing globalization for latam according to the oecd 15strengthening international bonds could help latam to adopt nationally driven development processes and create new capacities to adapt to national and global reforms many look to europe as a potential partner but the last joint effort was a 2019 free trade agreement with one of the most important blocs of latam the mercosur putting the agreement into effect has been politically complicated for both parties meanwhile the pacific alliance another regional bloc composed of chile colombia mexico and peru is eager to strengthen its collaboration with asia and the pacific what does all this mean with regard to benedikter and kofler s proposed 5rs of re globalization for latam it is urgent not just to reform but also to reframe the way that its states are contributing to social order and welfare strengthening regional collaboration especially with the eu could be a huge opportunity for both sides latam s leaders and citizens could learn better ways to articulate a vision for their societies pursuing paths to effective and lasting development as for the eu it could benefit from new modes of creativity and expanded relationships with latin america and the pacific rim offering returns on both financial and social capital if mutually beneficial relationships evolve out of these initiatives they could provide a valuable model of how to develop the global south and thus get globalization back on track in a better way

fiscal deficits geopolitical uncertainty acute domestic political divisiveness rising populism trade wars corona virus as we know this list could be extended for pages however the one thing that will never show up on this list is inflation inflation as reported by the bureau of labor statistics bls and the bureau of economic analysis bea inflation has been running above 2 for the better part of the last few years despite cpi being greater than their 2 target the federal reserve fed has been wringing their hands about the lack of inflation they insist that inflation as currently measured is too low we must disclaim this all assumes we should have confidence in these measurements at his january 29 2020 press conference chairman powell stated inflation that runs persistently below our objective can lead longer term inflation expectations to drift down pulling actual inflation even lower in turn interest rates would be lower as well closer to their effective lower bound as a result we would have less room to reduce interest rates to support the economy in a future downturn to the detriment of american families and businesses we have seen this dynamic play out in other economies around the world and we re determined to avoid it here in the united states contradictions there are a couple of inconsistencies in powell s comments from the most recent january 2020 post fomc press conference these are issues i have become increasingly interested in exploring because of the seeming incoherence of fed policy further as investors high valuations and pe multiple expansion appear predicated upon favorable monetary policy if investors are to rely on the fed they would be well advised to understand them and properly judge their coherence as discussed in jerome powell the fed s great betrayal powell states that the supply of money that the fed provides to the system is to be based on the demand for money not the economic growth rate that is a major departure from orthodox monetary policy if investors had been paying attention the bond market should have melted down on that one sentence it did not because the market pays attention to the current implications for the fed s actions not the future shock of such a policy it is a myopic curse that someday could prove costly to investors as for powell s quote above the first inconsistency is that the circumstances they have seen play out in other countries have not shown itself in the u s to front run something that has not occurred assumes you are correct to anticipate it occurring in the future it is pure speculation and quite a leap even for those smart phds at the fed overall the u s economy appears likely to expand at a moderate pace over the second half of 2007 with growth then strengthening a bit in 2008 to a rate close to the economy s underlying trend ben bernanke testimony to senate banking committee july 2007 although we have not actually seen this dynamic play out in the u s since the great depression fed officials are so concerned about deflation that they have begun telegraphing their intent to allow inflation to overshoot their 2 target based on current fed guidance periods of lesser inflation would be offset by periods of higher inflation our question is how do they come to that conclusion and based on what analytical rigor and evidence there is by the way evidence from other countries throughout the history of humanity that when money is printed to accommodate the spending incontinence of politicians people lose confidence in the domestic currency that would be devastatingly inflationary and it is without question of measurements where we are headed the next inconsistency is that the fed s protracted engagement in quantitative easing qe over the past ten years has created precisely the circumstances about which powell warns here less room to reduce interest rates to the detriment of american families and businesses the chairman of the u s fed jerome powell should understand how supply and demand works but as a reminder the less available something is everything else constant the more it is worth mr chairman your predecessors removed 3 5 trillion of bonds from the market what did you think would happen to bond prices and therefore yields powell stumbled head first into that self contradiction especially after watching the fantastic failure to normalize rates through rate hikes and quantitative tightening qt earlier in 2019 which caused him to perform a hasty 180 degree policy reversal in the fall of 2019 we think this is a workable plan and it will as one of my colleagues president harker described it it will be like watching paint dry that this will just be something that runs quietly in the background janet yellen federal reserve chairman june 14 2017 fomc press conference contrary to the reassurances of janet yellen and many other fed members it qt was a lot more exciting than watching paint dry that too is troubling wise owl in a recent interview on realvision tv james grant publisher of grants interest rate observer said is inflation a thing of the past are forces in place today that could reproduce the great inflation of the 1970s inflation by definition represents a loss of confidence in money how do you lose confidence in money well you create too much of it to subsidize the spending habits of the politicians that s one possible cause and are we on the way to something like that well possibly in this splendid economy we re generating a trillion dollar budget deficit grant continues then two there is the physical structure of the economy we live in a world of expedited delivery of just in time rather than just in case we live in a world of ubiquitous information about supply chains but maybe if push comes to shove in the world of geopolitics the supply chains might break lo and behold we might be on our own in america for things we now import and if we are those prices would not be so low they would be much higher again pointing back to our recent article referenced above jerome powell the fed s great betrayal there are other indicators of inflation that contradict what the fed believes in that article we discussed real world examples such as m2 growth and auto and housing prices to contrast with the bls and fed engineered metrics despite a plethora of readily available data to the contrary we are continually reminded by the fed of the absence of inflation as we know the fed just began another round of radical policy accommodation to incite higher inflation if you pre suppose a confluence of circumstances that begins to constrict global supply chains then the inflation grant theorizes might not be so far fetched the fed as has historically been the case would be caught looking the wrong way and given their proclivity toward wanting more inflation it would almost certainly be too late to respond moreover the agencies have made clear that no bank is too big too fail so that bank management shareholders and un insured debt holders understand that they will not escape the consequences of excessive risk taking in short although vigilance is necessary i believe the systemic risk inherent in the banking system is well managed and well controlled benjamin s bernanke fed chairman confirmation hearing november 15 2005 rather than making management shareholders and debt holders feel the consequences of their risk taking you bailed them out in short you are the definition of moral hazard senator jim bunning at bernanke second confirmation hearing december 3 2009 in the same way there were recorded levels of laughter in fomc meetings at the absurd incentives homebuilders were offering to sell houses in 2004 2005 and 2006 the fed is now equally blind neglect and arrogant concerning the perceived absence of inflation the laughter in the eccles building boardroom stopped abruptly in mid 2007 as the housing market stalled the coronavirus may be a similar wake up call with serious economic consequences here and now the situation that is developing illustrates the one dimensional nature of fed thinking despite having the latest news on the spread of the corona virus at the january 29 2020 federal open market committee fomc meeting the fed s concern was for a slowdown in global growth and failed attempts to prime inflation there was no consideration for possible second and third order effects of the virus what are the possible second and third order effects they are the things that follow after the obvious occurs in this case there is no question that china s growth is going to be hurt by the virus and quarantines the restrictions on flight and travel and factory shutdowns that is obvious consider the virus is now spreading rapidly to other suppliers of u s goods and services such as korea japan and italy what might not be obvious is that the growing problem will impede global commerce and cause fractures in the extensive and complex network of global supply chains goods and services we are accustomed to finding on the shelves of the local wal mart or via the internet may not be available to us or if they are they may come at a cost well above the price we paid before the pandemic if that occurs those changes in prices will eventually find their way to the bls inflation data collectors and then as the old saying goes all bets are off summary there are plenty of uncertainties in the world individuals have the decision making ability to evaluate those uncertainties and the risks they pose that said it is difficult to remember a time when the potential turbulence we face has been so broadly ignored by the market and so overlooked by the fed and politicians it is as though we have been tranquilized by the ever rising stock market and net worth as an artifact of that fallacious indicator of security by all appearances stock index levels convey not a worry in the world indeed life is good today we are just

financial officer will then discuss the company s financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 as well as the guidance for 2020 i would now like to turn the call over to ken ken romanzi president and chief executive officer good afternoon thank you all for joining us today for our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call today i d like to cover three topics first i ll provide a quick recap of fourth quarter and full year 2019 performance second i d like to share my perspective on b g foods performance in 2019 against the plan we developed as a new management team as of april of this past year and how i view this in the context of our stock performance over the past year and third i ll provide an outlook of where we expect to go in 2020 and beyond first a quick recap of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 results during the quarter we reported net sales of 470 2 million an increase of 2 6 versus last year leading to full year net sales of 1 660 400 000 a decrease of 2 4 versus prior year primarily driven by the sale of pirate brands 10 stocks we like better than b g foods when investing geniuses david and tom gardner have a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market david and tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and b g foods wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of december 1 2019 excluding that sale full year net sales increased 2 1 adjusted ebitda was 69 5 million for the quarter an increase of 18 8 versus the year ago quarter this resulted in full year adjusted ebitda of 302 5 million a decrease of 3 7 versus last year also primarily driven by the sale of pirate brands and was at the midpoint of our latest guidance excluding pirate brands adjusted ebitda grew 2 8 versus full year 2018 so all in all we delivered stable expected performance i view this as very important because after many years of industry leading performance our earnings stumbled in 2017 and 2018 with fourth quarter earnings surprises even while growing sales so delivering what was expected in 2019 was critical for our new leadership team our plan in 2019 was to deliver modest sales growth and cover inflationary input costs with pricing and cost savings initiatives and that s exactly what we did while we needed some help from the addition of clabber girl we grew net sales 2 1 excluding the pirate brands divestiture while we also reduced low margin trade promotion activity and skus we delivered pricing of 20 3 million on the high side of our planned range of 15 million to 20 million we did this through a combination of list pricing earlier in the year and the removal of very low margin trade deals in the second half of the year and while we saw consumption declines in the third and fourth quarter much of that was planned and we did not significantly hurt our bottom line while taking price is never easy to achieve particularly in today s competitive environment i believe our efforts over the past two years demonstrate our ability to take price when needed to help offset input cost inflation on the cost savings front we delivered 20 million again at the high side of our planned target of 15 million to 20 million for the year primarily driven by terrific work in our logistics infrastructure plus some other areas in 2020 we ll dig deeper into our cost structure and expect to drive another 15 million to 20 million in cost savings and should be in a position to provide more detail on those opportunities in the coming months key highlights and accomplishments from 2019 include in april of last year we realigned our executive leadership team with new heads of sales marketing and supply chain it s a terrific complementary combination of new team members and b g veterans we completed the successful implementation of our new oracle jd edwards erp system and i m pleased to report that the system is up and running with minimal disruption we re looking forward to taking advantage of the many benefits of the system which we expect will help us streamline operations drive efficiencies in our finance and accounting processes and improve our operational planning and financial forecasting the green giant brand continued to march against its vision to be the plant based veggie brand of the future by delivering its mission to get people to eat more vegetables with continued growth of category reinventing innovation while green giant s growth slowed in 2019 primarily due to the reduction of low margin trade deals on legacy product lines and less innovation than in 2018 new products launched under green giant since b g foods acquired the brand in 2015 are now at an annual run rate of more than 200 million in retail sales while delivering more than 0 5 billion cumulatively over that time period in addition green giant has almost single handedly revolutionized the frozen vegetable category and we ve only just begun in 2020 we re launching a range of innovation across both the frozen food and dry grocery aisles more on that a bit later we acquired clabber girl fully integrating the business into our sales and distribution network we are very pleased with the results of this acquisition to date and clabber girl s dedicated employees who have joined the b g foods family i d also like to thank the b g integration team for their tremendous efforts to make the transition as smooth as possible we completed a successful 1 billion debt refinancing the largest in our company s history and at very attractive interest rates that included the second lowest coupon in company history of 5 25 we returned 123 7 million of cash to our shareholders in the form of dividends during fiscal 2019 which is consistent with our long standing dividend policy that have served our shareholders very well since our ipo back in 2004 and our board and management remain committed to returning cash to our shareholders we also returned an additional 34 7 million to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases during fiscal 2019 while share repurchases have not historically been a primary piece of our capital allocation strategy management and our board of directors both recognize that our share price is undervalued and people should not be surprised to see us step into the market to buy back our shares from time to time so stepping back the elephant in the room and the question everybody asking is why is our stock so low well in my first year as ceo i have listened to many investors debt holders bankers and advisors and there are clearly three large issues depressing our stock over the last year first there s been concern that after two years of disappointing investors with fourth quarter earnings results we would disappoint again in 2019 given the large increase we needed in q4 to hit our guidance and more recently our stock has been under greater pressure due to concerns over fourth quarter nielsen consumption trends second there is an investor fear that we ll cut our dividend driven by our high yield and concern that we don t generate enough free cash flow to cover it and third our leverage is too high at 6 1 times pro forma adjusted ebitda before share based compensation to net debt hampering our ability to continue our long term successful strategy of growth through accretive acquisitions so i d like to address each and every one of these issues first i hope our fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings announcement shows we can get back to growth through accretive acquisitions and deliver what we say we will deliver and while our volumes were on the low side of our expectations in the fourth quarter pricing was on the high side this is always a delicate balance and we ll continue to balance these two important levers as we move forward so while we are not declaring victory yet we see 2019 as the first year of many in improved expected performance second we have no plans to cut the dividend under our current operating model and assumptions we continue to believe in the dividend because that is the vehicle upon which this company was built we also believe that under normal operating conditions we generate enough cash flow to cover the dividend however as you ll see from our net cash from operations in 2019 and as bruce will discuss in more detail we had several onetime uses of cash in 2019 including a very sizable tax bill related to a gain on sale from the sale of pirate brands share repurchases and investments in working capital that increased our debt but we do not see these same uses of cash continuing in 2020 and bruce will share our cash flow plan that should give you the confidence in our dividend as we lastly we understand investor concern over our debt leverage we are committed to create excess cash flow to help reduce leverage later bruce will share our plan to get our leverage below six times in our 2020 plan in addition we do not believe we re shut out of acquiring more businesses the m a pipeline is active and we believe opportunities remain to acquire businesses without increasing leverage and that in some cases may actually help reduce leverage so in summary we realize we have to deliver consistent results to gain investor confidence in b g foods the b g model has worked for a very long time and we believe it can continue to work for a long time to come we see 2019 as the start of a new era here at b g so now on to 2020 for 2020 our long term strategic imperatives remain the same drive organic growth of 0 to 2 improve margins make accretive acquisitions and building a winning workplace we plan to drive organic growth through key brands like green giant ortega mrs dash and mccann s among others while maintaining a large portfolio of stable brands and managing our remaining brands for cash flow in 2020 we expect our net sales to grow about 1 as we drive growth on several of our key brands but our growth will be tempered down a bit as we continue to reduce low margin trade promotion and skus and overlap the loss of some low margin private label spice business we expect green giant to lead the charge again in 2020 through the introduction of a range of innovation across frozen food categories outside of frozen vegetables including cauliflower hash browns cauliflower crust pizza cauliflower gnocchi and cauliflower breadsticks frozen breadsticks made with 40 cauliflower and we re not stopping there building on the tremendous success of green giant riced veggies in the frozen aisle which is now an 80 million business annually we are launching green giant riced veggies in the shelf stable rice aisle shelf stable rice is a large 3 billion category with little innovation our shelf stable green giant riced veggies are made from 100 veggies featuring blends of legumes and veggies like cauliflower peas lentils and chickpeas green giant riced veggies taste and perform like regular rice but are chockful of vegetables with less carbohydrates and more protein we expect green giant growth to be driven further by the acquisition of farmwise which we just announced last wednesday farmwise is a small but very prolific forward thinking frozen veggie brand that will allow us to quickly commercialize products from their innovation pipeline and introduce them under the green giant brand in the traditional food channel and under the farmwise name in the natural channel where the green giant brand isn t a good fit we are very excited about this small acquisition with quick scale up capability and a good example of what i meant when i said it s a new era at b g all in all we expect 20 million in new sales from green giant innovation in 2020 but green giant won t have to carry the load alone our second largest brand ortega has grown steadily under b g foods ownership since 2003 and we remain very bullish on the mexican food category as leaders in veggie forward plant based innovation we are bringing some of the magic of green giant to ortega through the introduction of ortega cauliflower taco shells and ortega cauliflower tortillas made with over 25 cauliflower now ortega can help people get more vegetables in their diet while they enjoy taco tuesdays in addition we ll launch a line of ortega street taco sauces each with a unique and contemporary flavor capitalizing on the current food truck craze we expect further growth to be driven by the continued distribution expansion of mccann s irish oatmeal the small acquisition we made in 2018 we ve been expanding mccann s in both the u s and canada throughout 2019 and are receiving terrific retailer acceptance mccann s consumption accelerated to 6 5 in the latest quarter our second strategic imperative is focused on improving margins and while inflation appears to be more modest in 2020 than it has been over the last two years we still expect to see increased costs whether it be for inputs tariffs or labor to help offset these continued pressures and to work toward improving our margins we have extended our cost reduction program beyond our original goal of 50 million to date we have taken out approximately 25 million in costs since 2017 when we set our goal and our goal going forward is to reduce costs by 15 million to 20 million per year over the next three years we expect to do this by continuing to optimize our logistics network reducing product and packaging costs and stepping up the efforts to optimize our manufacturing network we plan to announce several initiatives in this area throughout 2020 as far as pricing goes we have achieved significant pricing over the past two years and should continue to benefit from some pricing overlap in 2020 we ll continue to refine the delicate trade promotion plans to optimize price volume mix and for 2020 we expect pricing to be 3 million to 5 million our third imperative is to continue our strategy of accretive acquisitions acquiring and integrating businesses has been a part of the b g strategy since the beginning and we expect that to continue well into the future we are always on the lookout for branded food products with defensible market positions and center store opportunities with high stable margins and good cash flow we also focus on acquiring like products to facilitate sales manufacturing distribution and g a synergies and importantly acquiring brands at accretive multiples we were able to achieve this in 2019 with clabber girl and an active m a market in the industry should give us the opportunity to acquire businesses without pressure on our leverage and last but not least b g wouldn t be b g without the incredible team members we have our focus remains on building a winning workplace to make sure we re always operating at our best we ve been investing a lot in people process and systems to improve our execution we strengthened our organization in 2019 including an organizational redesign talent enhancements and systems improvements such as our new erp systems integration in 2020 we ll begin to reap the benefits of the new system through better financial planning and forecasting and inventory management in addition this year we re implementing a new trade promotion management system that should allow us to better manage our large trade promotion spend so in closing 2019 was a year to get b g foods back on track and we re confident that we will continue to make progress in 2020 against improved sustainable performance now i d like to turn the call over to bruce to discuss the details of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance bruce bruce wacha chief financial officer thank you ken good afternoon everyone as ken just outlined we had a strong finish to 2019 with a solid fourth quarter that continued the momentum that we saw in the business in both the second and third quarters of our fiscal year we reported net sales of 470 2 million and adjusted ebitda of 69 5 million in the fourth quarter leading to full year net sales of 1 66 billion and adjusted ebitda of 302 5 million for 2019 adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales was 14 8 for the quarter which represents a 200 basis point improvement over the prior year period and separately we generated adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales of 18 2 for full fiscal year 2019 which was in line with our expectations after adjusting for approximately 74 9 million in net sales for pirate brands in fiscal 2018 our fiscal 2019 net sales represented an increase of 34 5 million or 2 1 over last year the acquisition of clabber girl in may 2019 benefited the company and contributed approximately 53 6 million to fiscal 2019 net sales base business net sales which excludes the impact of m a decreased by 22 2 million or 1 4 fiscal 2019 net sales benefited from approximately 20 3 million in pricing inclusive of our spring 2019 list price increase and our trade spend optimization program these pricing benefits were offset by approximately 42 4 million from reduced volumes in our base business that were driven in part by our trade optimization program as well as an active effort to reduce unprofitable and lower margin skus among our larger brands green giant was up 7 8 million or 1 5 with a strong first half of the year that was driven by both our new 2019 innovations as well as continued growth by previous year innovations like green giant riced veggies and green giant veggie spirals plus distribution gains in the dollar channel for our shelf stable green giant products these gains were offset in part by reduced volumes of our frozen bag and our frozen bag in a box products in the second half of the year as we altered some of our key trade programs during the non holiday portion of the year as we have stated previously green giant saw just one wave of innovation launches in 2019 compared to two in 2018 we also believe the reception of our 2020 launches will be more in line with some of the other frozen some of the other successful frozen innovation launches we think we have some big ideas in store for 2020 among our other larger brands new york style had another successful year and net sales increased by 2 1 million or 5 7 maple grove farms increased by 2 6 million or 3 7 ortega and victoria were essentially flat or down by 0 6 and 0 7 respectively cream of wheat following a strong 2018 performance that was driven by a cold winter was off by 2 6 million or 4 2 driven in part by a much more mild winter season net sales for our spices and seasonings business inclusive of ac cent mrs dash sasón and the business that we acquired in 2016 was down 4 6 million or 1 4 both ac cent and mrs dash were up modestly while the rest of the business was negatively impacted by lower pricing of some commodity spices as a result of decreases in commodity input costs primarily garlic and black pepper as well as some losses in certain low profit private label contracts despite the lower sales profits in our spices and seasonings business remain strong and have outperformed our original m a model our recently acquired brands also performed well in 2019 with clabber girl which was acquired in may 2019 generating some 53 6 million in net sales slightly ahead of plan and mccann s irish oatmeal which was acquired in july 2018 generating approximately 12 1 million in net sales in 2019 mccann s had generated approximately 5 3 million in net sales during the period that we owned the business in 2018 while we have spent a lot of time discussing clabber girl s performance in 2019 mccann s has also done well as we continue to expand distribution and net sales for the brand mccann s net sales were up 7 5 in the fourth quarter of 2019 when compared to our first full quarter of ownership for the business in fourth quarter 2018 gross profit was 383 1 million for fiscal 2019 or 23 1 of net sales excluding the negative impact of approximately 22 million of acquisition divestiture related and nonrecurring expenses during fiscal 2019 the company s gross profit would have been 405 1 million or 24 4 of net sales gross profit was 349 5 million for fiscal 2018 or 20 5 of net sales excluding the negative impact of 76 3 million of acquisition divestiture related and other nonrecurring expenses during fiscal 2018 the company s gross profit would have been 425 8 million or 25 of net sales our plan in 2019 was to increase pricing and implement cost savings initiatives to offset inflation in order to maintain gross profit margins and for the most part that is exactly what happened for full year 2019 gross profit benefited from an increase in net pricing of 20 3 million just ahead of our full year target of 15 million to 20 million likewise our cost savings initiatives also came in at the high end of our 15 million to 20 million plan for the year with approximately 20 million of cost savings realized in 2019 the successful realignment of our dry and frozen distribution networks was the largest contributor of the savings as we took more than 19 million miles out of our network we also saw benefits from improved procurement packaging and weight outs as well as the g a rationalization that we implemented earlier in the year these initiatives in addition to the pirate brands divestiture helped lower our cost of goods sold inclusive of the cost of materials labor overhead freight and warehousing from 1 35 billion in 2018 to 1 28 billion in 2019 cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was 76 9 in 2019 compared to 79 5 in 2018 despite increased input costs that we faced particularly driven by a second consecutive short agricultural crop that negatively impacted our green giant margins increased tariffs and increased can prices resulting from higher steel and aluminum prices selling general and administrative expenses decreased 6 7 million or 4 to 160 7 million for fiscal 2019 from 167 4 million for fiscal 2018 the decrease was composed of decreases in consumer marketing expenses of 5 7 million warehouse expenses of 2 7 million selling expenses of 2 5 million and acquisition divestiture related and nonrecurring expenses of 0 2 million partially offset by an increase in other general and administrative expenses of 4 4 million expressed as a percentage of net sales selling general and administrative expenses improved by 0 1 percentage point to 9 7 for fiscal 2019 compared to 9 8 for fiscal 2018 we generated 302 5 million in adjusted ebitda in fiscal 2019 compared to 314 2 million in the prior year as a reminder 2018 adjusted ebitda included roughly 20 million in contribution from pirate brands which was sold during the fourth quarter of 2019 as we first highlighted nearly a year ago when we initially laid out our guidance for 2019 we expected to see reduced sales and adjusted ebitda in each of the first three quarters as we lapped the sale of pirate we then expected to see a favorable fourth quarter finish to the year with pirate generating just 2 million or so in net sales during the fourth quarter of 2018 and this is exactly what happened we generated 69 5 million in adjusted ebitda in the fourth quarter of 2019 an increase of 11 million or 18 8 from the year ago period adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales was 14 8 in the fourth quarter of 2019 which represents approximately 200 basis point increase from the 12 8 generated in the fourth quarter of 2018 full year 2019 adjusted ebitda as a percentage of net sales was 18 2 which is largely in line with our expectations and the 18 5 generated in the prior year we generated 1 64 in adjusted diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2019 compared to 1 85 per share in 2018 the decrease was primarily driven by the lost contribution resulting from the sale of pirate brands in late 2018 offset in part by an incremental contribution from the acquisition of clabber girl in mid 2019 the lower interest expense resulting from our reduction in debt following the sale of pirate brands and a small reduction in our share count resulting from our share repurchase efforts despite the overall interest savings for the year interest expense was negatively impacted in the fourth quarter of 2019 by approximately 512 000 or nearly 0 01 per share following our fall 2019 debt refinancing by the negative carry of both our 4 5 8 notes that we retired and our newly issued 5 1 4 notes which occurred for about 14 days during the mandatory call notice period before the 4 5 8 notes were ultimately retired the b g foods management team and our board of directors remain true to our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders which in 2019 consisted of 123 7 million in cash dividends paid to our shareholders or 1 90 per share as well as share repurchases that we made in the open market during fiscal 2019 we repurchased 34 7 million in shares at an average price of 19 95 per share which reduced our share count by 1 7 million to 64 04 million shares the 2019 share repurchases followed our 2018 share repurchases of 26 9 million of common stock or approximately 1 million shares at an average price of 27 17 in fiscal 2019 we generated 120 4 million in net cash from operations after adjusting for the 73 9 million of negative tax impact from our gain on sale of pirate brands as we highlighted during previous calls we sold pirates in 2018 for a great price which resulted in a fantastic return on our investment but also in a tax obligation that came due in 2019 separately in 2019 we had a 70 4 million invested in net working capital or accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable net cash from operations after adjusting for the pirate gain on sale tax and assuming a flat net working capital number would have been approximately 190 8 million while inventory crept back up on us a little bit at the end of 2019 we think that this creates a nice opportunity for us in 2020 we expect normalized working capital levels to create an additional 35 million to 45 million in net cash from operations and to provide a cushion for our expected 122 million of dividends during 2020 and now i would like to review our guidance for 2020 we expect net sales to be in the range of 1 66 billion to 1 68 billion we expect net sales to be positively impacted by a full year of clabber girl clabber girl which was acquired in may 2019 and generated approximately 50 million to 55 million in net sales under our watch in 2019 should generate an additional 20 million or so in fiscal 2020 we also expect a strong year for green giant with a strong series of innovation launches this year including green giant riced veggies cauliflower hash browns cauliflower crust pizza cauliflower and spinach gnocchi and cauliflower breadsticks as ken mentioned earlier we expect our green giant frozen innovation efforts to also receive an extra boost this year and again in 2021 following our acquisition of farmwise which was just announced last week farmwise is the proud creator of veggie fries veggie tots and veggie rings we think that the addition of these products to our frozen portfolio will be extremely complementary to our efforts to revolutionize the frozen vegetable set on the downside we expect to see a reduction in our commodity spice sales by approximately 20 million to 25 million as we continue to pare back certain lower margin private label and foodservice contracts we also expect to see some softer sales at the company level in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of our trade spend optimization program while pricing came in at the high end of our expectations in 4q and full year 2019 our volumes were a little softer than we wanted we expect a similar performance dynamic in the first quarter of this year from a sales standpoint trade spending may be an area that we tweak further throughout the year as we may very well strategically invest in trade for some of our more elastic brands to optimize performance now back to the rest of our fiscal 2020 guidance we expect adjusted ebitda of 302 5 million to 312 5 million adjusted earnings per share of 1 60 to 1 80 a cash working capital benefit of approximately 35 million to 45 million net interest expense of 98 million to 103 million including cash interest expense of 94 million to 99 million and interest amortization expense of 3 5 million depreciation expense of approximately 45 million amortization expense of approximately 19 million an effective tax rate of approximately 25 to 26 cash taxes of approximately 10 million to 20 million and finally we anticipate capex to be approximately 40 million to 45 million in fiscal 2020 which is slightly below last year based on the midpoint of our adjusted ebitda guidance range we expect that our adjusted ebitda less capex cash taxes and cash interest will be approximately 150 million to 155 million we also expect to see an additional 35 million to 45 million cash benefit from an anticipated reduction in working capital taking this number closer to 185 million to 200 million which should leave us with a reasonable cushion from which to pay our annual dividend of approximately 122 million absent acquisitions we expect our net debt to adjusted ebitda before share based compensation as per our covenant calculation in our credit agreement to be approximately 5 7 to 5 9 times by the end of fiscal 2020 this concludes our remarks and now we would like to begin the q a portion of our call operator questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with barclays please proceed with your question andrew lazar barclays analyst good afternoon everybody ken romanzi president and chief executive officer hey andrew bruce wacha chief financial officer hi andrew lazar barclays analyst hi a couple of quick things from me i guess first off i wanted to just trying to get a sense of a little bit of a disparity that we ve seen over the course of the quarter between the green giant sales performance that you talked about today on the call and maybe what we ve seen in some of the scanner data perhaps it doesn t take into account some of the areas that are growing in that franchise but just want to make sure i get a sense of what if any disparity we see there because i think sales were up a little bit for green giant and obviously in scanner it s been a little weaker ken romanzi president and chief executive officer yes so well first of all green that s u s green giant has had we had a terrific year in canada plus there are some unmeasured channels but green giant sales were softer in total not quite as soft as what scanner showed but a lot of that was the effect of our trade promotion reduction program but we expect to be through that in the first quarter and on to the more normalized green giant results with stepped up innovation and not nearly as much cutbacks on trade post the first quarter of this year andrew lazar barclays analyst got it ok thanks for that and then i think you talked about what you anticipate for incremental sales in 2020 from clabber girl do you have something similar for ebitda as i recall you weren t expecting a whole lot of benefit in 19 on ebitda from clabber girl so even though it s only in the base for kind of half of the year in 2020 is it more that you get closer to a full year of incrementality on ebitda maybe i was thinking somewhere around 20 million or i might have been wrong bruce wacha chief financial officer sure so clabber girl was a positive in fiscal 19 it ll be a positive again in fiscal 20 a couple of million dollars in the first half of fiscal 20 andrew lazar barclays analyst ok so you did actually end up getting some benefit as it went down bruce wacha chief financial officer yes we got some benefit in the second half of fiscal 19 and we have clabber obviously baked into our 2020 guidance ken romanzi president and chief executive officer more than we thought andrew lazar barclays analyst ok and then last thing would be a little broader from just the frozen industry standpoint we just hear a lot from any number of other companies that operate in the space whether it be your area frozen vegetables or more broadly frozen meals and such about just a lot of change and disruption at the retail level in terms of things that they re trying to do whether it be changing timing around freezer shelf resets moving things forward maybe because of all the innovation being brought to the market the whole sort of move toward click and collect and having to sort of get rid of let s say or take off the shelf some of the slower turning items so you have more phasings of the things that have the highest velocity for click and collect and have the holding power at grocery there s just a lot of different sort of trends happening and dynamics happening i was hoping maybe you could put your perspective on it as it relates to what you see and more specific to your business if it s having any impact like that on your business at all ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well when you just described what you ve been hearing in frozen you could say that about the whole store so there are a lot of times where reset timing changes customers change when they want to we ve even stated that we went from two innovation launches in frozen in a year to our major retailers only wanted to reset the shelf once however with the increase in innovation from everybody they have to figure out they don t want to pass up and wait to launch the innovation so i wouldn t say frozen is necessarily any more volatile than the rest of the store when there s lots of innovation that comes retailers have their set time frames sometimes they change them it is very hard to get retailers all in the same time frame because they are their own individual our major new muscle we have to exercise going forward is while we had good rhythm launching frozen vegetables our new innovation is now going to go across multiple frozen categories so when we recount that we re going to launch pizzas breadsticks a few new items in vegetables as well as gnocchi that s four different that could be four different reset timing because there are different categories within the frozen food set so how it pertains to our businesses is i can t tell you exactly each retailer when we re going to launch because it s going to be multiple dates that those are going to be launched in multiple retailers so there is a lot of noise but i wouldn t say that frozen is any more difficult than any other active category in the store andrew lazar barclays analyst got it thanks very much for the color ken romanzi president and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of karru martinson with jefferies please proceed with your question karru martinson jefferies analyst i guess in that same vein when do we see the new green giant products on the shelf i wanted to get a little more color on when do we see shelf stable veggie rice out there and just a housekeeping i thought i heard the number of 20 million in new product sales for 2020 is that correct ken romanzi president and chief executive officer yes karru martinson jefferies analyst ok and then how should we think about the cadence i mean i recognize that everyone has their own time but when is this going to be more back half weighted more front half how should we think about that ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well some of the items we launched already in the fourth quarter with some customers that took them early and they re going to be launching all throughout first quarter and beyond specifically you asked about the rice veggie shelf stable that s not going to first launch until the second quarter but i can t promise you but the acceptance in the first ship differs by customer all throughout the year said another way 20 million in new product sales aren t the annual run rate it s what we re adding up based on how best we can project the distribution level we re going to achieve and when the first ship date is by customer imagine a grid of 15 new skus across all the retailers all shipping at the first ships at different times karru martinson jefferies analyst absolutely and when you guys look at the portfolio i mean how do you guys balance the volume declines that you ve been seeing with the pricing what is the optimum mix that you guys would like to get to in terms of the elasticity of the products ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well we ve answered this question over the past couple of years because in 2018 we took more just straight list pricing which is a little bit more predictable in what the elasticities are and we came in pretty much where we thought we d come in but that s a base price of maybe 0 10 or maybe 0 20 a unit in everyday price it doesn t normally show up in huge swings of volume either way you might have a little bit of volume downtick some of our brands proved to be pretty inelastic of pricing in 2018 so it delivered in 2019 we really transitioned to not only did some list pricing but transition to cutting back on some very very deep discounting on a few categories when you talk about elasticity then that s much much greater swings of elasticity because you re talking about changing very very low promoted price points with in many times excess merchandising that goes along with them and forecasting and guessing the volume decline on that is very complicated you learn over time and there may be places as bruce mentioned where we lost a little more volume than we thought we might want to get some of that back but it s not like we re going to do a wholesale change we knew and said we were going to have less volumes because we were giving up very very deep discounting many at low and below margin so it s why we were able to withstand a little bit of sales on the lower end and hit our ebitda guidance because a lot of them were empty cases karru martinson jefferies analyst ok and just lastly you guys called out last quarter higher garlic costs due to the tariffs and now with the coronavirus we ve been hearing reports that garlic prices again are going up just because there s not enough production coming out of china just thinking of that as a lead in to how you re looking at inputs and your ability to kind of price through for that ken romanzi president and chief executive officer we have some ability so we re securing garlic supply so we are already in we have good supply already in inventory from china but we re also looking at other regions to make sure we re protected and never have an interruption of supply so there is going to be an uptick in our costs and that s probably one of the biggest upticks in cost we haven t really seen a lot of other volatility but there is an uptick in garlic cost and the way that many of our spice contracts are written we can pass some of that along it s more commodity based and as bruce said we had negative pricing last year on spices because we gave back some of the commodity savings we got so it s not 100 pass through either way but it does go in tandem in the spice world operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bryan hunt with wells fargo please proceed with your question bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst thanks for your time this afternoon i was wondering if you could maybe help bridge out the remainder of the 1 to 4 ebitda growth for 2020 you gave us a little bit of contribution a couple of million from clabber girl again i was wondering if you can help cover the rest of it ken romanzi president and chief executive officer go ahead bruce wacha chief financial officer yes so there should be a little bit of green giant from incremental sales and then we referenced a small price increase which is really the wraparound benefit of last year and some more cost savings efforts all of that ll contribute and offset some increased costs bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst very good next i was wondering if you could just touch on farmwise maybe what the acquisition costs are i mean is for that business and maybe what the sales and ebitda contribution might be for 2020 there as well bruce wacha chief financial officer yes it s small less than 5 million in all cases and this was less an acquisition around a business that s generating ebitda that we re going to leverage this year and more about as ken likes to describe it it s a research lab in this sense product innovation demonstrated ability to launch into the natural channel and products that are very complementary with what we re looking to do with green giant ken romanzi president and chief executive officer yes this business as it comes in will have de minimis impact on our numbers it really is a it s the accelerating of green giant innovation going forward and we haven t yet even developed a plan for what we re going to do with farmwise in the natural channel we are very excited about our access into the natural channel which will probably be more of a 2021 opportunity all of this great veggie innovation we don t have any green giant in the natural channel they don t want mainstream brands so we see farmwise as a great ability for b g to now have access with our great innovation engine both the b g innovation engine as well as the farmwise engine to take farmwise and build it in the natural channel bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst very good i was wondering if you could also touch about and you talked a lot about innovation when you look across your portfolio of innovation how wide is the acceptance of items such as cauliflower breadsticks and the cauliflower and corn blended shells at ortega ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well if you look at food because xaoc as measured by nielsen has got convenience stores and stuff like that in it which are hard to measure and not really appropriate for a lot of our products so if you look at food distribution our food distribution on green giant as a brand is very high it s in the 80 90 range a lot of our top selling innovation gets 75 or more distribution on our innovation on green giant on ortega i don t believe we re that high yet but we re presenting every day to customers so i don t have the final number about what acv distribution is but it s clearly going to be somewhere in the 50 to 70 range on the innovation given there are high priority launches so we want to do innovation on the big brands so that we can get more national distribution and innovation on a regional brand is just not going to amount to all that much bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst do you believe the discrepancy between what you just reported for green giant and the nielsen data it was just you had better growth in placement in non measured channels is that kind of a fair assessment of the situation ken romanzi president and chief executive officer a little bit but canada was probably the biggest driver of the difference between this you don t see canadian consumption numbers but green giant did have a slowdown in sales but again a lot of that was due to the pullback we did on trade bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst very good i will hand it off to somebody else oh i m sorry last question when you look at the proposed improvement in leverage to 5 7 to 5 9 what does that imply with your discussions with the agencies does that get you into a spot where you re able to maintain the b to b bruce wacha chief financial officer we would love to maintain our existing ratings and improve them probably not appropriate for me to comment on conversations with the analysts but certainly our ratings are important to us our cost of debt is important to us we ve been very fortunate with pricing on our debt as ken mentioned earlier we just did a debt refinancing last fall our largest ever and one of our largest coupons ever and so that s obviously important to us bryan hunt wells fargo securities analyst very good have a good evening bruce wacha chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rob dickerson with jefferies please proceed with your question rob dickerson jefferies analyst great thank you so much bruce it sounds like you said some of the year over year ebitda uptick you expect in 2020 maybe driven by savings i m assuming that includes say the 15 million 20 million you mentioned in the prepared remarks each of the next three years or is there other kind of regular productivity i m really just asking to see if we think about that bruce wacha chief financial officer yes that is the productivity that s exactly what we re talking about that s it rob dickerson jefferies analyst ok so like if we re thinking about the 15 million to 20 million each year over the next three years i m assuming there s some plan to reinvest some if not all of that back just given obviously like the competitive dynamics increase you re posting some volume pressure the trade spend you pulled back in but you never know you might have to put more of that back in so like if we re all forecasting the next three years we shouldn t be taking call it 17 5 million per year and dropping that to the bottom line bruce wacha chief financial officer you are absolutely correct rob dickerson jefferies analyst ok thanks and then just ken romanzi president and chief executive officer yes our model is really to provide some stability to our earnings going forward we re not going to be presenting huge increases in base business earnings it s really to get back on track to being kind of the steady eddy performance that b g has always been known for and then get back to accretive acquisitions the problem over the last few years before 19 was that while we continued on the acquisition hunt we had a little we had leakage and so our acquisitions weren t accretive not because the acquisitions didn t perform but because we had a leaky bucket so our goal is to stop the leaky bucket which we did last year and clabber girl helped us grow a little bit ex pirates because there s been so much noise with pirates in and out and so going forward we re saying we re going to have stability in top line and bottom line we need to do cost productivity to offset inflation and maybe drop some of that to the bottom line maybe invest some in marketing but then make sure that our balance sheet can be prepared to do the accretive acquisitions and that s a little tricky with our debt the way it is right now quite frankly but not impossible we did it with clabber and as we said in our remarks there s opportunities we re looking at that will not put pressure on our leverage but will help us grow our ebitda which is what this company has been doing for over 20 years rob dickerson jefferies analyst fair enough and then just quickly on the dividend you stated upfront there are three issues that probably pressured the stock one of them you called out was the dividend so i m just curious you said in the prepared remarks not trimming the dividend because that s kind of how the company was built which i understand to an extent but then i also have to ask why not allocate more capital to acquisitions and kind of just trying to understand a little bit better just the process behind the capital allocation strategy given your dividend yield is materially higher than the highest next to you within this space that s all thanks bruce wacha chief financial officer sure and i think the board and the management team ken and i included have had a consistent view on this and we went public on the idea of returning excess cash to shareholders we view the dividend policy based on our cash generation and the cash generation that s here with the company we do think the yield doesn t make a lot of sense but we never set the dividend policy based on yield it s been more a function of the cash flows and our view is just the dividend yield doesn t make sense because the stock price doesn t make sense rob dickerson jefferies analyst ok great thanks guys bruce wacha chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of hale holden with barclays please proceed with your question hale holden barclays analyst hi thanks for taking the call i had two questions for you the first it s been a little while since we ve talked about ortega growth and you talked about the innovation and then in response to bryan s question gave a little bit of schematics on kind of where you were in distribution but is it just sort of the new veggie tacos that you re looking at on the street sauces or is it distribution gains and what would it take to get that to kind of a low single digit growth as a brand ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well it s definitely the launch of we think the probably the biggest news in taco shells since the taco shells so with those launches and of that in the taco sauces and good acceptance we should see some you got it some low single digit growth hale holden barclays analyst and does that take more marketing and noise around to do that or ken romanzi president and chief executive officer excuse me i m sorry hale holden barclays analyst would that take more marketing support to do ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well we have marketing that we allocate among our brands depending on what each brand has going on but yes we re going to support it with a lot we don t have the biggest advertising budget so we do focus a lot on digital and we focused a lot on shopper marketing with our retailers and we also focused a lot on in store so there are several categories we have shared in the past where we have bought out some of the categories like frozen vegetables where the signage that goes on the freezer doors we have exclusivity on that signage so we have done that in other areas of the store to support both cross brand merchandising as well as innovation hale holden barclays analyst got it and my second question bruce is could you give us a sense of where the working capital the 35 million working capital savings where it is coming from or i guess what drove the increase last year that you re pulling back on a little bit this year in bruce wacha chief financial officer yes sure and as i m thinking about working capital i m literally thinking accounts receivable accounts payable inventory we did a great job 2018 bringing inventory down it came up a little bit again in 2019 some of that is the acquisition of clabber girl and then payables went the wrong way on us and so both of those will be a big focus in 2020 we think that there s an opportunity to generate some excess cash by bringing those back down to the right levels hale holden barclays analyst there s no one category like the can category that you kind of liquidated out of to do that so it s just better management across the system bruce wacha chief financial officer yes better management across the system hale holden barclays analyst ok thank you guys so much i appreciate it bruce wacha chief financial officer thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ken zaslow with bank of montreal please proceed with your question ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst hey good afternoon everybody bruce wacha chief financial officer hey how are you ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst good a couple of questions you took away the cash flow question so i don t have to ask that when i think about all the reduction in your lower margin skus sku rationalization how come that s not going to add to the operating profit line is that not accretive to your numbers bruce wacha chief financial officer it was and if you look our ebitda was up 11 million in the fourth quarter ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst is that going to though continue into 2020 or that action is done bruce wacha chief financial officer so we talked about a very small price benefit in 2020 i think 3 million to 5 million ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst but what about the but you re not calling any more skus i thought when you talked about the guidance you said that it would be zero to 2 but partially offset by some sku rationalization getting rid of some low margin skus and then we account for that bruce wacha chief financial officer correct yes and that is all factored in and baked into our full year guidance of 302 5 to 312 5 ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst but i guess what i m trying to say is when you re thinking about the ebitda bridge to 2020 is that materially incrementally marginally incremental it just seems like it would be but anyway bruce wacha chief financial officer marginally incremental and baked into our numbers ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst ok my second question is in terms of managing complexity so i don t remember exactly what was the last time you had this much product innovation coming this much products going into different categories what capabilities are you better equipped to be able to manage the complexities relative to history ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well i d say that we have been launching a steady array of new products in green giant frozen for now started in 16 right so 16 17 18 19 so we haven t had any significant material hiccups in our ability to launch a lot of new innovation in frozen having said that since we are putting the accelerator on one of the initiatives that we are doing that we haven t shared is that we are dedicating we re taking the old b g model was to take everything we have and put it in the same salesperson s bag and now that bag has over 50 brands in it so we are dedicating some of our salespeople to only focus on frozen green giant so across our major customers we re going to have people that are dedicated on frozen because there s so much activity and now competing in multiple categories within the frozen food space and then we ll have a group that sells the rest of the line so that s our commitment to accelerate our capabilities to handle green giant ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst ok and then my last question is as you think about your new product innovation the investment that goes alongside that how much incremental investment is required year over year for the new product launches investment and is this going to be a new level of investment on a per year basis is this something that you re going to as a base case where you re going to build onto or is this a onetime infusion can you talk about how you think about the capital investment for the new product launches and how you think about this ken romanzi president and chief executive officer no i mean we re not proposing a significant increase in marketing investment we are spending a little bit more on slotting next year but that s baked in our sales assumptions and slotting is a gross to net reduction and in terms of capital we re not spending a lot of capital with a lot of these quick commercial r d and commercialization of these items are with partners and outside manufacturers so none of what we outlined in innovation for 2020 correct me if i m wrong none of the green giant s going to be internally produced and cauliflower taco shells and pizzas will be internally produced but that wasn t a significant capital investment so really more about r d expertise and consumer insights than anything else bruce wacha chief financial officer yes i don t think anything that we re proposing that we re planning on doing in 2020 is radically going to be different than what we ve done in the past so for green giant new innovation sales contributed something like 200 million in retail sales in the last year up over 0 5 billion since launch and then different brand but just showing what we ve been able to do with big brands when we bought ortega it was something like 75 million in sales it s north of 140 million today and so we ve definitely demonstrated with some of our big key brands an ability to innovate around the brand grow things clearly what we re doing with green giant is revolutionary in the category but it s more of the same as far as what we ve been dealing with green giant for the last couple of years ken zaslow bmo capital markets analyst great i really appreciate it bruce wacha chief financial officer thank you operator thank you we are out of time for today s call i would like to turn the call back over to mr romanzi for any closing remarks ken romanzi president and chief executive officer well we thank you for joining us this afternoon i hope we addressed the issues that people have with our performance in the past and that you can understand that we re committed to drive continued sustained performance in the future and that the model for b g is alive and well and works so thank you all and have a good night operator duration 67 minutes call participants ken romanzi president and chief executive officer bruce wacha chief

improving the reliability and resiliency of our transmission and distribution system while also reducing methane emissions through the second phase of our gas system modernization program or gsmp as i will also refer to later on pse g completed its energy strong resilience work for nearly 200 million less than the authorized amount and we finalized the second energy strong agreement to invest an additional 842 million on system hardening to better adapt to a climate challenged world for 2019 pse g once again achieved top quartile osha scores for safety and posted our best ever j d power scores for electric and gas customer satisfaction we outpaced the industry the average industry improvement on metrics that consider total monthly cost bill clarity fairness of pricing and options and ability to manage monthly usage we were also gratified to receive for the 18th year in a row pa consulting s reliability one award as the most reliable electric utility in the mid atlantic region we remain strongly supportive of new jersey governor murphy s goals of reaching reductions in electric usage of 2 and gas usage of 0 75 within five years of programmatic energy efficiency implementation last week we agreed to extend the procedural schedule of our clean energy future energy efficiency proposal from march to the end of september 2020 in order to provide regulators with additional time to complete their review of our 2 5 billion filing which is essential for new jersey to reach its carbon neutral energy goal by 2050 this agreement was approved by the new jersey board of public utilities our bpu at the february 19 meeting at the same time our existing programs were authorized to invest an additional 111 million of note the bpu lifted a statewide moratorium on advanced metering infrastructure ami if you will and directed the electric distribution companies to file new proposals or in our case to update previously filed proposals to install ami across the state this is a significant advance for customers as it will help them better manage their energy use and improve outage restoration times ami will also support the integration of ee programs which can limit growth in the customer bill we look forward to applying best practices learned from our experience installing about one million smart meters at pseg long island over the last three years in addition the bpu staff has circulated draft procedural schedules covering the remaining 1 billion of proposed clean energy future investments in ami electric vehicles and energy storage addressed schedules outlined concluding these cases by bpu decisions in the first quarter of 2021 or possibly later this year if settlements can be agreed to by the parties in the cases since we filed pse g s four part clean energy future program in january of 2019 much has happened on the clean energy front in new jersey and surrounding states last april the bpu awarded three years of zec to each of our new jersey nuclear units supporting their continued operation as new jersey s largest source of baseload carbon free generation in june the bpu awarded the state s first offshore wind solicitation to the 1 100 megawatt ocean wind project and at the start of 2020 new jersey reentered the regional greenhouse gas initiative or rggi pennsylvania and virginia are considering joining rggi as well which could address some of the price disadvantage or leakage experienced by lower carbon states surrounded by non rggi participants the bpu finalized the state s energy master plan last month which broadly supports the decarbonization and modernization of new jersey s energy system in order to achieve its goal of 100 clean energy by 2050 a cornerstone of meeting that objective is retaining nuclear generation through 2050 maximizing energy efficiency the deployment of offshore wind and other renewable generation as well as electrifying the transportation and building sectors the final version of the energy master plan also mentioned the bpu s intent to be more proactive in matters related to transmission citing cost allocation and financial returns determined by the federal energy regulatory commission or ferc this is an issue that has come into sharp focus following the ferc s november 2019 order narrowing the methodologies used to determine the return on equity for a group of midwest transmission owners we are reaffirming the earnings sensitivity for transmission returns we have provided in the past where each 10 basis point move in roe from our base of 11 18 would result in a 0 01 per share change in annual utility earnings i must tell you the market appears to have assumed a reduction of pse g s transmission roe as a result of the midwest roe order and then some i would point out that the midwest roe order appears far from final the complexity expense and uncertainty on timing and which calculation methodologies ferc ultimately adopts makes the outcome of any potential complaint should one be filed difficult to predict i also would like to address the energy master plan s goal to maintain existing gas pipeline system reliability and safety while planning for future reductions in natural gas consumption tied to energy efficiency we believe that it may become more difficult to site new natural gas infrastructure such as pipelines and power plants in new jersey that said regulators have been publicly supportive of maintaining and modernizing existing gas infrastructure to ensure safety and to minimize harmful methane emissions both of these are benefits of our gas system modernization program from a practical standpoint 80 of new jersey households already use natural gas to heat their homes or to cook and in fact many of our customers converted to natural gas from using oil or electricity for these purposes conversion cost per customer would be upwards of 10 000 or higher this would be a significant economic burden on every household and contrary to most customers personal preferences pse g customers enjoy the lowest natural gas prices in the region so a mandated switch to electrification of homes would also diminish the decade long price benefit shale gas has provided to new jersey moreover it would be worse for the environment until zero carbon generation dominated the fuel mix we strongly believe and the bpu acknowledges that natural gas and nuclear power are essential to new jersey s energy mix and will remain that way for the foreseeable future with this backdrop of clean energy progress the urgency for needed climate action and major elements of the 2018 clean energy act awaiting implementation pse g s 3 5 billion clean energy future filing is as important as ever to get done our proposed energy efficiency programs give every customer the opportunity to reduce their energy bills while lowering emissions as part of the bpu approved extension of the energy efficiency filing pse g will expand investment in several of its existing programs by 111 million the previous extension authorized last fall quickly sold out underscoring the demand for our energy efficiency offerings providing universal access to energy efficiency is but one of the many ways we demonstrate our commitment to minimizing the customer build as we have always recognized this to be a vitally important factor in our ability to make system investments in an affordable manner in addition to the build comparisons we ve highlighted previously and i will repeat here that combined customer bills are 30 lower than they were 10 years ago and are 40 lower in real terms it should be noted that over the 2018 to 2023 period pse g will lower bills by nearly 3 billion of tax reform related benefits with approximately 650 million in 2019 alone over half of that 380 million went to lower transmission bills we re able to pass through these savings and in some cases on an accelerated basis in 2019 pse g returned all eligible excess deferred tax balances at transmission offsetting a scheduled formula rate increase that resulted in a 52 million rate reduction we continue to be mindful that pse g s balance sheet strength enables us to pass through these savings on an accelerated basis which in turn aids the affordability of investing in large infrastructure projects that benefit customers let me turn my attention to pseg power for a moment power s non gaap operating earnings for the full year of 409 million or 0 81 per share were 19 below 2018 reflecting the effect of recontracting at lower market prices and lower capacity revenues that were partly offset by zecs starting in april we completed power s 1 800 megawatt combined cycle construction program with the placement into service of bridgeport harbor 5 we also made significant progress in replacing reactor vessel bolts at salem 1 power continues to exercise stringent cost discipline to remain competitive in a challenging market pseg power made progress in 2019 to reduce the already low carbon footprint of its 11 gigawatt fleet with an output profile now comprised of over 50 baseload zero carbon nuclear generation given the completed sale of nearly 800 megawatts of coal interest in keystone and conemaugh power expects it will eliminate all coal fired generation from its fuel mix by mid 2021 the scheduled early retirement of bridgeport harbor 3 on the power market and policy front the recent capacity auction held in iso new england produced a weak capacity clearing price that reflected a significantly lower demand forecast however our largest asset in new england is the new bridgeport harbor five combined cycle gas turbine which as you know cleared the 2019 2020 auction and locked in a 231 per megawatt day capacity payment for seven years thereby limiting our exposure to this latest auction result the long awaited ferc capacity order to expand the application of the minimum offer price rule and i ll just refer to that as mopr going forward puts pjm states that want to support clean energy resources on notice that they will need to seek an alternative to the capacity market auction in order to procure their preferred resources and avoid the risk of costly double payments to satisfy that capacity obligation pjm is expected to update their price floors for all pjm nuclear units soon and will submit these default avoidable cost rates or acrs to ferc in their compliance filing on march 18 the acr will be used as the price floor for subsidized nuclear units and will likely determine whether our new jersey nuclear units can clear the pjm capacity auction for the 2022 2023 energy year as a reminder our capacity revenues are locked in through may 2022 as the ferc order currently stands the mopr will also be applied to new state supported renewable generation such as offshore wind which will have the net cost of new entry as it s price floor that price flow results in a very remote possibility of clearing the capacity auction which has prompted several pjm states to consider a fixed resource requirement or frr self supply option we will work cooperatively with the board of public utilities in new jersey and pjm to find the best path forward whether that is to bid and clear the capacity auction under a business as usual scenario or seek the frr alternative in partnership with new jersey to preserve its preferred zero carbon resources and let s remember that the underlying rationale for ferc s action was to eliminate price suppression caused by units that were receiving out of market payments also at power we ve reached an agreement to sell our interest in the yards creek pump storage generating station that we jointly own with firstenergy this sale reflects our ongoing commitment to optimize the value of the generating fleet these proceeds will add to the improved cash flow at power given the completion of the combined cycle construction program and power s declining capital needs pseg s long term strategy to transition our business to a mostly regulated company with predictable cash flows is on track our financial condition remains strong with a healthy balance sheet that provides us the ability to finance our five year capital plans and provides the opportunity for growth in the common dividend without the need to issue equity our total capital program for the 2020 to 24 time period is now 12 billion to 16 billion with over 90 of that amount directed at regulated utility growth that improves the reliability and efficiency of our operations and supports new jersey s energy policy goals pse g s planned capital spending program over 2020 to 2024 is 11 5 billion to 15 billion and is projected to produce compound annual growth in rate base of 6 5 to 8 starting from 2019 year end base of just over 20 billion so that denominator in the cagr keeps growing for 2020 we are forecasting consolidated non gaap operating earnings of 3 30 to 3 50 per share which at the midpoint represents approximately a 4 increase 3 6 to be precise over 2019 results full year 2020 consolidated guidance remains at a consistent 0 20 band as provided in recent years while subsidiary guidance ranges are modestly wider to allow for variability by business that is often offset in consolidated results the increase for 2020 is led by a higher contribution from regulated earnings at pse g approaching 80 of consolidated results partially offset by an expected decline in power s results to account for lower expected market prices for energy and capacity this guidance includes the benefit from a full year of zecs for all three of our new jersey nuclear plants the board of directors recent decision to increase the company s common dividend to the indicative annual level of 1 96 per share is the 16th increase in the last 17 years and reflects our commitment to returning capital to our shareholders as well as preserving the financial flexibility to pursue growth we finished 2019 well positioned to execute on our policy and regulatory priorities as well as our environmental social and governance priorities pseg recently adopted the sustainability accounting standards board or sasb disclosure practice and incorporated the u n sustainable development goals in our 2019 sustainability report pseg power adopted a net zero by 2050 goal in july assuming advancements in technology public policy and customer behavior and this coming april we expect to issue our first climate report using the task force on climate related financial disclosures framework pseg was again named to the dow jones sustainability index for north america for the 12th consecutive year in 2019 most recently pseg was recognized among america s most just companies for 2020 by forbes and just capital and forbes included pseg in its 2020 list of america s best employers for diversity for the third year in a row with that in mind i want to thank all of our employees for their dedication and customer commitment each and every day that help make these results possible i will now turn the call over to dan for more details on our operating results and we ll be available for your questions after his remarks daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer great thank you ralph and good morning everybody as ralph said pseg reported non gaap operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2019 of 0 64 per share versus 0 56 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 our earnings in the quarter brought non gaap operating earnings for the full year to 3 28 per share which is 5 higher than 2018 s non gaap operating earnings of 3 12 per share and on slide six we provide you with a reconciliation of non gaap operating earnings to net income for the quarter we also provide you with information on slide 12 regarding the contribution to non gaap operating earnings by business for the quarter and slides 13 and 15 contain waterfall charts that take you through the quarter over quarter and year over year net changes in non gaap operating earnings by major business i ll now review each company in detail starting with pse g pes g reported net income for the fourth quarter of 2019 of 0 54 per share compared with 0 47 per share for the fourth quarter of 2018 full year 2019 net income was 1 250 billion or 2 46 per share an improvement of over 17 compared with net income of 1 067 billion or 2 10 per share in 2018 as shown on slide 17 pse g s net income in the fourth quarter increased as a result of expanded investment in transmission and distribution infrastructure and distribution rate relief for the full quarter as new rates were put into effect on november 1 2018 growth in pse g s investment in transmission improved quarter over quarter net income comparisons by 0 04 per share gas margin improved by 0 02 per share as a result of rate relief and recovery of investment in gas distribution made under the gas system modernization program electric margin was flat in the quarter as one month of incremental rate relief versus 2018 s fourth quarter was offset by lower weather normalized volume and demand operating and maintenance expense improved by 0 02 per share compared with the prior quarter reflecting lower tree trimming and preventative maintenance work and in addition retiree medical plan benefit changes implemented in 2019 had a 0 03 per share positive impact on net income compared to the year earlier quarter these positives were partially offset by 0 01 per share of higher depreciation expense on higher plant balances 0 01 of higher interest expense on higher debt outstanding and higher taxes and other items that were 0 02 unfavorable compared to the year earlier quarter for the full year weather normalized residential electric sales were 0 2 lower and weather normalized residential gas sales declined by 1 8 total electric and gas customers for the full year increased by 0 9 and 0 6 respectively last october pse g updated its transmission formula rate filing for 2020 to implement a rate increase after having completed the return of excess deferred tax benefits in 2019 in 2019 pse g s formula rate filing included the flow back to customers of the tax benefits related to accumulated deferred income taxes on an accelerated basis in a single year which had the effect of lowering the annual revenue requirements in transmission revenue for 2019 after reflecting system investments pse g s investment of over 2 7 billion in its transmission and distribution infrastructure in 2019 resulted in 6 growth in rate base to over 20 billion and of this amount pse g s investment in transmission represents 45 or just over 9 billion of the company s consolidated rate base at the end of 2019 pse g s net income for 2020 is forecasted at 1 310 billion to 1 370 billion now let s turn to power pseg power reported non gaap operating earnings of 0 10 per share in the fourth quarter compared with non gaap operating earnings of 0 11 per share a year ago the results for the quarter brought power s full year non gaap operating earnings to 409 million or 0 81 per share compared to 2018 s non gaap operating earnings of 502 million or 0 99 per share power s non gaap adjusted ebitda for the quarter and the year amounted to 198 million and 1 035 billion respectively this compares with non gaap adjusted ebitda for the fourth quarter of 2018 of 176 million and for the full year of 1 059 billion the earnings release as well as slides 13 and 15 provide you with detailed analysis of power s operating earnings quarter over quarter and year over year from changes in revenue and cost power reported net income that increased by 0 39 per share and non gaap operating earnings that declined by 0 01 per share compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 as shown on slide 23 a scheduled decline in capacity prices in pjm and iso new england in the second half of 2019 reduced fourth quarter non gaap operating earning comparisons by 0 11 per share lower generation output for the quarter also reduced comparisons by 0 02 per share the benefits of a full quarter of zec revenues of 0 06 per share and lower cost to serve of 0 05 per share were partly offset by a 0 03 per share decline from recontracting at lower market prices gas operations were flat as lower commodity prices pressured margins and limited off system sales the decline in our o m expense improved comparisons by 0 03 per share reflecting savings from the keystone and conemaugh sale and lower fall 2019 fossil outage expense that more than offset higher costs related to the hope creek refueling outage and bridgeport harbor fives in service as of midyear 2019 higher interest and depreciation expenses were offset by savings from retiree medical plan benefit changes that were implemented in 2019 and lower taxes improved non gaap operating earnings by 0 01 over the fourth over the prior year s fourth quarter gross margin in the fourth quarter stabilized at 31 per megawatt hour from the same level in 2018 s fourth quarter as a scheduled decline in capacity prices that began on june one in pjm and iso new england was largely offset by the zecs awarded in april for the year gross margin declined to 32 per megawatt hour from 33 per megawatt hour reflecting the average decline in 2019 hedge prices for energy of approximately 3 per megawatt hour now let s turn to power s operations we ve provided you with detail on generation for the quarter and for the year on slides 24 and 25 output from power s generating facilities in the fourth quarter declined by 6 2 from last year primarily reflecting the sale at the end of the third quarter of the keystone and conemaugh coal fired generating units as well as an extended refueling outage at hope creek full year 2019 output of 57 terawatt hours was at the low end of our 57 to 59 terawatt hour forecast the nuclear fleet operated at an average capacity factor of 81 9 in the quarter resulting in a full year capacity factor of 88 7 and total production of approximately 30 terawatt hours the combined cycle fleet operated at an average capacity factor of approximately 54 8 in the quarter resulting in a full year capacity factor of 52 2 and total production of approximately 23 terawatt hours for the year an increase of over 20 year over year reflecting the addition of bridgeport harbor five and high capacity factors achieved at the other two new combined cycle units keys and sewaren coal fired generation for the quarter and the year was significantly reduced as a result of the sale of keystone and conemaugh an update of power s hedge position following the bgs auction in early february is provided on slide 27 pseg power is forecasting a decrease in output for both 2020 and 2021 to 50 to 52 terawatt hours down two terawatt hours since the third quarter 2019 update primarily reflecting weak prices and lower market demand following completion of the recent basic generation service or bgs auction in new jersey approximately 85 to 90 of production for 2020 is hedged at an average price of 37 per megawatt hour with baseload production hedged at approximately 1 lower than the average hedge price in 2019 for 2021 power has hedged 45 to 50 of forecast output of 50 to 52 terawatt hours at an average price of 36 per megawatt hour and for 2022 power has hedged 20 to 25 of forecast output of 50 to 52 terawatt hours at an average price of 36 per megawatt hour the forecast for 2020 to 2022 volumes fully reflects the sale of keystone and conemaugh which had produced approximately five terawatt hours of annual generation in prior years the generation from the three new ccgts approximately three terawatt hours of lower generation in each year consistent with current market conditions and the planned retirement of 383 megawatts of coal fired generation at the bridgeport harbor three station in june of 2021 power s 2020 non gaap operating earnings and non gaap adjusted ebitda forecasted is projected to be 345 million to 435 million and 950 million to 1 050 billion respectively moving on to enterprise and other for the fourth quarter of 2019 enterprise and other reported net income that increased by 0 01 per share and non gaap operating earnings that increased by 0 02 per share compared with the fourth quarter of 2018 net income of 2 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with a net loss of 5 million or 0 01 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 and for the full year of 2019 pseg enterprise and other reported a net loss of 25 million or 0 06 per share compared with net income of 6 million or 0 01 per share for all of 2018 enterprise and other reported non gaap operating earnings for the fourth quarter 2019 of 2 million bringing full year results to 7 million or 0 01 per share which compares to non gaap operating loss of 12 million or 0 02 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018 that brought results to 13 million or 0 03 per share for full year 2018 for 2020 enterprise and other is expected to produce a non gaap operating loss of 5 million and this guidance reflects the continued pseg long island results that are more than offset by higher parent interest expense pseg concluded 2019 with 147 million of cash on hand and debt representing 52 of our consolidated capital position power s debt was 33 of its total capital base and its year end debt position stood at just over 2 7 times 2019 non gaap adjusted ebitda we expect internally generated cash flow will enable us to fund our current 2020 to 2024 capital program of 12 billion to 16 billion and accommodate incremental investment in previously identified opportunities without the need to issue equity while providing the opportunity to grow our dividend so to recap we re guiding to non gaap operating earnings for 2020 of 3 30 to 3 50 per share an approximate 4 increase over 2019 with regulated operations at pse g approaching 80 of consolidated earnings we also raised pseg s common dividend by 0 08 to the indicative annual level of 1 96 per share a 4 3 increase over 2018 this level continues to represent about a 58 payout of consolidated earnings at the midpoint of 2020 guidance and is comfortably covered by utility only earnings and has contributed to a 4 7 annual rate of growth in the dividend over the last five years and with that tiffany we are now ready to take some questions questions and answers operator your first question comes from the line of praful mehta with citigroup thanks so much hi guys ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hi praful mehta citigroup analyst hi so ralph on the pjm capacity auction i m sure you re expecting the question unfortunately the way ferc has left it it s going to be difficult to see how states stay in it if they really want to push the renewable mandates especially like you said offshore wind and we ll see how the net acr comes out from nuclear but what is your view on that if states were to separate or at least have their own frr like you said what does that mean for new jersey what does the process and timing take and what does that mean for your portfolio in particular ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so that s a very thanks praful that is a very complicated question and so much of it is really summarized in two words it depends i don t think new jersey wants to pay twice for capacity from carbon free sources in particular from offshore wind so under the current construct which as you know many people have filed for rehearing but under the current construct that would be new jersey would have to have either a zonal or a statewide frr which to me is suboptimal right because now you re going to be solving a small problem with a rather large tool if your aspirations are for 7 000 megawatts of offshore wind the need to pull out 15 000 megawatts from the capacity market seems to be a bit of overkill it also depends upon the design of the frr are you taking out what is the engineering assessment of the reserve margin you need at 15 16 if so you re leaving behind a residual market that is protestingly oversupplied and crushing capacity prices in that market how is price set i mean there s just a ton of questions what i feel good about is number one we have an energy master plan that says nuclear is important to 2050 so that has to be economically supported number two we have fossil assets that are located close to the load centers and have deliverability advantages that will make them important factors in any capacity reliability construct that is created so candidly we ve already filed comments and by virtue of those comments i think it s safe for me to say that we ve said ferc didn t quite get this right and it looks like the most likely outcome is folks that are not close to load centers and that are in other regions may face a residual market that is that does experience some price depression which is the exact opposite of what ferc said they wanted to do so everything i said after the first two words of it depends you should take with a little bit of a very cloudy crystal ball in terms of its ability to be precise and i ll end where i started which is it depends daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer and praful just one thing to add the we mentioned in the prepared remarks that we will find out a little bit more from pjm on the 18th of march with respect to the acrs which is part of your question as well so that depends as well but we ll get a little bit more insight and we anticipate that to come out on the 18th of march ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes and you do know praful i m sure that the imm numbers would suggest that our nuclear plant should we choose to participate would be certainly competitive praful mehta citigroup analyst right no daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer for capacity growth praful mehta citigroup analyst yes and obviously i do appreciate that nuclear should at least based on imm numbers but i guess given all of the it depends and uncertainty from a timing perspective if ferc were to go ahead do you think new jersey can react in time to get the frr if that were the path forward like you said a big tool for a smaller problem but if that was the only path forward what is the timing expectation you think that ferc that new jersey can get together and kind of solve the problem from an frr perspective ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so remember our capacity prices are set through 2022 so we have a little bit of time there depending upon whether or not ferc responds promptly to the march 18 filing that dan referenced it s conceivable that the next auction would take place late in q4 of this year and new jersey will not have offshore wind collecting payments until sometime in 2024 so it doesn t start paying double until the second auction from now right because we re still working on the 2019 auction just yet for the 2024 energy year as a 2021 auction so new jersey has a little bit of time and in conversations with cef we believe and we re hearing from cef that they also believe that they may not need legislation to go forward with an frr now it s not 100 certain but i do think that there will be adequate time for new jersey to avoid double paying for capacity for 2024 it won t be a walk in the park praful mehta citigroup analyst got it fair enough i ll get back into you guys lots more questions for thank you operator your next question comes from the line of julien dumoulin smith with bank of america julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst thank you good morning kim ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer raise your hand julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst hey excellent so let me turn the subject to a slightly different more utility oriented subject the e p talked at least a little bit about transmission returns i d be curious to get your latest thoughts on new jersey specific dynamics obviously you already alluded to in your prepared remarks to the miso situation and specifically with the new jersey do you think that there s a potential to file like a 205 to get ahead of any kind of process in new jersey or how do you see this playing out if at all curious on your reaction there ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so i don t know how to predict whether or not there ll be a 205 at all julien i mean we ve often talked about a 206 and there is a high threshold for someone who files a 206 i think we have to do a better job here quite candidly reminding people of the enormous value of our transmission investments over the years right if i take you back to august of 2003 when the grid was very different in its structure and how much more improved it is now from a reliability point of view we ve literally reduced transmission outages by 300 i believe over that period of time once upon a time when there was low cost fuel for generators in the west new jersey faced prices with that at a 20 basis uplift in the east and nowadays the nature of that low cost fuel in the west has changed from coal to gas but it s still a lower cost fuel in the west new jersey doesn t have any natural gas and basis differential is now sort of being positive 20 or negative 3 so there s been a bunch of advantages associated with the transmission and we still have no shortage of 90 year old transmission assets that need to be replaced having said that we are not likely to file a 205 to change our roe because we really don t know what the ferc rules are going to be it seems pretty clear to me that ferc has as professionally as is humanly possible basically said oops maybe we need to rethink what we did here and i believe the chairman himself has said that they are open to potentially rehearing this case so a 206 filing is extremely complicated it takes many years just take a look at what happened in new england take a look at what happened in midwest and that s when people knew what the methodology was going to be so now in the absence of a known methodology with that complexity i think it s not particularly beneficial to our customers or to us to begin to go in and talk to surmise what those rules might be in the form of a 205 so i m proud of every dollar we spent on transmission and the customer benefits we ve delivered and as soon as ferc gets the rules straight then maybe we can have an intelligent conversation with our regulators and our customers about what is a fair return but right now the market seems to have anticipated every bit and then some so julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst indeed and then if i may just to follow up on the sort of bridging the two conversations in power and utilities obviously pressure across the market and then also a potentially slowing utility growth trajectory even on the margin how do you think about the power business again strategically as you think about dividends and cash flow required back into the utility again trying to bridge that financing conversation against both sides of this business and all of this in light of the latest asset sale too ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes no so first of all remember because of the delay in cef combined with the 6 growth in rate base which was part of a 17 growth in utility earnings yes we do have lowered the bottom end of our rate base growth to 6 5 but i would take issue with the slowing utility growth i think that we are very mindful of customer bills and the impact and the customer value creation associated with the type of investments we are making right we re not here to just grow the rate base we re here to reward shareholders by doing better things for customers and so that 6 5 to 8 i would still say is not only robust but at the risk of being a little bit well it s real so let me just leave it at that instead of describing it and so 6 5 is programs and things that we know and 8 is if we hit some part of cef and what the bpu is saying please bring in an ami or modify your ami proposal i think it s safe to assume that some part of cef both ee and ami will be approved now in terms of power to your to the heart of your question i just sorry julien but i just want to take issue with some of the assumptions behind the question we re making progress we ve sold keystone and conemaugh because that made sense we re selling yards creek because that makes sense right now we re not selling bethlehem because it seems that we can get more value out of it than the market was willing to pay for it and the utility is going to be almost 80 of our earnings this year with 90 of our capital deployed in that direction in the next five years so the cash flow from power is an attractive way to fund the utility operations the debt capacity of power is an attractive way for us to fund the equity component of the utility and we ll keep doing that but as people come forward and say we can make better use of that asset fill in the blank as to what that asset is then we re more than happy to have a conversation and those conversations take place all the time and sometimes they re fruitful and other times we realize people are just trying to say something that s quite valuable at a discount price and we re not going to let them do that daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and i think julien the only other thing to add really is if you think about it we have talked for a long time about a growing base of rate base it s going to trend toward the potential for a lower growth rate off of that because of the higher base and that s a little bit about what you see from the standpoint of the range that we have put out in addition to the fact if you think about some of the clauses that are in place related to gsmp related to energy strong have five year run rates which run through 2023 the five year plan that we talk about now runs through 2024 so remember the low end of the range is what we know is approved and is moving forward and so it kind of fall off one year within our five year forecast from the standpoint of what is approved and we ve also talked about there s a lot of gas pipe gas iron pipe that s out there that has a longer run rate from the standpoint of being able to move through all that to eliminate all the methane leaks that come from that so i think some consistency with that that s not approved as yet into 2024 it s approved through 2023 so you see some drop off on the lower end of that range for that reason julien dumoulin smith bank of america analyst thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jonathan arnold from vertical research jonathan arnold vertical research analyst guys daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer hey john jonathan arnold vertical research analyst thank you just a quick on the capex updated slide i just was curious in 2023 there s obviously a big increase in the orange segment the electric distribution can you just remind us what s in that piece is the ami in there or is that sort of still up in the green hashed out section daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer jonathan i think there s maybe two things that you can think about a little bit from that perspective one is the fact that and i just referenced energy strong and gsmp and there s usually some of what we call stipulated base within the overall spend that is there and that spend can tend to lag a little bit across the five year period of the clauses that we have so to the extent that the stipulated base comes through toward the end of those programs you may see some of that come through and usually there s a little bit of capital that a capital adder as we move toward the rate case here just based upon ultimately pulling capital together so those are the two things that would come to mind related to that jonathan arnold vertical research analyst okay and as i look the orange and blue bits 23 particularly had really increased a lot versus what you were showing us just recently so ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer an ami is above in the cross hatch recent jonathan jonathan arnold vertical research analyst okay so that s not what s driving it and then just sort of generally when i sort of try to design numbers underlying the slide with the slide rule it seems that you re spending through 2023 is probably up 1 billion maybe a little more and but the rate base is more or less spending up in the same place am i on base with that observation or not quite daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer with respect to i m not quite sure i follow your question jonathan arnold vertical research analyst just if you look at what your slide implies in terms of the 2022 2023 kind of time frame rate base although you ve had all this moving around on the capex it looks like it ends up in more or less the same place i just want to make sure i m right about that daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer 2023 ends up in the same place as what jonathan arnold vertical research analyst same as before daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer how it was ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer we ll have that comparison daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer are you saying that as compared to jonathan arnold vertical research analyst yes i mean you would have to let me rephrase it has your 2023 vintage type of rate base forecast changed very much in aggregate once you have put all this together daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer i think from the lower end of the range i would say no and what you re seeing on the top end of the range basically is inclusive of both the cef potential as well as the iip potential so we can pull our slide rules together and kind of look through what s there you re basically looking at what was a 7 to 8 increase off of 2019 versus a 6 5 at the lower end off of 2020 and you re seeing a 6 increase year over year so net net that just becomes math jonathan arnold vertical research analyst okay so the destination does seem to be kind of not that different not that daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think that s fair jonathan ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i don t think it s that different daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and i think the dependency of cef is a part of that that s been what s been the biggest part of our range and remains that way because we are still in progress with respect to those filings jonathan arnold vertical research analyst perfect and then just one other thing what was the goodwill impairment power that you took in the quarter daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer oh that jonathan that was from many years ago when we acquired a location in new york which ultimately became the bethlehem energy center and we ve built that so i m going to guess a couple of years to build that it might have been in the 2001 2002 time frame something like that we acquired a site of the old albany steam station from niagara mohawk and at the time of that acquisition there was some goodwill that came on the books and that goes through an annual impairment test and that was impaired as we went through this year it was a fairly modest amount but ultimately it was just that accounting test as we went through it jonathan arnold vertical research analyst okay so it was none not one of your core assets okay daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes noncash and relatively small amount jonathan arnold vertical research analyst thank you operator the next question comes from the line of michael lapides with goldman sachs michael lapides goldman sachs analyst hey guys just a quick question on the transmission capex embedded in the five year outlook just curious how much clarity do you have at this point in time on 2021 and 22 transmission capex levels daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer i would answer generally it s a very high degree if you think about a lot of those projects they end up being multiyear projects and so a lot of that spend is not awaiting approval in those years it s more related to spend on projects that have a longer term run rate michael lapides goldman sachs analyst okay and the only reason why i asked that question is historically if you go back over time when you all put out a five year forecast of transmission spend what the actual spend in years three through five were versus what the forecast were a couple of years earlier turned out to be vastly different numbers i m just curious if we re looking at something where there could be a significant uptick relative to what we re seeing on slide 19 in terms of expected transmission spend especially since the rollover seems to be occurring really next year in 2021 normally it s kind of years three through five when you guys have forecast that out ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so mike i mean i think you could rest assured that we re putting out there the best of our knowledge right now we have said in the past that some of the larger projects which tended to make the future a little bit lumpier so to speak as new projects were approved those large projects are not in the forecast we don t envision any i mean you never say never depending on what pjm does with the rtep much of the transmission improvements now are end of life projects and 69kv upgrade projects so the susquehanna roseland type projects the northeast carda projects which could take something that was at x and make it much bigger than x as it gets approved are not likely to show up in the near term michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it and then one follow on i just want to make sure can you remind me what happens now on the ami process is that spin that s approved does that spin that s part of the ongoing dockets on the cef that needs to get approved and would i and if it s a separate part of that when does that kind of roll in is that just part of the energy cloud docket ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so what so the bpu listed the moratorium said ok based on some work that was done at rockland electric and an independent consultant report this makes sense we should do this statewide so they put forth a procedural schedule which would if it were fully litigated in its outcome based on our experience that would wrap up sometime in q1 of next year and they said to utilities ok please submit your filing you could do it under the rubric of the infrastructure improvement program which you may recall was passed in december of 2018 since we already have a filing in we don t need to write a new filing so we are going to simply take the ami component of our cef the energy cloud component and make sure it doesn t need to be tweaked in any way and pilot under the infrastructure improvement clause recovery mechanism so i would think i would hope that we have a very strong opportunity to come to a negotiated settlement on that since everybody recognizes the value of ami and since the recovery mechanism and the iip is pretty well documented and has been used extensively so maybe this is something we can actually get done this year but we ll see michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it and last question can you remind me on energy efficiency spend at pse g how was that treated from an earnings perspective ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer rate base rate of return and we ve had a mechanism in all of our prior programs which continues in this case to recover we have the opportunity to recover the lost revenue through an administrative fee that is set in a way that allows us to run the programs and have the opportunity if we run them efficiently to recover that as a lost revenue component michael lapides goldman sachs analyst got it thank you much appreciated guys operator your next question comes from the line of paul patterson with glenrock associates paul patterson glenrock associates analyst good morning how you doing ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hey how you paul patterson glenrock associates analyst just really quickly is there any reason to think that i mean that there d be a significant difference between the pjm s acr values versus the imm s ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer there s nothing that jumps out at us paul they don t always agree as you know on either policy or their analysis but there s nothing that jumps out at us at this moment right now paul patterson glenrock associates analyst okay and then with respect to the frr if that s the route that s taken how should we think about the amount of capacity that new jersey would be procuring i guess and how it would be selected i guess ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer that s really to be determined we would want to work with the state to make sure that reliability concerns are met but that the state doesn t oversupply itself and therefore pay more people than it needs to but that all needs to be determined paul patterson glenrock associates analyst does that daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer the state would provide information to pjm to ensure that they have actually met the requirements that they need to meet so you can kind of i think you can think about the concept of needing to meet the reliability is being consistent with pjm from the standpoint of what kind of a credit you would give to particular types of units like a so you wouldn t get a megawatt per megawatt credit because it s not dispatchable but i think that the details are to be determined paul patterson glenrock associates analyst so it would be it would basically one would normally think that it will be basically the pjm rules for capacity and what have you and what their what the goal is for reserve margin for pjm is that how we should probably think about it or ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer that s the way i think about it paul because clearly you want to avoid the free rider case because new jersey is not going to sever its interconnections to the rest of pjm and if and you re not suggesting this but if new jersey designed an frr that created greater opportunities for reliability concerns in new jersey to be backstopped by the rest of pjm but the new jersey doesn t pay for it that does not seem to be fair but yes i mean i think that we all know that pjm right now has reserve margins that exceed its stated requirements and presumably if new jersey just followed the pjm frr requirements that would be more akin to what they ve traditionally said in the 16 range not 20 plus percent range and that s why i think there ought to be concerns about the residual market paul patterson glenrock associates analyst absolutely okay thanks so much ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer tiffany will take a final question operator your next question will come from the line of shahriar pourreza with guggenheim partners constantine guggenheim partners analyst hi morning it s actually constantine here for sure ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer hi constantine constantine guggenheim partners analyst it s actually constantine here for shar just a quick one we re kind of slipping from distribution to transmission to generation fairly frequently but just high level when we re thinking about kind of the clean energy future programs and advanced metering kind of energy efficiency opportunities with kind of this update that you re potentially thinking about how does that kind of translate into opportunity and i m just thinking in aggregate that you have about 2 3 million customers and what s kind of an efficient rate at which you think you would deploy ami and kind of how should we think about the trajectory overall so the annual rate i don t have it committed to memory constantine but the 2 5 billion for energy efficiency was over six years and we are convinced that we can deploy that right now we have the authority to commit 111 million over the next six months that one will get spent in six months but if we could commit it based upon the demand for our programs i m pretty confident i m very confident of that the ami estimate we ve made is about 500 million to 600 million investment and that s for all two million electric customers our gas system has got a fairly extensive amount of driveby reading capability and on electric vehicles and storage that s the one that really is just a question of what is the regulatory appetite and enthusiasm the state has like a 600 megawatt battery storage goal for 2021 which clearly is not going to hit and we re just proposing 100 million for 30 megawatts so as the state wants to really aggressively pursue that 2021 target we could do a lot more and then electric vehicles is similar question of what is the appetite we ve proposed a 300 million program for a variety of different charging station infrastructure deployments so in the aggregate if we add those numbers up it s 3 5 billion over six years with the ee being the single biggest piece and the ami probably being a little bit more of the back end loaded piece in terms of once you get the approval and then are doing the deployment daniel j cregg executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i think that deployment is going to run a few years by the time you roll it out to everybody and i think a couple of unique aspects of the ami is that it certainly feels more like an all or none scenario you re not going to do every third house with ami it s going to you re really going to roll out ami or you re not so it s got a more of a binary aspect to it and to do that full rollout is going to take i don t know maybe three or four years or so depending upon the pace so it ll take a little bit of work through it all constantine guggenheim partners analyst okay that s very helpful and just one quick follow up on kind of offshore wind and the timing and kind of opportunities going forward kind of have you made the commitment or is there a time line for making a commitment with orsted and how are you positioning for any kind of future rfps new jersey or otherwise ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer so we have not made the commitment yet we do need to resolve that by the third quarter of this year i think both we and orsted would like to see that sooner rather than later but we don t want to do that in the absence of being fully comfortable that our due diligence is complete and we have retained ownership of another site that is a residual from our prior partnership with deepwater wind which was acquired by orsted and that site has access really i think to three states to maryland delaware and new jersey in terms of future solicitation constantine guggenheim partners analyst okay that s very helpful and kind of any way that you re thinking about kind of partnerships and structures going forward or is that a little too early to tell ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes i mean those discussions are under way with orsted and i d rather not have a lengthy public conversation about that until we resolve that with our future partner constantine guggenheim partners analyst that s very helpful thanks so much operator mr izzo mr cregg that is all the time we have for questions please continue with your presentation or your closing remarks ralph izzo chairman of the board president and chief executive officer yes so thank you for joining us today and we will be on the road for the balance of next week and a few days after that so we d be more than happy to have to meet with folks and have further conversations i know that there s a little bit of a there s a fair amount to talk about in terms of the ferc mopr and the future of the regulatory decisions but i must admit that we are encouraged by some of the things that have happened in new jersey of late you may recall the white paper on the utility role and energy efficiency that came out at the end of last year the energy master plan has come out we are seeing procedural schedules for all aspects of our cef filing and we do have an extension of 111 million for just the next six months so i d say that of course we re never satisfied with pace but we are directionally satisfied with the dialogue and the substance of our continued growth of the utility in ways that benefit the customer so look forward to seeing you all on the road and thank you for joining us today operator duration 66 minutes call participants carlotta n chan senior director investor relations

by john mauldin as i write this a self proclaimed democratic socialist is leading the race for one of our major parties presidential nomination the fact that so many americans especially young americans support bernie sanders ought to tell us something a quinnipiac poll out this week showed senator sanders with 54 support among democrats age 18 34 meanwhile 50 of adults under 38 told the harris poll last year that they would prefer living in a socialist country i don t believe they really want socialism few even understand what it is what they want is change they see little hope for improvement in their situations no matter how hard they work and sacrifice they don t see anyone in authority trying to help them so when someone offers what sound like easy answers they jump aboard as harvard professor ed glaeser says my paraphrase people think of socialism as hyperredistribution they are not looking to control the means of production per se just redistributing the fruits of that production in one regard sanders is similar to trump in 2016 an outsider whose message activates previously neglected voters trump went on to win if sanders gets the nomination it s easy to imagine scenarios where he wins too that the us could plausibly swing from someone like trump to someone like sanders in the space of four years says to me at least that something bigger is happening until we fix it desperate people will keep making desperate choices this week s letter will be a little bit different in that i want to focus on why so many of our fellow citizens find socialist ideas attractive and why even in the face of that i am a long term optimist for those paying attention there has never been a time so potentially dangerous but still offering so many incredible opportunities because of the frustrations of so many both left and right i think volatile swings between radically different political choices could become de rigeur for at least the next three election cycles if not longer the simple fact is that no political solution can deliver economic nirvana but until something happens like the great reset to force unwelcome change the cycle will continue and that is a reality we as investors have to face what s the appeal to my generation socialism is the second s in ussr we grew up being taught the soviet union was a mortal foe bent on world domination we didn t have to wonder if this adversary had nuclear weapons we knew it could drop them on us any time remember duck and cover drills thankfully the threat of imminent nuclear war receded and attitudes changed in those who didn t grow up with it a 1974 poll showed 75 of americans aged 25 to 34 thought the us had moved dangerously close to socialism now 50 of young americans want to embrace what they think of as socialism its meaning isn t entirely clear to older generations either this mises institute article does a good job outlining the ideologies we call socialism broadly speaking they involve various degrees of collectivizing property and redistributing wealth those can sound pretty attractive if you have no property or wealth and threatening if you do this raises a question if the us economy is performing so well and the rising tide is lifting all boats why is socialism getting any traction at all public opinion data says this shouldn t be happening polls from gallup and others find solid majorities saying their financial condition improved in recent years or at least got no worse i see two answers to that one is in the question itself your financial condition can be better than it was but still not where you think it should be if you are no longer drowning and are instead treading water with no lifeboat in sight then yes your condition has improved but you re still looking for answers the broad better or worse responses are heavily weighted by political affiliation republicans say both their own condition and the economy are better democrats say both are worse they can t all be right polls that ask more specific questions find a considerably less rosy scenario for instance a december 2019 bankrate com survey found half of us workers didn t get any kind of pay raise in the last year gains in average hourly earnings may have been heavily weighted toward a smaller number of workers who got much larger raises another survey by salary finance of 2 700 us adults working at companies with 500 employees found 32 saying they ran out of money between paychecks that s consistent with the federal reserve s annual shed survey which last year found almost 40 of us adults would need to borrow money to cover a 400 emergency expense it also found an additional 18 of americans considered themselves just getting by and 7 finding it difficult to get by perhaps not coincidentally the fed reported this month that household debt balances hit 14 trillion an all time high this was actually low as a percentage of disposable income but disposable income is again highly weighted toward the top many at the bottom are in debt up to their eyeballs and we re not even in recession yet hence the dark humor like this from what i see it may be true that most americans are in better financial condition but i think ray dalio is right when he divides the country into a bottom 60 and top 40 more than half the country is in various degrees of trouble and they are open to anything they think might help them including what they think of as socialism affordability crisis last week i quoted from an article by annie lowrey in the atlantic the great affordability crisis breaking america we who watch macroeconomics tend to focus on aggregate numbers unemployment rate gdp growth and so on we can overlook the micro world hiding inside those numbers let me quote ms lowrey at length because she says this well in the 2010s the national unemployment rate dropped from a high of 9 9 percent to its current rate of just 3 5 percent the economy expanded each and every year wages picked up for high income workers as soon as the great recession ended and picked up for lower income workers in the second half of the decade americans confidence in the economy hit its highest point since 2000 right before the dot com bubble burst the headline economic numbers looked good if not great but beyond the headline economic numbers a multifarious and strangely invisible economic crisis metastasized let s call it the great affordability crisis this crisis involved not just what families earned but the other half of the ledger too how they spent their earnings in one of the best decades the american economy has ever recorded families were bled dry by landlords hospital administrators university bursars and child care centers for millions a roaring economy felt precarious or downright terrible viewing the economy through a cost of living paradigm helps explain why roughly two in five american adults would struggle to come up with 400 in an emergency so many years after the great recession ended it helps explain why one in five adults is unable to pay the current month s bills in full it demonstrates why a surprise furnace repair bill parking ticket court fee or medical expense remains ruinous for so many american families despite all the wealth this country has generated fully one in three households is classified as financially fragile along with the rise of inequality the slowdown in productivity growth and the shrinking of the middle class the spiraling cost of living has become a central facet of american economic life it is a crisis amenable to policy solutions at the state local and federal levels with all of the 2020 candidates president donald trump included teasing or pushing sweeping solutions for the problem but absent those solutions it looks certain to get worse for the foreseeable future leaving households fragile exacerbating the country s inequality slowing down growth smothering productivity and putting families dreams of security out of reach for many and maybe most americans life is a constant struggle to make ends meet they see prices rising for the things they need to survive even as the president says there s no inflation the central bank that supposedly works for them actually wants more inflation not less this hasn t always been the case not so long ago you could work your way through college with a part time job afford a small home or apartment in a city or suburb where jobs were available see a doctor if you got sick and send your kids to decent public schools those are now out of reach for millions and while some certainly made poor choices it is not entirely or even primarily their fault many people perceive with some justification that the economy is rigged against them correct or not that perception opened the door for trump in 2016 we have seen significant improvement since then but clearly not enough the door is still open for anyone who can present a convincing argument their way is better if their way is somewhere on the socialist spectrum millions will be receptive to trying it there is a way to close that door and it s pretty simple solve the problems that are making socialism seem attractive and capitalism seem evil unfortunately i don t see much interest from the people who would need to do it what i do see is a belief not entirely wrong that more economic growth will fix everything the problem is it will take time and people are hurting now and for reasons i have outlined in previous letters our debt burdened society has borrowed growth from the future that pied piper of current growth is getting ready to be repaid take healthcare it is not the case that everything was fine before obamacare there were serious problems for one people under 65 with preexisting conditions were effectively uninsurable unless they had employer coverage now health insurance is available to all but only at staggering cost bernie sanders elizabeth warren and others keep talking about a wealth tax to fund national health care student loan forgiveness and other benefits others talk about much higher income taxes or a return to higher corporate taxes these are terrible ideas but i get why people want them it is gallows humor to note that the impulse to pay for the redistribution of income and wealth with higher taxes seemingly comes from the desire to balance the budget we can pick death by higher taxes or bigger deficits there are no other choices social contract humans may be social creatures but today s societies didn t come easy it took millennia of precarious survival of the fittest to arrive at the social contract that defines human relations the norms of how we treat each other and how the state treats people are incredibly important and they are breaking down that s not a pleasant thought but it is growing harder to deny the mckinsey global institute has a new report the social contract in the 21st century outcomes so far for workers consumers and savers in advanced economies it is bleak reading mckinsey s findings in summary my emphasis in bold hile opportunities for work have expanded and employment rates have risen to record levels in many countries work polarization and income stagnation are real and widespread the cost of many discretionary goods and services has fallen sharply but basic necessities such as housing healthcare and education are absorbing an ever larger proportion of incomes coupled with wage stagnation effects this is eroding the welfare of the bottom three quintiles of the population by income level roughly 500 million people in 22 countries public pensions are being scaled back and roughly the same three quintiles of the population do not or cannot save enough to make up the difference these shifts point to an evolution in the social contract the arrangements and expectations often implicit that govern the exchanges between individuals and institutions broadly individuals have had to assume greater responsibility for their economic outcomes while many have benefited from this evolution for a significant number of individuals the changes are spurring uncertainty pessimism and a general loss of trust in institutions this isn t imaginary and it is not solely about individual responsibility society really has changed in important structural ways achieving stability much less success is far more difficult for younger generations than it was for me and my boomer peers we can and should discuss how to ease those challenges without causing even greater harm in the process but pretending they don t exist or telling people to pull themselves up by bootstraps they don t have isn t the answer urging people who live paycheck to paycheck to save more is not realistic they have no money left after those fast growing expenses almost all saving occurs in the top 20 and certainly in the top 40 the lowest quintiles have negative savings i e are going into debt if you work for minimum wage or even 20 an hour with a family to support and someone comes along and promises you 1000 a month or to cover your student debt or medical services or child care that solves a problem you have right now the fact that giving even 40 million people 1000 a month would be a 480 billion additional tax and spend which would significantly impact the economy is just not in your personal equation for many it s already an easy choice after a recession and deeper economic malaise rigged system the financialization of the american economy has led to increasing income and wealth disparity as much as it pains me to say it the system really is rigged whatever the good intentions of the federal reserve in particular and the us government in general have been it has distorted the economic feedback loops that balance a true market based economic system the fact is we already have socialism today it s not the socialism we feared in 1974 we have socialized the risks of capitalism to the benefit of a small portion of the country while a larger portion struggles that s why bernie sanders may be on your ballot this november and why he could win if the economy worsens and there s a chance it will i long ago said japan was a bug in search of a windshield maybe i should have said china in either case it s beginning to look like virus covid 19 could be the windshield against which the global economy meets its maker i am not being gloom and doom i really believe the world is getting better and i see opportunity everywhere however if there is a recession and thus more people in pain if we haven t given people better answers they may choose socialism by default coupled with socialism by central banking and

in the momentous referendum on 23 june 2016 voters decided that the uk should leave the eu while many of the details regarding the uk s ultimate withdrawal still need to be determined economic research has shed light on a number of aspects of the referendum and its consequences relevant research has highlighted long run trade effects dhingra et al 2017 sampson 2017 foreign direct investment mcgrattan and waddle 2018 and financial market volatility and stock returns davies and studnicka 2018 existing papers have also focused on uncertainty about the final uk eu trade arrangement in a general equilibrium setting steinberg 2017 the role of uncertainty shocks using the decision maker panel bloom et al 2018 faccini and palombo 2019 and the extent of exchange rate pass through following the referendum forbes et al 2018 born et al 2018 apply a synthetic control method to study the effects of brexit on uk growth the macroeconomic adjustments to the brexit vote in a recent paper broadbent et al 2019 we document how the aftermath of the referendum has been characterised by significant macroeconomic adjustments in the uk economy in doing so we make use of novel uk quarterly macroeconomic data for tradable and non tradable labour productivities and the relative price of sectoral outputs figure 1 presents the key facts panels a and b are intended to show the change in aggregate uk growth relative to pre referendum trends and expectations panel a is from vlieghe 2019 and plots the deviation of uk gdp from a no brexit counterfactual constructed using a synthetic control based on a pool of other countries gdp a marked decline is visible indicating that growth slowed after the referendum relative to what might have been expected in the absence of brexit panel b provides an alternative view of this effect and shows that the imf revised down the outlook for gdp growth after referendum panel c decomposes the weakening of aggregate output into tradable and non tradable gross value added while the two sectors show a parallel trend prior to the referendum there is a sharp break in the growth rate of the non tradable sector after the referendum panel d presents the relative price of non tradable to tradable output together with the real effective exchange rate reer as shown in the exposition of our two sector business cycle model these concepts are closely related it is evident that the uk real exchange rate depreciates sharply after the referendum panel e plots exports and the trade balance both measured as a percentage of gdp while the patterns in this panel are less stark they suggest that uk trade improved robustly following the brexit vote panels f and g show the evolution of aggregate factors of production while total investment weakened following the referendum the labour market has remained resilient panel h shows ten year zero coupon yields for the uk and the us these yields closely track each other prior to the brexit vote but a spread opens up thereafter uk yields have remained persistently below their us counterpart in the aftermath of the referendum omitting inflation risk and term premia considerations this pattern is already indicative of a mechanism by which market participants may have perceived a reduction in uk productivity growth relative to the us figure 1 adjustments of the uk economy following the brexit vote a simple economic interpretation of the adjustments negative news about productivity in the tradable sector in broadbent et al 2019 we argue that the facts presented in figure 1 are consistent with what economic theory predicts for the effects of an anticipated productivity growth slowdown in the uk tradable sector this basic idea is motivated by the remarks of broadbent 2017 who conjectured that market participants may have interpreted the consequences of the brexit vote as a future slowdown in the tradable sector prompting the depreciation of sterling following the referendum we formalise and assess this idea through the lens of a quantitative small open economy model with tradable and non tradable sectors estimated using uk macroeconomic data our two sector model allows us to characterise how firms and households respond to news about future productivity in the tradable sector by shifting resources across expenditure components sectors and time we demonstrate that the macroeconomic dynamics triggered by news about a disruption in the tradable sector are consistent with the broad patterns in the data following the referendum while the effects of the referendum encompass a variety of economic channels our analysis provides an explicit formal framework to interpret some of the macroeconomic responses to the brexit vote figures 2 and 3 show the responses of key macroeconomic variable in our model which is estimated using our novel macroeconomic data set up to june 2016 the responses are the responses to a news shock about lower productivity growth in the tradeable sector 11 quarters in the future this timing is motivated by the fact that article 50 was triggered several months after the referendum result figure 2 model responses to news about lower productivity growth in the tradable sector figure 2 reveals that the permanent drop in tradable sector productivity depicted in panel a leads to a permanent fall in the relative price of non tradable output since it will become relatively more efficient to produce panel b shows that the price of non tradable output falls immediately even before the reduction in productivity growth has materialised during the anticipation phase tradable goods are relatively profitable to produce because the reduction in productivity growth has not yet materialised as shown in panels c and d this effect encourages production of tradable goods and exports in the near term once productivity slows down however tradeable output declines and the trade balance deteriorates in the longer term unsurprisingly the profile of non tradable moves in the opposite direction to tradable output as shown in panel e during the anticipation phase non tradable output is relatively unprofitable and output declines as the drop in productivity materialises non tradable output becomes relatively profitable which generates a long term sectoral recovery eventually non tradable output converges back to its pre shock trajectory given that the balanced growth path for the non tradable sector is unaffected the net effect of the opposing forces on the tradable and non tradable sectors gives rise to a muted response of gdp panel f the initial response of gdp is small but the effect builds over time we calibrate the size of the initial shock so that gdp is around 3 lower in the long run figure 3 model responses across sectors figure 3 shows the responses of the factors of production and rates of return the inter sectoral reallocation is consistent with the main mechanism underpinning our results the tradable sector is relatively more profitable during the anticipation phase and less profitable once news materialise panels a and b show that labour shifts from the non tradable sector to the tradable sector during the anticipation period to support the production of tradable goods overall total employment rises during the anticipation phase this pattern reverses once productivity growth in the tradable sector actually starts to fall panel c shows that investment in the tradable sector falls sharply before slowly converging to a new lower level investment prospects in the tradable sector are dominated by the expected longer term decline in productivity in contrast panel d shows that while non tradable investment initially shows a marked slowdown it subsequently rises above the baseline path on aggregate there is a significant near term fall in investment and the labour market remains robust taken together the responses can be seen as an economy wide shift from capital towards labour a feature of recent uk data that has been highlighted by some commentators panels e and f show the real bond returns in both sectors the small decline in the bond rate denominated in tradable goods is driven entirely by the debt elastic premium in our model the return on bonds denominated in non tradable output falls during the anticipation phase before rising above the steady state level the model simulations which capture the basic notion about news in productivity in the tradable sector perform very well in matching the broad contours of uk

northjersey lieutenant governor oliver senate president sweeney assembly speaker coughlin majority leaders weinberg and greenwald minority leaders kean and bramnick members of the 219th legislature chief justice rabner and judge grant members of the cabinet former governors mcgreevey and codey first lady tammy murphy and the many special guests sitting with her before me distinguished faith leaders veterans members of organized labor honored guests and my fellow new jerseyans as president franklin delano roosevelt said in our personal ambitions we are individualists but in our seeking for economic and political progress we all go up or else we all go down as one people that was the ideal we brought to our first two budgets and which we now bring to our third for new jerseyans to succeed individually and for our state to succeed as a whole that is our north star ours is a vision of long term and sustainable investment in our people and our communities in their futures and in ours the choices we make come from a belief that the conversations taking place around the kitchen table are more important to our future than those happening around any backroom table the answer to the question of affordability isn t found in rewarding the special interests it is found in creating new opportunities that reward our middle class fixing what s broken and addressing the everyday needs of new jersey s families this has been our focus and because of that new jersey is confidently moving forward our administration took office with a clear and unshakable goal to grow and strengthen new jersey s middle class that means creating opportunity shrinking inequalities restoring fiscal responsibility delivering property tax relief growing our economy and investing in our future we were told that all of this couldn t be done we were told we were dreaming we were told the math couldn t possibly work they said we couldn t be pro growth and progressive that we couldn t make new jersey stronger and fairer but we have stayed true to our beliefs we are who we said we d be and today we are proving the naysayers wrong believe me there is so much more work to do but today property taxes are stabilizing for middle class families and seniors today wages are rising and more new jerseyans are working than ever before our unemployment rate is below four percent for the longest period of time than at any other point in the past 20 years our economy has supported the creation of more than 72 000 private sector jobs and at the same time we have kept our state workforce level more job creating businesses are opening in new jersey and we are far outpacing our peers and indeed the nation in their rate of growth today 8 500 residents are participating in one of 988 recognized apprenticeship programs gaining the skills they will need to get good paying mostly union jobs hundreds of high school students in burlington new brunswick and paterson are preparing for the stem jobs of tomorrow in innovative p tech classrooms working toward a high school diploma a no cost associate s degree and workforce credentials all at the same time and right now students in trenton are preparing to join them today tens of thousands of three and four year olds in school districts up and down our state have a fully funded seat in a pre k classroom an opportunity nearly 6 000 of them across over 90 districts didn t have two years ago more than 7 500 qualified students are working toward an associate s degree tuition free under the community college opportunity grant program that didn t exist two years ago nearly a quarter million residents have been able to purchase affordable individual health care plans under the affordable care act and at a time when health care costs are rising across the country these policies are coming with lower average costs than before our administration took office and we ve secured the aca s protections for millions more consumers today we have a stronger surplus we have been disciplined and anticipate making back to back deposits into the rainy day fund for the first time in 20 years and we re putting the brakes to the financial roller coaster our state has been on for far too long we are making progress not despite our progressive and forward leaning policies but because of them i stand here today with a vision for how our state can work for everyone with a proposed budget built to see it to fruition and with our progress as prologue now i know that the budget i receive back won t look exactly like the one i am handing you but i know that by working together we will arrive at a budget that continues to restore the faith that we can work together for the common good and that we can deliver upon the promises we ve made to our middle class families and just as importantly to those striving to join our middle class to invest in them and to put their needs before those of the special interests to make our state fairer for them and stronger for our future and to change the culture of trenton so that it works for ordinary new jerseyans the values we share will shape that final document a stronger state is a state that does more to invest in its people a fairer state is a state which ensures all of its residents can be part of its progress we will continue to provide real property tax relief and meaningfully and honestly attack the core problems that have long vexed property taxpayers and we will continue to fight for middle class tax fairness we re getting results and making progress we ve relied upon reasonable revenue estimates and early indications are that we may like last year exceed them i don t intend to stop our streak in fiscal 2021 under this budget we will also continue growing our surplus to a projected 1 6 billion triple the surplus of my predecessor s final budget proposal and we will make another roughly 300 million deposit into the rainy day fund our second in as many years and the first back to back deposits in 20 years it s not enough to have the resources to meet the challenges of today we must ensure we can meet the unseen challenges yet to come a stronger surplus and another payment into the rainy day fund are important signs to new jerseyans that we like them understand that we can t rush out and spend everything we have without regard to future risks and it sends an unmistakable signal to the credit rating agencies that we will not follow the irresponsible ways of the past that led to 11 consecutive downgrades we ve reduced our dependence on one shot revenues those one shots may help balance the books for one year but always always lead to a mad scramble to close an even bigger hole the next today i propose bringing one shots down to only eight tenths of one percent of our budget continuing our progress to build our state s fiscal house on a foundation of reliable and recurring revenues we re cutting back the raids and diversions that have been a key reason why so many residents don t trust us with their money in the first place as with last year the affordable housing trust fund will pay for affordable housing we ll build on last year s progress and keep even more in the clean energy fund to support projects that counter the threat of climate change and we will ensure that millions more remain at the ready to build the modern next generation 9 1 1 emergency services infrastructure our communities need and because of the work we ve done together over our first two years to restore our state s fiscal standing we re also able to fulfill our obligation by making a nearly 4 9 billion total payment into our pension system but i know our work is not done the senate president and i agree we need to do all we can to ensure the stability of our pension system so in addition to a 794 million increase for fiscal 2021 our administration will make an extra 279 million payment into the pension system this current fiscal year this is a roughly 1 1 billion increase in our overall pension payment this administration will have put more back into the system in just three years than the preceding one did in eight we can keep this progress going but only with recurring and sustainable revenues and there is no better alternative than a millionaire s tax it s the way we both ensure tax fairness for our middle class and fairness to the dedicated rank and file women and men of our public workforce after all the millionaire s tax is a matter of fairness to our middle class homeowners and renters our seniors and the countless working families reaching to pull themselves up and into the middle class the property tax is the most unfair regressive and cruelest of taxes a middle class family in merchantville or milford or moonachie after all pays a greater percentage of their income in property taxes than a millionaire anywhere else it s easy to see how our middle class can feel cheated their tax burden is real and when put side by side with that of the wealthiest in our state proves to be the exact opposite of fair it isn t the wealthy who bear the burden of our tax system it s the middle class asking the wealthiest 22 000 new jerseyans to pay two cents more in income tax for every dollar they make over 1 million so we can provide nearly 500 million more in property tax relief to new jersey s families is simple fairness as i noted in my state of the state address six weeks ago the 400 wealthiest americans now pay a lower tax rate than the nation s middle class the first time this has happened in our nation s history by the way the number of millionaires in new jersey keeps growing every year and i do not begrudge their financial success i want them and many more to come and stay and they will why because of proximity to the best job opportunities in america to the best schools for their kids in america and the best communities to call home in america there is not one iota of hard economic evidence that has proven the myth of millionaire tax flight and yet i have heard from countless middle class families and seniors who are afraid that they may have to leave because of high property taxes they should be our focus in making new jersey more affordable and tackling income inequality we go nowhere without our middle class and right now they re the ones getting squeezed let s be clear a millionaire s tax doesn t punish the rich it lifts up the middle class and that s good for everybody so i thank the senate president and welcome his willingness to embrace a millionaire s tax in this budget when we have tax fairness we can continue our historic investments in our pension systems and in our middle class families let s secure hundreds of millions of dollars of constitutionally dedicated property tax relief for more school aid for more senior freeze relief for more and larger direct middle class relief to support more shared services and to more fully secure the long term stability of our pension system the millionaire s tax won t make us less competitive it will allow us to continue fighting against high property taxes and allow us to become even more competitive we need to treat every discussion about spending as a family would around their kitchen table and we must properly invest in a way that will return dividends to our entire state and our taxpayers the evidence is clear the steps we are taking are making a difference no other administration has done so much in its first two years to control property taxes or to deliver more property tax relief in just our first two years of working together we have achieved the first and fourth lowest year over year increases in property taxes on record and statewide property values have grown more in our first two years than at any point since the great recession we re helping families by protecting the single most important investment most of them will ever make their homes this hasn t happened by accident it s happening because we re making critical investments in property tax relief for our communities investments in our schools investments to alleviate the other forces that drive up property taxes investments that are making our communities stronger and fairer and we re being honest with taxpayers we re not going to defeat the decades old if not century old problem of property taxes with gimmicks or in one fell swoop but we are making real progress and moving in the right direction this administration s approach undertaken with your partnership has been to combat directly and consistently the costs that drive property taxes higher in the first place the first budget i signed two years ago began what i pledged would be a ramping up of school funding to meet the needs of both our school districts and our property taxpayers our public schools rank as the very best in the nation in large part because of our commitment to investing in classrooms in every community in our highly talented students and our highly skilled educators and educational support professionals school funding is an investment in our future but just as important school funding is property tax relief let s be absolutely clear every new dollar in school funding is a new dollar of property tax relief every new dollar we provide is a dollar that doesn t have to come out of the pockets of property taxpayers now is no time to let up so our budget proposes keeping us on our upward trajectory with an additional 336 million investment in our k through 12 classrooms for the upcoming school year on thursday i ll visit the bound brook school district as we release our state aid amounts and we ll invest an additional 83 million in pre k allowing us to expand opportunities for an additional 3 000 children funding pre k specifically is directly making our communities more affordable for thousands of young families and it is making communities more attractive to prospective homebuyers in just three years we will have restored nearly 900 million in direct formula aid to our public schools a nearly 11 percent increase in just three years and every penny is property tax relief and through reforms championed by senate president sweeney those new school funding dollars are working more efficiently and effectively our schools benefit and our property taxpayers benefit and because of that our future benefits as we properly fund the school funding formula we know that some districts continue to face challenges so our budget also includes 50 million to stabilize their finances without cutting vital student programs school taxes make up more than half of the average property tax bill in new jersey so there is urgency in our action and as we make up for the years of aid cuts and flat funding that preceded us taxes in more than 250 school districts are stabilizing and as we continue to reinvest that number will grow it bears repeating school funding is property tax relief it is the most aggressive way we can attack the single largest root cause of our high property taxes although we in this building do not set property taxes the decisions we make can relieve the strain they place on our families and seniors that s why i am so proud of the work our administration has undertaken over the past year to seek out hundreds of millions of dollars in health care savings alongside our public workforce i ve said it before our public workers are not the enemy they are our neighbors they are the women and men who make our communities our schools and our state function and they too are property taxpayers and when we can work together in partnership to ensure high quality health care for them at a lesser cost to us all it s the best kind of win win and this concept is at the heart of our work to provide chapter 78 relief to our educators and esps and we must deliver for them we are making real progress on health care even with inflationary cost pressures running rampant throughout the health care marketplace overall spending on public employee health care across fiscal 2020 dropped by 300 million more than nine percent but the good news isn t just at the state level for active local government employees enrolled in the state health benefits program premiums decreased 4 3 percent for the 2020 plan year school districts enrolled in the school employees health benefits program saw an even bigger 4 5 percent drop in coverage rates for our educators and staff health care costs continue to be one of the biggest drivers of local and school budget growth and therefore one of the biggest drivers of property taxes lowering health care costs is property tax relief in fiscal year 2021 we aim to reduce budgeted amounts for state paid health care benefits by another 174 million this will be a significant achievement in the face of national trends and the first time in memory that we have year over year over year reductions in the overall cost of health care and we will be more aggressive than ever in directly controlling the costs of health care delivery we will close gaps that incent the use of costly out of network providers or which misclassify certain services so providers can reap a big payday we will no longer tolerate providers who send out big bills for reimbursement because they know the insurance company will settle by just sending a big check in return these seemingly small steps alone can save us literally tens of millions of dollars we re not simply cutting costs we re cutting out the drivers of cost increases while ensuring quality services it is in this same vein that we are so committed to promoting shared services the goal should not be to deliver fewer services or diminished services our goal should be to ensure the high quality services that our people need and expect in a way that is more efficient and effective with the leadership of lieutenant governor oliver and our shared services czars mayors nic platt and jordan glatt we recently passed the milestone of 1 000 shared service agreements this budget will support their work and further our progress so that is why our budget will maintain our 10 million investment to keep bringing local governments and school districts together to share services we are also creating a new grants management office co located in my office here and in our state office in washington to marshal resources and help county and local governments bring home more federal grant dollars to further alleviate the property tax burden one reason why we ve been dead last in returning federal dollars to our state is because we ve never had a whole of government approach to get them that will change and our budget will extend our commitment to direct property tax relief for middle class families through the homestead benefit and for our seniors through the senior freeze and i thank in particular speaker coughlin for his commitment to this in doing each of these things funding our public schools and delivering direct property tax relief providing high quality health benefits to our public employees educators and educational support professionals at a lower cost both to them and to taxpayers and making it not only possible but easier for communities to adopt shared services and better compete for federal grants we are being more effective in combating our property tax crisis than any administration that has come before the two leaders behind me have made many of these efforts their key priorities as have most of you and in partnership we will continue step by step to challenge the property tax crisis that has been atop our state s to do list for well over a generation when we do these things we will continue to make new jersey not only a go to place for business but a come to place we re already competing and winning that s a fact our economy is performing well in large part because we are keeping our promises and making transparent and stable investments the census bureau tracks the creation of what it calls high propensity business applications the newly born businesses it sees as growing into enterprises with employees and payrolls which is an important indicator for future economic growth and one we track closely throughout 2019 high propensity business applications in new jersey grew every quarter the fourth quarter alone grew by 3 4 percent over the fourth quarter of 2018 which had in turn grown by 3 5 percent over the fourth quarter of 2017 and our fourth quarter 2019 growth rate was nearly double that across the rest of the entire northeast new jersey has become more attractive to and supportive of business creation than both massachusetts and new york and we far outpaced the national growth rate of 2 percent this is a strong indicator that businesses see the advantages of new jersey it s a strong indicator that our economy will continue to create jobs in 2020 it s a strong indicator that our policies are working this is why our budget will continue to invest in making new jersey more competitive for businesses in workforce development through jobs nj and in our successful apprenticeship programs to ensure expedited permitting so more private investment such as that from the offshore wind industry can flow into our state to grow jobs and new opportunities and in the work of the commission on science innovation and technology so we can prove ourselves worthy as the heirs of thomas edison and bell labs and fully reclaim our place as the true home of the global innovation economy and let s also acknowledge that our work to deliver property tax relief by investing in our schools and communities also benefits our businesses especially the small businesses in our downtowns and the startups that have outgrown their incubator and are looking to build their permanent homes and at the same time there are large corporations in new jersey that do not provide health benefits to their employees and their families or who offer policies that their employees cannot afford when these families turn to medicaid it s our taxpayers who pick up their health care costs new jersey pays an average of 1 000 per person without any contribution by their employers our budget will require these corporations to pay their fair share through a corporate responsibility fee every page of our budget is filled with investments that will make our state stronger and fairer i could name them all but here are just a few beginning the work of our new office of health care affordability and transparency to lower the costs of health care for millions of our residents and build upon the successful out of network reforms championed by speaker coughlin expanding eligibility for the pharmaceutical assistance for the aged and disabled or paad and senior gold programs to thousands more new jerseyans investing an additional 200 million to further lower the costs of health insurance for individuals purchasing plans through the aca fully funding women s health care and family planning maintaining our data driven and whole of government fight against our opioid scourge continuing the partnerships the first lady has built to meaningfully combat the infant and maternal mortality disparities among our communities of color investing in programs and services for youth so they don t get entangled in the juvenile justice system fully funding the amistad commission expanding the size of the earned income tax credit and making thousands more young adults eligible helping ensure safe learning environments for our kids and communities of faith for the first time exempting combat pay earned by our active duty military men and women from taxes making a down payment for our communities to replace lead water service lines and modernize our infrastructure and building the futures of our college students through the garden state guarantee the garden state guarantee will build upon the already successful model of the community college opportunity grant program and provide the first two years of study at one of our four year public colleges and universities tuition free to thousands of eligible students tomorrow i will visit william paterson university to open a deeper discussion about this new initiative and with the public health challenges we face from the tragedy suffered at wanaque to today s rightful concerns over the coronavirus our budget will continue to invest several million dollars to partner with local health authorities to support infectious disease control i also call once again for you to join me in raising the cost of handgun permits for the first time since 1966 this is not about the 2nd amendment this is about public safety these fees are meant to cover the costs of state police background checks on prospective gun buyers and right now they don t come close to doing so it s still just 2 to get a handgun permit it s still more expensive to buy a dog license that s entirely backwards let s fix this so we can keep guns out of the wrong hands our budget will continue our work fixing nj transit increasing our investment by another 132 million to a record total of nearly 600 million this increase will help train an additional 98 new locomotive engineers fund service enhancements at both newark and new york penn stations and start a new electric bus program among much more it will also protect nj transit s commuters from a fare hike for a third straight year this record investment will dovetail with the mission and values of nj transit s forthcoming ten year strategic and five year capital plans this is an investment in nj transit but it is even more an investment in our commuters and our communities it is an investment in giving new jerseyans the freedom to leave their cars at home and to take our trains and buses and with the federal government s long awaited green lighting of the portal bridge replacement we are finally moving forward in alleviating one of nj transit s commuters other headaches wondering if a cranky obsolete century old bridge is going to hold it together for another day the portal bridge is just one part of a much larger project one new span doesn t in any way eliminate the need for new tunnels under the hudson and it in no way signals our retreat in the fight to get gateway done and by the way it bears repeating that had it not been canceled the arc tunnel would today be open and serving our commuters that ghost continues to haunt us but make no mistake the portal bridge decision is a big victory for our commuters and i thank our federal delegation in congress for their tireless help it is also a big victory for the building trades and it is a big victory for a state whose economic lifeblood can only flow with modern infrastructure by now i bet you thought i was going to get through this speech without mentioning tax incentives but this is too important this is about who we stand with and what we stand for this is about how we create jobs and for whom we create jobs these are our choices are we on the side of protecting taxpayers hard earned money or with the millions of dollars spent with no oversight and too often with no results are we on the side of small businesses and the entrepreneurs women veterans and people of color who want to start a business or do we only welcome the big fish and the well connected are we on the side of communities and residents or do we reward those who ignore them are we on the side of transparency and accountability or do we close our eyes to those gaming the system we should all agree that a targeted program with strong compliance standards is a good thing we should all agree that we need a program whose focus is on expanding our economy not rewarding special interests and we should all agree that just as much as we need strong compliance standards we must have clear annual overall caps in place blank checks are bad policy no family budgets that way neither should we as i ve said countless times most companies are good corporate citizens who play by the rules but some are not we are seeing progress in the name of our taxpayers in getting back some of the millions of dollars we now know were inappropriately awarded the first 11 million of some 500 million being investigated i am committed to not reliving the mistakes of the past the mistakes that put huge tax breaks for the well connected before tax breaks for the middle class and let s be perfectly clear billions given away in open ended corporate tax breaks will be billions we will not have to make our state more affordable for both residents and businesses tax incentives cannot be about rewarding special interests they must be about making our state more competitive creating jobs and growing the next great wave of new jersey based companies period i am pro jobs pro growth and pro accountability that is why i am for reforming a failed incentives system just as i am for reforming our ethics laws to let more light shine in when we reject transparency in any forum bad deals are made and taxpayers are hurt the public needs to see unmistakably that we work for them and not the other way around and i ask you to join me in this cause the goal isn t to win for the sake of politics but to win for the sake of our future that s also an apt way of thinking about our first two years two years speaking to our core value that new jersey is at its strongest when it is at its fairest two years speaking to the need for us to focus not on gimmicks but on long term and sustainable solutions for real property tax relief two years speaking to the need to change the culture of trenton from one that shields the wealthy and special interests to one that secures progress for our entire new jersey family we re doing what no one thought possible we re making real progress against high property taxes restoring new jersey s fiscal standing growing our economy repositioning our state for success and at the same time investing in our future here we are with a record of unmistakable progress on all fronts and with a budget that promises to keep us moving forward thank you all very much may god continue to bless the great state of new jersey and the united states of america

year at both the top and bottom lines we realized sales of 555 million a 9 increase over last year our 2018 acquisitions of faster and custom fluidpower drove our 2019 growth contributing 65 5 million of acquisition revenue in 2019 organic sales on a consolidated basis excluding currency decreased 2 in 2019 organic sales of our hydraulics segment grew 1 while sales in our electronics segment declined by 11 both excluding the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates as expected currency had an unfavorable impact during the year despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop our fourth quarter consolidated revenue and quality of earnings were better than we expected we have been successfully improving operational efficiency and throughput at all of our operations tricia will provide more details on each segment s performance turning to the bottom line for 2019 we reported 60 3 million of net income a 29 increase over the prior year on a non gaap cash basis net income was 77 7 million or 2 43 per share a 6 improvement over 2018 adjusted ebitda for the year was 131 1 million or 23 6 of sales as you may know increasing cash flow and reducing debt have been important goals for us this year we finished 2019 with very strong cash generation in the fourth quarter this contributed to adjusted free cash flow for the year of nearly 14 of sales significantly exceeding our 10 target level during 2019 we reduced debt by over 52 million closing the year with a 2 1 times net debt to adjusted ebitda ratio we are nearing our goal of less than 2 times which we anticipate achieving by the middle of this year please turn to slide 4 and i ll summarize our strategic business highlights for 2019 starting with our hydraulics segment as we reported earlier in the year we completed our cvt manufacturing consolidation project this involves consolidating manufacturing into our two adjacent sarasota facilities applying our lean enterprise principles and reorganizing our production lines we improved our productivity as we progressed through the year and freed up additional capacity next we accelerated our in the region for the region initiative in both the emea and apac markets i want to remind you that one of the synergies we identified as part of the faster acquisition was to leverage the capacity and regional expertise presented by machining cvt components at our faster facilities in the middle of 2019 we began production of cvt components in europe which will ultimately drive efficiency and cost savings we will produce six critical parts for the high volume cartridge valves at that location initially representing a near term vertical integration cost synergy we expect that the cost savings will ramp up to full realization in the middle of this year this represents the first phase of cvt manufacturing in emea the next phase of this project will involve complete cartridge valve production capability for the emea market we have approved site expansion plans to support our anticipated hydraulics segment growth in that market turning to the apac region we opened and began shipping products from our new facility in china near shanghai ahead of schedule in the middle of 2019 we experienced significant demand and volume ramped up as we progressed through the year i ll touch on coronavirus later in this presentation this factory is currently performing assembly and test for a selected range of products sold in the region over the next few years we plan to expand the value add manufacturing within this facility for our regional customers ultimately bringing complete cartridge rollout production capability to the asian region where we continue to make market share gains this new capacity is complementary to our facility in south korea which we inaugurated in 2018 furthermore the new engineering center of excellence in our third sarasota facility is progressing as planned as a reminder the third facility will house our global cvt research and development activities as well as certain administrative and operating functions and is expected to be completed next month our r d investments remain very active in our hydraulics segment we launched an initiative named e volved that is focused on the development of electro hydraulic coupling solutions as we have done in the past we will leverage the electronics knowledge across our segments as we develop this innovative product offering we anticipate continued product development and electro hydraulic portfolio expansion during 2019 we also launched new valves in our flex series as you might recall we commenced this activity at the end of 2017 continued releasing flex products in 2018 and will expand and broaden the electro hydraulic valves offering on an ongoing basis this was an important strategic initiative for us as it provides robust electro hydraulic control for mobile agricultural and industrial applications creating a critical path to expand our systems business and opening the door to new opportunities turning to our electronics segment we continue to make significant investments in collaborative r d initiatives actively pursuing projects jointly with oems that have model year rollouts beginning mid to late 2021 and continuing through 2023 these elevated levels of engagement with existing and new customers require additional upfront investments in r d and engineering resources as the projects progress 2019 marked the third and final payment of the contingent consideration payout to the group from whom we acquired enovation controls given the strong performance of that business it is truly a win win situation for all parties involved finally we are very pleased with the gross margin expansion realized in the electronics segment in 2019 which is a result of simultaneous engineering capabilities meaning state of the art product design capabilities in combination with sophisticated manufacturing execution all of these initiatives are important components of our vision 2025 strategic plan to achieve global technology leadership in the industrial goods sector with critical mass exceeding 1 billion in sales while maintaining superior profitability and financial strength with that overview i will now turn the call over to tricia to review the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year in a bit more detail tricia l fulton chief financial officer thank you wolfgang and good morning everyone let s begin on slide 6 with the review of our fourth quarter consolidated results organic sales were down 11 1 million or 8 compared with last year s quarter excluding a 1 7 million unfavorable currency impact i will now touch on sales by region which are designated here in the sales bar charts on the left during the 2019 fourth quarter apac realized year over year growth of 9 while the americas and emea markets declined by 18 and 10 respectively sales to the americas emea and apac regions were 44 26 and 30 of the consolidated total respectively in the fourth quarter despite lower revenue in the quarter profitability remained relatively comparable with consolidated adjusted ebitda margin at 23 2 compared with 23 4 in the prior year period turning to the bottom line non gaap cash earnings per share were 0 54 down 0 02 compared with last year s fourth quarter the adjustment to arrive at non gaap cash earnings consist of acquisition related amortization of intangible assets in this year s quarter and also the impact of tax reform and some other non recurring items in last year s quarter these are shown in the reconciliation tables in the back of the slide deck and release please turn to slide 7 for a review of our hydraulics segment fourth quarter operating results consistent with prior periods i want to point out that acquisition related costs including amortizations are not included in our operating segment numbers they are accumulated in our corporate and other segment reported in the tables in the back of our earnings release and slides sales for the hydraulics segment declined 8 excluding currency which had a 1 7 million unfavorable impact from a geographic perspective excluding the effects of currency we saw a 11 year over year growth for the quarter in the apac region which was offset by an 18 decline in the americas and an 8 decline in the emea market the primary drivers for the decline in the americas and emea regions were seasonality and softer end market demand as a result of the lower sales volume gross profit declined 6 for the quarter while gross margin increased by 70 basis points the gross margin expanded as improved productivity net price increases and cost management efforts more than offset unfavorable product mix and foreign currency hydraulics segment operating income decreased 2 million primarily due to lower revenue in the quarter however cost management efforts drove 500 000 reduction in sea expenses in the quarter compared with the prior quarter prior year quarter sorry please turn to slide 8 for a review of our electronics segment fourth quarter operating results revenue was down 14 compared with the fourth quarter of last year the decrease was due to continued softer demand in the recreational and oil and gas end markets as well as the ongoing impact of the customer contracts that we renegotiated in the first quarter recall that this allows us to offer all of our products to a broader global and more diversified customer base fourth quarter gross margin was 43 5 reflecting the impact of lower revenue during this quarter the decline was primarily offset by cost management efforts which resulted in production efficiencies due to the lower revenue and gross margins operating margin in the 2019 fourth quarter declined by to 12 9 of sales please turn to slide 9 for a review of our 2019 consolidated results sales were up 9 over 2018 faster and cfp contributed 65 5 million of acquisition revenue while our organic sales declined about 10 7 million or 2 excluding the impact of currency currency had an 8 1 million unfavorable impact on the consolidated sales for our organic businesses during 2019 sales to the americas emea and apac regions were 47 27 and 26 of the consolidated total respectively regarding profitability consolidated adjusted ebitda increased 5 compared with last year non gaap cash earnings per share were 2 43 up 6 over last year please turn to slide 10 for a review of our hydraulics segment operating results for 2019 sales for the segment grew 16 compared with 2018 the growth included 65 5 million of acquisition revenue contributed by faster and cfp and 1 organic growth excluding the 7 6 million unfavorable impact of currency gross profit increased by 14 during the year this significant increase resulted primarily from acquisitions as well as production efficiencies and price increases partially offset by higher material costs and the impact of changes in product mix the same drivers apply to hydraulics operating income which increased 3 sea included 11 3 million of incremental costs for the acquisition additionally 4 4 million of one time unusual items in the third quarter unfavorably impacted operating income for the year please turn to slide 11 for a review of our electronics segment 2019 operating results sales for the segment decreased 11 compared to 2018 the decline was primarily due to softer demand in end markets and the renegotiated customer contracts despite the lower revenue gross margin increased by 160 basis points to 45 5 and operating margin declined by only 10 basis points to 19 7 the significant improvement in gross margin was primarily the result of lower material costs as well as cost management efforts which drove production efficiencies the same drivers apply to operating margin which remained relatively comparable to the prior year please turn to slide 12 for a review of our cash flow and capitalization in 2019 we generated 101 2 million of adjusted cash from operating activities and 76 2 million of adjusted free cash flow both of which reflect significant improvements over 2018 benefiting from our strong fourth quarter performance our adjusted free cash flow as a percent of sales for 2019 was 14 significantly exceeding our 10 target our capex was 25 million down from 28 4 million in 2018 due to timing and adjustment of capex related to the manufacturing consolidation project as planned spending was primarily for machinery sorry for manufacturing technology enhancements capacity expansions machinery and leasehold improvements for china facility that opened in june equipment for our new engineering center of excellence and also for the addition of the faster business in 2020 capital expenditures are estimated to be between 20 million and 25 million regarding capitalization we reduced our debt by nearly 18 million in the fourth quarter contributing to over 45 million of debt reduction for the year throughout the year we improved our net debt to adjusted ebitda finishing at 2 1 times with our strong cash flow profile we are focused on getting that below 2 times which we expect to achieve by the middle of this year wolfgang i d like to turn it back to you for your perspective on outlook and our 2020 guidance before we open the lines for q a wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer thanks tricia please turn to slide 14 the macroeconomic climate continues to be filled with uncertainty in addition to the human toll that the coronavirus is having it has caused significant economic disruption leading to future uncertainty helios technologies generates approximately 9 of global revenue with chinese customers like most chinese companies helios technologies is gradually resuming work within our facilities we have no subsidiary in hubei province which remains in the lockdown state our factory and offices are in the expanded shanghai metro area after having received approval from the local authorities to reopen our businesses in mid february right now we are operating at about 50 working capacity the reduced staff level is driven mainly by the 14 day quarantine period imposed on all travelers returning to the shanghai area from other provinces trucking services across all cities remain limited because of the closure of selected highways and shortages of drivers causing cargo deliveries to be under tight delivery constraints we are monitoring the china situation closely and we are adjusting well to support our customers and channel partners on an ongoing basis china remains a key market for helios and the coronavirus will not change our localization plans which involve sourcing activities and revenue growth on the mid and long term basis we expect a gradual improvement in china over the next few weeks most recently several jurisdictions in northern italy near our faster facility are under quarantine today our operations are marginally impacted by imposed italian travel restrictions we are observing ongoing developments given these disruptions we are seeing delays in demand for q1 and expect this to continue into q2 other factors such as the us presidential election provide a lot of media hype but are not expected to have a significant macroeconomic impact it appears that the us china trade wars have cooled for the time being but we all know the situation is fluid with united kingdom exiting the european union last month it is unknown what the ensuing negotiations will yield we believe that mitigating factors will reduce the potential downside to our results and therefore we do not expect the material impact but uncertainty remains lastly anxiety in the middle east continues to disrupt that part of the world considering all of these factors leading us indicators suggest that we continue to be in a slowing growth phase expecting a new cyclical rise in the second half of this year around the world nearly all major global economies are still experiencing either a slowdown of growth or negative growth specifically western europe and japan are in a mild recession and economic growth in china has decelerated again the good news is that similar to the us all global economies are currently expected to recover in the latter half of this year as we have said in the past in accordance with our vision 2025 plan we expect to outpace macroeconomic growth over the long term this is being driven by the investments we have been making to expand our coverage in the field increasing and broadening relationships with oems penetrating regions where we have white space and continuing to introduce new and innovative products and solutions further the actions we have taken to broaden from our traditional end markets into more diversified markets expand our ability to successfully weather economic cycle please turn to slide 15 for our thoughts regarding our outlook for helios in 2020 we have selectively managed costs as we continue to invest in innovative manufacturing technologies and market leading new products these investments are critical to achieve our long term strategic revenue and profitability goals and position us well when our end markets recover given the economic climate and the temporary uncertainty surrounding coronavirus we are approaching 2020 guidance cautiously we currently expect q1 will be the weakest of the year from an absolute dollar standpoint referring to our hydraulics segment demand remained soft and activity in china in particular is being impacted by the coronavirus on a short term basis which presents uncertainty at this point accordingly we expect the slow start to the year with some anticipated catch up during the second quarter which we currently forecast is our strongest for the year in accordance with our vision 2025 goals we anticipate a cagr rate of 8 from 2019 to 2025 for the hydraulic segment with 2025 revenue of approximately 700 million this will result in market share gains relative to an expected market growth of 3 our 2020 outlook for our electronics segment also continues to be challenging given model year rollout schedules we currently expect our third quarter to be the strongest for the segment however we are encouraged by considerable demand for projects slated for mid to late 2021 and continuing through 2023 we will incur incremental r d and engineering expenses during 2020 for development of these projects given the projects we have in our pipeline at this time we believe we can increase our vision 2025 sales target for the electronics segment to approximately 220 million representing a 12 cagr from 2019 through 2025 please proceed to slide 16 where we provided our guidance for 2020 i would like to note the following first given the level of macro uncertainty as i described a moment ago we are providing wider guidance ranges than we have in past years second we are optimistic about the second half of 2020 based on the economic reports that we track and feedback we receive from our customers some level of recovery in the back half of 2020 is built into the top end of our guidance and can be seen in the expected 50 50 split in revenue between first half and second half of 2020 which deviates from normal seasonality we remain committed to investing for long term profitable growth throughout the business cycle to be ready when our market start to pick up and to outpace the market as we work diligently toward our vision 2025 goals now let s open the lines for q a questions and answers operator certainly at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session our first question comes from nathan jones of stifel please go ahead nathan jones stifel analyst good morning everyone tricia l fulton chief financial officer good morning wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer good morning nathan nathan jones stifel analyst let s start with the incremental r d and engineering expenses in 2020 to support these projects in 21 through 23 can you give us a little more information on what the incremental spend is in 2020 just so we can see how that s impacting 2020 results and then can you talk a little bit more about the kind of revenue levels content products etc that these projects are going into in 21 through 23 wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer sure nathan so with regard to the first question if you look at the incremental spend so as i explained earlier on we obviously have quite a number of attractive projects in the pipeline that are slated for revenue generation then in the latter part of next year maybe 2021 22 and 23 and we decided obviously in order to support these projects professionally to invest into r d and engineering expenses at this point in time already so we are talking roughly about an increase of about 20 people which is quite sizable i mean if you put that in relation to the entire workforce of enovation controls that s an increase of 5 basically right there as you know about 40 of the entire workforce is working in r d and engineering related positions we are talking roughly about 20 people we are adding these people during the course of the year it pretty much started already at the beginning year at the beginning of the year and are progressing according to plan with regard to your second question from a revenue recognition perspective i mean also as we indicated obviously we are pretty confident based on the numbers of projects we have in the pipeline and based on the degrees of discussions and collaborations with our oem partners that they will generate the double digit growth in 21 and 22 and 23 if you see from guidance for 2019 we are pretty much flat compared to 2018 but as of next year we would expect double digit growth in terms of sales revenue continuing in 2020 and 23 maybe the last statement i would like to add here to your first question because you were asking about the incremental spend is we are doing this in terms of step up function so obviously they will these 20 people will support projects for the next years and beyond meaning that the investments in r d expenses in 21 and 22 are expected to be significantly lower these are kind of step up investments that you have to make upfront you make it in one go over a certain period of time and then the following one year or two years normally investments in that particular area will be at a lower pace nathan jones stifel analyst okay so these 20 people become part of the base going forward and then we stay a little flatter after that going forward it sounds like wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer exactly we ll stay flatter in 21 and 22 obviously except i mean there is still some incremental cost that come in merit increases and so forth but it s a step up function that we have basically built in guidance for 2020 and you won t see that then in 21 and 22 nathan jones stifel analyst okay my follow up question then i mean you guys have you guys had a lot of projects going there over the last few years you ve done two major acquisitions so the company has seen a lot of disruption over the last few years can you describe the differences in the culture the level of talent in the organization relative to three years or four years ago where do you still need to add talent to support this ramp up in revenues say over the next two years what functions are you still upgrading and what s your view of the culture within the company today thanks wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer yeah i mean i wouldn t call it disruption i call it evolution it s an evolution if you know as a classical hydraulic cartridge valve company we entered into the electrical side of the business obviously to enhance our capabilities from a culture perspective i would say there is not one culture in the helios companies because if you look at the acquisition strategy obviously we are looking for very strong stand alone companies that have already a very strong existing culture so we don t want to destroy that dna and i think we have done a very good job if i look at enovation if i look at faster and even if i look at the most recent acquisition in australia with custom fluidpower to protect the successful dna that made these companies what they are made off and what they bring to the table for us with regard to your to the talent pool as you know and we highlight that on an ongoing basis so covering the marketplace is i think is key for us down the road so occupying white spots and obviously expanding the business on a global basis i think is one of the key challenges that we still have and if we look at the talent pool or the pipeline from a talent pool perspective that is probably where we still have to focus on the development of people that we have on board already today to develop the skill in them that they can help us to globalize the business even more in the years ahead i would say that s the area where i would say from a talent need perspective we have probably the most significant need operator our next question comes from jeff hammond of keybanc capital markets jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning tricia l fulton chief financial officer good morning jeff jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hey wolfgang just to come back on the electronics investments is there a way to quantify like the incremental spend in dollars just to i m just trying to get at the margin impact into 2020 wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer well it s 20 people as i said and we are hiring on these people during the course of 2020 it s more front end loaded though because we want to have these people on board and we have a number of them already hired over the last six weeks or seven weeks i think if you quantify it in dollars it s somewhere in the range of about 2 5 million to 3 million fully loaded tricia l fulton chief financial officer well and clearly that s built into the guidance that we ve given on the profitability side jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst right okay and then margin resilience in hydraulics was pretty impressive as you just saw you re kind of for sales decline what was really working there and then how should we think about decrementals in hydraulics into 2020 on that i guess is flat to down 6 wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer i mean to the first part of the question i ll let tricia onto the detrimental margins but to the first part of the question what has been working well i mean you have seen an improvement over the past couple of quarters already and it s mainly driven obviously by productivity and efficiency improvements so it s a much better oil to machine i would say than it was probably a year ago and i m actually pretty pleased with what the sun team is doing in that regard and i m pretty encouraged looking at some of the initiatives that are outlined for the balance of this year then besides productivity and efficiency improvement i mean the other factor that comes into play is also pricing i think we have done reasonably well from a pricing perspective we were not always very lucky from a mix perspective as we explained on the last call you might recall that we still have idle capacity in a certain area of manufacturing that is pretty attractive from a profitability perspective that challenge has not been overcome yet so there is an additional potential i think there for margin improvement down the road mid and long term i would just like to repeat i mean the goal is that all of our businesses generate gross profit margins of 40 on sales revenue and i am hopeful with everything i m seeing there that we will get there over time tricia l fulton chief financial officer on the decremental margin side i think we re going to see more traditional decremental margins of 30 to 40 that we historically saw in these businesses but i will say that i think over the last couple of quarters we ve done a good job of right sizing the businesses from a perspective of being able to flex a little bit on the fixed cost side and the labor side so i don t think we re going to see huge decrementals on the hydraulics side as we roll in through 2020 with a little bit lower revenue jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay and then just on the 2025 targets i think you fine tune the absolute revenue number for hydraulics down but i think the growth rate is actually higher just kind of where we stand today is that a function of we get a snapback in the market or something around confidence for share gains and outgrowth wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer well it s a mixture of both there as you know we were always hovering around that 7 to 8 cagr range for the hydraulics business going back all the way i think back to 2017 and it s obviously tied to all the investments that we are making from again from a global coverage perspective i think we are covering the marketplace significantly better than we did three years ago and obviously also from a product development perspective i mean there is still a lot lined up to broaden and expand the product portfolio as i stated earlier on with electro hydraulic products so that in combination i think makes that pretty comfortable to look at an 8 cagr rate in between now and 2025 jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay thank you operator our next question comes from jim sheehan of suntrust robinson humphrey please go ahead pete osterland suntrust robinson humphrey analyst good morning this is pete osterland on for jim on your fourth quarter gross margin commentary you discussed a change in the margin profile of your products was this more of a negative mix shift or was it based on pricing versus raw materials and what are your expectations for gross margins in 2020 tricia l fulton chief financial officer yeah it was a mix shift it was the shift that we ve been talking about the last couple of quarters specifically in the cvt business between auto sell products and used sell products they have a little bit different margin profile and we ve seen a decline in the auto sell products over the last couple of quarters so it s skewed more toward the used sell and that s a function of the consolidation project as well that we ve moved to this used sell manufacturing with regard to gross margins we aren t we don t guide to gross margin but i think that we can infer from one of the previous questions on what the decremental margins might be that we can roll forward the q4 margins with some potential downside given the guidance that we ve provided in the hydraulics segment pete osterland suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thanks and then with your net leverage closing in on your target of 2 times how are you thinking about free cash flow deployment this year beyond debt reduction do you have an active m a pipeline or would you consider share repurchases wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer yeah i mean we want to be consistent with the messaging of last year so getting below a ratio of 2 times as far as net debt to adjusted ebitda is concerned is pivotal so we are we will continue and use the free cash flow generation to delever the company irrespective of that i mean we have an ongoing m a process in place where we continuously look at companies and evaluate businesses but delevering at this point in time is still high up on the agenda here pete osterland suntrust robinson humphrey analyst thank you wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from mig dobre of robert w baird co please go ahead mig dobre robert w baird co analyst thank you good morning everyone few questions on hydraulics first can you comment at all on when you on where you stand from a backlog standpoint and i guess what i m curious when we re looking at 2019 the call it 443 million of revenue how much of that revenue would you say was associated with you being able to convert on the backlog build or put differently how much of that revenue do you think is associated with the backlog decline through 2019 just to kind of level set us into 2020 wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer yeah i think from a backlog perspective mig i think we are exactly in line with what we told you already two quarters ago we ve said backlog based on what we could see and based on softening in the economy and expected order intake we foresee we can foresee that backlog is still supporting revenue generation in q1 maybe marginally into q2 as well and i think what we have seen over the last couple of weeks or last couple of months was exactly in line with that statement so backlog overall obviously is depleting because the order environment is soft and coronavirus situation is not helping as i said i mean we have 9 of revenue tied to chinese customers that was specific geography where we have won quite some market share and have done exceptionally well over the last three years four years so backlog is depleting but it s i still expect it to support hydraulics revenue in q1 and maybe even leading into q2 mig dobre robert w baird co analyst so just to make sure i understand what you re saying here you expect further backlog depletion into q1 and q2 whatever the way i kind of read that is that the order intake that you re taking is not necessarily what s reflected in revenue it s there is that plus the backlog burn that s how i should be thinking about it right wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer sure yeah yeah exactly i mean we are tapping into backlog and we are depleting the backlog as i said exactly as we said already during i think it was the q2 earnings call last year so i think we re exactly in line with those projections at the time mig dobre robert w baird co analyst understood this is and the reason why i m asking all of this is kind of a big picture question here this is your first quarter or this was your first quarter of revenue decline in hydraulics can you maybe give us a framework for how you re thinking about the current environment versus prior downturns i mean when i m looking at my model here i typically see four plus quarters of revenue declines whenever market turned softer but this time we had this backlog dynamic that i don t think we ve seen in prior cycles so how do you think about the current environment and how long revenue contraction might be lasting here wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer yeah maybe this will be helpful if we look at seasonality this year and compare it to previous years so last year in hydraulics we generated 52 of revenue in the first half 48 in the second half we expect this to be evenly split in 2020 so 50 50 and the 50 in the first half still supported by backlog as i mentioned just now and then if you look at the 50 in the back half of 2020 that is in line with the second half of 2019 so it s actually a little bit higher so obviously we are expecting orders to increase as we enter into the third quarter this year so if you put the two statements together backlog will be depleted no later than mid of this year i said actually early second quarter we are then counting on order gains in the second half of this year in hydraulics compared to the second half of 2019 mig dobre robert w baird co analyst which in theory you should be quite strong in order to offset your comparison on the backlog burn right you re starting from a lower plate i would assume wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer yes but nevertheless i mean it will be single digit it will be a single digit increase compared to the second half of 2019 but that s pretty much what our own forecast is based on mig dobre robert w baird co analyst understood and then this question on incrementals and decrementals was asked earlier but i want to make sure that first we re kind of talking about gross margin tricia in terms of your comments on the 30 to 40 for incrementals decrementals correct tricia l fulton chief financial officer yes mig dobre robert w baird co analyst do you contemplate any adjustments to your sg a in hydraulics given obviously the market volatility that we ve got here tricia l fulton chief financial officer no we don t expect a lot of change on the hydraulics item and we did have the restructuring that we did in q3 of last year hit the sea line for hydraulics so that will carry forward into the year but we clearly have some other expenses that at the corporate level that may offset some of that so we don t expect to see the large increase in sea that we re seeing in electronics but we won t see a huge decline over the sea that we had last year in total mig dobre robert w baird co analyst okay and then moving to electronics these incremental costs these incremental investments you re saying that those are going to flow through the sg a line they are not going to flow through gross margins tricia l fulton chief financial officer correct mig dobre robert w baird co analyst okay good and then lastly here i am kind of scratching my head a little bit on how you structured the top line guidance simply because unless i m mistaken here you re the first half of the year is going to be down maybe north of 13 but then you got pretty robust growth double digit growth in the back half so i d like a little more color on what gives you guys the confidence that we can have this level of swing and if that s sort of driven by your broader end market assumptions like it is in the case of hydraulics or if this is something that s specific to customers and products that you really have good visibility on thank you wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer i think it s both mig it s obviously as you know in the meantime more than 50 is tied to oem business so we have much better visibility i think what is expected for the balance of the year and if we look at their forecast and their schedules i think it s pretty obvious that everybody is counting on a rebound in the second half of the year i think if you look at the macroeconomic picture obviously and there we pretty much go by industrial production evaluate the forecast for industrial production in the seven largest economies around the globe you also see that there is an up swing expected in the second half of the year so i think it s a combination of both mig what we ve seen from a macroeconomic perspective and feedback that we are getting from our customer base in both segments mig dobre robert w baird co analyst okay thank you wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer you re welcome operator our next question comes from brian drab of william blair please go ahead brian drab william blair analyst hi good morning you mentioned in the prepared comments that the back half of the year looks stronger from a macro perspective kind of across the board across the regions and but then i think you just said that you re expecting your business to be flat in the second half of 20 versus second half of 19 and i m just wondering why that is and is there some conservatism just given the uncertainty that is obviously out there wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer i think brian good morning first i think brian that you misunderstood so the business will be slightly up in the second half i said in the second half of 2020 compared to the second half of 2019 and that s applicable for both segments when i discussed with mig we said in the hydraulics segment it will be up in single digit percentage ranges and it will also be up on the electronics side in the second half of 2020 compared to 2019 brian drab william blair analyst okay okay yeah i think i heard you at one point say i don t know i guess it didn t sound like you had a ton of conviction in the back half growth i thought at one point you did say flat to and actually then slightly up but i just given the rebound and given the challenges that we ve had in the back half of 2019 that s why i was just wondering if there is some conservatism there so wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer yeah i can help you a little bit more on the electronic side i mean in 2019 the ratio between the first half and second half was 54 versus 46 and we expect that ratio to go to 49 versus 51 so it is back end loaded in electronics as well brian drab william blair analyst okay and in the back half of 2020 if you do experience growth let s say at a low single digit rate what would actually let s say the scenario if let s say in a tougher scenario and growth doesn t come in the second half and you re flat in the second half would you expect your gross margin to improve given the productivity improvements that have been in place even on flat revenue wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer yes i think based on the initiatives that we launched last year in q3 and q4 if i look at the restructuring and everything associated with that obviously that benefit will carry forward so we would expect margins to at least stay stable or slightly improve brian drab william blair analyst okay thanks and then wolfgang just finally can you put a finer point on some of the activity that you re seeing in some of the end markets and maybe even a little color regionally just a little more on like ag construction mining material handling since you ve got such a good finger on the pulse of all those end markets wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer yeah so if i look at the four main clusters that we are supporting so industrial mobile ag and recreational end markets it s definitely a fair assessment to say there is softness across all the four clusters now if you break it down into individual geographies and into individual sectors underneath there then we are seeing actually the few a few positive spots as well i repeat again what i said last year i think renewable energy is still an attractive market we grew a lot there in china over the last couple of years i think that will continue despite the coronavirus situation that we consider being temporary i think the other more positive note that we saw after the easing of the trade negotiations between the us and china this past december is in ag in north america is a little bit stronger than we anticipated so that s a positive sign but then i would say all the rest if you look all the other sectors within construction within material handling energy oil and gas it is rather soft and we expect that to continue during the first two quarters of 2020 brian drab william blair analyst okay thanks a lot i ll save the rest of my questions for offline thank you wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from joe mondillo of sidoti company please go ahead joe mondillo sidoti company analyst hi everyone good morning wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer good morning joe joe mondillo sidoti company analyst i wanted to follow up on a couple of questions regarding i guess the end of the day we re talking about the revenue guidance and it just seems like the high end of that revenue guidance in terms of sort of flattish sales seems a bit aggressive when you re talking about hydraulics backlog declining into the second quarter you have asia region which was a really good growth factor for you in 2019 what s going on the coronavirus in china was already slowing before then that going on and then on top of that we re hearing from you said over 50 of your oe customers are or 50 of your hydraulic sales or oe we re hearing the year down 5 to 15 and caterpillar similar a lot of these oes are talking about how their production is going to be down quite a bit so i m just wondering how you get to the high end of the guidance considering all that wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer well i think joe as i mentioned early on i can just repeat what i already said i mean based on the initiatives we have in place so it s a split of 50 50 roughly oem and channel and i think the initiatives we have in place on a global basis on the channel side are there in order to cover geographies in a much better way than in the past there we are dealing more with end users and small and medium sized oems so i would still expect business to trigger in there and grow particularly in geographies where we had nothing in the past i m still referring to places like southeast asia we still have opportunities to do more even in countries like china and japan and so forth and on the oem side we work with both partly with the larger oems you are referring to that are obviously reasonably negative at this point in time but we are also working with a lot of small and medium sized oems and i think there probably the picture is a little bit more rosy or a little bit more optimistic so all of that embedded into this forecast is pretty much what we reflected in the numbers here joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay could you talk about the decremental margin at the electronics segment since you since we ve already talked about hydraulics just wondering how that looks tricia l fulton chief financial officer yeah i mean we will see some there is a much smaller fixed cost based on the electronics business so the decremental margins are not as significant as what we generally see on the hydraulics side which has a very large capital investment so i would expect it probably to be somewhere around 20 joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay and regarding the margin expectations that you re looking at hydraulics is there anything baked in there in terms of more improvements or more costs restructuring or anything related to your cost structure going forward tricia l fulton chief financial officer no the only thing that we that s different from a cost structure perspective is what we ve already touched on with regard to the addition of engineering resources for r d in the electronics segment nothing else is different from before joe mondillo sidoti company analyst okay all right that s all i had most of my questions were answered thank you wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer thank you operator we have reached the end of the question and answer session i will now turn the call over to management for closing remarks wolfgang h dangel president chief executive officer thank you for your interest in helios technologies

equipment costs in the permian basin by 2 0 million per well reduced general administrative g a expense by approximately 30 from 2018 to 2019 decreased officer headcount by 54 which resulted in a 10 million reduction to target officer compensation generated 566 9 million of net cash provided from operating activities retired 66 9 million of debt and ended the year with a 166 3 million cash balance full year 2020 outlook overview plan to deliver 4 oil growth in the permian basin while reducing the permian capital program by approximately 8 completed g a expense reduction initiatives which delivers a 40 reduction to g a expense compared to 2019 plan to generate approximately 100 million of free cash flow a non gaap measure at 50 wti 76 of forecasted 2020 oil production hedged at approximately 58 per barrel continue to organically de lever balance sheet 2019 was a year of significant change for qep we were intensely focused throughout the year on right sizing our corporate overhead improving capital efficiency and reducing operating expenses in the field our focus resulted in qep essentially being free cash flow neutral for the full year 2019 as we prioritize profitability and financial discipline over production growth commented tim cutt president and ceo of qep our highly efficient capital investment program in 2020 along with the reduced corporate g a and operating cost structure provides us confidence in our ability to generate approximately 100 million of free cash flow at 50 wti in 2020 our robust hedge position 76 of forecasted 2020 oil production at approximately 58 per barrel creates a solid floor to achieve our financial goals through the efforts of our top tier employee base qep is in a strong position to build cash in 2020 which supports our corporate goal of organically de levering our balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders operations update for the full year 2019 the company drilled a total of 76 horizontal wells including 69 in the permian basin and seven in the williston basin and turned 66 operated wells to production including 59 in the permian basin and seven in the williston basin the average lateral length for the wells completed in the permian basin in 2019 was 10 205 feet and the average lateral length for the wells completed in the williston basin in 2019 was 10 182 feet oil equivalent production in the permian basin was 5 1 million barrels of oil equivalent mmboe in the fourth quarter 2019 an increase of 17 over the fourth quarter 2018 the increase was a result of putting new wells on production coupled with improved well performance which was attributable to changes in well completion design accelerated flowback and improved artificial lift and higher gas capture rates total company oil equivalent production was 8 5 mmboe in the fourth quarter 2019 a decrease of 27 compared with the fourth quarter 2018 primarily driven by the divestiture of our haynesville assets in january 2019 haynesville divestiture oil and condensate production in the permian basin was 3 4 million barrels mmbbl in the fourth quarter 2019 an increase of 4 over the fourth quarter 2018 total company oil and condensate production was 5 7 mmbbl in the fourth quarter 2019 and was essentially flat compared with the fourth quarter 2018 the relatively flat production was the result of an increase in volumes in the permian basin offset by lower williston basin volumes due to reduced activity for the full year 2019 oil equivalent production in the permian basin was 19 4 mmboe an increase of 22 compared with the full year 2018 the increase was a result of improved well performance on the 69 wells placed on production in 2019 which was attributable to changes in well completion design accelerated flowback and improved artificial lift and higher gas capture rates for the full year 2019 total company oil equivalent production was 32 2 mmboe a decrease of 19 7 mmboe compared with the full year 2018 primarily driven by the haynesville divestiture and uinta basin divestiture in september 2018 for the full year 2019 oil and condensate production in the permian basin was 13 5 mmbbl an increase of 1 4 mmbbl or 11 compared with 2018 for the full year 2019 total company oil and condensate production was 21 6 mmbbl a decrease of 2 4 mmbbl compared with the full year 2018 primarily driven by decreased activity in the williston basin and the uinta basin divestiture financial update the company reported a net loss of 110 4 million in the fourth quarter 2019 or 0 46 per diluted share compared with a loss of 629 3 million or 2 66 per diluted share in the fourth quarter 2018 the lower net loss in the fourth quarter 2019 was primarily due to a decrease in impairment expense of 1 156 5 million partially offset by a 448 3 million decrease in gain on derivative contracts and a 212 5 million increase in income tax expense net income loss includes non cash gains and losses associated with the change in the fair value of derivative instruments gains and losses from asset sales asset impairments and certain other items excluding these items the company s fourth

on an accrual basis for the fourth quarter 2019 compared with 188 4 million for the fourth quarter 2018 of which 102 6 million related to the drilling completion and equipping of wells and 2 9 million related to midstream infrastructure investment the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to a planned decrease in completion activity in the permian basin due to a change in our corporate strategy in 2019 to focus on free cash flow generation partially offset by increased capital expenditures in the williston basin as the company resumed completion activity in the basin total capital investment excluding property acquisitions was 571 5 million on an accrual basis for the year ended december 31 2019 compared with 1 053 5 million for the year ended december 31 2018 excluding 123 1 million of capital expenditures related to haynesville and uinta in 2018 a reduction of 482 0 million the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily related to decreased drilling and completion activity in the permian and williston basins due to a change in our corporate strategy operating expenses during the fourth quarter 2019 lease operating expense loe was 47 4 million a decrease of 20 compared with the fourth quarter 2018 the decrease in loe was primarily due to the haynesville divestiture and a decrease in the williston basin related to lower maintenance and repair expenses labor costs and power fuel and chemicals as a result of continuing efforts to reduce operating expenses and decreased production activity during the fourth quarter 2019 loe was 5 60 per boe an increase of 10 compared to the fourth quarter 2018 but was down 12 excluding the haynesville divestiture the 12 decrease per boe rate was related to lower cost production from the recent horizontal

qep s estimated proved reserves were approximately 382 3 mmboe a 42 decrease compared with 2018 primarily due to the haynesville divestiture and a 992 2 million reduction in future estimated capital expenditures over the next five years in the permian and williston basins the reduction in capital expenditures is due to qep s change in corporate strategy in 2019 to focus on free cash flow generation through a reduced capital program and a renewed focus on capital efficiency the change in development plan including the updated development sequencing along with the reduced capital program and lower oil prices were the primary causes of the 107 3 mmboe negative revisions to previous estimates in reserves the 107 3 mmboe negative revision is partially offset by extensions and discoveries of 47 6 mmboe primarily related to new pud locations from the change in our development sequence to maximize capital efficiency the majority of the locations that were removed are economic at current prices and are technically consistent with our puds however they no longer conform to the sec s definition of proved reserves under the five year rule and are therefore not reported as puds

distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio ebitda represents net income available to the partnership before deducting interest expense income taxes and depreciation amortization and accretion which includes certain impairment charges adjusted ebitda represents ebitda as further adjusted to exclude equity funded expenses related to incentive compensation and operating expenses payable to affiliates of the general partner gains or losses on dispositions and lease terminations certain acquisition related costs such as legal and other professional fees and severance expenses associated with recently acquired companies and certain other non cash items arising from purchase accounting distributable cash flow represents adjusted ebitda less cash interest expense sustaining capital expenditures and current income tax expense distribution coverage ratio is computed by dividing distributable cash flow by the weighted average diluted common units and then dividing that result by the distributions paid per limited partner unit ebitda adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio are used as supplemental financial measures by management and by external users of the partnership s financial statements such as investors and lenders ebitda and adjusted ebitda are used to assess crossamerica s financial performance without regard to financing methods capital structure or income taxes and the ability to incur and service debt and to fund capital expenditures in addition adjusted ebitda is used to assess the operating performance of the crossamerica business on a consistent basis by excluding the impact of items which do not result directly from the wholesale distribution of motor fuel the leasing of real property or the day to day operations of the partnership s retail site activities ebitda adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage ratio are also used to assess the ability to generate cash sufficient to

alternatives to net income or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with u s gaap ebitda adjusted ebitda distributable cash flow and distribution coverage

with brent d griffiths the ticker larry kudlow may have just had his baghdad bob moment as centers for disease control officials warned it is a matter of when not if the coronavirus arrives in the united states and the stock market responded by tanking more than 3 percent for the second day in a row president trump s top economic adviser tried in vain to reassure investors that all is well we have contained this i won t say airtight but pretty close to airtight kudlow said in an afternoon interview on cnbc like saddam hussein s spokesman insisting during the 2003 u s invasion of iraq that american forces were on the cusp of annihilation kudlow s claim the trump administration has the matter in hand seem to bear little resemblance to reality as other officials predicted the inevitable spread of covid 19 as the disease is known to the united states advertisement nancy messonnier a top cdc official told reporters the impact of the virus on the united states may seem overwhelming and that disruption to everyday life may be severe and she made a direct appeal to the public to brace for a domestic outbreak we are asking the american public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad that includes making plans to work from home and otherwise reduce face to face contact shares of zoom video which provides videoconference software have been surging amid the broader market carnage the virus continues its relentless spread outside of china overnight france reported the first death of a french citizen from the epidemic as cases spread rapidly across europe with spain confirming eight new cases in the past 24 hours and new infections reported in france croatia austria and switzerland the post s adam taylor writes although china announced a decline in new confirmed cases on wednesday the number of infected people soared in south korea to more than 1 200 with more expected in the coming days as the state attempts to test 200 000 people advertisement investors voted with their portfolios crediting dire warnings instead of kudlow s nothing to see here take the dow jones industrial average dropped 3 2 percent on the day making the two day selloff the worst the market has seen in two years with tuesday s declines eight of the s p 500 s 11 sectors are in negative territory for the year the worst among them energy has shed 19 so far in 2020 reflecting investors fears that a slowdown in global economic activity will drag oil prices lower per the wall street journal s akane otani investors fleeing risk assets piled into the relative safety of government debt sending the yield on 10 year treasury bonds to a record low of 1 32 percent trump who has been on a state visit to india weighed in five hours after the close of trading he rebutted the mounting criticism of his team s response in grievance fueled partisan terms democrats talking point is that we are doing badly if the virus disappeared tomorrow they would say we did a really poor and even incompetent job not fair but it is what it is so far by the way we have not had one death let s keep it that way donald j trump realdonaldtrump february 26 2020 but administration officials faced a bipartisan grilling on capitol hill on wednesday with republicans and democrats outwardly expressing alarm and outrage lawmakers cnn s lauren fox and clare foran report lawmakers from both parties say that the trump administration s response has exposed vulnerabilities and prompted lawmakers to push for ways to curtail future outbreaks faster advertisement behind the scenes the president is preoccupied by the stock selloff trump is highly concerned about the market and has encouraged aides not to give predictions that might cause further tremors my colleagues jeff stein and josh dawsey report privately trump has become furious about the stock market s slide according to two people familiar with the president s thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal details they write while abroad trump has watched the stock market s fall closely and believes extreme warnings from the centers for disease control and prevention have spooked investors the aides said for his part kudlow tells jeff and josh there is no distance between his position and that of the cdc officials we have to err on the side of emergency planning in the united states they are doing the right thing he said of the cdc i have to worry about the economy and the financial markets there s a fear factor right now and i get that but what i was trying to say is this thing is not going to go on forever and our economy is in great shape advertisement but as my colleague catharine rampell notes kudlow s credibility is a fragile resource remember the austan_goolsbee rule which he calls the pathological irony of crisis if you lose your credibility your statements begin to mean the opposite of what you say catherine rampell crampell february 25 2020 federal reserve officials are attempting to strike their own balance fallout from the spread of the virus could spill over to the rest of the global economy fed vice chairman richard clarida said in a tuesday speech per the wall street journal s nick timiraos but clarida said it is still too soon to even speculate about either the size or the persistence of these effects or whether they will lead to a material change in the outlook the mixed messages from federal officials are feeding investor anxiety says ed clissold chief u s strategist at ned davis research uncertainty is what the market dislikes the most he tells me and in general there has been conflicting information from the beginning about the coronavirus and that has not helped investor sentiment his firm s measure of daily trading sentiment fell to 36 percent bullish this morning in the extreme pessimism zone but higher than troughs around the six previous health emergencies since 2002 clissold writes in a follow up email advertisement meanwhile the virus is beginning to weigh on consumer confidence morning consult s measure of that sentiment dropped 0 6 percent and now stands at 114 8 close to where it started at the beginning of the year per economist john leer the dip was particularly pronounced among those who work in the financial and transportation sectors dropping 4 7 and 4 9 points respectively market movers el erian don t buy the dip yet mohamed el erian chief economic adviser at allianz se warns the worst may be yet to come in a bloomberg opinion column the steep sell off in stocks related to the coronavirus has intensified focus on the financial implications of the outbreak much of the narrative especially when it comes to economists and market pundits as opposed to companies has yet to internalize the significant uncertainties concerning both the known knowns and the known unknowns advertisement as the virus has spread into several countries particularly iran italy and south korea and brought with

all too often discussion over trade deals focuses almost solely on tariffs it s true that tariffs i e taxes are always a significant barrier to free exchange at all levels but there are also plenty of ways to block or lessen trade that are not primarily tariff based recent conflicts over the pending negotiations between the uk and the eu are a reminder of this for instance the guardian reported yesterday the eu will demand the right to punish britain if the government fails to shadow the brussels rule book in the future the bloc will demand that the british government apply eu state aid rules in their entirety as they evolve specifically eu countries especially france want to make sure that britain must comply with strict level playing field provisions to ensure that the uk does not undercut the eu on issues like the environment state aid and workers rights let me translate that for you european politicians are concerned there might be too much freedom in the uk after brexit is finished brussels fears producers in the uk might use that freedom to produce goods and services that will be more affordable to european consumers thus the eu s negotiators want to force british producers to labor under all the same entrepreneurship crushing and innovation destroying regulations that europeans now must endure should they refuse the eu plans to hike tariffs or employ other trade blocking sanctions the creation of a global trade bureaucracy this isn t to say that the eu is the only state or quasi state guilty of working to limit trade while also claiming to be expanding it the united states mexico canada agreement usmca the successor to nafta features the use of government regulations to manage trade and limit foreign freedoms that might be used to undercut other countries as with nafta under the usmca mexico can t export goods to the united states unless those producers are subject to new labor laws demanded by us negotiators mexican firms must also adhere to us approved environmental regulations and to intellectual property laws that extend corporate monopolies mostly patents into ever longer time periods and of course mexico must conform to country of origin rules designed to ensure that other countries aren t using mexico as a pass through for their goods what if mexico doesn t comply well then tariffs go up thus illustrating that the agreement was never really about free trade in the first place after all under both the usmca and the eu agreements enforcement of all these regulatory provisions requires a whole host of bureaucratic agencies designed to monitor and regulate trade so as to ensure compliance when your free trade agreement depends heavily on thousands of pages of rules and regulations then somebody has to check to make sure 40 to 45 percent of automobile parts must be made by workers who earn at least 16 an hour or that 75 percent of a manufactured good s components come from an approved location there must be inspections reports audits and when necessary judicial type proceedings designed to determine guilt and punishment we should also expect these requirements regulations and mandates to get worse over time ever since nafta was inked there have been complaints that the agreement did not impose enough new requirements on the mexicans to suit the desires of environmentalists and labor union advocates and of course huge corporations are always demanding ever more exploitive intellectual property rules we should not expect those demands to go away with the usmca meanwhile europe isn t exactly in any danger of liberalizing its regulatory regime if the past decade is any indication the next ten years will bring a host of new regulations through it all the eu is now telling us the british will be expected to keep up or harmonize its own laws with those of the eu otherwise britain will be accused of abusing the system by providing a means for employers and producers to avoid some regulations but still get access to the eu trading bloc poor countries often get the worst of it but at least the uk is already a rich country in the case of mexico as with other developing countries these nontariff trade barriers may erode the competitive advantage that developing countries have in terms of labour costs and preferential access yes poor countries can offer cheap labor to bring down costs of producing goods but when exporting those goods requires jumping a host of regulatory burdens costs can quickly climb again moreover these regulatory requirements can be stacked on top of each other under eu rules for example a trading partner in africa might need to meet sanitary requirements around food quality while also meeting labor requirements and quality control mandates on manufactured goods in many cases these requirements are difficult to meet because producers in poorer nations lack the expertise and capital to achieve compliance at a level far above what the market itself demands for this reason tariff liberalization alone has generally proven unsuccessful in providing genuine market access has drawn further attention to non tariff measures ntms as major determinants in restricting market access nor are these regulatory harmonization efforts the only sort of nontariff barriers at work according to this 2017 study these can include domestic subsidies designed to make domestically produced goods more competitive than foreign ones other nontariff barriers include straight up quotas on foreign goods and laws requiring governments procure goods and services only from domestic firms given the size of the public sector in many countries including the us which heavily employs this type of trade barrier those kinds of provisions have a sizable impact on international trade global non tariff barriers 2009 2016 image source erdal yalcin gabriel felbermayr luisa kinzius hidden protectionism non tariff barriers and implications for international trade munich liebniz institute for economic research 2017 p 8 of all of these though it may be the use of regulatory mandates as a trade barrier that is the most insidious by requiring trade partners to expand their own regulatory states so as to harmonize their legal environments with those of trading partners trade agreements actually expand the power and jurisdictions of bureaucratic regimes trade bureaucracy destroys innovation and entrepreneurship in rich and poor countries alike like all trade barriers this may be a net win for certain interest groups within the country where the state is pressing for greater regulatory mandates but these measures also cut out much of the benefit of expanded international trade for entrepreneurs and consumers for example imagine a small chain of us restaurants discovers a new much more affordable source of avocados in el salvador the restaurant chain then begins to demand more avocados than it could afford to buy before farmers in el salvador start to hire more workers to harvest the avocados and ship them north the american restaurants then hire more truckers to deliver the avocados and more waiters to serve their customers but then it turns out that the el salvador farmers aren t paying the workers the wage mandated in the trade agreement between the us and el salvador us trade negotiators then demand that the farm owners pay higher wages or submit to a 20 percent tariff as a result el salvador workers are laid off and become once again unemployed meanwhile in the us the restaurant chain must scale back its operations and close stores as a result of rising food costs had there been real free trade of course the workers the restaurant owners and the diners would have all been free to produce avocados in a way that everyone could agree on but then regulators got involved and imposed regulations to make sure salvadoran workers and farmers weren t undercutting us workers and farmers the enforcement of these provisions might be a win for certain american farmers and labor unions but it s a loss for everyone else so much for free trade here we see again the dark side of economic integration what was billed as a lowering of taxes barriers and transaction costs was in many ways just an expansion of the state s jurisdiction we are witnessing something very similar in the brexit negotiations the uk is angling for an agreement to facilitate trade but in the end it may just end up increasing brussels s power over british consumers
